CONCORD , England , April 24 ( UPI ) -- A 47 - year - old British woman says her arrest for being too noisy while having sex with her husband wo n't muffle her loud , vocal lovemaking .
Caroline Cartwright said despite being arrested and receiving an anti-social behavior order for her vocal lovemaking , she does not see such disciplinary actions curbing her vocal outbursts during sex , The Daily Mail reported Thursday .

" I can't stop making noise during sex , it 's unnatural to not make any noises , and I do n't think that I 'm particularly loud , " she said .
Cartwright 's comments came after she received her disciplinary order last Friday .
Two days later , a Sunday , the order was violated .
That session of noisy mating brought complaints from 25 neighbors and her arrest .
One of those neighbors , Rachel O'Connor , told Sunderland Magistrates Court that Cartwright and her husband Steve were both vocal lovers , the Mail said .
" I heard sounds of a sexual nature .
They were really loud , and there was a lot of moaning and groaning and screaming as if in pain , " O'Connor said of the incident that prompted her complaint .
" It was n't just the woman , it came from both parties . "

One of the more annoying things about the whole debate on patent reform is that some have tried to position it as " small companies " vs. " big companies . "
That 's not even close to true .
While there have been plenty of high profile fights between patent holders vs. big companies , that 's only a small part of the issue .
And , in fact , it 's often smaller , more innovative companies that are the most harmed by patents .
Joe Mullin has a great post looking at how small mom-and - pop photo sharing sites are being hit with a bunch of patent infringement lawsuits .
Basically , a few different companies are all claiming that they own patents on the ideas behind photo hosting online .
But , of course , since the idea is so obvious , there are aof photo hosting sites out there , including many run as small businesses .
Yet , they 're getting hit by patent infringement claims which seem ridiculous to them .
But ... since the cost of going to court ( or , even getting a patent lawyer to talk to them ) is so outrageous , some are choosing to settle -- even though it 's taking away from being able to dothings , like invest in the business .
It 's a sad story of patent holders ( often with no product being offered themselves ) harming lots of small businesses .
This is a big issue .
Whenever the rather vocal group of angry inventors show up in our comments defending the patent system at all costs as being " necessary " for " the little guy " they seem to conveniently ignore all the " little guys " harmed by the patent system .
What about the guy who thought the idea was obvious and did n't bother to get a patent , but now has to fight off an infringement suit by someone who did get a patent on the idea ?
What about the guy who invented the same thing just slightly later , but understands the market better and can do a better job bringing the product to market ?
What about the guy who can put a bunch of different ideas together to make a much better product , but is unable to because multiple patent holders all want a huge % of his earnings ?
Time and time again we hear stories of small businesses who feel the patent system is holding them back in significant ways -- and it's a true shame .

B raving the global recessionary trends , India managed 6.7 per cent economic growth in 2008 - 09 despite the manufacturing sector recording a dismal performance .
A 5.8 per cent growth rate during the last quarter of the fiscal , at a time when most developed economies have shrunk , puts India among the top - most growing nations .
The news was cheered by the stock market , which saw an immediate rise in the Sensex by 400 points to touch 14,692.27 at the BSE by mid-day , a level witnessed last in September 2008 .
Commenting on the growth figures released by the government today , Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said , " It is on the expected lines . "
The growth rate during 2008 - 09 is lower than the nine per cent in the preceding fiscal , but that is not as low as expected by certain analysts and quite in the range projected by the RBI : 6.5 - 7 per cent .

Jugendliche Massenmörder : Der doppelte Kontrollverlust
Wer die Ursachen von Amokläufen verstehen will , muss die Bedingungen beachten , unter denen Jugendliche aufwachsen - und die Konsequenzen mangelnder Anerkennung .
Diese Analyse ist nicht auf den Vorgang in Winnenden bezogen .
Belastbares Wissen über diesen Fall kann nicht vorliegen .
Stattdessen basiert dieser
Text auf desintegrations - und jugendtheoretischen Überlegungen sowie empirischen Auswertungen der Vorgänge in Littleton ( 1999 ) , Erfurt ( 2002 ) und Emsdetten ( 2006 ) .
Insbesondere der Amoklauf an der Columbine Highschool steht im Mittelpunkt , weil dieser als Vorbild für weitere Taten gilt .
Dies ist insbesondere mit der Kommunikation der virtuellen Fangemeinde im Internet belegbar , an der nicht wenige weibliche Jugendliche teilnehmen .
Um diese Abläufe angemessen zu analysieren , soll hier von einer
These ausgegangen werden , die auf einen doppelten Kontrollverlust fokussiert .
Der Kontrollverlust bei den Tätern besteht im Anerkennungszerfall und damit im Verlust der Kontrolle über das eigene Leben .
Auf der gesellschaftlichen Seite gibt es einen Kontrollverlust , weil zwar vielfältige Hintergrundkonstellationen bekannt sind , es aber keine Kenntnisse über die situativen Auslöser gibt , sodass die Verhinderung kaum gelingt .
Dies hat Effekte .
Die Einordnung solcher Massaker durch Öffentlichkeit und Politik folgt immer wieder typischen rituellen Erklärungsmustern , sodass die Kontrollverluste überdeckt werden .
Von " Heimsuchung " sprach etwa 2002 der Ministerpräsident Thüringens , von einem " psychisch schwer gestörten Täter " ein kriminalpsychologischer Experte per Ferndiagnose im Fernsehen .
Die ersten Einordnungen erklären solche Verbrechen zum quasi übernatürlichen Ereignis oder pathologisieren sie .
Beiden Erklärungen gemeinsam ist ihre Distanz zur sozialen Realität .
Es werden gesellschaftlich entlastende Deutungen geliefert , um schnell wieder " Normalität " herzustellen : Gegen eine " Heimsuchung " kann man nichts tun , weil sie schicksalhaft ist .
Und pathologische
Täter können von einer ansonsten angeblich intakten Gesellschaft isoliert werden .
Beide Interpretationen lassen die konstitutiven Merkmale von Gewalt unberücksichtigt : Gewalt ist eine für jedermann verfügbare und hocheffektive Ressource .
Sie hat immer eine Vorgeschichte und ist stets , gegen wen sie sich auch richtet , eine Machtaktion .
Diese Einsicht verunsichert ebenso , wie die Tatsache , dass Massaker jederzeit möglich und kaum zu vermeiden sind , eben Kontrollverluste erzeugt .
Um sich nicht mit den Ursachen des strukturellen Kontrollverlusts auseinandersetzen zu müssen und um sich zu beruhigen , zielt der dominierende öffentliche Diskurs darauf , derartige Phänomene von gesellschaftlicher Normalität abzutrennen .
Wo aber sind die beunruhigenden Quellen dieser Prozesse zu suchen ?
Ist es die anthropologische Grundausstattung ?
Die Forderung nach Aufrüstung der Polizei zwecks Überwachung " anfälliger " Institutionen wie Schulen , Kirchen und Stadien ist populär , zielt aber nur auf Symptome .
Um in die Tiefe zu gehen , muss man bei den Bedingungen des Aufwachsens von Jugendlichen ansetzen .
Diese zeigen ein Doppelgesicht : Die Gestaltbarkeit von Lebenswegen wird größer , aber der Gestaltungszwang nimmt zu .
Allerdings ohne dass junge Menschen genau wissen , ob sie Chancen und Optionen haben - und ohne dass sie wissen , für welche davon sie sich entscheiden sollen , um in der Gesellschaft eine Stellung und Anerkennung zu erreichen .
Dabei gibt es für sie drei Möglichkeiten : über Leistungen in der Schule , über äußerliche Attraktivität oder über die Demonstration von Stärke .
Das gesellschaftlich Leitbild besagt , dass eine anerkannte Stellung nur zu erreichen ist , wenn man andere unter " Kontrolle " hat und man sich von anderen unterscheidet .
Wer nicht auffällt , wird nicht wahrgenommen , und wer nicht wahrgenommen wird , ist ein Nichts .
Es gehört zur Ideologie der Aufstiegsgesellschaft , dass Jugendliche zumindest den Status ihrer Herkunftsfamilie erreichen müssen .
Am besten aber verbessern sie diesen noch .
Das allerdings fällt immer schwerer , denn heute sind eher prekäre Lebensplanungen und Lebensläufe der Normalfall .
Ambivalenz wird zum zentralen Lebensparadigma : Die Chancen zur eigenen Lebensgestaltung steigen , aber die Berechenbarkeit der Lebensplanung nimmt ab .
Die prekäre Normalität wird zum Normalfall .
Wir fühlen uns sicher , wenn wir von Normalität sprechen , also in unserer Welt nichts " auffällig " ist .
Entsprechend groß ist die Irritation , wenn ein scheinbar " ganz normaler " Junge unfassbare Gewalt anwendet .
Es liegt dann nahe , ihm den Stempel " psychisch schwer gestört " aufzudrücken .
Sobald wir ihn als " Anormalen " aus unseren Kreisen ausgegrenzt haben , können wir uns behaglich zurücklehnen und uns in " unserer Normalität " wieder sicher fühlen .
Normalität - das heißt in dieser Gesellschaft : Ein Mensch identifiziert sich in hohem Maße mit den zentralen prämierten Werten wie Leistung , Selbstdurchsetzung und Aufstieg .
Diese Botschaft ist auch bei den Jugendlichen angekommen und erzeugt einen hohen Druck .
An dieser Normalität , an diesen festen wie rigiden Normen zu scheitern , ist umso schmerzhafter , je intensiver man diese Wertvorstellungen aufnimmt und verinnerlicht ; also wenn man zum Beispiel mit allen Mitteln das Abitur machen will .
Die Erschütterung der Normalität ist vorprogrammiert , wenn es nicht klappt oder wenn Statusdruck erzeugt wird , aber kaum entsprechende Statuspositionen zur Verfügung stehen .
Eine mögliche Folge : Die Reaktionen des " Gescheiterten " werden - gerade wenn er sich wie bei einem Schulverweis , der tief in das weitere Leben eingreift , ungerecht behandelt fühlt - außer Kontrolle geraten .
Es entsteht ein " Tunnelblick " , der kaum noch ein anderes Konfliktlösungsmuster als die Gewalt zulässt .
Erfurt hat z .
B. deutlich gemacht , wie prekär die gesellschaftliche Normalität ist , wie schnell sie fundamental erschüttert werden kann .
Deshalb ist die Frage zu stellen , was Gewalt hervorbringt , warum ein Mensch das Leben , auch das eigene , so radikal abwertet und so extrem auf die Demonstration von Macht setzt .
Die Antworten führen in die Richtung sozialer Desintegration .
Damit geht es um das Problem der Anerkennung und im negativen Fall um Anerkennungszerfall , wenn Jugendliche keine befriedigende Antwort auf die basalen Fragen bekommen :
Wer braucht mich ?
Wer hört mir zu ?
Wozu gehöre ich ?
Bin ich gleichwertig ?
Werde ich gerecht behandelt ?
Werden meine Gefühle akzeptiert ?
Bedenkt man , dass niemand auf die Dauer ohne Anerkennung leben kann und insbesondere Jugendliche unter den skizzierten Bedingungen der Ambivalenz der Aufwachsens in einer prekären Normalität leben , dann ist hohe Aufmerksamkeit auf das gesamte Setting der Anerkennungsquellen des sozialen Umfeldes , der Entscheidungs - und Handlungskompetenzen des Täters sowie auf die Beeinflussungsfaktoren wie vor allem den Medienkonsum zu richten .
Diese drei Komponenten sind in ihrem Zusammenwirken zu betrachten , um einschätzen zu können , ob und wie sich in einem weiteren Schritt ein Eskalationsprozess abzeichnen kann .
Die Anerkennungsquellen stellen den zentralen Ansatzpunkt dar .
Für Jugendliche sind drei Erfahrungsbereiche von höchster Relevanz : Die Schule stellt vielfältige Anerkennungsressourcen bereit , insbesondere über Leistung , um Voraussetzungen für eine positionale Anerkennung im späteren Leben zu erwerben .
Zugleich ist die Institution von Missachtungsaktivitäten durch die Lehrerschaft , vor allem auch Mitschüler und Mitschülerinnen durchsetzt .
Die Familie variiert in ihrer Bedeutung mit dem Lebensalter , gleichwohl bleibt die Anerkennungsquelle der Liebe , mithin die emotionale Anerkennung .
Gleichzeitig ist der Entzug durchaus relevant , wenn etwa das Statusverhalten von Eltern ausgeprägt ist , d. h. Leistung und Aufstiegsambitionen an emotionale Anerkennung gebunden werden .
Die Gleichaltrigengruppe ist gerade in der Jugendphase von höchster Relevanz sowohl bei gleichgeschlechtlichen wie geschlechtlich unterschiedlichen Gruppen .
Die Anerkennungsquellen sind Zugehörigkeiten und Stärke sowie erwiderte Attraktivität .
Für Jugendliche stellt sich aus desintegrationstheoretischer Sicht nun die Frage nach der Anerkennungsbilanz .
Ist sie positiv , oder muss sich der Jugendliche mit einem subjektiv empfundenen Anerkennungszerfall auseinandersetzen ?
Da es sich immer um Interaktionsprozesse mit Lehrern , Eltern und Gleichaltrigen handelt , sind diese Kontakte oder Beziehungen bei einem Anerkennungszerfall immer mit Ohnmachtsgefühlen verbunden .
Da jede Person immer darum bemüht ist , eine positive Identität aufzubauen und zu sichern , stellt sich die Frage , wie Auswege aus dieser Ohnmacht bzw .
Unterlegenheit gelingen können .
Dabei sind die Kompetenzen zur Bewältigung solcher Konflikte vielfältig verteilt .
Eine Variante ist die Überwindung der negativen Anerkennungsbilanzen und damit verbundener Ohnmacht durch Machtdemonstration .
Gewalt ist die effektivste Variante , der die Gewaltfantasien gewissermaßen " zwischengeschaltet " sind , sie vermitteln also zwischen den Ohnmachtsempfindungen und der einsetzenden Planung von Gewalthandlungen .
Diese Planungen sind zum Teil langfristig angelegt .
Im Columbine - Fall dauerte es über ein ganzes Jahr , denn es müssen die als effektiv angesehenen Verhaltensstrategien ausgewählt werden .
So werden , wie im Fall von Emsdetten , die Gänge der Schule im Computer nachgebaut .
Die medial bereitgestellten Gewaltspiele stellen Verhaltensmuster dar , um das " Wie " zu klären .
Solche Einflüsse können also allenfalls die " Strategien " beeinflussen , die der Gewalttäter wählt .
Sie sind aber meist nicht ausschlaggebend für die Entscheidung , das eigene Leben und das Leben anderer auszulöschen .
Von größerem Gewicht dafür ist etwas anderes : dass der spätere
Täter auf die oben genannten Fragen keine Antworten gefunden hat .
Das " Ob " , also die Gewaltfähigkeit , wird nicht durch das Medienangebot bzw .
die Mediennutzung erzeugt , sondern durch die nicht ertragbare negative Anerkennungsbilanz hervorgerufen .
Dies reicht aber zur Taterzeugung noch nicht aus , denn es braucht Gewaltrechtfertigungen ( " Warum " ) , um Gewaltschwellen abzusenken .
Das heißt , es geht um Schuldzuweisungen für die negativen Anerkennungsbilanzen .
Die Schule und die Gleichaltrigen sind zentrale Ziele dieser Zuweisungen , die zugleich zeitlich und örtlich berechenbar als Aktionsfeld der Machtdemonstration zur Verfügung stehen , um eine möglichst hohe Opferzahl zu erzeugen .
Die Täter in Columbine wollten 250 Opfer. Schließlich gehört zum Setting die Handlungs - , das heißt die Waffenkompetenz ( " Womit " ) , um tatsächlich die Unsterblichkeit , die endgültige , zeitgeschichtliche Anerkennung , zu erreichen .
Die genannten Bedingungen sind die Voraussetzungen für einen äußerlich unauffälligen , zunächst verdeckten Eskalationsprozess , dessen Richtung zunächst offenbleibt .
Dieser Prozess kann zur Anerkennungssucht , zum Streben nach Überlegenheit führen .
Auch das Ziel der Gewalttat ist die Wiederherstellung von Anerkennung .
Dabei spielt es keine Rolle , ob die Umwelt darauf negativ oder positiv reagiert .
In der Wahrnehmung eines Täters ist es schon positiv , wenn er mit seinem Verbrechen berühmt wird .
Grandios erscheint ihm die Aussicht , sich durch Exzesse wie in Erfurt oder Littleton unsterblich zu machen .
Rache als Ausdruck von Hass stellt nur ein vordergründiges Motiv für Gewalt dar .
Rache ist das letzte Glied in einer langen Ursachenkette .
Man hat es mit Anerkennungszerfall zu tun - mit einem Gefühl , das entweder nur befürchtet wird oder sich auf Erfahrungen stützt .
Ein solcher Prozess greift die Substanz eines jeden Menschen an , wobei der Punkt , wann dieser Anerkennungszerfall einsetzt und wann er einen " Grenzwert " erreicht , von Fall zu Fall variiert .
Es gibt keinen Automatismus , der in Gewalt gegen andere mündet .
Das bedeutet aber auch , dass es kaum Vorwarnungen an die Außenwelt gibt .
Dies ist der gesellschaftliche Kontrollverlust .
Deshalb führen solche Taten zu einer so tiefen Verunsicherung der ganzen Gesellschaft .
Der Anerkennungszerfall ist also ein Prozess .
Zentrale Normen wie die der Unantastbarkeit menschlichen Lebens respektiert der Betroffene nur noch , wenn er sich selbst von den anderen ausreichend anerkannt fühlt .
Das heißt : Die Anerkennung von Personen und der Respekt von Normen stabilisieren sich gegenseitig .
Dieser Prozess ist allerdings äußerst störanfällig , wenn Lehrer oder Eltern das Gerechtigkeitsgefühl verletzen .
Die Folgen : Soziale Bindungen , emotionaler Rückhalt können verloren gehen .
Dieser
Weg in die Einsamkeit kann für einen Menschen so bedrohlich werden , dass er die Folgen seines Tuns für andere nicht mehr berücksichtigt .
Die anderen verlieren an Bedeutung und damit aber auch die sie schützende Norm der Unversehrtheit : Die Gewaltschwelle sinkt bzw .
löst sich völlig auf .
Der Prozess des Anerkennungszerfalls lässt sich am Beispiel des Massakers in Littleton nachzeichnen , wo zwei Jugendlichen 15 Menschen ermordeten .
Die beiden
Täter entwickelten gesellschaftlich durchaus prämierte Überlegenheitsfantasien , mussten aber gleichzeitig erkennen , dass sie nicht anerkannt waren .
Sie wurden ignoriert , sodass sie ihre Einstellungen zum Leben insgeheim über einen längeren Zeitraum radikalisierten : Ihr Hass entlud sich gerade an besonders anerkannten Mitschülern , den Sportlern , aber auch an den besonders verachteten Personen , den Hispanics .
Während der
Tat lachten und kicherten die Mörder , um ein einziges und letztes Mal ihre Überlegenheit gegenüber denen zu demonstrieren , die ihnen Anerkennung verweigert hatten .
Die öffentliche Debatte über die Konsequenzen dreht sich immer wieder um schärfere Kontrollen , vor allem aber um die Werteerziehung junger Menschen .
Doch empirische Studien zeigen : Unabhängig von ihrem persönlichen Schicksal und ihrem Scheitern sind oft gerade Jugendliche mit eigenen rigiden Normvorstellungen besonders gewaltbereit gegenüber anderen , die diese Normen missachten .
Die Aufwertung der Moral , auch der Forderungen nach Gewaltfreiheit kann schnell ins Gegenteil umschlagen , wenn sich Enttäuschung über die Nichtrealisierbarkeit von Lebensplänen einstellt .
Überdies :
Wir haben es nicht mit einem " Werteverfall " , sondern mit einer Wertepluralisierung zu tun .
Aber auch Wertepluralisierung erzeugt Probleme der Geltung von Normen : Grenzen werden strittiger und Grenzüberschreitungen häufiger .
Die Debatte setzt auf die Verbreitung von proklamierten Werten wie Menschlichkeit und Solidarität .
Doch die gesellschaftliche Realität wird von anderen Werten bestimmt , von Werten , die auch besonders belohnt werden : der Verabsolutierung von Selbstdurchsetzung , dem Aufstieg um jeden Preis , dem Erfolg auf Kosten anderer .
Dieser Wertefundus ist längst durchgesetzt .
Und die Jugendlichen haben die Doppelbödigkeit dieser Wertedebatte längst durchschaut .
Die Frage der Zukunft muss deshalb lauten :
Woher bekommen junge Menschen , die nicht mithalten können , ihre Anerkennung ?
Die strukturellen Ursachen des Kontrollverlusts zur Vermeidung von Amokläufen können nicht aufgehoben werden , weil wir die trigger causes , also die situativen Auslöser , in der Regel nicht kennen .
Die einzig sinnvolle Konsequenz ist eine gesellschaftliche Debatte über eine neue Kultur der Anerkennung .
Dafür gibt es derzeit keinerlei Anzeichen , das heißt , die Probleme des doppelten Kontrollverlustes werden weiterbestehen .
Hurricane Season begins in less than two weeks .
Last year , there were 16 named storms in the North Atlantic with half of those becoming hurricanes at some time during their lives .
7 struck the United States and an eight skirted the east coast briefly .
Here is the archive of the 2008 Hurricane Season .
The most ferocious for the US was Hurricane Ike and if you like , here is a link to a gallery of Hurricane Ike video and Hurricane Ike photos .
The average for tropical activity has been some 10 named storms with 6 becoming hurricanes .
The general thought in research circles is that there is about a 30 year cycle of hurricane activity and that it was long forecast that activity would turn to the more active 30 year cycle starting in the mid 1990 ’s and that seems to have come about .
People forget that Hurricane Andrew , while a strong hurricane , was just the first of the season and that was not until late August 1992 .
Just a few years later , we had a record number of named storms in the North Atlantic and its been active ever since .
Dr. William Gray at Colorado State University has long been considered an expert at hurricane forecasting with his Tropical Meteorology Project .
This year , the 2009 Hurricane Forecast predicts 14 named storms with 6 hurricanes , two of which will become major hurricanes .
There is no predictability on landfalling hurricanes .
This forecast holds with the theory of the North Atlantic being in the active hurricane cycle but the number is supressed as a weak El Nino is being anticipated as the season unfolds .
It has been determined that an El Nino event in the Pacific tends to curtail tropical activity in the North Atlantic .
None of this has any relation to Global Warming .
However , Mr. Gore and others have speculated that Global Warming would result in more hurricanes and also more intense hurricanes .
In recent years , there has been an increase in North Atlantic tropical activity in recent years .
Many with a US based world view point to this as evidence of Global Warming .
However , the number of tropical systems in the Eastern Pacific has been supressed during that time as has been the case in other parts of the world .
So , it is held by many that the increase in the North Atlantic has its roots in the natural cycle rather than other factors .
Last year , A meteorologist with NOAA who had apparently been an advocate of a link between Global Warming and an increase in Hurricane Intensity and the numbers of hurricanes now has a new report that says the opposite .
Tom Knutson even says that warmer temperatures could decrease hurricane activity and their landfall .
That last part is something that I cannot fathom how anyone could make the statement .. but he did .
Anyway , here is the article with some other links to the study .
This guy ’s new report may be more of an indication that the wheels may be falling off the Al Gore Juggernaut .
New Global Warming / Hurricane Study
Hey , it ’s going to do what its going to do , whatever the cause .
We currently have a system that has been traversing the Florida Peninsula bringing welcome rain .
For several days , the National Hurricane Center has been threatening to send out a Hurricane Hunter to investigate even though they admitted the chances of it turning tropical was minimal .
They keep cancelling the flights and have now said that they will stop making special reports .
However , it will be interesting to see what they will do in the coming days as the models suggest the low will move into the middle of the Gulf and not along the Gulf Coast , as previously indicated .
It remains progged to be around a 1008 mb low , which is below standard sea level pressure but not all that low .
It will give the boys at the NHC something to talk about and use as a PR tool as we head into the hurricane season , which starts June 1 .

decorate - sort - undecorate in Haskell Wednesday , 24th June , 2009
Real World Haskell
Chapter 3 : Defining types , streamlining functions
Section : End of chapter exercises
Exercise 6 : Create a function that sorts a list of lists based on the length of each sublist .
( You may want to look at the sortBy function from the Data .
List module . )
Answering the question
The immediate exercise threw up enough problems to make it worthwhile .
The functions sort and sortBy are in Data .
List .
sortBy takes a comparison function ( and sort is just sortBy compare ) .
So , here was my direct answer to the exercise :
import Data .
List longer :: [ a ] -> [ a ] ->
Ordering longer a b = compare ( length a ) ( length b ) sortByLength :: [ [ a ] ] -> [ [ a ] ] sortByLength a = sortBy longer a
re type signatures : I knew that longer would have to return the same type as compare :
* Main > : type compare compare :: ( Ord a ) => a -> a ->
Ordering
Decorate - sort- undecorate
That is n’t how I would write this kind of sort in Python ( my main language ) .
For a sort with any kind of custom comparison function , I would use the decorate - sort - undecorate ( dsu ) algorithm .
Here ’s a verbose implementation :
>>> def dsu( func , xs ) : ... dec_xs = [ ( func( x ) , x ) for x in xs ] ... dec_xs.sort ( ) ... undec_xs = [ x [ 1 ] for x in dec_xs ] ... return undec_xs ... >>> a = [ [ 9 ] , [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ] , [ 2 , 2 , 2 ] ] >>> dsu( len , a ) [ [ 9 ] , [ 2 , 2 , 2 ] , [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ] ] >>> dsu(sum , a ) [ [ 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 ] , [ 2 , 2 , 2 ] , [ 9 ] ]
Passing the comparison function to sort ( ) directly will result in it being called every time two elements from the list are compared .
With dsu , the comparison function is called once for each item on the list , then sort ( ) can just use less than .
Here ’s my first naive and verbose dsu sort in Haskell :
dsu :: ( Ord a , Ord b ) => ( b -> a ) -> [ b ] -> [ b ] dsu decFunc a = undecorate ( sort ( decorate decFunc a ) ) decorate :: ( t -> t1 ) -> [ t ] -> [ ( t1 , t ) ] decorate decFunc [ ] = [ ] decorate decFunc ( x:xs ) = ( ( ( decFunc x ) , x ) : decorate decFunc xs ) undecorate :: [ ( a , b ) ] -> [ b ] undecorate [ ] = [ ] undecorate ( ( _ , y ) : xs ) = ( y : undecorate xs )
Trying it out with length and sum :
* Main > dsu length a [ [ 9 ] , [ 2,2,2 ] , [ 1,1,1,1,1 ] ]
* Main > dsu sum a [ [ 1,1,1,1,1 ] , [ 2,2,2 ] , [9 ] ]
A comment by gerg on the RWH website gave the following implementation of sort by length :
sortByLength :: ( Ord a ) = > [ [ a ] ] -> [ [ a ] ] sortByLength xss = map snd ( sort ( zip ( map length xss ) xss ) )
This is much terser and more apparently Haskellian than my sortByLength , and it already almost a general dsu .
With one small change , and a type signature , we have :
dsu :: ( Ord a , Ord a 1 ) => ( a1 -> a ) -> [ a 1 ] -> [ a1 ] dsu decFunc a = map snd ( sort ( zip ( map decFunc a ) a ) )
Type signatures
I must confess that I did n’t work out all those type signatures all by myself .
I used Haskell ’s type inference to work it out for me .
Write the function without a type signature , then ask ghci what type it is :
Prelude > import Data.
List Prelude Data .
List > let dsu decFunc a = map snd ( sort ( zip ( map decFunc a ) a ) ) Prelude Data .
List > : type dsu dsu :: ( Ord a , Ord a 1 ) => ( a1 -> a ) -> [ a 1 ] -> [ a1 ]
Remember there ’s no difference between a , b and t .
They are not types of types , just more or less random letters used by different parts of ghci ’s type inference mechanism .
Note that functions seem to be of type ( a -> b ) .
Further work
I asked about decorate - sort - undecorate on Haskell - Beginners and received very helpful , thorough and friendly reponses .
Some of their implementations of dsu used Haskell syntax I have n’t come across yet .
I ’d like to look into this new syntax further and write it up , but that can be another story for another day .
The oldest submerged town in the world is about to give up its secrets — with the help of equipment that could revolutionise underwater archaeology .
The ancient town of Pavlopetri lies in three to four metres of water just off the coast of southern Laconia in Greece .
The ruins date from at least 2800 BC through to intact buildings , courtyards , streets , chamber tombs and some thirty - seven cist graves which are thought to belong to the Mycenaean period ( c.1680-1180 BC ) .
This Bronze Age phase of Greece provides the historical setting for much Ancient Greek literature and myth , including Homer ’s Age of Heroes .
Underwater archaeologist Dr Jon Henderson , from The University of Nottingham , will be the first archaeologist to have official access to the site in 40 years .
Despite its potential international importance no work has been carried out at the site since it was first mapped in 1968 and Dr Henderson has had to get special permission from the Greek government to examine the submerged town .
Although Mycenaean power was largely based on their control of the sea , little is known about the workings of the harbour towns of the period as archaeology to date has focused on the better known inland palaces and citadels .
Pavlopetri was presumably once a thriving harbour town where the inhabitants conducted local and long distance trade throughout the Mediterranean — its sandy and well - protected bay would have been ideal for beaching Bronze Age ships .
As such the site offers major new insights into the workings of Mycenaean society .
The aim of Dr Henderson ’s project is to discover the history and development of Pavlopetri , find out when it was occupied , what it was used for and through a systematic study of the geomorphology of the area establish why the town disappeared under the sea .
Dr Henderson , from the Underwater Archaeology Research Centre ( UARC ) in the Department of Archaeology , said : “ This site is of rare international archaeological importance .
It is imperative that the fragile remains of this town are accurately recorded and preserved before they are lost forever .
A fundamental aim of the project is to raise awareness of the importance of the site and ensure that it is ethically managed and presented to the public in a way which is sustainable and of benefit to both the development of tourism and the local community . ”
The submerged buildings , courtyards , streets , tombs and graves , lie just off a sandy stretch of beach close to an area popular with holiday makers and campers .
Under threat from tourism and industry the remains are being damaged by boats dragging their anchors , inquisitive snorkelers on the hunt for souvenirs and the growth of marine organisms which are also taking their toll degrading the fragile 3,500 year old walls .

The survey , in collaboration with Mr Elias Spondylis of the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture , will be carried out using equipment originally developed for the military and offshore oilfield market but looks set to transform underwater archaeological survey and recording .
Dr Henderson and his team will carry out a detailed millimeter accurate digital underwater survey of the site using an acoustic scanner developed by a major North American offshore engineering company .
The equipment can produce photo- realistic , three dimensional digital surveys of seabed features and underwater structures to sub-millimetre accuracy in a matter of minutes .
Dr Henderson said : “ The ability to survey submerged structures , from shipwrecks to sunken cities , quickly , accurately and more importantly , cost effectively , is a major obstacle to the future development of underwater archaeology .
I believe we now have a technique which effectively solves this problem . ”
Joining the team will be Dr Nicholas Flemming who discovered the site in 1967 .
The following year he led a team from the University of Cambridge who surveyed the area with hand tapes .
The archaeological material — pottery , figurines , obsidian and small finds — they collected belong to the Early Helladic , Middle Helladic and Late Helladic period ( c. 2800 –1180 BC ) .
A systematic assessment of the finds recovered at the time is currently being undertaken by Dr Chrysanthi Gallou at The University of Nottingham .
The project has received funding from the Institute of Aegean Prehistory ( INSTAP ) , The University of Nottingham and the British School of Archaeology at Athens but it is still £ 10,000 short of the amount needed to carry out the main archaeological survey .
Four annual fieldwork seasons are planned .
This May and June the team will carry out a full underwater survey .
Between 2010 and 2012 there will be three seasons of underwater excavations .
After a study season in 2013 the findings of Dr Henderson ’s research will be published in 2014 .

Hold onto it for now , as TEC's Lingo mouse might be more tempting .
While more traditional in function than the aforementioned deskless variant , its claim to fame is a self - appointed " smallest mouse " title .
While we doubt that 's really the case , at 27.5 x 60 x 19 mm and 0.8 ounces , it certainly makes a good argument .
Since we know you 're dying to hear the nitty - gritty details : 800 dpi , 2.4GHz with a range of up to 32.8 feet , and about 15 hours battery life with automatic shutoff if left dormant for five minutes .
No indication of stateside release , but if you find somewhere to import it , at least shipping wo n't be too terrible , all things considered .

Russia is planning a fleet of floating and submersible nuclear power stations to exploit Arctic oil and gas reserves , causing widespread alarm among environmentalists .
A prototype floating nuclear power station being constructed at the SevMash shipyard in Severodvinsk is due to be completed next year .
Agreement to build a further four was reached between the Russian state nuclear corporation , Rosatom , and the northern Siberian republic of Yakutiya in February .
The 70 - megawatt plants , each of which would consist of two reactors on board giant steel platforms , would provide power to Gazprom , the oil firm which is also Russia 's biggest company .
It would allow Gazprom to power drills needed to exploit some of the remotest oil and gas fields in the world in the Barents and Kara seas .
The self - propelled vessels would store their own waste and fuel and would need to be serviced only once every 12 to 14 years .
In addition , designers are known to have developed submarine nuclear - powered drilling rigs that could allow eight wells to be drilled at a time .
Bellona , a leading Scandinavian environmental watchdog group , yesterday condemned the idea of using nuclear power to open the Arctic to oil , gas and mineral production .
" It is highly risky .
The risk of a nuclear accident on a floating power plant is increased .
The plants ' potential impact on the fragile Arctic environment through emissions of radioactivity and heat remains a major concern .
If there is an accident , it would be impossible to handle , " said Igor Kudrik , a spokesman .
Environmentalists also fear that if additional radioactive waste is produced , it will be dumped into the sea .
Russia has a long record of polluting the Arctic with radioactive waste .
Countries including Britain have had to offer Russia billions of dollars to decommission more than 160 nuclear submarines , but at least 12 nuclear reactors are known to have been dumped , along with more than 5,000 containers of solid and liquid nuclear waste , on the northern coast and on the island of Novaya Zemlya .
The US Geological Survey believes the Arctic holds up to 25 % of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas reserves , leading some experts to call the region the next Saudi Arabia .
But sea ice , strong winds and temperatures that can dip to below - 50C have made them technologically impossible to exploit .
Russia , Norway , Denmark , Canada and the US have all claimed large areas of the Arctic in the past five years .
Russian scientists used a mini-submarine to plant a flag below the North Pole in 2007 and have claimed that a nearby underwater ridge is part of its continental shelf .
Last week , ministers from many Arctic countries heard scientists and former US vice - president and Nobel prize winner Al Gore say that the Arctic could be free of ice in the summer within five years , with drastic consequences for the world 's climate and human health .
But many countries bordering the Arctic see climate change as the chance to exploit areas that were once inaccessible and to open trade routes between the Pacific and Atlantic .
According to a new report by the Arctic Council , an intergovernmental forum , Russia is considering other nuclear plants for power - hungry settlements .
" The locations that have been discussed include 33 towns in the Russian far north and far east .
Such plants could be also used to supply energy for oil and gas extraction , " says the report by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme .
Announcing : The Marriage of Bonnie Hildebrand & Pete Hoebel
Two Tuesdays ago , Bonnie Hildebrand and Pete Hoebel , both members of the local chapter of the Organic Athletes vegan cyclocross team , decided that their love for bikes and each other should be sealed and certified during Pedalpalooza .
When the couple realized that Bonnie ’s mother could not get to Portland in time for the ( later canceled ) Surprise Bike Wedding event , they decided to invite the world to their own ceremony on Saturday in Ladd Circle Park .

How committed is the happy couple ?
How about chasing a loved one halfway across the country — last summer , Bonnie was planning to ride her bike from Oregon to Iowa .
When Pete realized his work would keep him from joining her , he arranged to fly out to each major city that she could reach , so that they could still share the grand bicycling adventure with each other .
Three cheers to Bonnie and Pete !
All of us here at BikePortland wish you the very best , and may both your lives and your wheels stay good and true !

After effects of a major earthquake in Sichuan province , Central China .
Could future buildings be protected using the physics of invisibility cloaks ?
( Image : Sipa Press / Rex Features )
Borrowing from the physics of invisibility cloaks could make it possible to hide buildings from the devastating effects of earthquakes , say physicists in France and the UK .
The “ earthquake cloak ” idea comes from researchers in the UK , Italy and France , some of whom were the first to show that the physics of invisibility cloaks could have other applications – designing a cloak that could render objects “ invisible ” to destructive storm waves or tsunamis .
The seismic waves of an earthquake fall into two main groups : body waves that propagate through the Earth , and surface waves that travel only across the surface .
Advertisement
Although the team calculated that controlling body waves would be too complex , controlling surface waves is within the ability of conventional engineering , they say .
Fortunately , it is surface waves that are more destructive , says team member Sebastien Guenneau at the University of Liverpool in the UK .
He worked with Liverpool colleague Sasha Movchan , Michele Brun at the University of Cagliari , Italy , and Stefan Enoch and Mohamed Farhat at the Fresnel Institute ( CNRS ) in Marseille , France .
Tuned rings
The new theoretical cloak comprises a number of large , concentric rings made of plastic fixed to the Earth ’s surface .
The stiffness and elasticity of the rings must be precisely controlled to ensure that any surface waves pass smoothly into the material , rather than reflecting or scattering at the material ’s surface .
When waves travel through the cloak they are compressed into tiny fluctuations in pressure and density that travel along the fastest path available .
By tuning the cloak ’s properties , that path can be made to be an arc that directs surface waves away from an area inside the cloak .
When the waves exit the cloak , they return to their previous , larger size .
Unlike some of the optical invisibility cloaks that have been studied in physics labs in recent years , the new cloak is “ broadband ” , meaning that it can divert waves across a range of frequencies .
This is made possible by tuning different rings of the cloak to incoming waves of different frequencies .
Waves pass largely unaffected through rings not tuned to their frequency .
“ The outer rings remain nearly still , but the pair of rings tuned to the frequency of the wave move like crazy , bending up and down and twisting , ” says Guenneau .
“ For each small frequency range , there ’s one pair of rings that does most of the work . ”
The team has simulated cloaks containing as many as 100 rings , says Guenneau , although fewer would be needed to protect against the most common kinds of earthquake surface waves .
Sound foundations
When it comes to installing them into buildings , they could be built into the foundations , Guenneau suggests .
It should be possible to make concrete structures with the right properties .
To protect a building 10 metres across , each ring would have to be about 1 to 10 metres in diameter and 10 centimetres thick .
The concentric ring design can also be scaled down , and could offer a way to control vibration in cars or other machinery , he adds .
Work remains to be done to replicate the theoretical results experimentally , says physicist Ulf Leonhardt at the University of St Andrews , UK , who was not involved in the study .
But it is possible that invisibility physics may see its first real world applications of in guiding seismic or ocean waves rather than to manipulate light , he told New Scientist .
“ I think this is fantastic – I really like taking ideas that have emerged from optics and using them in other applications . ”

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Cancellation of a coal - fired power plant in Michigan announced on Friday brings to 97 the number of plants scuttled since 2001 , said the Sierra Club , an environmental group that opposes coal plants because they are major emitters of gasses blamed for global warming .
Plans remain active for only 59 of the 220 coal coal - fired plants planned and in various stages of permitting since 2001 , said Bruce Nilles , head of the Sierra Club ’s campaign to eliminate coal - fired power plants in the United States .
In 2008 , 24 coal projects were canceled , according to Sierra Club ’s count .
This year , nine plants have been dropped .
The rest are “ on ice ” and will likely never be built , Nilles said .
The Sierra Club wants existing coal - fired power plants to be replaced by cleaner power , but the U.S. Department of Energy ’s statistical arm expects coal to provide the largest share U.S. electric generation for years .
Coal is expected to fuel 47 percent of generation in 2030 , down just 2 percentage points from 49 percent in 2007 , the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) said in its 2009 Annual Energy Outlook .
Overall , electricity from coal - fired plants in 2030 would be 19 percent higher than in 2007 .
New coal - fired capacity will be limited by concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and the potential for mandated limits , but EIA noted that existing plants will keep operating .
Other factors besides environmental worries are working against coal plants : higher construction costs and lower prices for natural gas , a cleaner alternative for generation .
The recession also has hurt prospects for a number of abandoned coal projects , including the Michigan plant scuttled on Friday by LS Power .
Renewable power will not keep pace with growing demand , even if energy efficiency programs succeed , said Jim Owen , spokesman for Edison Electric Institute , an industry lobby .
He noted that the nine plants that have been scuttled in 2009 would have generated about 6,650 megawatts of power -- enough to serve almost 5 million homes .
Owen said the power industry hopes to advance so - called clean coal technologies that include capturing CO2 emissions for underground storage .
“ We must deal with higher demand for power and carbon constraints , ” he said .
Owen said the recession has cut into electricity demand , but he expects that within a few years , power demand will match annual U.S. GDP growth of 2 percent to 3 percent .
Nilles of the Sierra Club said coal power opponents “ have a long way to go .
We can declare victory when we ’ve ended coal ’s contribution to global warming . ”
Coal - fired power plants are the biggest single contributor of CO2 emissions in the United States , making up more than 30 percent of all such emissions .
All forms of power plants contribute 40 percent of U.S. greenhouse emissions .
CO2 is by far the leading contributor to global greenhouse gases which cause global warming .
Despite its success in fighting coal plants , the Sierra Club noted that a number of public - power agencies - rural electric cooperatives and municipalities - “ continue to push forward with new coal plants despite the increasing financial risk . ”
Nilles scored the election of Barack Obama as a major victory for his cause , as reflected in changes at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
Nilles hailed this week ’s withdrawal of a permit for the 1,500 - megawatt Desert Rock plant in New Mexico and the pronouncement two weeks ago that CO2 endangers public health and welfare as evidence of a new EPA .
“ The EPA has been moving very fast which is in sharp contrast to eight years when the EPA was very much on the sidelines , ” said Nilles .

Our September / October issue is at the printers and has been sent to digital subscribers !
Here ’s the p. 2 editors ’ note :
Cliffs , Seesaws , and Leaps
The numbers are certainly scary .
Key economic indicators in the current crisis — a second - quarter GDP decline at an annual rate of 30 % , a drop in employee compensation at an annual rate of 20 % , and a contraction in real personal consumption of nearly one quarter — are on the scale of the Great Depression .
But as Alejandro Reuss shows in this issue ’s cover story , even decreases on this scale could be managed without widespread hardship , if it were n’t for the staggering inequality in U.S. society and the refusal of ruling elites to take measures to help people who are struggling .
As Reuss puts it : “ Some people live , in effect , far away from the cliff ’s edge , and can bear a decline in their incomes without too much difficulty .
But many live dangerously close to the precipice — not just during crises but under the ‘ normal ’ conditions of U.S. capitalism . ”
There has been a massive government response , including spending in the trillions of dollars , but much of it has gone to bail out companies , and the stimulus payments and expansions of unemployment insurance — what ’s kept the economy going — wo n’t likely continue , because employers do n’t want them to .
In this issue ’s cover illustration , the U.S. working class teeters at — or over — the edge of the cliff , but the ruling class controls the seesaw .
This issue ’s two other features delve into the precariousness of U.S. workers in more detail .
Journalist Julian Jacobs looks at the huge overhang of private debt that is likely to make the economic crisis worse , especially for low - income workers who are more likely to have high levels of household debt .
And economist David McClough ’s examination of “ hero pay ” — the way private employers are supposedly rewarding essential workers in the pandemic — shows how those wage increases , which are as temporary as the public pandemic aid , have to be understood in the context of employers ’ power over workers .
As long as workers ’ income is linked to employment , and employers are able to keep government from providing alternatives , workers will remain on the edge .
Reuss proposes solutions to workers ’ economic subordination , as a way of de-linking income from employment , de-linking access to basic goods from income , and de-linking employment and wages from capitalist profits .
The workers ’ movement should demand job security guarantees , a guaranteed annual wage , direct government benefits ( instead of routing them through employers ) , direct employment ( e.g. , through a federal job guarantee ) , and workers ’ control of production ( via worker - owned and - managed co-ops ) .
All these demands have historical precedent , and many of them have been on the political agenda recently ( and in the pages of Dollars & Sense ) .
Such demands are anathema to capitalists and their politician and media allies , which is as it should be , since they threaten their power .
The organizing and actions that would make it possible to achieve these demands are the subject of a future installment of Reuss ’s ongoing series , “ Coronavirus , Capitalism , and the Workers ’ Movement . ”
But in this issue ’s Active Culture , journalist Abdul Malik shows what it might take , in his account of the recent brief wildcat strike by NBA players and its spread to several other North American professional sports leagues .
The strike was in direct response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha , Wis. , but it ’s important to appreciate that this strike was not just symbolic : it built on years of organizing , from Colin Kaepernick to Black Lives Matter , and the spread of the strike to other leagues , including Major League Baseball , Major League Soccer , and the Women ’s NBA , shows that this was about workers ’ power .
As Malik puts it : “… the fundamentals of what led to this moment — a problem , management ’s inability to address this problem , difficult conversations on the shop floor , and a flashpoint that led to a total work stoppage — are repeatable in every workplace and in every sector . ”
This is the kind of organizing and action that could allow U.S. workers to leap from the edge of the cliff , and safely arrive on the other side of the chasm , where we can enjoy an economy that is beyond inequality and economic subordination .
Also in this issue : John Miller on Joe Biden ’s version of the Green New Deal , Steve Pressman ’s review of Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman ’s latest book , and more !
The Best Illusion of the Year was just announced , and the grand prize goes to a trippy demonstration of how curve balls flummox batters .
Four visual researchers –Arthur Shapiro , Zhong - Lin Lu , Emily Knight and Robert Ennis–collaborated on the illusion .
The winners resolve a conundrum that baseball players have always faced :
The “ break ” in a curveball .
A curveball occurs because of the ball ’s topspin , but it curves gradually during the baseball ’s flight , and by just a couple feet .
But for batters , the ball seems to jump several feet nearly instanteously .
The illusion by Sharpio et al shows that crazy things happen when you switch from your peripheral vision to your central vision ; objects can appear to move more than they actually do .
A curveball can appear to break .
Still images can’t convey how bizarre the effect is , watch the animation here .
The award , which is given away each year at the Vision Sciences Society Meeting , was n’t just a lark for the the participants .
Illusions have long been used to test exactly how our vision works , and the competitors were mostly scientists who ’ve recently
published their illusory findings in academic journals .
Second place went to an experiment in creating “ afterimage ” colors ; third prize went to a demonstration that simply changing the contrast on an androgynous face chances whether we see it as female or male :

My son is 13 .
In his English lessons , he spends time learning the grammar and vocabulary of the language - basic necessities for anyone leaving school .
But he has also been exposed to some of the great works of literature that have been created using these building blocks .
He has already read Richard III and George Eliot 's Silas Marner .
He probably did n't understand the intricate complexities and subtleties of these great works , but he was excited by the contact with such stimulating literature .
In mathematics , he has also been learning the basic grammar and vocabulary of the world of numbers .
Percentages , long division , some basic algebra and geometry .
Techniques that are also regarded as core skills that every child should leave school with .
But the curriculum has not exposed him yet to the creative possibilities of mastering these tools .
And nor is the curriculum likely to , even as he advances through the school system .
The teachers are required to teach a utilitarian and unadventurous curriculum that leaves them no room to explore the creative side of the subject .
Indeed , most people are utterly surprised to discover that there is any creativity in mathematics .
When I was 13 , I had n't caught the mathematical bug yet .
I was n't particularly interested in mathematical computations .
But then my mathematics teacher took me aside after one lesson and recommended a few books that he thought might interest me .
He conspiratorially intimated that the maths we were doing in the classroom was n't really what maths was about .
It was something much more exciting , creative , imaginative .
Those books provided me with a key to the secret garden of mathematics .
In that garden I discovered that mathematics also has great stories .
Unsolved mysteries like the enigma of prime numbers .
Magical mathematical machines that could help you see in four dimensions .
Mathematicians who had journeyed to infinity and beyond , discovering that there are many sorts of infinity , some bigger than others .
Like my son reading Shakespeare , I certainly did n't understand everything I read , but it inspired me to want to navigate this world , to put in the hard graft to master the language and grammar of maths so that I could read and one day create my own mathematical stories .
One of the books my teacher recommended was GH Hardy 's A Mathematician 's Apology .
At the time , I was very interested in music , I was learning the trumpet , hanging out with the arty crowd , doing plays and singing in choirs .
Science had n't really captured my imagination .
But I also had a desire for things that made logical sense , for solving puzzles , for a rational perspective on the world .
A Mathematician 's Apology suddenly opened up a bridge between these two competing desires , these two cultures .
As I read Hardy 's book , there were sentences which revealed to me that mathematics shared a lot in common with the creative arts .
It seemed to be compatible with things I loved doing : languages , music , literature .
Here for example is Hardy writing about being a mathematician : " A mathematician , like a painter or a poet , is a maker of patterns .
If his patterns are more permanent than theirs , it is because they are made with ideas . "
Later he writes : " The mathematician 's patterns , like the painter 's or the poet 's , must be beautiful ; the ideas , like the colours or the words , must fit together in a harmonious way .
Beauty is the first test : there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics . "
For Hardy , mathematics seemed to be a subject with a sense of aesthetics .
His book contained two proofs .
Like playing a delicate mathematical minuet , he explained the ancient Greeks ' discovery that there are infinitely many primes .
It was a revelation that one could prove with such a simple piece of logical reasoning that these indivisible numbers with no discernible pattern spiral off to infinity .
That our finite minds could master the infinite was inspiring .
Here was the power of analytical thinking to get you to new places , new discoveries , new knowledge .
The other proof he explained was the discovery that the square root of 2 cannot be written as a fraction , another proof for which the ancient Greeks were responsible .
It led to the creation of a whole new sort of number called irrational numbers .
Mathematics is full of these extraordinary moments of creativity and discovery , breakthroughs that have had an impact on understanding the world we live in .
The creation of a number whose square is - 1 seems a moment of absurdity , but led to the maths that allows us to formulate quantum physics .
Imagining new geometries that exist beyond our three - dimensional world and will never have a physical reality gave birth to the physics of relativity .
Creating strange new symmetrical objects has inspired the invention of codes that are the basis of the telecommunications industry .
But mathematics does n't always need to be linked to a technological or scientific breakthrough to accentuate its potency .
Discovering that there were many different sorts of infinity ( in fact infinitely many ) was an exciting moment in my own mathematical career , as it was for the first mathematicians who discovered it at the end of the 19th century .
It does n't need to have an application to be exciting .
I 'm a maths nerd .
I love maths for its own sake .
But for others the subject comes alive when they learn how mathematics is not an isolated subject , but runs seductively below the surface of many other subjects in the curriculum .
I 've never understood why education is so compartmentalised .
My son looks at his timetable : maths first lesson , history second lesson , music before lunch .
The curriculum gives no hint at how integrated all these subjects are .
To look at the historical evolution of mathematical ideas provides an invaluable perspective on why the mathematics was created in the first place .
The volume of a pyramid is a third the base times the height .
Its discovery was first recorded in the Egyptian Rhind Papyrus .
The Egyptians wanted to know how much stone would be needed to build the pyramids in Giza .
A cosine is the adjacent divided by the hypotenuse .
It was developed to allow ancient astronomers to measure distances in space without ever having to move from the comfort of their observatories .
In music , there are so many interesting mathematical themes and variations that can be investigated : Ghanaian and Indian rhythms exploit the indivisibility of the primes ; the tension between fractions and irrational numbers like the square root of 2 is the key to problems of musical harmony ; and modern music by Schoenberg and Messiaen is a musical expression of the mathematics of symmetry .
In art , the mathematics of symmetry is fundamental to understanding the beautiful designs of the Moorish artists in the Alhambra .
Baroque art and science are both attempting to understand how to capture things in motion : one with paint , the other with calculus .
Just like Riemann before them , the cubist painters are trying to see beyond our three - dimensional world into hyperspace .
The architecture that adorns our modern skylines is the physical embodiment of many different themes from the mathematical palette .
In English and theatre , I 've done workshops with maths and theatre teachers exploring ideas of infinity as part of my collaboration with the theatre company Complicité .
The condition to join the workshop was that a theatre teacher had to bring a maths teacher with them .
They went away wondering why they 'd never talked to each other in the common room before .
As Stoppard and Frayn discovered , mathematics is full of wonderful ideas to explore theatrically .
Even Shakespeare 's poetry is full of interesting mathematical structures .
Mathematics could come alive for so many more people if it was n't kept behind walls .
I am not an educationalist .
I am a mathematician .
But I know what turned me on to the subject .
It was being shown what mathematics is really about .
It was being exposed to the big stories , the Shakespeare of mathematics that inspired me .
Why are more children not given the key to this secret garden ?
Why ca n't we include the Shakespeare of maths in the curriculum ?
I admit it 's not for everyone , just as Shakespeare does n't work for every child .
English has two GSCEs : literature and language .
There is talk of having two GCSEs in maths .
Why not dedicate the second GSCE to studying the great stories of maths ?
We are not frightened to throw Richard III at 13 - year - olds .
Let 's be more brave and throw Riemann at them , too .

2 What are the chances that two people in the class have the same birthday ?
3 Is there more than one infinity ?
4 Primes go on for ever , but what 's the biggest prime so far discovered ?
5 A one - dimensional line has two ends .
A 2D square has 4 corners .
A 3D cube has 8 corners .
How many corners do you think a 4D cube has ?
The Answers :

Hugo Chavez 's " Bolivarian revolution " has just revolted its way into cell phone design , producing a US $ 13.95 handset / MP3 player in Venezuela with Chinese parts .
Chavez has big plans for the phone , which he wants to export to the world , but much of the talk so far has focused on its name , " Vergatario " — as one YouTube commenter put it , " creo que la traducion corecta es : Big Wang . "
" Verga " is a Venezuelan slang term for " penis . "
The fact is glossed over in some Spanish newspaper accounts , which say that the phone 's name only signifies " excellence . "
But , as The Guardian points out , the root word retains prominence .
And Chavez can't keep himself from chuckling when he says it .
As other Spanish - language sources have noted , the phone is already known as the " penis cellphone " in the US , and Chavez is n't above making jokes about the name .
" Whoever does n't have a Vergatario is nothing , " he said .
Chavez called his mother on El Vergatario
That 's all odd enough , but the phone 's launch was then timed to coincide with ...
Mother 's Day , and Chavez made a big show of calling his mother on one of the devices during a TV appearance .
The government charges that " Venezuelan private media have distorted the name of the cell phone made in Venezuela , the Vergatario , so as to give it a sexual connotation and to try to hold back the great success the appliance has had in the country . "
" Vergatario " means only " optimal , outstanding , incredible or of the best quality , " and the Royal Spanish Academy agrees .
" Therefore , the same entity that clarifies the meaning of all the words in Spanish dismisses any other type of meaning for ' vergatario , ' " says the government , though one is immediately reminded of the " teagbagging " movement here in the US for an example of how just going to the dictionary is n't enough to avoid sexual innuendo .
Let 's talk quality
Despite the name , early batches of the device are selling .
The first 5,000 - unit shipment sold out quickly .
According to the government , " The quality and high demand of the Vergatario was evidenced the same day it appeared in the market , when thousands of Venezuelans made lines since early in the morning to purchase the phone , which caused that before midday the mobile phone run out of stocks . "
The phones are produced by a state - owned manufacturing firm called F?brica Venezolana de Telecomunicaciones ( and known as Vetelca ) .
Venezuela has an 85 percent stake in the factory , and Chinese firm ZTE has the other 15 percent and will supply most of the parts .
According to the Venezuelan government , most of Vetelca 's assembly jobs will go to women , and the company believes it can produce one million handsets a year .
As its price suggests , the device is basic but does offer MP3 playback , phone , camera , radio , and text messaging .
Chavez 's goal is to produce the cheapest phone in the world , offering a device that even the poor can afford .
It 's no iPhone , but that 's exactly the point .
Also , the phone is not used for espionage .
Just ask the head of Vetelca , Carlos Audrines .
" The issue of espionage is quite farfetched , " he said .
" This telephone has basic features as stopwatch , address book , calculator ; it serves to communicate .
That thing of espionage is too farfetched . "

Sunrise over the Parthenon

Explanation : Today , the sun will stay in the sky longer than any other day of the year , as seen from the northern hemisphere of Earth .
Named the Summer Solstice , today 's maximum daylight is indicative of the high amount of sunlight this time of year that is primarily responsible for the heat of the summer season .

If Jimmy Kimmel still has a job at ABC on Wednesday , he is either a very lucky or very deft comedian , or he has great blackmail photos of the network executives .
At Tuesday afternoon ’s upfront presentation in New York , Mr. Kimmel , the host of ABC ’s late night talk show “ Jimmy Kimmel Live , ” delivered a withering , blistering monologue that took direct aim at ABC , its potential advertisers and his NBC late - night rival , Jay Leno .
The assembled advertisers received his performance with a mixture of uneasy laughs and the occasional gasp .
UPDATE : As several commenters have rightly pointed out , much of Mr. Kimmel ’s routine also received healthy laughter and was well received by the room .
We did n’t intend to imply otherwise .
You can watch video of Mr. Kimmel ’s upfront performance here .
Bouncing onto the stage at just after 4 p.m. , Mr. Kimmel self - deprecatingly declared , “ All of ABC ’s late night comedy talent is assembled here on one stage . ”
After rattling off a few statistics about the affluence of his viewers , he then admitted that he ’d made all the numbers up .
( He said so in a more obscene way . )
Then , in a “ Jerry Maguire ” - like moment of clarity , Mr. Kimmel said , “ Everything you ’re going to hear this week is ” nonsense .
“ Let ’s get real here .
Let ’s get Dr. Phil - real here .
These new fall shows ?
We ’re going to cancel about 90 percent of them .
Maybe more . ”
If ABC is so confident in its new fall shows , he asked , why is it announcing them at the same time it announces the midseason shows that will replace those fall shows ?
“ This show ‘ Shark Tank ’ has the word tank right in the title , ” he said .
To the ABC advertisers , Mr. Kimmel said , “ Every year we lie to you and every year you come back for more .
You do n’t need an upfront .
You need therapy .
We completely lie to you , and then you pass those lies onto your clients . ”
Mr. Kimmel then took a verbal swing at his own network , reminding the audience that ABC had attempted to hire away Mr. Leno when his tenure ended at NBC ’s “ Tonight Show . ”
But , according Mr. Kimmel , NBC said it would not give up Mr. Leno , “ even if we have to destroy our own network to keep him . ”
By devoting its entire 10 p.m. lineup , Monday through Friday , to Mr. Leno , Mr. Kimmel said NBC is “ giving Jay ’s viewers exactly what they want .
An early - bird special . ”
By deciding on their fall schedule in April , Mr. Kimmel said , “ NBC got such a head start , they ’ve already had time to cancel half their schedule . ”
Mr. Kimmel also aimed a couple of zingers at Fox .
That network ’s action series “ 24 , ” he said , was “ a head butt away from cancellation . ”
Next season , he said , Jack Bauer would have a new sidekick “ played by Kiefer Sutherland ’s probation officer . ”
Returning to ABC ’s advertisers , Mr. Kimmel said , “ Next year on ‘ Grey ’s Anatomy , ’ your product could kill Dr. Izzie .
It just depends on how much you want to pay . ”
In closing , Mr. Kimmel said , “ I think all our shows are going to work this year .
I really do . ”
He paused .
“ I do n’t , really . ”
Before departing the stage , he said : “ The important thing to remember is : who cares , it ’s not your money . ”

Milan , Italy , 13 May 2009 -
If somebody asks you " Do you remember what you did on March 13 , 1985 ? " you are very likely to answer " I do n't know " , even if your memory is excellent .
In a study conducted by Dalla Barba and Decaix from the Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale and the Department of Neurology of the Hôpital Saint Antoine in Paris and published in the May 2009 issue of Cortex , researchers found that a patient with severe amnesia reported detailed false memories in answering this type of question .
People with normal memories are unable to answer this type of question because it is beyond their memory capacity .
This is the first reported case of a pathological condition that the authors of the article named ' Confabulatory Hyperamnesia ' .
Patient LM , described in this study , is a 68 - year - old man , who , following more than 30 years of heavy drinking , developed Korsakoff 's syndrome , a condition characterized by severe amnesia and confabulation , the unintentional production of false memories by amnesic patients who are unaware of their memory deficits .
Patients who confabulate produce more or less plausible false memories answering questions like " What did you do yesterday ? " or " How did you spend your last vacation ? " , but , just like people with normal memory , they answer " I do n't know " to questions like " Do you remember what you did on March 13 , 1985 " .
What makes LM different from other confabulators is his unusual tendency to consistently provide a confabulatory answer to this type of questions .
He would say , for example , that on March 13 , 1985 he spent the day at the Senart Forest ( a place where he used to go often with his family ) or that he could remember that on the first day of summer in 1979 he was wearing shorts and a T - shirt .
LM 's confabulatory hyperamnesia could not be traced back to any specific pattern of brain damage and the MRI brain scan was unremarkable .
The authors conclude that LM shows an expanded consciousness of his past , a consciousness which has surpassed the limits of time and details .

Animal welfare activists
Wen Zhenyu and Luo Xinmei are trying to halt the illegal sale of endangered animals for food and medicines in the markets of Guangzhou in China guardian.co.uk
Stewed turtle cures cancer , crocodile meat relieves asthma , pangolin scales regulate menstruation and scorpion venom helps stroke victims .
Such is the traditional wisdom in Guangdong province , where animal markets teem with snakes , scorpions , salamander and dozens of different species of birds and turtles , some of which are endangered and all of which are fated to end their lives in restaurants , pharmacies or pet cages .
Eating rare wildlife is normal in southern China , but a growing group of student activists is trying to do something considered far stranger : they are trying to save them .
The nascent NGO conservation movement is stepping in where the authorities have had limited success by monitoring markets and restaurants , reporting sales of endangered species and trying to change the consumer culture .
Among the youngest of several small groups is the Asian Turtle Rehabilitation Project , established earlier this year to save the reptiles from the soup pot .
The founding members say they are trying to cross the divide between the culture in which they were raised and the global conservation concerns they have been exposed to via the internet and schooling .
They are surrounded by people who think it 's a wasted effort .
" They disapprove of this activity .
They think turtles are small animals only good for eating , so why bother saving them , " says Luo Xinmei , a local student .
" Almost no one in Guangzhou realises this is a centre of the illegal wildlife trade . "
They are up against tradition and economic growth .
Guangdong is the richest and most powerful province in southern China , where the appetite for exotic animals and plants is seen as extreme even in most other regions of China .
The main reason is Chinese traditional medicine , which lists curative qualities in many exotic animals .
It is believed that the wilder the animal or plant , the better the effects .
A popular saying has it that people here will eat anything with four legs except a chair , anything that flies except a plane and anything in the water except a boat .
Demand dropped briefly after 2003 , when the Sars crisis was blamed on pathogens spread by civet cats and other wild animals .
But it has surged back since as rising incomes allow more consumers to indulge in foods that were once considered delicacies for the very rich .
A survey by the conservation group Traffic last year found that almost half of city dwellers had eaten wild animals in the previous 12 months .
The impact has been devastating .
While international attention tends to focus on big mammals such as the Sumatran tiger and the giant panda , many reptiles have quietly been pushed to the brink of extinction , including the three - stripe box turtle , the Rogi Island snake - neck turtle and the Malaysian giant turtle .
Turtles are among the most threatened because they breed slowly and their meat is considered good for longevity .
Raising awareness takes a number of forms .
The group has secretly taken images of a turtle being butchered and posted them online .
But its main job is monitoring .
On a recent visit to the city 's Qingping and Huadiwan markets , Wen Zhenyu identified big headed turtles , pig - nosed turtles , Chinese three - striped box turtle and elongated tortoises among the many species that are meant to be protected by international treaty .
While China is not the only culprit in the consumption of wild animals , it is the biggest .
And its impact is being felt across the region .
In February , ­Vietnamese authorities seized a record haul of ­illegally harvested wildlife products , including two tons of tiger bones , bear paws and gall bladders .
­Reports the same month from Laos revealed the ongoing poaching of tiger .
The biggest market for these products is China , where a tiger 's bones and penis can fetch $ 70,000 .
The authorities launch occasional raids on restaurants and dealers .
Last month , Guangzhou wildlife protection officials intercepted a cargo of smuggled golden pheasant , sand badger , leopard cat and other animals .
The Guardian found two food outlets in the Honghua hot spring resort outside Guangzhou openly breaking the law by serving pangolin and other protected animals .
The Huasheng restaurant charges 1,000 yuan ( about $ 150 ) per kilogram of pangolin meat .
" You need to pay in advance and then we will find one for you , " said an employee .
" We can cook it in a hotpot or braise it in soy sauce . "
Nearby , the Liyuan Meiwei restaurant illegally offers cobra .
" It is 100 yuan per half - kilo , " said a waiter .
" We get it from the wild . "
Conservationists believe police alone cannot solve the problem .
" We need to build consumer awareness so people move away from unsustainable consumption towards a feeling of stewardship , " said James Compton , the Asia Pacific co-ordinator of Traffic .
Late last month , activists from another group , Green Eye , scored a major victory by protesting outside a Guangzhou restaurant in which a nurse shark was held in a tiny tank in which it could barely move .
With banners reading " No consuming , no killing " in English and Chinese , the campaigners received widespread coverage from local news channels .
They eventually secured the release of the shark into the local marine park .
Zheng Yuanying , of Green Eye , said the focus was not on the stall owners but on the consumers .
" We avoid conflict .
We just try to make suggestions .
But some people think we care about animals too much . "
For many species , it may be too late .
The Wildlife Conservation Society reports a sharp decline in the diversity of freshwater turtles , snakes and frogs in the wild , though many species , including crocodiles , are being bred successfully in captivity .
At Qingping market , a veteran snake seller says the market sells fewer species than before because many animals are extinct and the authorities are conducting stricter checks .
But he admits to selling some protected species under the table .
" Even if people know an animal is endangered , they will eat it if they have a disease that cannot be cured with other types of medicine . "
One notorious market in Nansha has been closed , but conservationists fear the wild animal business is simply being pushed underground .
At 4 am in a dark suburb of Taiping , about an hour 's drive from downtown Guangzhou , the Guardian found exotic animals traders covertly plying their wares out of sight of the authorities and conservationists .
The three long rows of sheds resembled a cramped and dirty zoo filled with wire cages : long and tall for the herons , flat and low for the civet cats .
Ostriches have room to move their necks , but not their bodies .
There are similar markets throughout southern China .
The activists say the key is changing attitudes .
" We try to educate people that turtles are not only pets and not only food ; they are also a friend of ­humans , " Wen Zhenyu says .
America is literally driving itself into debt .
US households now carry a stunning $ 1.34 trillion in automotive debt .
What is troubling about this is the amount of driving taking place has plunged courtesy of Covid - 19 and much of our economy is built around driving .
People take the morning and evening commute , and this was seen as simply normal – but now with many working from home , that may not be the case .
Also , the notion of buying cars ( a depreciating asset ) every few years is just a bad financial move .
The buying would not be so bad but the level of debt being taken on to finance a car purchase is .
Not too long ago a three - or four - year term on an auto loan was standard .
Now we have loans of six to seven years !
You also have billions of dollars going to subprime borrowers and in this climate , a large number of Americans are financially on the edge .
Where do we go from here when it comes to auto debt ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama has accepted the resignation of Louis Caldera , the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the controversial low - altitude flyover of New York by a 747 plane used as Air Force One , the White House said Friday .
The 747 used as Air Force One flies over the Statue of Liberty in this photo released by the White House .
The photo shoot , which President Obama said he was " furious " with , happened on April 27 .
The image of a low - flying plane accompanied by an F - 16 fighter jet sent some New Yorkers into the streets and into a panic -- reminding them of the tragic 9/11 attacks on the city .
Building evacuations also took place across the Hudson River in Jersey City , New Jersey .
Read more of Obama 's reaction
Caldera later apologized for the flyover .
" I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group 's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office , " Caldera said in a letter to Obama .
" Moreover , it has become a distraction to the important work you are doing as president .
After much reflection , I believe it is incumbent on me to tender my resignation and step down as director of the White House Military Office . "
The White House also released a photo of the flyover and a report on the incident on Friday .
In the report , the White House said Caldera , who had been traveling with President Obama when the flyover plans were initially discussed , did not remember a conversation in which his deputy , George Mulligan , informed him of the flyover .
Caldera did not open an e-mail about final plans for the flyover until after it had happened , the report said , noting Caldera had been suffering from severe muscle spasms and had left the office early on several days .
Although recommendations by several parties involved in the flyover had been made that White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs and Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina be informed of the plans , the report said , that job was left to Caldera , who did not pass the information along .
The flyover , officials said , was a training mission -- it was also a government - sanctioned photo shoot .
Military officials estimate the mission and the photo shoot , aimed at updating file photos of Air Force One -- cost $ 328,835 in taxpayer money .
But they said " the hours would have been flown regardless , and the expenses would have been accrued on a different mission . "
Witnesses reported seeing the plane circle over the Upper New York Bay near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River .
Watch the plane fly over Manhattan »
A YouTube video showed people standing in a parking lot , watching the plane approach .
As it nears , they begin to run .
" Run , run ! " said one person .
" Oh my God , " cried another .
Mayor Michael Bloomberg was visibly angry last week .
" I 'm annoyed -- furious is a better word -- that I was n't told , " he said , adding that the decision by the White House Military Office and Federal Aviation Administration to withhold details about the flight were " ridiculous " and " poor judgment . "
But according to Air Force Capt .
Anna Carpenter , local law enforcement agencies and the FAA had been notified of the exercise .
New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne confirmed that department had been alerted about the flight " with directives to local authorities not to disclose information about it . "

The Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth has acquired what some scholars now say is the first known painting made by Michelangelo .
And if he created it , he did so when he was only 12 or 13 .
This latest research holds that Michelangelo painted “ The Torment of St. Anthony ” between 1487 and 1488 .
That would make it one of only four known easel paintings by Michelangelo — another is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence and two unfinished ones are in the National Gallery of Art in London — and the first to enter an American museum .
The painting ’s attribution has been the subject of ferocious debate among scholars for four and a half centuries .
While experts , citing historical records , agreed that Michelangelo had made a painting of the saint , the question was , Is it this work ?
But “ The Torment of St. Anthony ” — an oil and tempera on a wood panel , depicting the saint poised in midair and beaten by demons — has recently undergone conservation and technical research at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Keith Christiansen , a curator of European painting there , said he firmly believed that it was by the hand of the master .
Call for Tax Deductibility for Donating ( to ) FLOSS ( AU )
Call for Tax Deductibility for Donating ( to ) FLOSS ( AU )
Brendan Scott
May 2009
Summary
There is cause to believe that an entity could be established in such a way as to be a deductible gift recipient under the Australian Income
Tax legislation and that donations of open source software to that entity would give rise to a tax deduction to the benefit of the donor while preserving public access to the software .
Such an arrangement would benefit individual FLOSS developers ( who have an income against which a deduction can be claimed ) , including those whose FLOSS activities are pro bono at the moment .
There is no reason to think the same principles would not apply to other licensing schemes , such as open content .
Background
Some while ago Open Source Victoria ( OSV ) asked me to investigate some issues relating to the tax deductibility of donating FLOSS to charities as a means of promoting participation in FLOSS within Australia .
OSV agreed to partly fund the work , and I mapped out some options for them at the time .
I ’ve recently spoken with OSV and they were happy for some aspects of work to be made public .
Who Benefits ?
Policy makers too often overlook the fact that the whole of the community benefits whenever software is released under a FLOSS licence .
The intended beneficiary of such a scheme are therefore the community as a whole .
However , consistently with existing government policy to provide incentives for the creation of works , the donors of such FLOSS software would also benefit through a tax benefit in return for the donation .
Further , as businesses will likely be able to deduct the costs of development of software which is created in the course of their business , the donors most likely to benefit are those individual developers engaged in pro bono development .
That is , such a scheme would provide an incentive to individual developers to create and donate FLOSS .
Outline of the Arrangement
In some circumstances the donation of gifts to charities gives rise to a tax deduction to the value of the gift .
Such deductions are not available for all donations , but whether the gift is money or an asset does not remove its deductability .
Software is an asset , so it can be a gift .
The arrangement therefore involves establishing an entity which grants OSI compliant licences over software donated to it in such a way that the gift of copyright to the entity would give rise to an entitlement to claim a tax deduction for the value of that copyright .
Discussion
Eligibility for a Deduction
There are a number of things to be established in order for a donation to an entity to be tax deductible .
These are :
that the donation falls into one of a number of specific categories of things which can be gifts ; that the recipient of the gift has a special character as a Deductible Gift Recipient ( DGR ) .
This involves both being entitled to endorsement as a DGR and actually receiving that endorsement ; that any additional special conditions are satisfied .
Special conditions can apply to gifts based on the character of the DGR and / or the circumstances of the donation ; and that the donation has the character of a gift as defined by taxation law .
This includes both the nature of the gift itself and the manner in which the gift is given .
Deductible Gift Recipient
The legislation does not make it particularly easy to become a DGR .
Indeed , it has a Byzantine structure which the unkind might think was specifically designed to prevent entities becoming DGRs .
The tax deductibility of gifts is dealt with in Division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 .
Section 30 - 15 has a table which sets out the circumstances in which a gift will be deductible ( Deductibility Table ) .
The Deductibility Table sets out not only the categories of gift recipient , but also links the gift recipient to specific categories of gift and / or special conditions on gifts and / or deductibility of gifts .
A gift recipient may appear in different rows of the table , indicating that the same recipient may receive different categories of gift or that different gifts are subject to different special conditions ( or both ) .
From a review of all of these the following seemed promising :
“ (1 ) A fund , authority or institution covered by an item in any of the tables in Subdivision 30 ‑ B ” ;
“ 4( b ) a public library in Australia ” ; and
“ 4( c ) a public museum in Australia ” .
The tables in Subdivision 30 - B list a large number of funds , authorities and institutions .
Some of these are named specifically ( eg item 2.2.19 “ the Foundation for Gambling Studies ” ) , while others are identified by category ( eg item 2.1.1 “ a public university ” ) .
Of all the entities listed in Subdivision 30‑B , the only ones likely to be applicable in the proposed circumstances are :
( a ) 4.1.1 a public benevolent institution ;
( b) 12.1.2 a public library ; and
( c ) 12.1.3 a public museum .
In certain circumstances , there may be other categories which are appropriate – for example , certain research arms of universities are entitled to be DGRs .
In addition , there would be the possibility of having the entity specifically listed in the legislation – if a specific naming was possible it would be the easiest route home , but the least likely to be able to be achieved .
Failing that , the most promising seem to be establishing a library or a museum .
The detail of what constitutes a public benevolent institution is rather stringent and would be difficult to qualify under .
Gifts
In addition to the entity being established as a DGR , the gifts themselves need to have the requisite character .
These requirements are set out in a number of court cases and include :
( a ) that there is a transfer of money or property ;
( b ) the transfer is made voluntarily ;
( c ) that there is no material benefit to the donor by way of return ; and
( d ) it essentially arises from benefaction and proceeds from detached and disinterested generosity .
There is no reason why the donation of code could not qualify under this definition as a gift .
Anti-Avoidance
In addition to the provisions qualifying what is , or is not a gift , the Act also has “ anti-avoidance ” provisions which are relevant .
These are intended to apply to invalidate gifts where a scheme or arrangement has been contrived to avoid the spirit of the deductible gift recipient provisions .
In essence a gift is not deductible where as a result of a gift :
( a ) the value of the gift to the recipient is reduced ( including where the reduction is from an event that happens after the gift is given ) ;
( b ) another fund other than the recipient becomes liable to another person ;
( c ) the donor of the gift ( or an associate ) receives a benefit ( other than the tax deduction ) ; or
( d ) there is a requirement for the recipient or another fund to acquire other property from the donor .
There is no reason in principle why the anti-avoidance provisions should preclude software donations of the kind contemplated by these arrangements .
How Much of a Deduction ?
In theory the whole value of the asset is deductible .
The Act has different rules for different categories of gift .
In some circumstances no deduction is available for the donation of assets worth less than $ 5,000 .
However , it is plausible that a gift of software under the arrangements contemplated would not be subject to this $ 5,000 minimum .
There are specific procedures in the Act to establish a value of assets .
For the arrangement to work could require establishing software valuers approved by the relevant department .
Presumably the market value of the donation of a substantial project ( Joomla ? ) would be signficant .
What needs to be done ?
From here there is still a fair bit of work to be done before such an entity could commence operation .
A start would be to establish the infrastructure for such an entity – eg finding people to run it , creating constituting documents which would be consistent with an open source donation , establishing a valuation procedure and making an application for deductible gift recipient status .

Changes to the US visa system mean foreign science and technology professionals could get approval within two weeks
The US government has implemented changes to its visa system that are expected to make it dramatically easier for foreign researchers and graduate students to enter the country to work or attend scientific conferences .
The State Department has hired additional staff in Washington , DC to process visa applications from individuals whose advanced scientific and technical backgrounds raise red flags from a national security or technology transfer perspective .
The agency anticipates that extra staff , together with ’ procedural modifications ’ made in early June , will allow foreign science and technology professionals who apply for US visas to receive approval within two weeks .
’ We found that the processing times of these visas were increasing , and over the last year had increased to a point that made us concerned , ’ State Department spokesman Andy Laine tells Chemistry World .
’ These delays were creating an obstacle to the legitimate sharing of scientific information . ’
US science advocacy groups like the National Academies and the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) are hailing the developments as a victory .
They have complained for years that foreign scientists , engineers , and students involved in scientific disciplines face a visa application backlog that harms the nation ’s research enterprise .
Roughly one - third of all US Nobel laureates in science are born outside the US .
The State Department says 8.7 million people applied for a non-immigrant US visa from October 2007 to September 2008 ; 56,000 of those were subject to an extra layer of review in Washington because of the applicant ’s scientific background .
Chemistry feels the pain
The US chemistry sector is among the science communities adversely affected by visa roadblocks .
’ We lose talent to other counties at all levels - graduate students , postdocs , and senior people who could come here to work in academia or industry , ’ Stanford University chemistry professor Michael Fayer tells Chemistry World .
Chemists who were considering applying for postdoctoral positions or assistant professorships at US universities are choosing to go elsewhere , Canadian or German universities for example , he says .
Fayer , who has chaired the school ’s chemistry graduate admissions committee , further notes that international participation in US scientific conferences has suffered in recent years .
Data from the American Chemical Society confirm that there is room for improvement .
The group surveyed scientists abroad who were invited to participate in its last three national conferences , which took place in various US cities during 2008 and 2009 .
Of those who responded , less than half said their visas were approved in time to attend the meetings , and just over three per cent were either denied a visa or were not granted a visa in time .
While the State Department is confident these latest changes will make a difference , others are not so sure .
’ The proof , of course , will be in the pudding - once we actually start seeing the backlog shrink and the process speeding up , ’ states Al Teich , head of science and policy programmes at AAAS .
’ The moves that State is currently implementing will not solve all of the problems with the visa system , ’ he warns .
Representatives from the National Academies also say they are reserving final judgment until they witness actual improvements .
The organisation expects to see results within the next few months and vows to monitor the situation .

Despite the National Organization for Marriage making clear that Carrie Prejean does not speak for them ( outside of that “ No Offense ” ad ) , Miss California continues her media tour .
Her latest stop ?
Greta Van Susteran ’s show on Fox News , where she subjected viewers to a rambling interview about something — we ’re now absolutely confident — she does not understand at all .
Listen to Prejean , who calls her stance on marriage “ not hateful , it ’s not discriminatory , ” declare herself “ not a politician , ” which is the excuse she uses for not knowing where she stands on civil unions .
Or gays adopting .
Just traditional marriage , which is the only thing she believes she ’s a qualified expert on .
VAN SUSTEREN : What is your thought on civil unions ?
PREJEAN : My thought on civil unions ?
You know what , Greta ?
I do n’t have the answers to everything .
I ’m not running for political office .
I do n’t have the answers to everything , you know , in the world out there .
But I think that there should be rights for people , you know , especially in California .
I think that people that are homosexual should have some rights , you know , hospital rights , and things like that .
But I would like to be more educated on that , so when I do have a better answer for you , I will get back to you on that one .
But so far I just support traditional marriage , and that ’s my main focus .
VAN SUSTEREN : What about adoption ?
PREJEAN : Greta , I am focusing on marriage right now , not adoption , not civil unions , just traditional marriage , and I ’m going to do whatever it takes to promote that .
VAN SUSTEREN : I understand , and I understand your position on traditional marriage .
I ’m just sort of trying to figure out where you draw the line in terms of what kind of rights that you think that a man and woman should have that maybe two men , two women , should n’t have .
And that ’s why I was asking the question on civil unions and adoptions .
I was just trying to sort it out for myself what you think .
PREJEAN : Well , I ’m not a politician , so I ca n’t give you an answer to that .
( CNN ) --
Ten villages in western Niger have publicly denounced the practice of female genital mutilation , according to a UNICEF report .
Representatives from the West African nation 's Tillabery region have called for all people living there to end the practice , the report said .
" We have decided to definitively put an end to female genital mutilation in our villages and to continue sensitizing neighboring villages so they also give up the practice , " said N. Babobou Pana , leader of one of the villages .
Heading the call was Kompoa Tamkpa , a former traditional practitioner .
" I have given up the bad work , because it does not bring anything to our village , " she said .
" We thought it was good for women , that it was going to bring them success .
But we found out that it does not bring anything . "
Female genital mutilation , which is also called female circumcision , is commonly performed on young girls without anesthesia , and is extremely painful and traumatizing , UNICEF said .
The practice involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia and can result in prolonged bleeding , a higher risk of HIV infection , infertility and even death .
The procedures are based on religious and cultural beliefs , including efforts to prevent premarital sex and marital infidelity .
" UNICEF is extremely pleased with this public declaration to end female genital mutilation in this part of Niger , as it is seen by Nigerian authorities as a severe violation of the rights of women and young girls , " said Akhil Iyer , a UNICEF representative in Niger .
The rate of genital mutilation in Niger dropped by more than half between 1998 and 2006 , from 5.8 percent to 2 percent , according to a government survey released last year .
But about 66 percent of women in the west of the country are still subjected to the practice , the report said .
The practice is most common in western , eastern and northeastern regions of Africa , as well as in some countries in Asia and the Middle East , and among certain immigrant communities in the United States and Europe .

A guy who is ... well , you get the point ...
This exercise in mate preferences ( and stereotypes , please excuse us ) serves to illustrate a simple point : Gay men are attractive .
In fact , their might sometimes be the only trait that makes them less than the ideal mate for many women .
But you already knew this .
If you ever agreed with the - hearted lady who lamented , " all the good ones are gay or taken , " then you understand .
Two recent articles suggest that these women are on to something .
These types of findings are also exciting for the purveyor of natural selection ( e. . , evolutionary psychologists ) because they might offer a solution to an old Darwinian puzzle .
Questions like , " Why do people commit ? "
" Why do people adopt children ? " and the question relevant to this post , " Why are some people sexually attracted to the same ? " are music to the ears of anyone trying to convey the basic tenets of evolution by natural selection to a class full of students .
These questions reflect that the " asker " has a more than cursory understanding of natural selection and EP , enough so to raise their eager little hand and attempt to " stump the teacher . "
Puzzles , however , do have solutions , and these Darwinian puzzles have some tentative answers .
Again , scientists have known for some time that sexual orientation has a genetic component .
They 've noticed that it runs in families and that identical - who share 100 % of their - are more likely to share a sexual orientation than are fraternal twins - who share only 50 % of their genes .
But how are genes associated with homosexuality maintained in a population if homosexuals do n't reproduce ?
It was once hypothesized that such a trait could be maintained via kin selection .
That is , instead of homosexuals reproducing directly , they get their genes into the future by investing ( e.g. , providing resources and child care ) in the children of genetic relatives , increasing their kin's chance of survival and reproduction as a result .
Reproducing indirectly is actually not too uncommon in nature ( see , for example , the hymenoptera ) .
By this reasoning , homosexuals could have positively affected the survival and reproductive success of their family members and passed on their genes indirectly , through their related gene - vehicles ( i.e. , their kin ) .
[ By the way , we do not recommend referring to your kin as gene - vehicles , even after several glasses of wine . ]
Hypotheses demand empirical tests , and when the kin selection hypothesis of homosexuality was tested by David Bobrow and Michael Bailey of Northwestern University and later by Qazi Rahman and Matthew Hull of the University of East London , it was not supported .
Homosexuals did not provide more care and resources to family members than heterosexuals .
Whether assessing subjective measures ( e.g. , feeling of closeness to the family , , etc. ) or objective measures ( e.g. , distance residing from relatives , frequency of contact , etc. ) , few significant differences emerged between homosexuals and heterosexuals , and when there were slight differences , they were in the opposite direction ( e.g. , homosexuals reported giving fewer monetary resources to kin than heterosexuals reported ) .
Even without data protesting against this kin selection hypothesis , we find it illogical .
The extension of the kin selection argument to account for the origins and maintenance of homosexuality would suggest that homosexuality is a switch in reproductive strategy ( duh ) - a tradeoff from effort to effort .
That is , if an individual does not reproduce directly , he should focus his efforts and resources on alloparenting so as to increase the likelihood of related offspring 's survival and reproduction .
Sexual preferences are inherently about mating , however , and so the kin selection argument does not make clear why individuals who choose to invest their resources in relatives ' offspring would be anything but asexual ( as they are in hymoptera ) .
So if this Darwinian puzzle is not solved by invoking kin selection , what 's another solution ?
Two recent studies reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior demonstrate how genes associated with homosexuality might lead to reproductive success in their heterosexual carriers .
Overly simplified , this " tipping - point " model ( originally introduced by G. E. Hutchinson in 1959 , and then later popularized by Jim McKnight in 1997 and Edward Miller in 2000 ) posits that genes associated with homosexuality confer fitness benefits in their heterosexual carriers .
If only a few of these alleles are inherited , a males ' reproductive success is enhanced via the expression of attractive , albeit feminine traits , such as kindness , sensitivity , empathy , and tenderness .
However , if many of these alleles are inherited , a " tipping point " is reached at which even mate preferences become " feminized , " meaning males are attracted to other males .
In explaining this model , Miller asked readers to imagine a genetic system in which there are five different genes that place an individual along a masculine - feminine continuum .
Each of the five genes has two alleles , one that pulls the individual to the masculine side and one that pulls to the feminine side .
If a man inherited all of the feminine - pulling alleles ( of which he has a 3.125 % chance : .55 ) , he will become homosexual .
If he inherited less than all five of the feminine - pulling alleles , however , he would not be homosexual .
Although originally proposed in simple form in 1959 , this model was finally empirically tested in 2008 and 2009 .
Behavioral geneticists at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research lead by Brendan Zietsch ( joined by sexual orientation expert Michael Bailey and evolutionary geneticist Matthew Keller ) found that psychological femininity in heterosexual men elevated the number of opposite - sex sexual partners , suggesting that their femininity was often attractive to women ( think Johnny Depp ) .
In addition , these researchers and those at Abo Akedemi University in Finland ( lead by Pekka Santtila ) independently predicted that if the " tipping point " model was correct , then heterosexual men with a homosexual twin should have more of the attractive feminine - pulling alleles and thus more opposite - sex sexual partners than members of heterosexual twin pairs .
The Finnish group also measured the number of children and age at first intercourse between heterosexual men with a homosexual twin brother and heterosexual men with heterosexual twin brothers .
While the findings did not reach statistical significance , data suggested that heterosexuals with a homosexual twin had slightly more opposite - sex sexual partners , slightly more children , and were a bit younger at the age of first intercourse than heterosexual twin pairs .
These recent findings are scientifically intriguing and they likely have profound implications for the LGBT community ( which we purposefully skirted here as we are donning our science and description hats and not our policy and prescription caps ) .
This Darwinian puzzle , of course , is far from solved .
For instance , it is unclear how this tipping - point model applies to lesbianism .
The maintenance of homosexuality in the population is a 500 - piece puzzle and we might have some of the borders in place :
We 're not sure what the picture fully looks like , but we 're beginning to make out the parameters .
Future replications will confirm or disconfirm this model , and new hypotheses generated from the model will bolster or undermine the current work .
For example , one hypothesis that is generated from this model is that attractive men should be more likely to have gay sons than unattractive men .
Men generally viewed as attractive partners should carry more of the feminine - pulling alleles than unattractive men , thus making the former more likely to produce gay sons .
John Depp Jr.'s sexual orientation is yet unknown - the kid's only 7 - but you can bet that Johnny Sr. 's kindness , empathy , and tenderness will make for a fabulous father - son relationship .

Tamils demand national self - determination on May 1 , 2009 .
Photo by Peter Boyle .
By the Socialist Party of Malaysia ( Parti Sosialis Malaysia , PSM )
May 27 , 2009 -- Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared victory over Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) as the last LTTE strongpoints crumbled .
The victory is for no one but only the chauvinistic nationalist Sinhalese government led by Rajapaksa , which had launched a brutal , merciless and cold - blooded military offensive against the Tamil population for several months , inflicting nothing but death , destruction and misery .
The victory proclaimed by Rajapaksa will not put an end to the conflict that has lasted for several decades , but signals a new assault on working people in Sri Lanka -- Tamil , Sinhalese and Muslim .
The 26 - year protracted civil war was not to eradicate “ terrorism ” as claimed by the Sri Lankan government but to defend the power and privileges of the ruling Sinhalese elites .
While the LTTE ’s separatist program , which included attacks on Sinhalese civilians and ruthless suppression of Tamil opponents certainly deepened the communal divide and played into the hands of the most reactionary elements of the Colombo establishment , the responsibility for the war rests squarely on successive Sri Lankan governments , which exploited anti-Tamil chauvinism to divide and rule the working population on the island - nation .
Since the independence of Sri Lanka in 1948 , the Tamil minority has suffered systematic discrimination linguistically , culturally and economically .
Until 1970s , the Tamils of the north and the east of the island repeatedly demanded respect of their culture and fundamental rights , but all were unsuccessful because of the chauvinist attitude of Colombo establishment .
This has led to political radicalisation of Tamils and the emergence of a militant armed struggle and finally escalated into a civil war .
While we condemn any terrorist attack on civilians , we must also denounce all kinds of state terrorism like what Sri Lankan government has carried out over the last 26 years in the protracted civil war .
State terrorism fuels individual terrorism , when a class - based revolutionary movement is absent .
Like all other oppressed ethnic minorities around the world , the Tamils in Sri Lanka have every right to self - determination , and the struggle for the respect for Tamil rights and culture are pertinent .
There will be no real democracy and sustained peace if there is no respect for the rights of ethnic minorities .
For the last 26 years , the war in Sri Lanka has caused significant hardship for the population , environment and economy of the country , with over 80,000 people officially listed as killed during its course .
The Colombo regime had ruthlessly bombarded Tamil rebels and civilians .
In the first five months of 2009 , it was estimated 7000 - 8000 civilians were killed .
Hundreds of thousands of the Tamil population were forcibly moved and placed in detention camps where they were not allowed to leave .
Even after the “ end ” of the war , the Colombo government has refused to provide unrestricted access to its detention camps where at least 280,000 Tamil civilians are now being held in appalling conditions .
The so - called “ war against terrorism ” against the LTTE has served as a pretext to the chauvinist Rajapaksa regime to trample democratic freedoms , not only for the ethnic minorities of the country but of all citizens .
There has been massive discrimination , racialisation of everything , massive censorship , the murder of journalists in the south and anybody else who speaks up against Colombo ’s war policy .
The genocidal crimes committed by chauvinist government against Tamil population have been condoned and supported by Western imperialist powers like the United States and United Kingdom , as well as regional powers like India and China , all of them interested in gainimg more influence and control over the Indian Ocean .
The US has provided the Sri Lankan government with direct military aid through International Military Education and Training Program ( IMET ) and Foreign Military Financing ( FMF ) , as well as financial aid that enabled the Sri Lankan government to increase its military budget .
The US government also provided intelligence services to the Sri Lankan government in order to fight the so - called “ war on terrorism ” .
India has been assisting the chauvinist Colombo regime in suppressing Tamil rebels and civilians all the while .
China also served as an accomplice in the crimes against humanity committed by chauvinist Colombo government , by becoming its largest arm supplier .
The Chinese government even gave Rajapaksa ’s government six Jian - 7 jet fighters “ free of charge ” , to use in the cold - blooded assault against the Tamil population .
Beijing and Moscow repeatedly blocked discussion or any binding motion in the UN Security Council over Sri Lanka , just like Washington did on Palestine .
China and Russia also have tabled a counter - resolution in praising Colombo for winning a war against a “ terrorist group ” and calling for international funding for Sri Lanka .
It has shown again that all the imperialist powers and pro-capitalist governments care more about the interest and profit of the ruling class than the lives of ordinary people like the Tamils in Sri Lanka .
They are only interested in keeping the “ stability ” at the expense of the lives and democratic freedoms of ordinary people .
Only the people 's movement from below can reverse such policies in all these countries and put an end to the genocidal violence committed by chauvinist governments like the one in Sri Lanka .
The Socialist Party of Malaysia ( PSM ) calls for :
The immediate withdrawal of all Sri Lankan troops from the north and the east of Sri Lank .
Unrestricted access to all detention camps of Tamil , and that Tamil refugees be allowed to return to their homes in the north and the east .
Respect the right to self - determination of Tamils in Sri Lanka .
All governments , especially the US , UK , Indian and Chinese government , to stop providing military aid to the Sri Lankan armed forces .
Only with the recognition of the right to self - determination of the Tamil people , can there be a possible lasting solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka .
The PSM extends its solidarity to the Tamils in Sri Lanka as well as all the oppressed working people in Sri Lanka in their struggle against chauvinistic nationalist regime .

Vancouver has been named the world 's most livable city .
The Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) announced Monday that Vancouver is the best city in the world to live , followed by Vienna , Austria and Melbourne , Australia .
The EIU -- the business arm of the U.K. - based weekly economics magazine -- ranked the living conditions of 140 cities around the world based on five broad categories ; stability , healthcare , culture and environment , education , and infrastructure .
With a rating of 98 out of 100 , with one being " intolerable " and 100 being " ideal " , Vancouver topped the charts , " benefiting from strong Canadian infrastructure , " according to the study 's authors .
Harare , the capital city of Zimbabwe , was ranked the worst city in the world to live because of the " unfolding crisis . "
Two other Canadian cities , Toronto and Calgary , ranked in the top 10 .
Toronto ranked fourth , followed by Perth , Calgary , Helsinki , and Geneva .
Zurich and Sydney tied for ninth .
The study 's authors say the cities with the best scores usually tend to be mid-sized , are in developed countries with a low population density , and benefit from cultural or recreational availability .
These cities experience lower crime levels or infrastructure problems that can be caused by large populations .
EIU says the world 's worst cities to live in tend to be those in Africa and Asia with civil instability , poor infrastructure , and the threat of violence .
Out of the 140 cities ranked , 64 achieved scores of over 80 per cent , while 13 scored below 50 per cent .
As Ramon Huerta stood shirtless and shivering in the frontyard of the Pico Rivera house he ’s called home for more than four decades , the 64 - year - old retired chef struggled to comprehend the questions being shouted by the heavily armed police who began pounding on his front door some time before dawn .
Where are the guns , they wanted to know .
Where are the drugs ?
Huerta -- a soft - spoken grandfather who retired last year to care for his wife , who is battling colon cancer -- said he tried to tell them he did n’t know what they were talking about , that they had the wrong man .
Nonetheless , he was handcuffed and hauled away as part of a massive gang sweep last week that federal authorities touted as the largest of its kind in the nation .

Huerta would spend the next two nights in a federal lockup in downtown Los Angeles before authorities acknowledged that “ there exists the very real possibility ” that he is n’t the heroin dealer they were looking for .
He was released from custody on Saturday after inquires by The Times .
According to an indictment unsealed last week , a Ramon Huerta was identified as an alleged heroin dealer with connections to the Varrio Hawaiian Gardens street gang , which authorities began investigating four years ago after one its members murdered a Los Angeles County sheriff ’s deputy .
The indictment said the man was captured in wiretapped telephone conversations speaking in coded language about heroin and conspiring to sell the drug on several occasions .

A search warrant affidavit seeking permission to search the alleged drug dealer ’s residence described Huerta ’s Pico Rivera home in detail .
His house was raided early Thursday as part of the Hawaiian Gardens gang case , dubbed “ Operation Knock Out . ”
Thom Mrozek , a spokesman for the U.S. attorney ’s office , said officials now believe there had been a misidentification regarding Huerta and were “ continuing to look into ” how it occurred .
Prosecutors drove to a federal magistrate ’s home Saturday in order to have the charges dismissed , he said .
In an interview Sunday , Huerta sat surrounded by family members in his living room as he described the ordeal , which began some time between 4 and 5 a.m. last Thursday .
He said he and his wife , Myrna , 63 , were fast asleep when they heard a pounding on their metal security gate that was so forceful “ it felt like the whole house was shaking . ”

Dressed only in shorts , he went to the front door , thinking there must be some crisis in the neighborhood and the police were there to tell him what to do .
Instead , he said , they ordered him outside at gunpoint , cuffed his hands behind his back and began badgering him with questions .
Soon his wife was outside too , dressed only in her pajamas .
Her hands were not cuffed , the couple said , but when she asked to go to the bathroom some time later , a female officer escorted her into the restroom and stayed there while she relieved herself .
Huerta said the police ransacked the interior of the house and back patio , where he tends to his prized potted plants .
They also dug holes in the backyard .
He said he continually asked what they thought he had done wrong but got no answer .
Advertisement
“ To tell you the truth , they were rude , ” recalled Huerta , a gourmet chef who prepared such dishes as chateaubriand , chicken cordon bleu and lobster Thermidor while working at various restaurants , country clubs and upscale retirement homes .
He said he kept thinking to himself , “ how can you not see that I ’m not a criminal ? ”
After about half an hour , Huerta said , he was placed in a van and driven to various locations where other arrestees were put inside with him .
He was booked and eventually taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown L.A .

At a court hearing Friday afternoon , he said prosecutors sought to have him held without bail because they considered him a flight risk .
The judge set bail at $ 100,000 , he said .
The family coughed up $ 400 to get the bail bonds process started , but on the eve of the Memorial Day weekend , they were n’t expecting to see Huerta until today at the earliest .
Huerta , meanwhile , shuddered at the thought of spending a long weekend in jail .
“ I was scared to death , ” he said .
His first morning in custody he fell while trying to get down from the top bunk and split open his lip .
He asked for a doctor , he said , but was told he ’d have to wait .
Advertisement
On the plus side , he said , his age seemed to garner respect from his fellow inmates , who treated him nicely and gave him chocolate and coffee , which he could n’t buy because he had n’t been in long enough to go through the process that allows inmates to receive funds .
Though Huerta did n’t know it at the time , his daughter , Marianne , had set in motion a process that would secure his release .
She sent an e-mail to a Times reporter on Friday afternoon insisting that her father had been wrongfully arrested .
The reporter called the U.S. attorney ’s office , repeating the daughter ’s claim and asking whether prosecutors were sure they had the right man .
According to Mrozek , federal prosecutors and others “ worked late into the night Friday and on Saturday morning ” to determine whether Huerta had been falsely charged .
Once officials became concerned about the likelihood that he had , Mrozek said , “ we took immediate action to get him out of jail . ”
Advertisement
It was so fast , Huerta said , that he found himself standing on a street corner dressed in his jail - issue clothing as he waited for his family to pick him up .
He said he was told the clothes he was arrested in would n’t be available until Tuesday .
“ I told them to burn ‘em , ” he quipped .
Though Huerta did n’t seem particularly bitter about his experience , he said he ’s worried about what his neighbors will think .
“ I feel embarrassed to go outside , ” he said .

There ’s little doubt that a bra is an important support device , particularly for women with large breasts who may suffer serious discomfort and even pain otherwise .
However , wearing certain types of bras might not be in your best interest .
In fact , if you ’re in the habit of wearing the most popular styles , you may be setting yourself up for some potentially serious health problems .
Is Your Bra Helping or Harming Your Body ?
“ Over 85 percent of the lymph fluid flowing from the breast drains to the armpit lymph nodes .
Most of the rest drains to the nodes along the breast bone .
Bras and other external tight clothing can impede flow .
The nature of the bra , the tightness , and the length of time worn , will all influence the degree of blockage of lymphatic drainage .
Thus , wearing a bra might contribute to the development of breast cancer as a result of cutting off lymphatic drainage , so that toxic chemicals are trapped in the breast . ”
“ After repeated bouts of inflammation , the breasts develop scar tissue in many places , and some of the milk ducts become plugged , forming cysts .
Fibrocystic breast disease , not surprisingly , is associated with a higher risk of breast cancer [ 3 ] . “
“ These reflexes , like all acupuncture points , follow the Law of Stimulation .
In the beginning of stimulating a point , it is stimulated – often causing an increase in associated function .
Later on , this continued stimulation causes sedation of that point and a subsequent decrease in its associated function .
It ’s a mechanical thing .
If a woman keeps the metal underwires on top of those reflex points , over time that WILL mess up the functioning of the associated circuits : Liver , gallbladder , and stomach .
Bottom Line :
It will likely make her sick ; slowly and quietly . ”
There are several potential problems with bras .
And while some types of bras are worse than others , simply wearing an ill - fitting bra could spell trouble .
Many physicians and researchers now agree that wearing a tight fitting bra can cut off lymph drainage , which can contribute to the development of breast cancer , [ 1 ] as your body will be less able to excrete all the toxins you ’re exposed to on a daily basis .
Aluminum from antiperspirants , for example , is one potentially dangerous source of toxins that can accumulate if your lymph drainage is impaired .
Says Dr. Michael Schacter , M.D. in his article , The Prevention and Complementary Treatment of Breast Cancer [ 2 ] :
Constricting bras have also been implicated in the rise of benign ( non-cancerous ) but often painful breast cysts and lumps .
Says Dr. John McDougall , M.D. , in his book titled The McDougall Program for a Healthy Heart :
You can avoid some of the improper drainage issues if you wear a bra that is properly fitted .
Many , many women simply wear bras that do not fit .
The website Linda ’s Bra School offers plenty of guidance on proper bra fitting and can help you find a more appropriate bra style .
The Underwire Bra — A Cancer - Causing Device ?
But far worse for your health than tight or ill - fitting bras is the most popular type of all — the underwire bra .
It ’s important to realize that nearly all underwire bras contain metal underwires , coated with plastic .
And it is the metal that could ruin your long - term health .
In his 1975 article , Chinese Lessons For Modern Chiropractors , Dr. George Goodheart – known as “ the father of Applied Kinesiology ” — explained what he calls the “ Antenna Effect . ”
Essentially , he discovered that by taping a small metal ball over an acupuncture point , you could achieve longer - term stimulation to that point in question .
This discovery led to what are now known as AcuAids — small magnetic patches that are used by thousands of doctors across the world .
However , just like a small metal ball , any metal constantly applied to any given energy channel or point on your body can have the same stimulating effect .
As described by John D. Andre , D.C. , N.D. [ 4 ] , below your breasts are two important neuro - lymphatic reflex points .
The one below your right breast corresponds to your liver and gallbladder .
The one below your left breast goes to your stomach .
He goes on to say :
In addition to that , the metal wire can also act as an antenna attracting electromagnetic fields , which can also increase your risk of breast cancer .
Bra Wearers May Face Up to 125 - Fold Higher Cancer Risk
Women who wore their bras 24 hours per day had a 3 out of 4 chance of developing breast cancer
Women who wore bras more than 12 hour per day , but not to bed , had a 1 out of 7 risk
Women who wore their bras less than 12 hours per day had a 1 out of 52 risk
Women who wore bras rarely or never had a 1 out of 168 chance of getting breast cancer Medical anthropologists Sydney Singer and Soma Grismaijer — authors of Dressed to Kill : The Link Between Breast Cancer and Bras — conducted a study of over 4,000 women , and found that women who do not wear bras have a much lower risk of breast cancer . [ 5 ]
Their findings included :
The overall difference between women who wore their bras 24 - hours a day and those who did not wear bras at all was a 125 - fold difference .
Based on the results of this study , the link between bras and breast cancer is about three times greater than the link between cigarette smoking and cancer .
Singer and Grismaijer also found that about 90 percent of fibrocystic patients improve when they quit wearing bras .
I believe the results of this study are compelling , despite the fact that it was not a controlled study for other risk factors .
There are few solid studies on bra wearing and breast cancer , but research showing links between the two is not entirely nonexistent .
For example , one 1991 study , published in the European Journal of Cancer , found that premenopausal women who did not wear bras had half the risk of breast cancer compared with bra users . [ 6 ]
Another group of Japanese researchers discovered that wearing a girdle or bra can lower your levels of melatonin by 60 percent .
[ 7 ]
The hormone melatonin is intimately involved with the regulation of your sleep cycles , and numerous studies have shown that melatonin has anti-cancer activities .
[ 8 ]
It ’s also a powerful antioxidant , and can prevent DNA damage and bind to T - helper cells .
Furthermore , researchers in Spain published a study detailing the possible use of melatonin in breast cancer prevention and treatment . [ 9 ]

This week motor manufacturer Mitsubishi used the mainstream nature of file - sharing and P2P in order to promote its new Colt model .
Now , in what appears to be an upcoming marketing campaign by fast food giant Burger King , the famous beef grillers say that cheeseburgers are just like downloading free music from the Internet - but legal .
Taking advantage of the web ’s popularity and downloading in particular , this week Mitsubishi scattered virtual pieces of one of its new Colt cars around the Internet .
The first person to find all the components and reassemble them will receive a free and very real car , courtesy of the Japanese motor maker .
But you know what it ’s like – you wait for years for a P2P related advert , then two come along all at once .
In what appears to be a new marketing campaign by fast food giant Burger King , the company likens its cheeseburgers to piracy .
A scan of a promotional flyer sent to TorrentFreak says that BK ’s burgers are just like downloading music from the Internet , but better because they ’re “ legal ” .
Maybe i’m getting old , but I ca n’t in any way see how cheeseburgers are like downloading music off the Internet .
That said , if BK want to complete the analogy , I want their burgers leaked to file - sharing sites before their promotion starts , available 24/7 via The Pirate Bay , I want to be able to share this food with my friends ( and them with their friends ) without ever taking my hands off my ‘ copy ’ .
And I want my burger for free , if you do n’t mind .
Here ’s your chance to “ Have It Your Way® ” .
If any creative souls out there think they could create a better ( preferably funnier ) flyer for Burger King on the same theme , or feel they could tenuously refer to burgers ( or anything else ) in a campaign to promote file - sharing , feel free to send them to me on enigmax[@] torrentfreak.com and i’ll link the best into this post .

Mr. Bradbury frequently speaks at libraries across the state , and on Saturday he will make his way here for a benefit for the H. P. Wright Library , which like many others in the state ’s public system is in danger of shutting its doors because of budget cuts .
“ Libraries raised me , ” Mr. Bradbury said .
“ I do n’t believe in colleges and universities .
I believe in libraries because most students do n’t have any money .
When I graduated from high school , it was during the Depression and we had no money .
I could n’t go to college , so I went to the library three days a week for 10 years . ”
Property tax dollars , which provide most of the financing for libraries in Ventura County , have fallen precipitously , putting the library system roughly $ 650,000 in the hole .
Almost half of that amount is attributed to the H. P. Wright Library , which serves roughly two - thirds of this coastal city about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles .
In January the branch was told that unless it came up with $ 280,000 it would close .
The branch ’s private fund - raising group , San Buenaventura Friends of the Library , has until March to reach its goal ; so far it has raised $ 80,000 .
Enter Mr. Bradbury .
While at a meeting concerning the library , Berta Steele , vice president of the friends group , ran into Michael Kelly , a local artist who runs the Ray Bradbury Theater and Film Foundation , a group dedicated to arts and literacy advocacy .
Mr. Kelly told Ms. Steele that he could get Mr. Bradbury up to Ventura to help the library ’s cause .
Billy Mitchell was an iconoclastic American military airman from the early 20th century .
He was a firm believer in military air power and was ordered court - martialed in 1925 by President Calvin Coolidge for criticizing his military superiors over the issue .
My kind of guy .
Gary Cooper played Mitchell in a 1955 movie , by which time everyone knew he had been right all along .
My fear is that when it comes to cyber warfare there is no Billy Mitchell today in Washington .
Cyber warfare was big news last week .
President Obama said he would name a cyber warfare czar to be a single point of contact on the issue for his Administration and that person would have direct access to the President .
If only that were true , but it is n’t , and the U.S. will be endangered as a result .
Billy Mitchell ’s argument was that aircraft would come to play a huge role in modern warfare , supplanting battleships at sea and artillery on the ground .
Air power was so important , Mitchell argued , that there should be a single air service to develop and deploy aircraft as needed in any war .
This still has n’t fully happened , of course , though Mitchell ’s work did directly lead to the creation of the U.S. Air Force in 1947 — 22 years and one world war after his court - martial for suggesting it in the first place .
The problem with Obama ’s cyber czar is that the Administration is CALLING the position a priority but not MAKING it one .
The position has in some accounts been called a “ member ” of the National Security Council , but the czar is also said to “ report ” to both the Director of National Intelligence and to the President ’s Senior Economic Adviser .
Well you ca n’t be ON the council and also REPORT to those guys — one of whom is on the council and the other is allowed to drop in if he feels like it .
In short , this is an NSC staff job .
Obama said the czar would have “ direct access ” to him , but did n’t say how .
At best I think they ’ll pass in the corridor .
This is no czar .
That ’s literally the case , of course , because nobody has yet been hired for the job .
But it is also the case that the job will — as the NSC is organized — not have the power needed to do what must be done .
Czars are dictators ; this guy can only recommend and even then he ’ll be recommending to people who may not then bother to inform the President .
If the cyber warfare czar is , in fact , a czar , the first thing he or she should do is give himself a promotion , which wo n’t happen .
In the meantime there are competing interests at the Department of Defense , the National Security Agency , the CIA , the Department of Homeland Security , the Department of Justice , and possibly elsewhere .
Each of these agencies is building its own cyber warfare capability , each with a different agenda both stated and real .
The stated agendas are to play either cyber defense or offense .
The actual agendas are to protect departmental turf from the new cyber warfare czar , to undermine him or her .
Let ’s go back to Billy Mitchell for a moment and think about how the technology of aerial warfare came to be in his era .
Most of the military services developed their own air capability as lip service to the idea while actually protecting major — and antiquated — weapon systems .
The U.S. Navy bought some planes and built some aircraft carriers , but not at the expense of battleships .
Even when naval air power came to the fore during World War II it was almost an accident , since the only surviving capital ships in the Pacific after the attack on Pearl Harbor were aircraft carriers , the battleships having for the most part been destroyed .
So the Navy had to rely on air power since that ’s the only power it still had .
They were n’t smart at all , just lucky .
It is rare in U.S. military history for a technological innovation to come down on our side .
That ’s because as self - designated good guys we are generally playing defense and defense does n’t usually get the cool new toys .
It ’s only in the U.S. development of nuclear weapons that we got a jump on the rest of the world — a jump that put us firmly in control for half a century ( now past ) .
We are woefully unprepared for cyber warfare mainly because the military does n’t want to lose funding for its other weapons — weapons that are likely to be rendered unusable or , worse still , actually used against us in a cyber attack .
Yes , it is that bad .
The best position here is to make cyber warfare a real priority , give the cyber czar some actual authority , and have him or her report to the President .
Otherwise the lessons of Billy Mitchell will have been forgotten and our first cyber war could be our last .

A 3.3 m sea level rise will still have a devastating impact on coastal areas
The collapse of a major polar ice sheet will not raise global sea levels as much as previous projections suggest , a team of scientists has calculated .
Writing in Science , the researchers said that the demise of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet ( WAIS ) would result in a sea level rise of 3.3 m ( 10 ft ) .
Previous estimates had forecast a rise in the region of five to six metres .
However , they added , the rise would still pose a serious threat to major coastal cities , such as New York .
" Sea level rise is considered to be the one of the most serious consequence of climate change , " lead author Jonathan Bamber told the Science podcast .
" A sea level rise of just 1.5 m would displace 17 million people in Bangladesh alone , " he added .
" So it is of the utmost importance to understand the potential threats to coastlines and people living in coastal areas . "
Threat reassessed Professor Bamber , from the University of Bristol 's Glaciology Centre , said that the WAIS posed " potentially one of the most serious threats " .
The ebb and flow of sea level rise
The world has three ice sheets , Greenland , East Antarctica and West Antarctica , but it is the latter that is considered most vulnerable to climatic shifts .
" It has been hypothesised for more than 30 years now that the WAIS is inherently unstable , " he explained .
" This instability means that the ice sheet could potentially rapidly collapse or rapidly put a lot of ice into the oceans . "
When the idea first emerged in the late 1970s , it was estimated that global sea level would rise by five metres if the WAIS collapsed .
Current projections suggest that a complete collapse of WAIS would result in an increase of up to six metres .
But Professor Bamber said that no - one had revisited the calculation , despite new data sets becoming available , and scientists developing a better understanding of the dynamics in the vast ice sheets .
The original estimates were based on " very basic ice thickness data " , he explained .
" Ice thickness data gives you information about the depth of the bedrock underneath the ice sheet .
" Over the past 30 years , we have acquired much more ice thickness data over the whole of Antarctica , particularly over West Antarctica .
" We also have much better surface topography .
Those two data sets are critical in determining two things . "
The first was knowing the volume of ice that could contribute to sea level rise , and the second was a better understanding of the proportion of WAIS that was potentially susceptible to this instability .
Instead of assuming that the entire WAIS would collapse , causing sea level to rise by up to six metres , Professor Bamber and colleagues used models based on glaciological theory to simulate how the 2.2 million - cubic - km ice sheet would respond .
" Our reassessment of West Antarctica 's contribution to sea level rise if the ice sheet was to collapse is about 3.3 metres , " he said .
" That is about half of the value that has been quoted up until now . "
The team 's study also calculated what regions were likely to experience the biggest increases in sea level .
" Sea level rise is not uniform across the world 's oceans , partly as a result of disruptions to the Earth 's gravity field , " explained Professor Bamber .
" It turns out that the maximum increase in sea level rise is centred at a latitude of about 40 degrees along the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards of North America . "
This would include cities such as San Francisco and New York .
These areas could expect increases of one - and - a- quarter times the global average , the team estimated .
In other words , if the global average was one metre , then places like New York could expect to see a rise of 1.25 m .
Responding to Professor Bamber 's paper in Science , British Antarctic Survey science leader Dr David Vaughan described the findings as " quite sound " .
" But for me , the most crucial question is not solely about the total amount of ice in West Antarctica , because that might take several centuries to be lost to the ocean , " he told BBC News .
" The crucial question is how much ice could be lost in 100 - 200 years ; that 's the sea level rise we have to understand and plan for .
" Even with this new assessment the loss of a fraction of WAIS over those timescales would have serious consequences and costs that we 've only really just begun to understand . "

News !
My new book will be coming out in the spring !
It is about lesbians and dead moms and weird not - quite - dead creatures .
It is based on One Bloody Thing After Another .
Emily and I sometimes joke that A Softer World is mostly about lesbians , dead moms and zombies , and so at first that was how I referred to the book .
But it 's not really about zombies .
They 're just weird bloody violent creatures .
Also , youthful vandalism and vomiting ghosts and young love !
Spring ' 10 !
Also ,
My book Overqualified just had its third printing !
You guys are great .
Where would I be without such a lovely group of people crazy enough to enjoy my off - kilter nonsense ?
Off - kilter nonsense ?
Who talks like that ?
I 'm so sorry .
I 'm just sort of giddy because I sold my new book and I love you .
The Robbers Cave Experiment had as its subject 22 twelve - year - old boys , selected from 22 different schools in Oklahoma City , all doing well in school , all from stable middle - class Protestant families .
In short , the boys were as similar to each other as the experimenters could arrange , though none started out knowing any of the others .
The experiment , conducted in the aftermath of WWII , was meant to investigate conflicts between groups .
How would the scientists spark an intergroup conflict to investigate ?
Well , the first step was to divide the 22 boys into two groups of 11 campers -
- and that was quite sufficient .
There was hostility almost from the moment each group became aware of the other group 's existence .
Though they had not needed any name for themselves before , they named themselves the Eagles and the Rattlers .
After the researchers ( disguised as camp counselors ) instigated contests for prizes , rivalry reached a fever pitch and all traces of good sportsmanship disintegrated .
The Eagles stole the Rattlers ' flag and burned it ; the Rattlers raided the Eagles ' cabin and stole the blue jeans of the group leader and painted it orange and carried it as a flag the next day .
Each group developed a stereotype of itself and a contrasting stereotype of the opposing group ( though the boys had been initially selected to be as similar as possible ) .
The Rattlers swore heavily and regarded themselves as rough - and - tough .
The Eagles swore off swearing , and developed an image of themselves as proper - and - moral .
Consider , in this light , the episode of the Blues and the Greens in the days of Rome .
Since the time of the ancient Romans , and continuing into the era of Byzantium and the Roman Empire , the Roman populace had been divided into the warring Blue and Green factions .
Blues murdered Greens and Greens murdered Blues , despite all attempts at policing .
They died in single combats , in ambushes , in group battles , in riots .
From Procopius , History of the Wars , I :
In every city the population has been divided for a long time past into the Blue and the Green factions [...]
And they fight against their opponents knowing not for what end they imperil themselves [...]
So there grows up in them against their fellow men a hostility which has no cause , and at no time does it cease or disappear , for it gives place neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of friendship , and the case is the same even though those who differ with respect to these colours be brothers or any other kin .
Edward Gibbon , The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire :
The support of a faction became necessary to every candidate for civil or ecclesiastical honors .
Who were the Blues and the Greens ?
They were sports fans - the partisans of the blue and green chariot - racing teams .
It 's less surprising if you think of the Robbers Cave experiment .
Favorite - Team is us ; Rival - Team is them .
Nothing more is ever necessary to produce fanatic enthusiasms for Us and great hatreds of Them .
People pursue their sports allegiances with all the desperate energy of two hunter - gatherer bands lined up for battle - cheering as if their very life depended on it , because fifty thousand years ago , it did .
Evolutionary psychology produces strange echoes in time , as adaptations continue to execute long after they cease to maximize fitness .
Sex with condoms .
Taste buds still chasing sugar and fat .
Rioting basketball fans .
And so the fans of Favorite - Football - Team all praise their favorite players to the stars , and derogate the players on the Hated - Rival - Team .
We are the fans and players on the Favorite - Football - Team .
They are the fans and players from Hated - Rival - Team .
Those are the two opposing tribes , right ?
And yet the professional football players from Favorite - Team have a lot more in common with the professional football players from Rival - Team , than either has in common with the truck driver screaming cheers at the top of his lungs .
The professional football players live similar lives , undergo similar training regimens , move from one team to another .
They 're much more likely to hang out at the expensive hotel rooms of fellow football players , than share a drink with a truck driver in his rented trailer home .
Whether Favorite - Team or Rival - Team wins , it 's professional football players , not truck drivers , who get the girls , the spotlights , and above all the money : professional football players are paid a hell of a lot more than truck drivers .
Why are professional football players better paid than truck drivers ?
Because the truck driver divides the world into Favorite - Team and Rival - Team .
That 's what motivates him to buy the tickets and wear the T - Shirts .
The whole money - making system would fall apart if people started seeing the world in terms of Professional Football Players versus Spectators .
And I 'm not even objecting to professional football .
Group identification is pretty much the service provided by football players , and since that service can be provided to many people simultaneously , salaries are naturally competitive .
Fans pay for tickets voluntarily , and everyone knows the score .
It would be a very different matter if your beloved professional football players held over you the power of taxation and war , prison and death .
Then it might not be a good idea to lose yourself in the delicious rush of group identification .
Back in the good ol ' days , when knights were brave and peasants starved , there was little doubt that the government and the governed were distinct classes .
Everyone simply took for granted that this was the Natural Order of Things .
This era did not vanish in an instantaneous flash .
The Magna Carta did not challenge the obvious natural distinction between nobles and peasants - but it suggested the existence of a contract , a bargain , two sides at the table rather than one :
No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned , or be disseised of his Freehold , or Liberties , or free Customs , or be outlawed , or exiled , or any other wise destroyed ; nor will We not pass upon him , nor condemn him , but by lawful judgment of his Peers , or by the Law of the Land .
We will sell to no man , we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right .
England did not replace the House of Lords with the House of Commons , when the notion of an elected legislature was first being floated .
They both exist , side - by - side , to this day .
The American War of Independence did not begin as a revolt against the idea of kings , but rather a revolt against one king who had overstepped his authority and violated the compact .
And then someone suggested a really wild idea ...
From Decision in Philadelphia : The Constitutional Convention of 1787 :
[ The delegates to the Constitutional Convention ] had grown up believing in a somewhat different principle of government , the idea of the social contract , which said that government was a bargain between the rulers and the ruled .
The people , in essence , agreed to accept the overlordship of their kings and governors ; in return , the rulers agreed to respect certain rights of the people .
But as the debate progressed , a new concept of government began more and more to be tossed around .
It abandoned the whole idea of the contract between rulers and the ruled as the philosophic basis for the government .
It said instead that the power resided solely in the people , they could delegate as much as they wanted to , and withdraw it as they saw fit .
All members of the government , not just legislators , would represent the people .
The Constitution , then , was not a bargain between the people and whoever ran the new government , but a delegation of certain powers to the new government , which the people could revise whenever they wanted .
That was the theory .
But did it work in practice ?
In some ways , obviously it did work .
I mean , the Presidency of the United States does n't work like the monarchies of olden times , when the crown passed from father to son , or when a queen would succeed the king her husband .
But that 's not even the important question .
Forget that Congresspeople on both sides of the " divide " are more likely to be lawyers than truck drivers .
Forget that in training and in daily life , they have far more in common with each other than they do with a randomly selected US citizen from their own party .
Forget that they are more likely to hang out at each other 's expensive hotel rooms than drop by your own house .
Is there a political divide - a divide of policies and interests - between Professional Politicians on the one hand , and Voters on the other ?
Well , let me put it this way .
Suppose that you happen to be socially liberal , fiscally conservative .
Who would you vote for ?
Or simplify it further : Suppose that you 're a voter who prefers a smaller , less expensive government - should you vote Republican or Democratic ?
Or , lest I be accused of color favoritism , suppose that your voter preference is to get US troops out of Iraq .
Should you vote Democratic or Republican ?
One needs to be careful , at this point , to keep track of the distinction between marketing materials and historical records .
I 'm not asking which political party stands for the idea of smaller government - which football team has " Go go smaller government !
Go go go ! " as one of its cheers .
( Or " Troops out of Iraq ! Yay ! " )
Rather , over the last several decades , among Republican politicians and Democratic politicians , which group of Professional Politicians shrunk the government while it was in power ?
And by " shrunk " I mean " shrunk " .
If you 're suckered into an angry , shouting fight over whether Your Politicians or Their Politicians grew the government slightly less slowly , it means you 're not seeing the divide between Politicians and Voters .
There is n't a grand conspiracy to expand the government , but there 's an incentive for each individual politician to send pork to campaign contributors , or borrow today against tomorrow 's income .
And that creates a divide between the Politicians and the Voters , as a class , for reasons that have nothing to do with colors and slogans .
Imagine two football teams .
The Green team 's professional players shout the battle cry , " Cheaper tickets !
Cheaper tickets ! " as they rush into the game .
The Blue team 's professional players shout , " Better seating !
Better seating ! " as they move forward .
The Green Spectators likewise cry " Cheaper tickets ! " and the Blue Spectators of course cheer " Better seating ! "
And yet every year the price of tickets goes up , and the seats get harder and less comfortable .
The Blues win a football game , and a great explosion of " Better seating !
Better seating ! " rises to the heavens with great shouts of excitement and glory , and then the next year the cushions have been replaced by cold steel .
The Greens kick a long - range field goal , and the Green Spectators leap up and down and hug each other screaming " Cheaper tickets !
Hooray !
Cheaper tickets ! " and then tomorrow there 's a $ 5 cost increase .
It 's not that there 's a conspiracy .
No conspiracy is required .
Even dishonesty is not required - it 's so painful to have to lie consciously .
But somehow , after the Blue Professional Football Players have won the latest game , and they 're just about to install some new cushions , it occurs to them that they 'd rather be at home drinking a nice cold beer .
So they exchange a few furtive guilty looks , scurry home , and apologize to the Blue Spectators the next day .
As for the Blue Spectators catching on , that 's not very likely .
See , one of the cheers of the Green side is " Even if the Blues win , they wo n't install new seat cushions ! "
So if a Blue Spectator says , " Hey , Blue Players , we cheered real hard and you won the last game !
What 's up with the cold steel seats ? " all the other Blue Spectators will stare aghast and say , " Why are you calling a Green cheer ? "
And the lonely dissenter says , " No , you do n't understand , I 'm not cheering for the Greens .
I 'm pointing out , as a fellow Spectator with an interest in better seating , that the Professional Football Players who are allegedly on the Blue Spectators ' side have n't actually -"
" What do you mean ? " cry the Blue Spectators .
" Listen !
You can hear the Players calling it now !
' Better seating !'
It resounds from the rafters - how can you say our Players are n't true Blue ?
Do you want the Green Players to win ?
You - you 're betraying Our Team by criticizing Our Players ! "
This is what I mean by the " two - party swindle " .
Once a politician gets you to identify with them , they pretty much own you .
There does n't have to be a conscious , collaborative effort by Your Politicians and Their Politicians to keep the Voters screaming at each other , so that they do n't notice the increasing gap between the Voters and the Politicians .
There does n't have to be a conspiracy .
It emerges from the interests of the individual politicians in getting you to identify with them instead of judging them .
The problem dates back to olden times .
Commoners identifying with kings was one of the great supports of the monarchy .
The commoners in France and England alike might be cold and starving .
And the kings of France and England alike might be living in a palace , drinking from golden cups .
But hey , the King of England is our king , right ?
His glory is our glory ?
Long live King Henry the Whatever !
But as soon as you managed to take an emotional step back , started to think of your king as a contractor - rather than cheering for him because of the country he symbolized - you started to notice that the king was n't a very good employee .
And I dare say the Big Mess is not likely to be cleaned up , until the Republifans and Demofans realize that in many ways they have more in common with other Voters than with " their " Politicians ; or , at the very least , stop enthusiastically cheering for rich lawyers because they wear certain colors , and begin judging them as employees severely derelict in their duties .
Until then , the wheel will turn , one sector rising and one sector falling , with a great tumult of lamentation and cheers - and turn again , with uninhibited cries of joy or apprehension - turn again and again , and not go anywhere .
Getting emotional over politics as though it were a sports game - identifying with one color and screaming cheers for them , while heaping abuse on the other color 's fans - is a very good thing for the Professional Players '
Team ; not so much for Team Voters .

Could it be sheer coincidence that the murderous attack on the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC on Wednesday by James W. von Brunn , an anti-Semitic Christian terrorist , occurred scarcely a week after an attack on a Wichita health clinic that performed abortions ?
Perhaps .
Though it is also possible that these incidents , and a host of other threats in recent months , are the violent fringe of a new wave of religiously - motivated violence that might rival America ’s Christian terrorism of the 1990s .
If , as it seems , Scott Roeder was indeed the culprit behind the ghastly killing of Dr. George Tiller last week in a Wichita church , the attack raises the possibility of the beginning of a new wave of Christian terrorism in the Obama era .
Ruby Ridge and other incidents in the 1990s culminated with the Oklahoma City Federal Building bombing , an event so horrendous that it seems to have sobered the radicalism of many Christian militia members .
Then came the eight - year reign of President George W. Bush who voiced his support for anti-abortion activists and gave the impression that they had a friend in the White House .
The violence abated .
All this may now be changing .
A new president is vilified in the right - wing press not only as pro-abortion but as a demonic figure .
The image is one of desperation : that the moral authority of the country has been taken captive by an evil enemy .
This has the effect of giving moral license to an image of cosmic war , goading the violent urges of some of the most extreme of the Christian activists , whose world view is a melange of millenarianism and anti-abortion adventurism .
Scott Roeder ’s religio- political stance is a disturbing example of the revival of this 90s - era Christian terrorism .
Though Roeder has been identified with the right - wing Freeman movement , he is also closely related to one of the 1990s most vicious Christian extremist groups , the Army of God [ warning : while this link leads only to the Wikipedia page , should you then decide to click through to the AOG website please note that it can be very disturbing ] .
Roeder has been associated with the movement for some years , and his actions — such as pouring glue into the locks of clinics that perform abortions — are straight out of the Army of God Manual , said to have been authored by Rev. Michael Bray , the Army ’s “ chaplain . ”
Last week , soon after Roeder ’s attack on Dr. Tiller , Bray wrote a publicly - published letter to Roeder , declaring that the assassin had acted in “ righteousness and mercy . ”
Bray went on to praise Roeder for following the commandments of God as he “ sought to deliver the innocents from the knife of a baby murderer . ”
Bray is the author of A Time to Kill , the 1990s booklet that gave a theological justification for anti-abortion activism .
One of Bray ’s best friends , Rev. Paul Hill , was a Presbyterian pastor who killed several staff members of a Pensacola , Florida clinic that performed abortions .
Hill was convicted by the State of Florida , sentenced to the death penalty , and recently executed for his crime .
Bray himself served prison time for a lesser offense , bombing several abortion - related clinics on the Eastern seaboard .
Some years ago I interviewed Bray at his home in Bowie , Maryland [ see Terror in the Mind of God , UC Press , 2003 ] .
What I found was a likeable Lutheran pastor with a solid theological background whose worldview was much more sophisticated than simply an anti-abortion stance .
Bray saw society at the brink of economic and moral decay , and envisioned a radical revolution that would usher in a Christian world order .
According to Bray , Americans live in a situation “ comparable to Nazi Germany , ” a state of hidden warfare , as the comforts of modern society have lulled the populace into apathy .
Bray was convinced that a dramatic event , such as economic collapse or social chaos would reveal the demonic role of the government , and people would have “ the strength and the zeal to take up arms ” in a revolutionary struggle .
What he envisioned as the outcome of that struggle was the establishment of a new moral order in America , one based on biblical law and a spiritual , rather than a secular , social compact .
Until this new moral order is established , Bray said , he and others like him who are aware of what is going on and have the moral courage to resist it are compelled to take action .
According to Bray , Christianity gave him the right to defend innocent “ unborn children , ” even by use of force , whether it involves “ destroying the facilities that they are regularly killed in , or taking the life of one who is murdering them . ”
By the latter , Bray meant killing doctors and other clinical staff involved in performing abortions .
Bray defended the 1994 actions of his friend , Rev. Paul Hill , in killing Dr. John Britton and his escort .
Bray ’s theological justifications were echoed by Hill himself .
“ You may wonder what it is like to have killed an abortionist and his escort , ” Hill wrote to Bray and his other supporters after the killings .
“ My eyes were opened to the enormous impact ” such an event would have , he wrote , adding that “ the effect would be incalculable . ”
Hill said that he opened his Bible and found sustenance in Psalms 91 : “ You will not be afraid of the terror by night , or of the arrow that flies by day . ” [ NAS Bible ] .
Hill interpreted this as an affirmation that his act was biblically approved .
When I suggested to Bray that carrying out such violent actions is tantamount to acting as both judge and executioner , Bray demurred .
Although he did not deny that a religious authority has the right to pronounce judgment over those who broke the moral law , he explained that attacks on abortion clinics and the killing of abortion doctors were essentially defensive rather than punitive acts .
According to Bray , “ there is a difference between taking a retired abortionist and executing him , and killing a practicing abortionist who is regularly killing babies . ”
The first act is in Bray ’s view retributive , the second defensive .
According to Bray , the attacks were aimed not so much at punishing clinics and abortionists for their actions as at preventing them from “ killing babies , ” as Bray put it .
He was careful to say that he did not advocate the use of violence , but morally approved of it in some instances .
He was “ pro-choice , ” as he put it , regarding its use .
Bray found support for his position in actions undertaken during the Nazi regime in Europe .
His moral exemplar in this regard was the German theologian and Lutheran pastor , Dietrich Bonhoeffer , who abruptly terminated his privileged research position at Union Theological Seminary in New York City to return to Germany and clandestinely join a plot to assassinate Hitler .
Bray also cited Reinhold Niebuhr , one of the greatest Protestant theologians of the twentieth century .
Niebuhr began his career as a pacifist , but in time he grudgingly began to accept the position that a Christian , acting for the sake of justice , could use a limited amount of coercive force .
Once again Christian theological arguments are being advanced to support the most lethal acts of terrorism .
In the imaginations of Scott Roeder , James W. von Brunn , and Michael Bray , they are soldiers in an awesome war , a grand struggle between the forces of good and the reign of evil — now incarnate in the Obama era of liberal society .
Their positions might be taken as poignant reminders of the past if they were not so vividly in the present , and so gruesomely destructive .
I guess they rent those suits by the hour .

This is again the projection of a worst - case scenario that does not take into account containment efforts .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Large - scale computer simulations run by Northwestern University researchers show worst - case scenario projections of approximately 1,700 cases of swine flu for the entire United States four weeks from now .
Associate Professor Dirk Brockmann and his research group have found that the major areas projected to have incidents in the worst - case scenario include California , Texas and Florida .
Worst - case scenario means that no measures have been taken to combat the spread of disease .
These numbers would , of course , be lessened by preventive measures already under way .
Under the worst - case scenario , more than 100 cases are projected for the Chicago area .
The affected locations largely correspond to major transportation hubs in the country .
The researchers also will be running simulations on the possible time course of the spread of swine flu in Europe .
The video depicts a four week projection of the time course of a simulated swine flu epidemic .
Brockmann says their swine flu results are in excellent agreement to those of a research group at Indiana University led by Alex Vespignani that is using a different method .
“ The Indiana group uses a different computational approach , and the agreement of our results is promising and an indicator of reliability in both methods , ” says Brockmann , associate professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science .
Brockmann and his doctoral students Christian Thiemann , Rafael Brune and Alejandro Morales - Gallardo are constantly updating the simulation , taking into account new information on confirmed cases and more precise information on transmissibility and disease - specific parameters .
Brockmann has extensive experience modeling the spread of disease .
His high - performance computer clusters can be used to simulate an infectious disease that spreads among 300 million people .
“ We can , on a very realistic scale , try to model an epidemic that has the same size as a real epidemic , ” he says .
In order to understand how disease travels , Brockmann also must understand human transportation networks .
“ These networks play an important role in the spread of infectious disease , ” he says .
“ So we ’re looking at how people travel in the United States and Europe and trying to find a theory behind human traffic .
Then we can unravel the structures within these networks and explain them . ”
Health officials around the world continue to search for the origins of a recent outbreak of swine flu that appears to be centered in Mexico .
Robert Lamb , professor of molecular and cell biology at Northwestern University , is an internationally recognized authority on the influenza virus and discusses the current outbreak .
One way to track how people travel is to monitor how money travels .
In a 2006 study , Brockmann used data from WheresGeorge.com -- a site where users enter the serial numbers from their dollar bills in order to track their travels -- to create a model to predict the probability of a bill staying within a 10 - kilometer radius over time .
From that information , Brockmann found a key factor in his disease - spread modeling approach : very accurate datasets on human mobility .
This multi-scale human mobility network included small - scale daily commuting traffic , intermediate traffic and long - distance air travel , which helps determine how a disease could potentially spread .
Brockmann and his research group also have created a map of community boundaries in the United States based on human mobility , rather than the usual state - line boundaries of rivers , mountain ranges or administrative lines .
The map shows that some states , like Missouri , are essentially cut in half -- likely due to two large cities that lie on either side of the state .
Other boundaries are islands in the middle of states , as is the case with Santa Fe , New Mexico .
“ These boundaries might be better suited for developing mitigation strategies against epidemics , ” Brockmann says .
“ We ’re working on creating a similar map for Europe . ”
For his work , Brockmann collaborates with linguists , epidemiologists , ecologists and other scientists from around the world .
He is motivated by results that could potentially be useful for humanity .
“ I want to do work that is important , that involves pressing matters , ” he says .
“ It motivates me to do research on complex systems that will eventually improve life . ”

I 've been interested in the Atonement for a long time .
Basic to Christian belief is the idea that because Christ died , my sins are forgiven and I am reconciled to God .
How exactly this occurs is not spelled out - and the New Testament uses different metaphors to describe the work of atonement .
Most modern evangelical thought has tended to emphasis just one of these metaphors .
For many evangelical Christians atonement = Penal Substitution .
The famous Four Spiritual Laws tract explains that sin separates man from God and " ... that God has bridged the gulf which separates us from Him by sending His Son , Jesus Christ , to die on the cross in our place to pay the penalty for our sins . "
This is the Judicial metaphor and it is usually tightly connected to the concept of Justification : sin is transgression of God 's moral law , God as Judge demands the penalty of death ( Romans 6:23 the wages of sin is death ) and Jesus offers his own death as satisfaction of the penalty guilty humanity owes .
God as Judge than dismisses the charges against us since the penalty has been paid in full .
I did n't grow up opposed to the idea of Penal Substitution , it just always seemed ... insufficient .
If Penal Substitution is the wholly sufficient explanation for our atonement and justification , what are we to do with Scriptures like
Hebrews 2:14 -15 14
Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood , he also himself likewise took part of the same ; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death , that is , the devil ; 15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage .
or
Colossians 2:13
And you , being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh , He has made alive together with Him , having forgiven you all trespasses , 14 having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us , which was contrary to us .
And He has taken it out of the way , having nailed it to the cross .
15 Having disarmed principalities and powers ,
He made a public spectacle of them , triumphing over them in it .
Clearly these passages are not using the sort of language that fits into a judicial model .
But I did n't know exactly what to make of them until I bumped into the term Christus Victor .
Thanks to an article by Derek Flood at sharktacos.com ( very highly recommended ) I began to have a vocabulary to identify the drama described in Scriptures where the Atonement is the victory of Jesus through his death and resurrection over the powers that oppress us and keep us separated from God.
Christ the Victor !
The result for me of identifying the Christus Victor model in the New Testament has n't been to challenge the Penal Substitution model as much as to emphasize the mystery at the heart of the atonement cannot be neatly packaged - the New Testament has a variety of models and metaphors to describe the atonement and each has it's contributions to make to our understanding and experience of the Christian life .
I 've several times done a " multiple metaphors of the atonement " style class or Biblestudy - looking at the Priestly / Sacrificicial , Financial / Ransom , Juridical / Justification , and Military / Victory metaphors for the atonement .
But recent reading has left me wondering if perhaps the language we use to understand the atonement plays a decisive more role in determining our life in Christ .
I recently got around to reading Christus Victor - the 1931 work by Gustaf Aulen who coined the term .
Christus Victor is basically a polemic survey of the various theological takes on the atonement with the assertion that the chief view of the atonement in the New Testament and Patristic writings has been lost since Anselm and Abelard and we 've been left with the " objective " and " subjective " theories of atonement presented as the only choices .
( briefly : " objective " atonement sees the passion as directed towards God ; Penal Substitution or Satisfaction falls under this rubric .
" Subjective " theories tend to see the atonement as aimed at humanity ; the " Moral Influence " theory of atonement which sees Jesus sinless death as example of God 's love to us .
Presented with those two choices , of course , evangelicals rightly tend to gravitate towards the Objective theories .
Aulen thinks this is a false choice and calls the narrative / dramatic account of victory over opposing powers to earn humanity 's freedom from sin , death and hell the " Classic Theory " of atonement . )
I can't do justice to Aulen 's arguments in this space ( and really - if you 're interested you should just go read the essay at sharktacos ) .
Most interesting to me , however , were the observations that over and against Penal Substitution , Christus Victor takes into account the enemy ( Satisfaction , for instance , needs no devil ; God is sinned against , God demands Payment for sin ) , the incarnation and Jesus life of obedience , and the resurrection itself which is the capstone of Christ 's Victory but seems somewhat inessential ( besides being a note of Divine approval ) in most atonement theology .
It also suceeds in capturing the ambivalent nature of the operation of the Law in Scripture - blessed because it is true but ultimately against us and our opponent ( among the powers defeated by Christ ) because it cannot lead us into fellowship with God.
Penal Substitution , despite being strongly associated with the reformation takes a legalistic view in which the Law 's demands are immutable and cannot be broken - God will not forgive us without satisfying the demands of the Law .
I have always wondered what the Penal Substitutionary model makes of Jesus ' profligacy in forgiveness of sins .
To the paralytic , the woman caught in adultery , the prostitute who washed Jesus feet with her tears , the thief on cross - Jesus extends forgiveness of sins without worrying about the demands of the Law .
Aulen also takes an interesting tour from the Patristic Fathers , through Medieval commentators and onto the Reformation , arguing most interestingly that Luther 's atonement theory was mostly of the " Classic " type though largely misunderstood by his contemporaries and heirs .
The historical treatment was mostly new to me ( I have n't read much Anselm or Abelard . or Luther , for that matter ) and a fairly convincing explanation of how penal substitution grew out of a medieval legal backdrop ( concepts like penance and indulgences fit right into the western concept of justice ) .
Fresh on the heels of Christus Victor I got around to reading a gift from my sister - in - law : Joel B. Green and Mark Baker 's Recovering the Scandal of the Cross ( Joel is one of her Professors at Fuller ) .
Recovering the Scandal ... is a little less straightforward - in part it is also a critique of the dominant Penal Substitution model but it 's purpose is not so much to replace it with another model as it is to emphasise the necessity and desirability of having multiple models for the atonement .
Green & Baker also provide a historical tour of atonement theology that covers some of the same ground .
They review the language of the New Testament in regards to salvation and atonement and agree with Aulen that the Christus Victor best characterizes the Patristic writings ( with a few variations ) .
They also cover Anselm and Abelard and use Princeton Seminarian Charles Hodges as an expounder of Penal Substitution from the 20th century .
Most interestingly , however , they move from a critique of existing models to relating several attempts at contextualizing the Good News of Christ 's atoning work in models that communicate to a particular .
The Penal Substitution Model makes assumptions about the concepts of justice , punishment , guilt , and satisfaction that are only coherent within western cultural understandings .
In Japan , for example , the judiciary operates under a shame / alienation framework that seems strange to western minds .
Justice , in the west , is exemplified by the blind ( and therefore impartial ) goddess Justicia with scales and sword in either hand .
Japanese culture as related by Norman Kraus , a missionary teaching theology in Japan in the early 80's , sees justice as the wise decision made by judges having taken into account the context and rendering the decision that will best preserve relationships in the community .
Because shame , rather than guilt , is the primary cultural deterrent the ideas of forgiveness and propitiation as communicated by Penal Substitution do not resonate with Japanese culture .
Clearly Biblical truths should not be cast aside in order to conform to human culture .
As Green & Baker point out , however , emphasizing the sense of sin as alienation from God and the atonement as Jesus entering into shame and dishonor in order to reconcile and restore us to God not only communicated meaningfully within Japanese contexts , it may also be closer to the scriptural depiction of the atonement as well !
After all , the cultures in which the texts of the Old and New Testaments were written were also shame / honor cultures as well .
While I found the other attempts at contextualizing the meaning of the Atonement less successful , it was stimulating to think about how we can best communicate the mystery of the work of Christ in comprehensible ways .
All metaphors break down at some point ( if Christ effected a Ransom , to whom was the price paid ?
If it was Satisfaction of the Law 's demands is God bound by the Law ?
Or did Jesus come to save us from God ? )
All we can do is resort to narrative and metaphor to explain the atonement .
Not every metaphor is equally powerful or explicative but some do have the virtue of communicating in the " native language " , so to speak , of a particular cultural group ( I 've been thinking , for instance , about Jesus as Trickster to communicate to the hacker / geek subculture I partially inhabit .
The trickster ( in the jungian archetype sense ) is much revered in hacker culture ( as embodied by words like " hack " ) .
And Jesus ' subversive relationship to the religious / political power structure of His day as well as the unexpected quality of His victory ( achieved by submission to torture and death ) and his upside - down Kingdom could communicate within this particular subculture in ways communication along the Penal Substitution lines cannot .
In fact - following Gregory of Nyssa 's imagery of Christ as a baited hook proffered to Evil , the Godhead concealed in humanity , Life swallowed by death which cannot contain it - the act of the Atonement might be classified as a clever hack .
This will doubtless be seen as a sacrilegious characterization outside of hacker circles .
Besides being encouraged to think about how to think about the atonement Recovering the Scandal ... also had the salutary effect of challenging my acceptance of the exclusive use of Penal Substitution language .
About halfway through the book I became increasingly aware of my uncomfortableness with their polemic against Penal Substitution .
For example :
Hodge 's penal substitution model takes sin very seriously in that it presents sin as a huge barrier between God and humans .
Yet it is a limited concept of sin that portrays it only in terms of moral failure or transgression of a law .
Even within that concept of sin , however , the model does not intersect with the day - to - day reality of actual people .
Describing the atonement as a legal transaction within the Godhead removes it from the historical world in which we live and leaves it unconnected to personal or social reconciliation .
And in actuality it only addresses our reconciliation with God at an abstract level .
That is to say , it is so objective , so outside of us ( and in a sense outside of God ) that what changes through the cross is a legal ruling .
According to the logic of the model , an individual could be saved through penal substitution without experiencing a fundamental reorientation of his or her life .
Ethically this model has little to offer p149
Should we be doing theology on this sort of ends - oriented basis ?
Surely as exegetes the question to grapple with is " what does the text communicate " , not " how will this work out " .
And it is undeniable that the concept of Satisfaction is in the Bible and in places hints at a Penal understanding ( Isaiah 53 , for example ) .
It was n't until I had moved on to other reading that I realized I had the ends - analysis exactly backwards .
J. Denny Weaver , contributing to Anabaptist Currents analyzed the ways in which atonement theology contributes ( or fails ) to ecclesiology .
One key statement stuck out to me :
The doctrine of substitutionary atonement allows the same kind of substitution to occur in the area of theology .
Defining salvation in terms of escape from guilt and deserved penalty - a legal transaction with God - provides a theological way to talk about salvation apart from considerations of discipleship , nonresistance , and love of enemies .
It thus enables and reinforces an understanding of salvation that is separate from ethics .
p35 , The Church , Pietism and Nonresistance
Perhaps my question needs to be reversed .
Is it possible that the Church in the West has selected Penal Substitution as the primary means of understanding the atonement precisely because it does lack an ethical dimension ?
Jesus came to preach the Kingdom of God the synoptic Gospels agree , and yet western Churches and western theology sees the Kingdom and discipleship as an optional add - on ( at best ) to the core message of Salvation ( always understood in a juridical sense ) .
Salvation as a legal transaction does allow us to do away with or render optional ecclesiology , discipleship , and ethics .
But for the purposes of much of the Church this has been a feature , not a bug , which allows a Christianity neutered down to become a private transaction which need not affect the present .
Phrased like that it seems to me that a primary task of recovering the New Testament vision of the Christian life is to reject with prejudice exclusive claims for penal substitution and assert the diversity of Biblical language and atonement models ( with all their implications for salvation ) .

The scoopers , who also handle cat , goose and deer waste , typically place it in plastic bags and , depending on local ordinances , dump it in the homeowner ’s trash or drop it off at local landfills or incinerators .
Their growing popularity parallels that of styling boutiques and travel services that have sprung up to help Americans spend about $ 45 billion on their pets each year .
Image Mr. Patterson cleans up after Daisy , Lashelle and Mark Daviss white German shepherd , at their West Harrison home .
Credit ... James Estrin / The New York Times
Mr. Sichler said he and his wife ran a pet - food delivery business in the late ’90s and got into waste removal in 2001 after an epiphany : “ We hated cleaning up after our own dogs , and we wondered if other people hated it as much and would pay someone else to do it . ”
The latest survey by the American Pet Products Association estimated that in 2008 , Americans owned 94 million cats and 78 million dogs .
There were pets in 71 million households , or 62 percent of all homes  up from 56 percent in 1988 .
Enter the scoopers , which Cheresee Rehart , the president of their professional association , said range from “ a guy completely happy with 20 customers ” and an income of $ 30,000 a year to multimillion - dollar chains with franchises .
The service Mrs. Davis uses is DoodyCalls , a Virginia company founded in 2004 that now operates from 42 sites in 21 states .
Its Web site proclaims : “ Woof - woof waste does not a good fertilizer make .
It is actually toxic to your lawn . ”
But for harried customers , convenience trumps all other incentives .
“ We sell time , ” said the company ’s founder , Jacob D’Aniello , 32 , a former technology consultant .
One customer , Kevin Durkin , 50 , a stay - at - home father of two in the Westchester hamlet of Katonah , said it fell to him to retrieve the waste produced by his black Labrador , Savannah , until he spotted a DoodyCalls ad and signed up for the service this spring .
“ It ’s just something else I do n’t have to take care of , ” he said on a recent Monday morning as he watched Mr. Patterson , his DoodyCalls “ technician , ” traverse the lawn in a grid pattern .
“ Go through the flower beds , too ! ” Mr. Durkin shouted from the porch .
Mr. Patterson , 26 , whose previous job was stocking supermarket shelves , said his fiancée laughed when she first heard about his new vocation .
But he said he enjoys working outside and makes sure he uses a long - handled scoop to keep a safe distance from the waste .
He is one of five scoopers employed by the franchise , earning about $ 15 an hour .
Update :
The initial version of this post said that RapidShare had been fined € 24 million .
Another look at GEMA 's press release says that the group won a case against RapidShare " worth € 24 million , " but this appears to refer to the value of the songs in question , not to an actual damage award .
We blame Google Translate and some really poor German classes for the confusion .
Thanks to readers for pointing this out .
Story : German music trade group GEMA has won a court judgment against one - click file - sharing service RapidShare , and the Hamburg Regional Court has confirmed that services like RapidShare must implement proactive content filtering to avoid liability .
The decision has been building for more than a year .
GEMA went after RapidShare after it became a popular hub for sharing albums online , and in relative safety .
In January 2008 , another regional court in D�sseldorf found that RapidShare was responsible for what its users uploaded to the service .
So RapidShare implemented a screening process — six full - time staff members vetted content and dealt with infringement complaints , and RapidShare maintained hashes of all files that were pulled down for infringement .
Using the hashes , the site would prevent repeat uploads of identical content , though any alteration in the file would render the hash technique useless .
This was n't good enough for GEMA , which went back to court .
In October 2008 , a court found that the these systems were n't robust enough and said that " a business model that does n't use common methods of prevention cannot claim the protection of the law . "
This week , GEMA won yet again ( German ) , securing a court order absolutely requiring RapidShare to block 5,000 songs represented by GEMA .
In GEMA 's view , this is all to the good ; the court decisions of the last few years mean that GEMA and other rightsholders can go after the hosting and intermediary companies without having to sue end users instead .
Dr. Harald Heker , the boss of GEMA , said in a statement that " the decision of the Landgericht Hamburg [ Hamburg Regional Court ] is a milestone in GEMA 's fight against the illegal use of musical works on the Internet .
GEMA will continue to protect its members from online piracy .
We are confident that we can reduce the illegal usage of GEMA 's repertoire on the Internet to negligible levels . "
The decision appears wide - reaching in its effect ; user - generated content sites located in Germany will need to take proactive measures to screen copyrighted material , and those measures had better be effective .
The first accredited Islamic college in the US is being planned by an influential Muslim body hoping to produce " a generation of indigenised scholars " .
The management committee from the Zaytuna Institute , which is dedicated to classical Muslim scholarship , last week recommended launching Zaytuna College in autumn 2010 .
The board of trustees is expected to vote on it later this month .
The college would be open to men , women , Muslims and non-Muslims , and would be on a level comparable to the best religious seminaries and higher education institutions in the US , the brochure says .
The initiative , described as a " Muslim Georgetown " , is backed by widely respected Islamic scholars and clerics across the world , who argue there is a need for institutions that can wed religious texts to a contemporary context .
There are thought to be about seven million Muslims in the US , and in Cairo last Thursday , President Barack Obama noted that Islam had " always been a part of America 's story " .
" They have fought in our wars , served in government , they have stood for civil rights , they have started businesses , they have taught at our universities , they have excelled in our sports arenas , they have won Nobel prizes , built our tallest building , and lit the Olympic torch . "
Every state had a mosque and there were more than 1,200 mosques within the country 's borders , Obama said , before adding : " Let there be no doubt , Islam is a part of America . "
Imam Zaid Shakir , scholar in residence at the Zaytuna Institute , said : " We 're an expanding Muslim community in North America and we do n't have any seminary or college that is endeavouring to produce a generation of indigenised scholars .
" Non-Muslims are free to study here .
We are not a closed society or a secretive one .
Our goal is to have a 50/50 gender split in the student body .
We 're talking about a generation of American Muslim scholars , period . "
His key concerns , shared by others at Zaytuna , are that there are few scholars who can meet the religious and pastoral needs of the west 's Muslim community and that much of the younger generation has become alienated from the mosque and the religious culture .
Students on the bachelor programme will study the Qur'an , jurisprudence , legal theory , theology , hadith science , Islamic spirituality and Arabic .
There will also be an emphasis on studying history , literature , philosophy , political science and economics and sociology .
The brochure states : " We see no dichotomy between what is called ' secular ' and ' religious ' in the modern world .
We believe our students will be able to contextualise Islamic knowledge in a dynamic and productive way . "
Shakir , an African - American air force veteran who converted to Islam in the 1970s , studied in Syria and Morocco .
It is hoped that by obtaining accreditation – a process that can take up to seven years – Zaytuna college will offer a local alternative to those who are thinking of studying overseas .
It has even been suggested that its classes in Islamic studies will rival those offered at places such as Yale and Stanford .
" We want to be recognised by Al - Azhar [ an eminent centre of cultural and religious teaching in Cairo ] and other educational institutions in the US , " he said .
The initial enrolment will comprise 30 students , with up to 50 students added each year .
The operating budget is forecast at $ 3 m for the first year .
The biggest financial overheads will come with the creation of a $ 30 m endowment and $ 20 m for property purchasing .
The college will , for a while , work out of rented buildings .

The original said that Barack Obama had given a speech at Al - Azhar .
He spoke at Cairo University .

This walking gel inches along like a looper caterpillar
A chemical gel that can walk like an inchworm , or looper caterpillar has been demonstrated in a Japanese robotics lab .
The video above shows the material in action .
It was created in the Shuji Hashimoto applied physics laboratory at Waseda University , Tokyo .
Shingo Maeda and colleagues made the colour - changing , motile gel by combining polymers that change in size depending on their chemical environment .
This is based on an oscillating chemical reaction called the Belousov–Zhabotinsky ( BZ ) reaction .
The result is an autonomous material that moves without electronic stimulation .
The BZ reaction is one of a class of chemical systems in which the concentration of one or more compounds periodically increases and decreases .
As well as producing stunning patterns ( video ) , it can even be used to perform calculations using a dish containing the pulsing patterns as a chemical brain .

Force amplifier
Polymers used in the gel shrink and grow in response to ruthenium bipyridine ions , alternately losing and gaining electrons in the cyclical reaction .
That effect has been known for some time , but has n’t been used to make a self - locomoting material on such a scale before , says Maeda .
“ In previous work , the displacement of the mechanical oscillation of the gel was very small in comparison with the gel size , ” he told New Scientist .
Maeda and colleagues created a gel that magnifies the small changes in size by building tension into it .
That produces its curved shape as well as amplifying the material ’s response to the oscillating reaction inside itself .
The gel shown in the video above is able to move thanks to a notched surface .
But Maeda is now working on a new version that lies flat on a normal surface and moves using a peristaltic motion , like an earthworm or snail .
Lab worm
Like the inchworm , this incarnation of the gel will still be limited to the lab bench , but these experiments demonstrate the potential of using oscillating chemical systems like the BZ reaction for tasks engineers usually achieve using electronics , says Maeda .
“ Mechanical systems need complex fabricated circuits or external control devices because the mechanical motion is driven by on - off switching of external signals , ” he explains .
By comparison , chemical systems can be “ self organised ” and generate their own control and mechanical signals from within , he says .
Those abilities could be used to make some components of a future robot , while more conventional engineering is used for the parts for which only electronics will do .

Stanford Researcher Sophia Yen
from the top medical web sites .
It 's wrong .
" Even widely trusted sites like WebMD are not that accurate when it comes to adolescent reproductive health , " says Dr. Sophia Yen , a Stanford University Med School instructor in Adolescent Medicine .
She conducted an online review last summer and concluded many of the web sites were n't just incomplete — they were often wrong , wrong , wrong
For example , weight gain is n't a side effect of birth control pills — but 60 % of the reviewed sites claimed that it was .
( And three sites even claimed , incorrectly , that IUDs should only be used by women who had already had children . )
In fact , 40 % of the web sites actually contradicted the guidelines of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on PAP exams , mistakenly recommending the tests every time women change sexual partners or as soon as they turn 18 .
" Extra Pap exams are an unnecessary stress and expense , and a barrier to getting birth control , " Yen says — since some teenagers may postpone birth control if they mistakenly believe it will first require a Pap exam .
With undergraduate researcher Alisha Tolani ,
Yen reported her results in March to the annual meeting of the Society for Adolescent Medicine , concluding that web sites " do n't always incorporate changes to policy or to clinical recommendations that have occurred within the past five years . "
Between July and August ,
Yen 's team performed a detailed assessment of the sexual health information online , a process she describes in an online video .
" We did a Google search for phrases such as birth control , sexually transmitted diseases , emergency contraception , and IUDs , and looked at which web sites were the top 10 to 15 that came up on each of these topics . "
They cross-checked their list against Alexa 's reports of U.S. - based traffic — but were still disappointed by the information they discovered .
For example , " about half of the Web sites , including such highly trafficked destinations as Wikipedia and Mayoclinic.com , failed to provide accurate , complete information about emergency contraception , " according to the study announcement by Stanford 's School of Medicine .
Emergency contraception has been available over - the - counter since 2006 for people over 18 , but 29 % of the web sites
Yen checked failed to mention this fact .
She discovered 16 of the 34 sites correctly stated this information , but then failed to mention that in nine states it's also available over - the - counter without any age restrictions .
And Yen also faults 10 of the 34 sites for failing to correct a common misconception — that emergency contraception is identical to the RU - 486 abortion pill .
And it 's not just teenagers that misunderstand the information .
Yen cites one study which determined that 45 % of newspapers confused emergency contraception ( which prevents pregnancy from occurring ) with RU - 486 , a pill which triggers an abortion after pregnancy occurs .
Possibly because of this , 31 % of teenagers now wrongly believe that emergency contraception induces an abortion , according to studies cited by Yen — while another 35 % of adolescents have never even heard of emergency contraception .
And Yen found that many web sites also failed to include the latest guidelines from the World Health Organization about Plan B emergency contraception .
( The group recommends that the pills be taken as soon as possible after sex , adding that the latest they can be effective is five days after intercourse . )
Yen 's interest stems from her work as a pediatrics instructor at Stanford 's medical school , and as a specialist in adolescent medicine at the Lucille Packard Children 's Hospital .
In fact , the hospital 's chief of adolescent medicine added a statement to the announcement .
" Making the transition between childhood and adulthood can be tough on teenagers , " said Neville Golden , MD , noting that teenagers have many questions about sexual health .
" That 's why Dr. Yen 's research is so important .
" She has demonstrated that there is a tremendous amount of misinformation on the Web .
" Butadolescents get their sex information the web ?
Yes .
Yen cites two studies by the PEW research center plus a 2003 survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation , which determined that approximately 25 % of teens acquire " some or a lot " of their sexual health information from the internet .
And though more than half of teenagers mistakenly thought they were immune to herpes if they were only kissing , this was n't addressed by 69 % of the web sites studied .
( Only nine of 29 pages about STDs explained that herpes could be transmitted through kissing . )
It 's just one more example of ways health sites are failing their teenaged readers .
" No studies have investigated the extent to which these myths exist and are perpetuated on the internet , " Yen argues in her findings , adding that in the last five years , " several notable changes to policy and clinical recommendations have occurred .
"
Yen recommends that teenagers see a physician who specializes in adolescent medicine , and seek web sites reviewed by similar specialists ( like the web sites associated with academic medical centers ) .
She recommends Go Ask Alice , a question - and - answer service from Columbia University , the Center for Young Women 's Health by the Children 's Hospital Boston , TeensHealth by KidsHealth.org , and Planned Parenthood 's Teen Wire .
And she also recommends the book Our Bodies , Ourselves Ultimately , she suggests web sites " should consider more frequent reviews by health practitioners to contain accurate information consistent with such changes . "
She also has some advice for doctors — " be aware of myths on ' reputable health websites ' and actively debunk them in clinical settings . "
And finally , she has some advice for teenagers .
" Be cautious about finding sexual health answers on the Web . "
Sitting on the banks of the Moray Firth , the small Scottish town of Lossiemouth is synonymous with aeronautical endeavour .
For the past 70 years , its airbase has been home to some of the RAF 's most elite squadrons and boasts that it exists to " Provide Combat Capability for Expeditionary Operations Worldwide " .
But now the base has been earmarked for expeditions that are out of this world .
The site is one location being considered as a spaceport where Richard Branson 's Virgin Galactic tourist flights to space would operate from .
The proposal has been in the offing for three years and this week it received the support of the MP and MSP for the area .
Angus Robertson and Richard Lochhead held talks in Edinburgh yesterday in an effort to secure the use of RAF Lossiemouth for the ambitious project .
Virgin is interested in using the Moray airbase for commercial space flights .
The first commercial flights are expected to take off from a base in New Mexico in the United States as early as 2011 .

Virgin plans to launch spaceships from carrier planes , taking two pilots and six passengers on a brief sub-orbital journey 87 miles above the earth .
Customers paying £ 110,000 will get to experience five minutes of weightlessness during their flight .
Sir Richard Branson , the Virgin chairman , wants to build three spaceports in the US , the Middle East and Asia or Australia .
On Thursday the two politicians stressed the potential economic benefits when they met John Swinney , Scotland 's Finance Secretary .
Mr Robertson said : " With test flights already under way the likelihood is these flights could be available in the next few years , so the chance to discuss the role the Scottish Government could potentially play in realising this goal was welcome .
" I have already spoken with the UK Science Minister Lord Drayson and Dr Ian Gibson of the British National Space Centre , who are positive about the future of space flight from Moray .
Mr Swinney was equally as enthusiastic about the plans and receptive to exploring the possibilities in Moray . "
Mr Lochhead added it would be a mistake to underestimate the potential of the Virgin flights to also launch satellites .
" I am delighted myself and Angus Robertson were able to represent Moray 's interest in making sure the full potential of these flights is explored , " he said .
" I look forward to working with interested parties , including Virgin Galactic , to move this forward in the interests of our constituents in Moray , with potential benefits for the whole of Scotland . "

In 1972 , Thomas Nagel first introduced what is now known as the “ explanatory gap ” amongst contemporary philosophers .
It was described in his paper “ What Is It Like To Be A Bat ? ” and the gist of the argument was this : one cannot fully understand the mind unless one has experienced that mind .
Nagel took the example of a bat because bats are so fascinatingly different than humans ; they hang upside down most of the time , use echolocation , they are nocturnal , and most eat nothing but insects .
Could a human ever convincingly claim that he knew what it was like to be a bat ?
Nagel did n’t believe this was possible – I agree .
Can the same be true amongst humans ?
Can another human fully understand the mind of another , or , does one have to be in the first - person to understand the mind more clearly ?
Philosopher Frank Jackson wrote a paper in 1982 titled “ Epiphenomenal Qualia ” where he introduced the famous thought experiment known as Mary ’s room .
It goes like this :
“ Mary is a brilliant scientist who is , for whatever reason , forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor .
She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires , let us suppose , all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes , or the sky , and use terms like ‘ red ’ , ‘ blue ’ , and so on .
She discovers , for example , just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina , and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence ‘ The sky is blue ’ .
(…)
What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor ?
Will she learn anything or not ?
It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it .
But then is it inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete . ”
These arguments by Frank Jackson and Thomas Nagel are two of the most famous papers in support of the idea of qualia – a term used in philosophy to describe the subjective quality of conscious experience .
It is an idea often associated with mind / body dualism – the belief that the mind is in some - part nonphysical , and therefore a separate entity from our physical bodies .
However , the explanatory gap does not suggest that exactly , and it is perfectly compatible with a materialist view of the mind .
The real questions that the explanatory gap provokes is within the field of psychology and the scientific method itself .
Science is science because of its objective , empirical , and third - person approach to knowledge .
Science has often given man the ability to step outside of the subjective experience of natural phenomena , observe them , study them , test them , replicate their findings , and come to conclusions .
There is no doubt the breakthroughs and advancements science has come to offer man throughout the centuries .
It would be foolish to deny these achievements .
Even in Western psychology ( which is quite a young field relative to the natural sciences ) , researchers have made incredibly discoveries of the mind and how it works .
We have devised useful models for how the mind perceives sensations ( Psychophysics ) , how it processes information , stores memories , and solves problems ( Cognitive Psychology ) , how the mind changes throughout the human lifespan ( Developmental Psychology ) , how the mind builds associations and how these associations affect our behaviors ( Learning or Experimental Psychology ) , how the brain or the “ physical anatomy of the mind ” works ( Neuroscience ) , and we ’ve been given the chance to take all of this information and apply it to a variety of other fields : Clinical Psychology , Industrial and Organizational Psychology , Sport Psychology , Healthy Psychology , Forensic Psychology , etc .
There is no denying the leaps psychology has made , all in the name of proper science .
This is knowledge we would likely have not gotten any other way if it were not for the extraordinary and rigorous scientific method .
However , there is good reason to believe that Nagel and Jackson are right and that we cannot fully explain or understand a mind from an outside view .
This is the belief that once science carries out its full course of discoveries that there will still be something left unsaid about the mind .
That is : what it is like to actually experience consciousness itself .
War Crimes in Gaza ?
Palestinian Lawyers Take on Israel
Four months after the war in Gaza , Palestinian lawyers have prepared 936 lawsuits against the Israeli military over alleged war crimes .
Some of the cases could soon be tried at Spain 's National Court under universal jurisdiction .

There are tons of green conferences these days , and to be sure lots of great information to be learned at them , people to connect with , ideas to germinate , funding to be sought .
And yet , something ’s missing .
Do n’t get me wrong , magic has been made and minds blown with just Powerpoint and a good presentation .
I do n’t know about you , but how many times do you find yourself thinking , “ I have something to add to what they ’re saying , ” or “ Gah !
I wish they ’d do a session on * this * topic ! ”
Green Business Camp , done for the first time a few weeks back in South San Francisco at the Green V Sustainable Center , a creative reinvention of a former car dealership site , may be just the antidote you ’re seeking .
It ’s what they call an “ unconference . ”
As in the opposite of all the trappings of your usual conference .
[ social_buttons ]
It began with everybody having the chance to write their own ideas for a session , then we all pinned them up on a wall , each getting 6 votes for the topics that drew our interest .
The organizers then tallied votes , including bundling together similar ideas , and then magically , a cluttered wall full of dozens of ideas became a grid of four sessions , four topics to choose from in each .
Topics ranged across the spectrum , from electric vehicles to how to get a green job , collaboration to how to use social media in relation to your green business .
Paul Hawken then set the tone for the day , giving his ever unique , leading edge , and funny perspective on the importance of green business .
Each session was different in terms of its structure , as the topic originator was also the leader of the session , helping set the tone .
For me , it ranged from highly organized and led to more hot potato group discussions that dashed from subject to subject .
Each way had its own merit , and though I would have liked the sessions longer ( In conversation with the organizers , they ’d thought people might run out of things to talk about if longer !
Changing next year , I imagine . )
I got something from every one .
I even found myself being a pseudo panelist in the social media based conference , as it ’s an area I have a lot of experience in and had just the day before been at the social media focused Inbound Marketing Summit .
The organizers then took an interesting turn at second half of the day : Taking advantage of having a collection of so many people with so many connections , they gave us all two brown paper lunch bags , and told us to write on each something we wanted .
Then , for the rest of the day , people could look these bags over and drop their information in them if they could help with what the bag was asking for .
I was interested in finding funding for my new employer , 3rdWhale Media , and got three cards !
Other people seemed to be getting numerous cards in their bags too .
How refreshing to be able to ask for what you want , in a low pressure way , and have the treat of coming back and finding people willing to help with it .
This is the first of what I imagine will be several of these events .
Readers :
What sustainability related conferences ( or unconferences ) have you been to lately that inspired you , got your attention , and you think we should know about ?
Comment below please .

The Tata Nano , India 's equivalent of the Ford Model T a century later , finally went on sale on April 9th .
And while it may not seem like much of a car to US buyers , more than 200,000 eager Indian buyers put down deposits for cars that wo n't be delivered for as long as two years .
And that should be a relief to Tata , whose $ 2 billion purchase of Jaguar Land Rover from Ford Motor Company last August could n't have come at a worse time , just weeks before the global auto market began to implode .
Deposits of roughly 90 percent for confirmed Nano orders have added $ 500 million to company coffers ( though of course they 'll have to spend most of that money to build the cars ) .
And in a first for any Indian car , roughly 4,000 were ordered and paid for online , via the Tata Nano website .
According to Tata , in just two weeks , it received 203,000 paid orders and sold another 600,000 booking forms for the car .
The first year 's production of 50,000 cars from a factory in Pantnagar will be delivered starting in July .
They and another 50,000 Nanos from a factory -- which had to be relocated from Singur to Gujarat after protests over land seizures -- will be allocated among paid - up buyers by lottery .
Proving the allure of optional equipment , just one of five Nanos ordered are the bare - bones Nano Standard model , costing $ 2,000 .
Another 30 percent are the mid-level Nano CX , which adds air - conditioning and power brakes , but fully half the buyers paid for the top - of - the - line Nano LX , which tops out at $ 3,300 .
That model has electric windows and door locks , nicer trim , body - colored bumpers , and more .
The Nano has gotten good reviews , from a first ride report in December to more recent full road tests .
They pretty much add up to : " Yep , it 's a real car .
Handles decently , not that fast , fits four adults .
Gee , that 's pretty amazing , is n't it ? "
While Tata will have its hands full with home - market orders for a couple of years , it 's moving ahead aggressively with plans to sell the Nano in Europe and perhaps even in the United States .
For reference , the Nano is 10 feet long , longer than the two - seat 2009 Smart ForTwo but shorter than a 2009 Mini Cooper .

Military robots with guns
Robotex Inc is one of the plethora of companies out there that are working to bring intelligent weapon wielding robots to reality .
From the limited information on their website we can’t say much about whether Robotex ’s robots are ever going to come to much , but perhaps these guys have a future in robotic video editing .
Check out the awesome Robotex futuristic vision of military robots with guns taking matters into their own hands in the video above .
Its a simulation , and there are holes all over this video in terms of how militant robots will actually look and act .
Most notably military robots probably wo n’t be humanoid looking ( wheels , treads , and other designs are easier to develop and often just as useful , if not superior to humanoid design ) , but the video is still an awesome ride for the imagination .
Skip the first 50 seconds of slideshow at the beginning … but after that the video is well worth watching !

Woodland caribou are most at risk from habitat loss
Reindeer and caribou numbers are plummeting around the world .
The first global review of their status has found that populations are declining almost everywhere they live , from Alaska and Canada , to Greenland , Scandinavia and Russia .
The iconic deer is vital to indigenous peoples around the circumpolar north .
Yet it is increasingly difficult for the deer to survive in a world warmed by climate change and altered by industrial development , say scientists .
Reindeer and caribou belong to the same species , Rangifer tarandus .
Caribou live in Canada , Alaska and Greenland ; while reindeer live in Russia , Norway , Sweden and Finland .
Worldwide , seven sub -species are recognised .
Each are genetically , morphologically and behaviourally a little different , though capable of interbreeding with one another .
Reindeer and caribou numbers worldwide : red denotes herds in decline , green indicates those on the increase and dark grey means no data is available .
Reindeer and caribou do not range in areas coloured light grey
These differences between sub -species dictate how each is affected by human impacts .
For example , it has been known for a while that populations of woodland caribou in Canada have declined as human disturbance has increased , caused by logging , oil and gas exploration , and road building , says Liv Vors of the University of Alberta in Edmonton , Canada .
But then reports started coming in that the numbers of other herds were also falling .
" When we discovered that many herds of reindeer also were declining we decided to compile a comprehensive survey to see if this indeed was a global pattern , " says Vors .
Vors and Mark Boyce at the University of Alberta contacted other researchers and scoured the published literature and government databases for all the information they could find about reindeer and caribou numbers .
They compiled data on 58 major herds around the Northern Hemisphere .
The scientists were shocked to discover that 34 of the herds were declining , while no data existed for 16 more .
Only eight herds were increasing in number .
Many herds had been declining for a decade or more .
Migratory caribou are feeling the heat from climate change " We were surprised at the ubiquity of the decline , " says Vors .
" We knew that woodland caribou in North America were in bad shape . "
There is also some evidence that populations of migratory caribou in the Canadian Arctic have fluctuated in recent history .
But the researchers were surprised at how migratory caribou and reindeer numbers seem to be falling in synchrony across the Northern Hemisphere .
" When we delved into the status of European reindeer herds , we were surprised that so many were declining .
We expected them to be in better shape than North America herds because reindeer , namely the semi- domestic herds , are closely managed by humans . "
The scale of the problem is shown by a map upon which the researchers plotted their data , which is published in Global Change Biology .
THE SEVEN SUB - SPECIES R. t. tarandus .
Semi-domestic and wild reindeer that live across northern Scandinavia and Russia .
Wild reindeer undertake long , seasonal migrations between summer and winter ranges .
R .t. fennicus .
Wild forest reindeer that live in the forests of Finland and the Kola Peninsula of Russia .
R. t. platyrhynchos .
Svalbard reindeer that live only on the Spitsbergen Archipelago , which belongs to Norway .
Svalbard reindeer have light - coloured fur , and shorter legs than other subspecies .
R. t. granti .
Grant 's caribou found in Alaska and the Yukon .
They reside in large groups and undertake long , seasonal migrations .
R. t. groenlandicus .
Migratory barren - ground caribou found across the tundra of Canada and Greenland .
R. t. pearyi .
Peary caribou , of which perhaps 700 persist on Canadian high Arctic islands .
R. t. caribou .
Woodland caribou residing in the boreal forest , mountains and tundra lowlands of Canada .
" Seeing that sea of red was a sobering moment , " Vors says .
" If global climate change and industrial development continue at the current pace , caribou and reindeer populations will continue to decline in abundance , " says Vors .
" Currently , climate change is most important for Arctic caribou and reindeer , while anthropogenic landscape change is most important for non-migratory woodland caribou . "
For example , climate change is affecting migratory caribou in a number of ways .
Warmer summers mean more insect activity , and caribou and reindeer that are harassed by insects are not able to feed as much to put on weight before winter .
Earlier springs mean plants may be past their prime by the time migrating animals reach their calving grounds , while warmer winters include more freezing rain which can form layers of ice over the ground .
The caribou and reindeer cannot dig through the ice to feed , and can then starve en masse .
" In time , however , climate change will become more important for woodland caribou , and landscape change will have a greater effect on arctic caribou and reindeer , " Vors continues .
" There likely will be more forest fires in woodland caribou habitat , as well as diseases and parasites transmitted to caribou from white - tailed deer , whose range is expanding northward in Canada .
More roads are being built in the Arctic , as well as infrastructures like diamond mines , and these sometimes interfere with migration routes . "
Unless something is urgently done , all seven sub-species of Rangifer face a bleak future , says Vors .
" The concern is that their habitat and the climate are changing too quickly for them to adapt . "
Fewer than 700 Peary caribou remain
The annual treks of migratory caribou form one of the last remaining large - scale ungulate migrations in the northern hemisphere .
Different sub -species also provide a cornerstone to many indigenous cultures around the circumpolar north , from subsistence hunting of caribou by Aboriginal peoples in Canada , Greenland and Alaska to reindeer husbandry by numerous cultures across Scandinavia and Siberia .
" From a Canadian perspective , the caribou is part of our national identity , " says Vors .
" Canada 's caribou migrations have frequently been identified as one of this country 's natural wonders , and the species even appears on our 25 - cent coin . "

King Bhumibol is a much revered figure in Thailand
A Thai citizen has been sentenced to 10 years in jail for violating strict laws against insulting the monarchy .
A court in Bangkok said Suwicha Thakho , 34 , digitally altered images of King Bhumibol Adulyadej and his family and posted them on the internet .
The court did not say how the pictures were changed or where they appeared , but local media cited YouTube .
Thai officials say more than 5,000 websites have been blocked in the past year for insulting the monarchy .
Thailand 's royal family is sheltered from public debate by some of the world 's most stringent " lese - majeste " laws , as the police and army try to suppress what they fear is a rising tide of anti-monarchy sentiment .
One political activist was jailed for six years in November for an anti-monarchy speech she made just a stone 's throw from the old royal palace last July .
Several other people are awaiting trial .
But in February the king pardoned Australian writer Harry Nicolaides , who was sentenced to three years in jail for insulting the crown prince in a little - known book .
The 81 - year - old king also pardoned a Swiss man who was given a 10 - year sentence two years ago for defacing his portrait .

On the Web : Download reports from the Idaho State Police investigation at spokesman.com / documents .
They ’re paid to guard and care for inmates .
But some Kootenai County Jail employees saw the facility as their personal drug store , taking advantage of such lax controls over inmate medications that the Idaho State Police would eventually launch a yearlong investigation involving hidden cameras , lie detectors and interviews with more than a dozen nurses , jail guards and inmates , documents obtained by The Spokesman - Review show .
The documents , obtained through a public records request , provide the first detailed look at a criminal probe that ended in March with no charges filed and few details revealed .
Although the Kootenai County Sheriff ’s Department in April announced the firing and punishment of 11 jail employees as part of the probe , officials refused to identify the employees or discuss the scope of the problem .
The ISP investigation found that inmate prescriptions were left on carts in a room with little security or supervision .
Pills left over after inmates were discharged , or that were refused , were tossed in a bin marked for disposal ; it was from this bin that most of the thefts occurred .
This lack of security and poor record - keeping enabled the thefts , records show , and it contributed to a Bonner County prosecutor ’s decision not to file criminal charges .
In explaining his decision , Prosecutor Louis Marshall cited a lack of evidence such as recovered stolen pills or records proving the thefts , documents show .
Charges dismissed
A missing pill or two from the inmate stores had been common for years , records show .
It was n’t until February 2008 , when an inmate noticed that nearly 75 of her hydrocodone painkillers were missing , that there was deemed to be a problem .
The inmate demanded reimbursement , but initially got nowhere , complaining for weeks to a jail nurse , Monique Minas , who ended up being implicated in the investigation .
Minas was not fired , but officials declined to discuss disciplinary actions against her , citing personnel privacy .
When the inmate threatened to go to the media and her lawyer got involved , jail staff contacted the Idaho State Police , launching the investigation .
A 2006 medication - theft case at the jail ended with the firing of a longtime employee .
Al Hetzler , a 25 - year veteran , was charged with theft for stealing medications from an inmate .
Charges were dismissed after he served five days in jail in August 2007 , paid a $ 300 fine and reimbursed the inmate $ 25.50 , records show .
Jail officials concluded at the time that Hetzler ’s case was an isolated incident and made no policy changes , said jail Capt .
Travis Chaney .
But documents show the Hetzler theft hinted at a problem that reached supervisors charged with investigating the missing pills and seemed to reveal a mentality that prescription pills were no big deal .
“ The only difference between the deputies and them ( pointing to the inmates ) was that the inmates got caught , ” one jailer recalled another saying , according to the documents .
‘ A candy store ’
Three employees were fired this February – 11 months after the ISP investigation began and a year after the pills were reported missing .
Documents show the trio ’s actions were the most egregious of a handful of employees implicated in the investigation .
Eleven - year veteran Sgt. Rafael Merrill was fired after admitting taking a hydrocodone pill from the leftover medications with the help of a licensed practical nurse , Ruth Nagle .
Nagle , who was hired in 2003 , was fired in February after the investigation concluded she ’d helped Lisa Brumbaugh , a booking deputy who ’d worked at the jail nine years , smuggle pills from the jail .
Brumbaugh was fired two days earlier after admitting she ’d taken hundreds of hydrocodone pills since May 2007 with the help of Nagle and Judy Lobue , a registered nurse who still works there .
Nearly a dozen people were named in the investigation , and interviews show the medications were long seen by many employees as free for the taking .
“ The accessibility of the medications without accountability was a candy store for anyone that needed free controlled narcotic medications , ” one employee told investigators .
Some spoke of receiving one or two pills over the years .
Another recalled getting a handful of prescription medications that were left over from an inmate ; that employee insisted on repaying the jail and bought the office a filing cabinet , documents show .
Documents suggest some employees were bitter that inmates had prescriptions for drugs they could n’t get .
‘ Problems can arise ’
The ISP ’s yearlong investigation steeped the office in suspicion .
Employees were under watch , and rumors about the investigation permeated their work life , they told the ISP .
Initially , Nagle and Brumbaugh gave investigators names of co-workers they claimed might be responsible .
But investigators had heard Brumbaugh might have a drug problem , and her medical records showed she was taking hydrocodone – something she lied about during her first interview with investigators .
Brumbaugh ’s prescription ran out about the time the hydrocodone pills turned up missing , records show .
“ Any time you ’re dealing with those types of substances , problems can arise , ” said Chaney , the jail captain .
“ That ’s why you try to maintain controls . ”
In this case , some who were assigned to maintain that control ended up on the other end of the investigation .
Disciplinary actions against employees were determined not just by the investigation but by the employees ’ work record and past performance assessments , officials said .
Sheriff Rocky Watson refused to discuss apparent differences in how various employees were disciplined , citing personnel issues .
But procedures for storing and documenting medication have changed , Watson said .
He declined to detail those changes , citing security issues .
Documents show at least five employees who were implicated in the thefts still work at the jail .

There are many ways for ISPs to manage the increased load BitTorrent traffic places on their network .
Some choose to interrupt BitTorrent transfers like Comcast did , but there are more ' consumer friendly ' alternatives too .
An Israeli Internet provider is adding local web - seeds to speed up torrent transfers and reduce the amount of international traffic .
Over the past few years Internet service providers have been increasingly complaining about the massive load BitTorrent transfers place on their networks .
They claim that this load can reduce the performance experienced by other subscribers , but the huge amount of data transferred outside their own network is also very costly .
To solve these issues , some ISPs have started to slow down all BitTorrent traffic , Comcast - style .
Others choose to limit BitTorrent speeds at certain times of the day , and there are other examples where customers simply cannot download files with a . torrent extension at all .
Luckily there are options available which can help manage BitTorrent traffic and please customers , all at the same time .
The Israeli ISP Bezeq International has taken this more consumer - friendly route .
This ISP actually makes BitTorrent downloads faster by caching popular torrent downloads on their own network .
By doing so the load on the network decreases and since there are less connections to peers outside the network Bezeq is also saving on costly bandwidth .
It works as follows .
When a Bezeq International customer downloads a . torrent file the ISP will intercept it and add (! ) a new tracker to it .
The additional tracker is only accessible for Bezeq International customers and it connects to a high speed web - seed hosted on Bezeq International ’s network .
As a result the files will be downloaded much faster .
A Bezeq customer told us that almost all ‘ popular ’ torrents he downloaded connect to local seeds .
Interestingly , the tracker Bezeq International uses is hosted by an ISP in The Netherlands , while the actual seeds ( caches ) are on the ISPs network .
The provider confirmed to TorrentFreak that the ISP is indeed listed as a client , but they were not aware of its torrent caching practices or that they were hosting a BitTorrent tracker .
On the surface this seems to be a win -win situation for both the ISP and its customers .
Bezeq saves on resources and expensive bandwidth while the customer enjoys higher download speeds .
There are of course privacy concerns , since the .torrent files are intercepted and edited without permission , but the biggest opposition to such a system will most likely come from the entertainment industry .
Various anti-piracy lobby groups , including the MPAA and RIAA are already pushing for more cooperation from ISPs in tracking down copyright infringers .
The relationship between the entities is an uneasy one already , and that ’s before an ISP decided it would become a BitTorrent seeder .
Although Bezeq International does not control which files are cached on their servers , the likes of the MPAA and RIAA will likely see it as aiding in copyright infringement .
Caching BitTorrent traffic and attempts to keep it within the local network as much as possible are not new , but aside from occasional tests these technologies are never implemented by ISPs .
Bezeq International did not respond to our inquiries so we ca n’t confirm that they have implemented it for all their customers .
For those who are lucky enough , enjoy the ride .
More discussion in Israeli .
It would appear to the casual observer that Haddock works fairly excellently cross-packages .
For example , I haddocked the Haddock code , and all the links to the types from the GHC API point to the haddock - docs in my GHC 6.10.3 installation .
( Yes , you need the versions of the dependent packages chosen , installed and haddocked , and this does n’t always work out optimally online .
But that ’s not the problem that I ’m confronting . )
Yes , links work .
But that ’s about it , right now .
Compare ( broken )
http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/stable/docs/libraries/haskell98/List.html to ( good )
http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/stable/docs/libraries/base/Data-List.html .
The broken one ’s source ( haskell98 : List ) imports the good one ( base : Data .
List ) .
haskell98 : List ’s documentation luckily lists the * names * of the exported things , because they ’re listed in that file ’s export list .
But not their types or their docs .
Not the module doc header ( though that should n’t be copied anyway ) , and there ’s no link to base : Data .
List ( which is acceptable .
Although maybe someone should write a haddock - header to haskell98 : List that says it ’s the Haskell 98 version ( specified at http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/list.html ) of the slightly expanded base - package Data .
List [ link ] .
Anyway , the way we get any links to modules in other packages is because we read their generated .haddock files .
They ’re binary and haddock does n’t have any obvious way to make them human - readable , but they correspond to Haddock .
InterfaceFile.InterfaceFile .
Which is , roughly , a list of Haddock .
Types .
InstalledInterface , which seems to be the interesting bit .
data Installed Interface = InstalledInterface {
instMod :: Module ,
instInfo :: HaddockModInfo
Name ,
instDocMap :: Map Name ( HsDoc DocName ) ,
instExports :: [ Name ] ,
instVisibleExports :: [ Name ] ,
instOptions :: [ DocOption ] ,
instSubMap :: Map Name [ Name ]
}
A Module ( not to be confused with GhcModule , which is defined by Haddock ) is a low - information type defined in GHC that contains the package name and version and the module name .
HaddockModInfo is just the module ’s header description , plus the portability : , stability : , maintainer : fields ( HaddockModInfo is defined in GHC , oddly enough : must be parse result .
defined in ghc : HsSyn to be precise . )
DocOptions are hide , prune , ignore - exports , not - home .
( defined in haddock code . )
The rest contain a lot of “ Name ”s , which is a GHC thing that refers unambiguously to the place an identifier originates .
Sufficient for making a link , but not sufficient by itself for copying the named identifier ’s docs or type .
So passing over them for now … there is one interesting thing left .
A DocName contains a Name and also ( if any ) the module we ’d like to link to in which that name is documented .
instDocMap :: Map Name ( HsDoc DocName ) .
This gives more info on any number of Name identifiers .
( HsDoc provides formatting , DocName provides its references .)
There is no type information here at all , as far as I can tell , which will clearly need to be remedied somehow ( in Interface , roughly a superset of Installed Interface , types appears in ifaceDeclMap , though I ’m not sure if that ’s where they ’re retrieved from for HTML - doc- printing ) .
But there ’s another big question I need to find out : * which * names are documented in any given module ’s instDocMap ?
The type provides no clue , nor does its current ( lack of a ) doc string , nor ifaceRnDocMap .
I could look everywhere in the code that it ’s generated , or I could ask David Waern … who will need to tell me if I said anything confused here anyway 🙂

Roqaya al - Hazalin , 23
I am eight months ' pregnant .
On Friday , 10 April , I took my sheep to graze in an area southwest of our village , not far from the cattle farm of the Ma'on settlement .
I was with other women from the village , among them Amneh Sallem ‘ Eid al - Hazalin and Khadrah Suliman al - Hazalin , and a group of children under the age of 15 , among them Tareq Sallem ‘ Eid al - Hazalin , 13 , Musa Suliman al - Hazalin , 12 , and ‘ Omar Suliman al - Hazalin , 10 .
Around 8:00 A.M. , we arrived to land owned by farmers from Yatta .
We grazed the sheep and gathered plants we use for food .
We were more than five hundred meters from the Ma'on settlement .
We did n't go close to the settlement .
Around 9:00 A.M. , we saw four settlers coming toward us from the settlement .
Two of them went down into the wadi [ valley ] and headed to another group of shepherds , and two of them , who were masked , approached us .
The two who came toward us appeared to be young .
They were holding sticks and had pistols on their hips .
Amneh was standing close to me , and Khadrah was relatively far from us .
When the settlers got to about thirty meters from us , they shouted at us in Hebrew .
Their appearance frightened us , and we began to run away .
The settlers chased us , and continued to shout at us as we ran .
Being pregnant , I could n't run fast .
After about one hundred meters , the settlers caught me .
One of them hit me in my right arm and left leg with his stick .
The other settler threw a stone at me , which hit me in the left leg .
Then one of them pushed me , and I fell onto some thorns .
My arm and leg hurt a lot .
When I fell , the two settlers left me and ran toward the farmers and other shepherds .
I remained there , crying .
I was in terrible pain .
After a few minutes , Amneh and Khadrah ran over to me and helped me get up .
They lifted me up with the help of the children and laid me on the donkey that we had brought with us , and returned me to the village .
I was in such great pain that I thought my arm has been broken .
I was still crying when we reached the village .
An Israeli ambulance came and the medical team gave me first - aid .
Then the Israeli police and two army jeeps of the Civil Administration arrived .
I told them what happened .
Around 11:00 A.M. , a Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance came and took me to ‘ Aliyah Government Hospital , in Hebron .
At the hospital , they examined me and X - rayed me .
They found that my arm was not broken .
I was very lucky , and the fetus was not harmed .
I remained in the hospital for two or three hours , and then went home .
My arm swelled up and I am still in pain , a week after the incident .
A Palestinian policeman at the hospital took my complaint .
I did not go to the Israeli police because I do n't feel well enough , and because I need somebody to accompany me to Kiryat Arba to do that ./>
Roqaya ' Ali Hamdan al - Hazalin , 22 , married with one child , is a homemaker and a resident of Umm al - Kheir in Hebron District .
Her testimony was given to Musa Abu Hashhash at the witness 's house on 18 April 2009 .
That was a fantastic and satisfying 3 minutes of Star Wars porn .
But it 's obviously not in - game gameplay , and probably does n't represent the MMO experience .
In the MMO , every single combatant would have identical equipment and skills , because they all converged on the current maxed out template .
The accurate part is that only two significant combatants are non-Jedi .
SW Galaxies , set after the Jedi purge , had to keep bending to let nearly everyone be Jedi .
At least in this time period it makes sense .
However , I 'd be hugely impressed if the game somehow enabled tactics like crashing a shuttle into a building to land an attack party .
Galaxies inadvertently enabled this with a 7 - seat speeder that looked from outside like just one character approaching .
One of the British National party 's first MEPs ' attempts to play down his past links to the extreme right as " silly " teenage posturing are today exposed as a sham after it emerged that for many years he played a crucial role in shaping the National Front 's most overtly racist policies .
In 1983 , when he was in his late twenties , Andrew Brons edited the National Front 's general election manifesto that called for a global apartheid to prevent the " extinction " of whites everywhere .
The Let Britain Live !
manifesto was prepared by the party 's policy department , chaired by Brons .
It outlined a series of hugely controversial positions , crystallised in one of its opening statements : " The National Front rejects the whole concept of multiracialism .
We recognise inherent racial differences in Man .
The races of Man are profoundly unequal in their characteristics , potential and abilities . "
The manifesto claimed the UK had been " swamped " by " racially incompatible Afro- Asians " and that " Black muggings of White people , especially elderly ladies , occurs regularly " .
It continued : " The eruptions in Bristol in 1980 and Brixton in 1981 were just two examples of the ' cultural enrichment ' promised to us by the multiracialists . "
And it claimed : " We believe the gradual dismantlement of the Apartheid system over the last 17 years to be retrograde ...
The alternative to Apartheid , multiracialism , envisages an extinction of the White man . "
Brons was also an enthusiastic contributor in the 1970s and 1980s to Spearhead , a far - right magazine considered so extreme even the BNP tried to distance itself from it .
In two lengthy polemics for the magazine , Brons outlined the supposed importance of nationalism and interpreted genetic studies to suggest Europeans had a " greater cognitive ability " than non-whites .
He attacked the influence of " people of Jewish ethnic origin " and peddled the myth that a number of predominantly Zionist organisations were controlling the world .
The now retired college lecturer wrote : " One ethnic , national and religious group whose power and influence has undoubtedly increased has been the Jews .
It can be no mere coincidence that the number of people of Jewish ethnic origin to be found in internationalist and multiracialist schools of thought and organisations of action is out of all proportion to their numbers in the population . "
Brons , who was elected as the BNP MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber this month , has tried to distance himself from his National Front days .
" People do silly things when they are 17 , " he said recently .
" Peter Mandelson was once a member of the Young Communist League but we do n't continue to call him a communist . "
But his critics say his relationship with the National Front was more than a youthful dalliance and question the extent to which he has left his past behind .
A 1980 edition of National Front News , the party newspaper , carried an article about Brons saying he was prepared to go to jail for his beliefs .
It noted that Brons refused a " Negro reporter permission to attend two National Front ticket - only meetings " and explains that Brons , then 29 , has " campaigned against Coloured Immigration since he was a teenager " - suggesting his extremist views have been a feature as much of his adult as his teenage life .
Brons seized the NF chairmanship in 1980 when John Tyndall quit to form the BNP .
In 1984 Brons was convicted of using insulting behaviour towards an ethnic - minority police officer and left the party , citing family problems .
At the National Front , Brons was a close ally of Richard Verrall , the author of the Holocaust - denial tract Did Six Million Really Die ? , who was vice - chairman .
In 1981 , while Brons was chairman , the NF endorsed We are National Front , a pamphlet carrying an introduction from Verrall .
It had photographs of Brons and Verrall as well as a picture of a gorilla and a black man stating : " These two creatures look the same , do n't they ? "
Anti-racism and Jewish support groups yesterday described Brons 's failure to condemn his past activities as disturbing .
" From a young man until well into his middle age , Andrew Brons was very much involved in a series of viciously antisemitic and racist far - right movements , " said a spokesman for the Community Security Trust , which monitors attacks on the UK's Jewish community .
" It 's hard to believe he has undergone a serious conversion since then . "
Searchlight , the anti-fascist organisation , said Brons was influential in shaping the NF and it was important that those voting for him should be aware of his past views .
" The fact that Brons is an intellectual fascist and bigot rather than an ignorant fascist and bigot cuts little ice , " a spokesman said .
" We are unimpressed by his claims that his prejudice was a result of youthful exuberance . "
Attempts to contact Brons through the BNP were unsuccessful .
BURTON , Michigan --
The black helicopter crowd 's worst fears of a New World Order are coming true .
The military is invading Burton .
But it promises to only stay a week .
The U.S. Special Operations Command is using Burton as a training ground for military exercises .
Sometime over the next day or two , a military spokesman said residents may see low - flying helicopters buzzing overhead .
People may even catch a glimpse of special operations forces , but the goal is to keep the exercise as low key as possible .
" Chances are that most people wo n't see them , " said Naval Lt. Nathan C. Potter , a spokesman for the exercises .
Citing safety and security concerns , the military is being mum on details about the exercises , including the size of the force being trained .
There 's also no word on where exactly the operations will take place , although Potter said soldiers could be working in neighborhoods and industrial sites .
" It will be very sporadic , " he said .
The goal is to prepare troops for unfamiliar urban areas .
Once they are finished in Burton , Potter said the soldiers will be ready to be deployed overseas .
The military approached Burton officials with the request to train there about three months ago , said Burton police Lt. Tom Osterholzer .
Although officials are being cautious about the details , Osterholzer said they opted to notify the public to allay any fears once people start seeing helicopters .
Burton and Flint police will provide traffic control for some of the exercises and 911 operators at the Flint and Genesee County dispatch centers have been alerted in case of panicked calls .
" It 's an honor to help these guys , " said Osterholzer .
Not everyone is as enthusiastic .
" It scares me , " said Jennie Moench of Swartz Creek .
Moench questioned whether the military is getting ready for action in a new theater outside of Iraq and Pakistan and wonders why it chose Burton .
" Would you see this happening in a wealthy city ? " said Moench , a member of the area Peace Triangle group that has protested the U.S. presence in Iraq for about seven years .
But Burton resident Leroy Cronkright believes the city is providing an important service to the military .
" Nowadays , almost everything ( soldiers do ) is cities and towns , " said Cronkright , a Navy veteran who served in the 1960s .
Sonia
Flagg said she would have been caught offguard by the sight of helicopters over her yard , but likes the idea .
" Somebody 's got to do it , so why not Burton , " said Flagg .
" Young kids will love watching the helicopters fly around and everything . "
Potter said the military appreciates the local help and said such training exercises are critical to the ability of soldiers to operate overseas .
Similar operations have been run in other cities around the nation .
" We 're not trying to cause a disturbance , " said Potter .
Mr Gates spoke while visiting a military base in North Carolina US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has warned Pakistan that relations with the US will be threatened unless Islamabad combats the rise of the Taleban .
His comments echo a warning from US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Mrs Clinton said on Wednesday that Pakistan poses a " mortal threat " to the world by abdicating to the Taleban .
Earlier on Thursday , Pakistani troops were sent to tackle Taleban militants who had advanced into a region just 100 km ( 67 miles ) from Islamabad .
One policeman was killed in the assault in Buner district , which is next to the Swat valley , where the Taleban holds sway after government forces failed to quell an insurgency .
Partnership threatened Speaking at a US military base in North Carolina , from where American marines are about to be deployed to Afghanistan , the US defence chief said some Pakistani leaders recognise the " existential threat " facing the country 's government , but needed to act swiftly .
" It is important they not only recognise it [ the threat ] , but take the appropriate actions to deal with it , " Mr Gates said .
" The stability and the longevity of democratic government in Pakistan is central to the efforts of the coalition in Afghanistan , " he added .
" And it is also central to our future partnership with the government in Islamabad .
The Obama administration is clearly stepping up the pressure on Pakistan 's government and security forces to do much more to combat the Taleban , the BBC's Jonathan Beale reports from Washington .
Taleban ' springboard '
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs issued a separate warning on Thursday , calling the developments in Pakistan " very disturbing " .
" We are extremely concerned about the situation and it is something that takes a lot of the president 's time , " he said .
Tribal elders failed to secure a Taleban withdrawal from Bruner The Taleban moved several hundred men into Buner , just weeks after a peace deal signed by President Asif Ali Zardari allowed the introduction of Islamic Sharia law in Swat .
Insurgents have now begun patrolling the streets and mounting checkpoints in the area .
The Sharia deal was designed to end a bloody 18 - month conflict with the Taleban in Swat by yielding to some of their demands .
But critics say the militants can now use Swat as a springboard to take over new areas of the country .

The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address was full of good and even surprising announcements , but , as is often the case , it was most notable for what it did n't include .
The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference ( WWDC ) keynote address was doomed to disappoint even before Phil Schiller uttered his first " . "
It 's not that the keynote was a dud .
It 's just that each one of these events is freighted with such oversize expectations that it 's impossible for them to do anything but disappoint .
As it is , the changes to Apple 's products in the last couple of years have been largely iterative .
This keynote was no different .
Let 's take a look at the keynote from a " what 's in / what 's missing " perspective .
WHAT'S IN
Hello SD Card Slot :
This may be the single biggest surprise of the keynote .
Obviously , everyone was amped up for whatever phone gadget Apple announced , but I do n't think anyone expected this little laptop shocker .
This change to Apple 's laptops is almost a shocking admission by Apple that it was wrong about media card readers .
Apple was the only major PC manufacturer that did not offer a card reader and , until now , it seemed to think it was relatively unimportant .
In a way , it was right .
You do n't need a card reader to get your photos off your iPhone .
Just dock it or send them to someone via e-mail .
Those who love digital photography and are buying D - SLRs that use high - capacity SD cards were probably wondering why Apple had forsaken them .
Perhaps these folks even chose to buy a Windows PC instead simply because of the availability of a reader .
However , it seems like someone at Apple finally realized that the company was forcing some consumers to choose .
Now the new MacBooks and MacBook Pros will have an SD card slot .
What could be next ?
Video ! :
The iPhone can finally capture video .
It 's only VGA , but it 's video .
Say it with me : Video !
i Phone 3G S : When I told someone about the new phone , he automatically thought the " 3G S " meant some sort of broadband cellular network beyond " 3G . "
No , I explained , " the ' S ' is just part of a new model name and it stands for speed . "
The new model also has a much better camera , with 3 megapixels , auto focus , and even an automatic macro feature ( at 10 centimeters ) .
These features , despite the introduction of an SD card slot on MacBooks , could make the iPhone 3G S your primary , if not only , digital camera .
Good Prices : Both the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3G S will run iPhone OS 3.0 this summer ( it 's available on June 17 ) .
So , many of the benefits outlined in Schiller 's WWDC keynote apply to both phones .
To my mind , this means that the $ 99 iPhone 3G becomes more attractive than ever , and it will likely outstrip the new iPhone 3G S in sales for the remainder of 2009 .
Did I mention that Apple is offering the Snow Leopard update for $ 29 ?
No , that is not a typo .
Business Skills :
Make no mistake , Apple is more interested in the enterprise than ever .
The additions of tethering and cut-and - paste capabilities to the iPhone OS 3.0 are designed to satisfy business users .
Now Microsoft Exchange support is being built right into OS X .
This announcement received one of the biggest rounds of applause during the keynote and for good reason .
When the new OS ships , Macs will be able to integrate seamlessly with Exchange - based offices .
Again , this is not necessarily the most exciting announcement , but one that could have the biggest long - term impact on users and Apple .
WHAT'S MISSING
No Tablet :
Not only was there no new Mac tablet , but the dream of a larger iPhone form factor evaporated as well .
Even the $ 99 iPhone is n't what people thought it would be .
There were all these concept drawings for a tiny almost nano - sized iPhone floating around before yesterday .
Everyone figured that it was the only way Apple could sell the iPhone cheap .
Ah , but Apple pulled a fast one and simply reduced the price of the current iPhone .
That was pretty sneaky but also very smart .
Apple knows it has a form factor that works ( it 's sold 40 million iPhones and iPod touches ) .
Why mess with perfection ?
No Major OS X Interface Overhaul : I 'd heard rumors about something called " marble " that would radically remake the OS X interface , but the details on Snow Leopard indicated more subtle enhancements .
Finder , for example , has been rewritten , but still looks the same .
QuickTime X , however , does n't .
Apple showed it running in a frameless window .
No Apple TV :
This aimless product is , I believe , officially destined to go nowhere .
Apple wants people to use it to view a library of film and television content from iTunes on their TVs , but I think most people use it for music .
There are so many better options for on - demand video anyway , such as the , the , and , of course , the , which will soon provide access to Netflix Watch Instantly movies directly through the gaming console .
Apple left talk of the set - top box out of this event , and I expect it 'll soon walk away from it altogether .
No Multitasking :
We knew this already .
Apple did not introduce it with iPhone 3.0 and showed no indication that new hardware would change anything .
The iPhone is simply not a multitasking platform .
We 'll just have to deal with it .
No Steve Jobs : I am honestly surprised that Jobs did n't even appear via video .
It would have been something if some video was shot with the now video - capable iPhone 3G S. I wanted Jobs there not just because he always brings something exciting to whatever event he keynotes , but because I was hoping he was well enough to make his first public appearance in months .
I want the guy to be healthy , and I 'd like to see him firmly at the helm of Apple once again .
Perhaps if / when he is there 'll be more pizzazz in these Apple keynote events .
Apple did not disappoint , but you have to wonder if it 's feeling the heat of competitors like RIM , Google , and Palm .
These companies have bridged much of the gap between existing mobile products and the iPhone .
Trust me , Apple wo n't maintain its lead in the market if it continues making iterative updates .
Whilst meandering across the interwebs , I found to my surprise that Steven Seagal – the legendary martial arts , ass - kicking , Japanese - infused American actor – has his own energy drink called Lightning Bolt !
What ’s unique about this little cocktail is that it ’s 100 % fruit juice , none of that nasty taurine glow in the dark stuff – just totally natural ingredients .
Here ’s the blurb :
When Steven Seagal finished creating a drink that holds untold natural power , there was only one equivalent in nature – The Steven Seagal ’s Lightning Bolt .
Both mysterious and powerful , it ’s a symbol of the untold energy the earth has to offer - Such is Steven Seagals Lightning Bolt energy drink .
Amazingly this incredible drink , available in Asian Experience and Cherry Charge , can be purchased from Wal - Marts , 99 Cent Stores and even the official Steven Seagal store !
You , too , can chug the juice of Mr. Seagal himself and may even be able to harness the awesome power of lightning bolts , just like this kid :

Beat that Gatorade !
Linda Cook – the Shell executive once tipped for the top job – has resigned unexpectedly , forfeiting an £ 800,000 bonus in the process .
Ms Cook worked for the Anglo - Dutch giant for 29 years , most recently as executive director of the company 's gas and power division , which includes Shell 's fast - growing liquefied natural gas unit .
Her departure comes just as Shell is expected to announce a major restructuring that could see her division merged with the company 's other main unit , exploration and production , a move that Ms Cook is believed to have opposed .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
She was also one of a number of internal candidates in the running to succeed the outgoing chief executive , Jeroen van der Veer , and , if successful , would have been the first female boss of a major oil company .
But she was beaten to the post by the chief financial officer , Peter Voser , and will instead step down at the end of this week , although she will retain an advisory role at the company until a successor is found .
By handing in her notice , Ms Cook has given up the £ 800,000 loyalty payment due to unsuccessful applicants who remain with the company for a further three years .
Mr Voser , who will take over next month , is putting together his management team .
The company says that Ms Cook 's departure is by mutual consent .
Mr van der Veer said : " I am most grateful to Linda Cook for her many important contributions to the success of our company . "
But City gossip suggests that Mr Voser and Ms Cook do not get along .
The surprise departure of a high - profile executive is just the latest of Shell 's problems .
Last week , 59 per cent of shareholders voted down the directors ' remuneration package at a fractious annual general meeting and called for millions of pounds worth of bonuses to be repaid .
The row escalated over the weekend as a number of large investors demanded the resignation of Sir Peter Job , the chairman of the remuneration committee that has signed off discretionary share awards for executives despite the company 's failure to meet targets on shareholder returns .

Even worse than the pay scandal is the start of the New York court case accusing Shell of complicity in the death of Ken Saro - Wiwa , the environmental activist executed by the Nigerian government in 1995 .
The civil trial was due to start today but was last night delayed , according to the Centre for Constitutional Rights , which is a representative for the plaintiffs .
Shell denies any involvement in the killing of Mr Saro - Wiwa , but whichever way the trial goes it will not be good news .
One of Mr Saro - Wiwa 's main cause célèbres was gas flaring in the Niger Delta .
Energy companies , particularly
Shell , have been flaring gas in Nigeria for more than 30 years .
The company has a " flare down " programme , but has refused to provide a timetable .
Green groups claim that flaring in Nigeria emits as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year as 18 million cars and have branded Shell as the most carbon - intensive of the big oil companies .
The Saro - Wiwa case will refocus attention on the issue , says James Marriott , from the lobby group Platform .
" The oil companies would never flare gas like this in continental Europe – it would be laughable . "
As we all know , Transformers 2 : Revenge of the Fallen opens this week .
If you are a true fanboy , you 'll skip work and go see the flick at the afternoon showing .
If you feel like you can't skip work to go see a movie , here are ten reasons that will hopefully persuade you to play sick for the afternoon :
10 : Fred Jones is in it .
Not really , but legendary voice actor Frank Welker is .
While he provided the voice of Fred on Scooby - Doo , he also was the dulcet tones behind such Transformers greats as Megatron , Soundwave , Skywarp , Lazerbeak , Rumble , Frenzy , Ravage , and Buzzsaw .
He voices Soundwave & Devastator in Fallen .
CGI or Flesh & Blood ?
You decide !
( image : Dreamworks )
9 : Megan Fox is in it .
While there are rumors that she 's actually CGI - animated herself , Megan Fox is proving that she 's much more than just eye candy .
She 's eye candy that can run really fast from giant CGI robots .
8 : All right — for the ladies — Josh Duhamel is in it .
It 's only fair .
Look at that jawline !
While Shia LaBeouf is the hero of Fallen , Josh is the beefcake .
Is n't he dreamy ladies ?
( image : Dreamworks )
7 : Lots of things blow up .
To put it simply , Michael Bay likes to destroy pretty much everything .
Even if the plot is vacant ( see : Bad Boys II ) or if he 's slaughtering history ( see : Pearl Harbor ) there is always plenty of action .
Not bad for a guy who used to direct Meat Loaf music videos .
6 : It'll knock The Proposal out of the Top 10 Box Office .
Let 's put the shlock romantic comedies to bed for the rest of the year , or at least the remainder of the summer .
First Fallen then G.I. Joe and Harry Potter are sure to keep them down for a while .
5 : The Constructicons are in it .
Remember this line of Decepticons ?
They were the best because if you got all six of the toys together , you could make Devastator .
One of the best Transformers toys ever .

4 : Peter Cullen is still the voice of Optimus Prime .
He damn well better be .
The studio probably did n't want to even bother considering a Transformers movie until Cullen signed on .
The fan outcry when the first one was in the works was so huge , that there was no chance it would have made any money without him .
Prime only has one voice .
3 : It 's coming out in the middle of the week .
Which means it 's not coming out on the weekend .
Which means you 'll only have one night instead of three to see it before going into work the next day and being the only fanboy that has n't seen it .
You really want to be that guy ?
2 : It 's not Wolverine .
Which means it 's a movie full of giant space robots beating the crap out of each other .
That is , no matter what happens you wo n't be set up for disappointment .
1 : There is no school .
It 's summer .
Your kids do n't need an excuse to be pulled out of school to go see a movie .
You 're the only one that needs an excuse .
And now you 've got ten .
Go get your kids and a couple giant tubs of popcorn and let me know how awesome it is ...
I do n't get out of work until five .

Señor , señor , do you know where we 're headin ' ?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon ?
Seems like I been down this way before .
Is there any truth in that , señor ?
-- Bob Dylan " Señor ( Tales of Yankee Power ) "
Yesterday , we briefly took up a Daily Kos piece that declared , with quivering fervor , that America 's ever - expanding and ever - more - deadly military intervention in Central Asia is actually an act of purest altruism , aimed solely -- solely , we were told -- at preventing those lesser breeds under the law on the subcontinent from blowing their silly - billy selves up in a nuclear war .
We were also informed that anyone who did n't like Barack Obama 's " continuity " -- and expansion -- of Bush 's policies in the region was just a malevolent malcontent who did n't care about the millions of people who would surely die if America withdraw its entirely benign protection from Pakistan .
I did n't engage in a point - by - point rebuttal of the post -- even thourgh there was certainly meet food to feed upon in that regard -- because , quite frankly , I could n't see the point in wasting time and energy on such a -- how to put it charitably ?
-- jejune production .
So today let us depart from the fairy tale Pakistan concocted by our ever - earnest " progressives " in their increasingly desperate , well - nigh contortionist efforts to justify the brutal , bloody , lawless policies of the latest " safe pair of hands " picked to manage the militarist empire for a season or two .
Instead , let 's listen to someone who might actually know what he 's talking about -- always a rarity in our modern political discourse .
Here 's Eric Margolis on " stirring a hornet 's nest in Pakistan . "
It 's worth quoting at length :
Pakistan finally bowed to Washington 's angry demands last week by unleashing its military against rebellious Pashtun tribesmen of North - West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) -- collectively mislabelled " Taliban " in the West .
The Obama administration had threatened to stop $ 2 billion US annual cash payments to bankrupt Pakistan 's political and military leadership and block $ 6.5 billion future aid , unless Islamabad sent its soldiers into Pakistan 's turbulent NWFP along the Afghan frontier .
The result was a bloodbath : Some 1,000 " terrorists " killed ( read : mostly civilians ) and 1.2 million people -- most of Swat 's population -- made refugees .
By the way , these many deaths and gargantuan discolations are what our eternally hopeful progressives call the positive results of " our policy in Pakistan . "
[ Emphasis added . ]
Yes , many progressives now identify themselves personally with the same war machine -- and the same policies -- they were condemning with such vociferous heat just a few months ago .
It becomes clearer all the time that for many , many " dissidents " of the past decade , it was not really the substance of the Bush Regime 's high crimes and monstrous follies that bothered them ; it was the fact these crimes and follies were being committed by the wrong side in the factional tussles of the imperial court .
Once their guy had been draped with the purple , the Terror War and its discontents were suddenly transformed into wise , far - seeing acts of benevolence .
Now back to Margolis :
Unable to pacify Afghanistan 's Pashtun tribes ( a.k.a. Taliban ) , a deeply frustrated Washington has begun tearing Pakistan apart in an effort to end Pashtun resistance in both nations .
CIA drone aircraft have so far killed over 700 Pakistani Pashtun .
Only 6 % were militants , according to Pakistan 's media , the rest civilians .
Pashtun , also improperly called Pathan , are the world 's largest tribal people .
Fifteen million live in Afghanistan , forming half its population .
Twenty - six million live right across the border in Pakistan .
Britain 's imperialists divided Pashtun by an artificial border , the Durand Line ( today 's Afghan - Pakistan border ) .
Pashtun reject it .
Many Pashtun tribes agreed to join Pakistan in 1947 , provided much of their homeland be autonomous and free of government troops .
Pashtun Swat only joined Pakistan in 1969 .
As Pakistan 's Pashtun increasingly aided Pashtun resistance in Afghanistan , U.S. drones began attacking them .
Washington forced Islamabad to violate its own constitution by sending troops into Pashtun lands .
The result was the current explosion of Pashtun anger .
I have been to war with the Pashtun and have seen their legendary courage , strong sense of honour and determination .
They are also hugely quarrelsome , feuding and prickly ....
Now , Washington 's ham - handed policies and last week 's Swat atrocity threaten to ignite Pakistan 's second worst nightmare after invasion by India :
That its 26 million Pashtun will secede and join Afghanistan 's Pashtun to form an independent Pashtun state , Pashtunistan .
This would rend Pakistan asunder , probably provoke its restive Baluchi tribes to secede and tempt mighty India to intervene militarily , risking nuclear war with beleaguered Pakistan .
That 's right : the nightmare scenario of subcontinental nuclear war that is evoked so shamelessly by Obama and his sycophants to " justify " the " Af - Pak " escalation is in fact made much more likely by Obama 's own policies .
Indeed , it would probably not be too much to say that at this juncture in history , it is only such American policies that could tip the region over into nuclear war .
For as Margolis makes clear , the jejeunistas ' fearmongering fantasies of a " nuclear Taliban " are baseless .
The real dangers lie elsewhere :
The Pashtun of NWFP have no intention or capability of moving into Pakistan 's other provinces , Punjab , Sindh and Baluchistan .
They just want to be left alone .
Alarms of a " Taliban takeover of Pakistan " are pure propaganda .
Lowland Pakistanis repeatedly have rejected militant Islamic parties .
Many have little love for Pashtun , whom they regard as mountain wild men best avoided .
Nor are Pakistan 's well - guarded nukes a danger -- at least not yet .
Alarms about Pakistan 's nukes come from the same fabricators with hidden agendas who brought us Saddam Hussein 's bogus weapons .
The real danger is in the U.S. acting like an enraged mastodon , trampling Pakistan under foot , and forcing Islamabad 's military to make war on its own people .
Pakistan could end up like U.S. - occupied Iraq , split into three parts and helpless ...
As in Iraq , profound ignorance and gung ho military arrogance drive U.S. Afghan policy .
Obama 's people have no understanding what they are getting into in " AfPak . "
I can tell them :
An unholy mess we will long regret .
II .
This genuine nightmare scenario -- Pakistan 's proxy - warring against the Pashtuns on behalf of America 's energy - driven dominationist policies -- is growing apace .
Pakistani military forces are preparing to follow the American leader in an upcoming attack on the largest town in the Swat Valley , ready to turn Mingora into another Fallujah .
As AP reports :
The Pakistan army readied a major assault to rid the main town in the Swat Valley of entrenched Taliban militants ...
The dusty streets of Mingora were mostly empty on Friday — one resident said some unidentified bodies lay unburied there .
The government relaxed a curfew to allow thousands of refugees to leave with whatever possessions they could carry ahead of what is expected to be bloody fighting .
So far , the nine - day - old army offensive in Swat — which is 100 miles from Islamabad , Pakistan 's capital — has n't moved into the valley 's towns .
Those who managed to escape Mingora , where five headless bodies were found this week , warned that the army would face tough resistance from deeply entrenched Taliban in the city .
Shaukat Saleem , a Mingora resident who escaped from Swat on Friday , said the Taliban had blocked roads in the city with trees and boulders .
They 've mined the streets , dug trenches , made bunkers and occupied many civilian homes , he said .
He said that he saw " lots " of Taliban as he was leaving the city , who stopped him for questioning at 10 to 12 of their checkpoints ....
The army estimated earlier this week that as many as 200,000 civilians were still in Mingora , and it was unknown how many remained there after Friday 's exodus .
The army said that it had cleared the area that leads to Mingora from the south as far as Udigram , a village on the outskirts of the city .
In Fallujah , American forces ringed the city for months -- after one failed attempt to take the town -- and allowed thousands of citizens to flee into destitute exile , while thousands more remained behind , with nowhere to go .
Shortly after Bush 's re-election in 2004 , Fallujah was systematically destroyed -- Gronzy - style , Guernica - style -- in an operation that openly targeted medical centers ( to prevent bad press about civilian casualties ) and mowed down many civilians in its relentless churning .
The Fallujah operation was of course only one small part of a vast , sprawling , still - ongoing war crime that has killed more than one million innocent human beings -- an " extraordinary achievement " indeed , in President Obama 's laudatory words .
But even in the midst of this burning lake of corpses , the murderous beserkers in the Beltway and the Pentagon have the gold - plated gall to criticize the Pakistanis for their " heavy - handedness " in an operation urged on them by -- the Americans !
McClatchy :
The U.S. military has encouraged its Pakistani allies to embrace counterinsurgency tactics , which call for winning civilian support , not just killing the enemy and seizing ground .
Some U.S. officials , however , worry that the Pakistani army is n't willing or able to move away from traditional war - fighting tactics .
" If you talk to the ( Pakistani ) military leadership , they say they get it , but do they understand it the way we understand it ? " a senior U.S. military official told McClatchy , speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to be more candid .
" Often their definition of counterinsurgency is warning a village before an attack .
That 's it . "
Really , this sort of thing is almost beyond comment .
" Do they understand it the way we understand it ? " says the spokesman of a military that launched a Hitlerian war of aggression on knowingly false pretenses , and has just had one of its main practitioners of murderous " dirty war " put in charge of its entire " Af - Pak " operations -- at the order of the " progressive " president .
To find apt comparisons to such horrific irony , you 'd have to reach back to the Eastern Front in World War II : " Reichsfuhrer Himmler , I regret to inform you that some of our Lithuanian auxilliaries have been entirely too primitive in their counterinsurgency tactics against the Jews .
Our proxies are too openly brutal -- sometimes clubbing old men and children to death right in the center of town , causing unnecessary distress among the locals .
They are sorely lacking in the efficiency and professionalism of our SS cadres , who escort their charges calmly and humanely to carefully pre-prepared pits far beyond the outskirts .
It is more regrettable . "
Washington is also upset because Pakistan refuses to put its military entirely at the disposal of the imperial agenda :
To the frustration of Washington and other Western allies , Pakistan continues to deploy most of its army on its eastern border to safeguard against its traditional enemy , India , which it fears might attack while it 's fighting the Taliban on its western border .
Just think of that : a sovereign nation having the nerve to decide its own strategic priorities , and actually commiting the bulk of its forces to defend against a much larger , nuclear - armed nation with which it has fought several major wars over the decades across a still highly volatile , hotly disputed border !
What effrontery to the Great Sahib !
Meanwhile , even as Pakistan 's American - fueled " surge " in Swat was driving more than a million people from their homes , Washington was throwing more gasoline on the flames of extremism with more drone strikes , killing at least 40 people , as Pakistan 's The News reports :
Forty people , most of them militants , were killed and several others critically injured in two successive attacks by US spy planes at Khaisur village of Mirali subdivision of North Waziristan Agency on Saturday morning ....
It is astonishing that despite a full - scale military operation launched by Pakistan against the Taliban in the Malakand region , the US forces are yet to stop targeting the tribal areas while the drone strikes have been fuelling anger among the people against the Pakistan government and the armed forces .
Yes , there does seem to a bit of miscommunication between the imperial center and its servants in the hinterlands .
But not to worry : soon they 'll all be singing from the same hymn sheet , as AP reports :
U.S. forces are already training a Pakistani paramilitary force in the frontier region , considered the likely hiding place of al - Qaida chief Osama bin Laden .
I think they mean " resting place , " but never mind .
A senior U.S. defense official said the Pentagon was considering plans to accelerate and expand that training .
U.S. and Pakistani officials are discussing a program that would increase the number of U.S. special operations trainers in the country and expand the schooling to the regular army , said the senior official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions are preliminary and no decisions have been made .
Small demonstrated this with functional - MRI scans , which reveal real - time brain activity .
Half of the 24 study participants used the Internet on a daily basis , and the other half had little to no experience .
( Yes , those people exist , and they 're easier to find if you look for people older than 60 . )
First , Small compared the participants ' brain activity as they read a book off a computer screen , and both groups produced similar results .
But when he examined the groups as they hunted for clues about the benefits of eating chocolate and the best way to visit the Galápagos , the Web - experienced group registered twice as much activity in the frontal , temporal and cingulate areas of the brain — all of which contribute to complex reasoning .
As D- has said in his post * here * the weekend was a bit of a disaster , well in terms of being invited to play on a boat with people we thought were a well rounded swinging couple and they turned out to be rude and inhospitable , it does not matter if they wish to play on their own , in fact that is everyone ’s right , pulling a dildo out to play with yourself while your partner is screwing another one is a bit of a novel experience for me , especially when there are three other people present who could and would have helped you play but as D - said , it was an experience !
Anyway , D- decided that we were not going to let it spoil the whole weekend and as I had previously wanted to sort the garage out , this is what Sunday was spent doing , well it started off being what we were doing , and it ended up being a new room to play in , and omg , did we all play !!
The garage was clean , and the exercise equipment was moved , as I was sitting on the bench D- slipped some cuffs around my wrists and laid me down , tying me to the built in ladder on the wall , next came the blind fold and I was completely in the dark , not knowing what to expect but knowing it would be something I would enjoy , and I did , immensely !
If you have never had wax dripped over your body while tied and blindfolded , please speak to your partner and research how to do it , it is one of the most erotic experiences I have ever had , the heat from the wax dripping over your swollen pussy , your nipples hard and covered in wax , hell even thinking about it is making me wet !
add to that a few paddles on the ass as D - was lifting my legs and I can say I was in heaven and all thoughts of the previous few days on the boat were wiped from my memory , all I could think of was the pleasure and wanting D - ‘s cock to fill me in any and every way , something he was happy to oblige with .
Both our friend and I were left feeling sated and worn out , candles were blown out and a group shower was next on the list of things to do , word of warning men , do not shower with two highly charged women , it can and does lead to the play being taken to another place but not stopped , poor D - he had pleasured two women for close to 5 hours , finally we let him take a nap , after all we had an ulterior motive , we wanted him fresh for the evening to cum , sorry come , and he looks so sweet sleeping with a grin on his face , hope his dreams lived up to our reality .

A Proclamation .
Whereas , the Senate of the United States , devoutly recognizing the Supreme Authority and just Government of Almighty God , in all the affairs of men and of nations , has , by a resolution , requested the President to designate and set apart a day for National prayer and humiliation .
And whereas it is the duty of nations as well as of men , to own their dependence upon the overruling power of God , to confess their sins and transgressions , in humble sorrow , yet with assured hope that genuine repentance will lead to mercy and pardon ; and to recognize the sublime truth , announced in the Holy Scriptures and proven by all history , that those nations only are blessed whose God is the Lord .
And , insomuch as we know that , by His divine law , nations like individuals are subjected to punishments and chastisements in this world , may we not justly fear that the awful calamity of civil war , which now desolates the land , may be but a punishment , inflicted upon us , for our presumptuous sins , to the needful end of our national reformation as a whole People ?
We have been the recipients of the choicest bounties of Heaven .
We have been preserved , these many years , in peace and prosperity .
We have grown in numbers , wealth and power , as no other nation has ever grown .
But we have forgotten God .
We have forgotten the gracious hand which preserved us in peace , and multiplied and enriched and strengthened us ; and we have vainly imagined , in the deceitfulness of our hearts , that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom and virtue of our own .
Intoxicated with unbroken success , we have become too self - sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming and preserving grace , too proud to pray to the God that made us !
It behooves us then , to humble ourselves before the offended Power , to confess our national sins , and to pray for clemency and forgiveness .
Now , therefore , in compliance with the request , and fully concurring in the views of the Senate , I do , by this my proclamation , designate and set apart Thursday , the 30th .
day of April , 1863 , as a day of national humiliation , fasting and prayer .
And I do hereby request all the People to abstain , on that day , from their ordinary secular pursuits , and to unite , at their several places of public worship and their respective homes , in keeping the day holy to the Lord , and devoted to the humble discharge of the religious duties proper to that solemn occasion .
All this being done , in sincerity and truth , let us then rest humbly in the hope authorized by the Divine teachings , that the united cry of the Nation will be heard on high , and answered with blessings , no less than the pardon of our national sins , and the restoration of our now divided and suffering Country , to its former happy condition of unity and peace .
In witness whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed .
Done at the City of Washington , this thirtieth day of March , in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty - three , and of the Independence of the United States the eighty seventh .
By the President : Abraham Lincoln
William H. Seward , Secretary of State .
It 's all supposed to be about campaign promises .
Did n't Barack Obama promise to deliver an address from a " Muslim capital " in his first 100 days ?
It 's got to be in a safe , moderate country , of course , but where better than Mustafa Kemal Ataturk 's secular / Islamist nation of Turkey , whose rulers talk to Syria as well as Israel , Iran as well as Iraq ?
But when the Obama cavalcade turned up in the heart of the old Ottoman Empire last night , he and all his panjandrums were praying that he did not have to use the " G " word .
The " G " word ?
Well , if it does n't trip him up in Turkey today , Mr Obama is going to have to walk into a far worse minefield on 24 April when he has to honour another campaign promise : to call the 1915 massacre of 1,500,000 Armenian Christians by Ottoman Turkey a " genocide " .
Presidents Clinton and Bush jnr made the same pledge in return for Armenian votes , then broke their solemn promise when Turkish generals threatened to cut access to their airbases and major US - Turkish business deals after they were in office .
This is no mere academic backwater into which Mr Obama must step but a dangerous confrontation with the truth of history , an explosive swamp of bones and old photographs – along with a few still - living survivors – through which he must either walk with dignity or retreat with shame ; and the entire Middle East will be watching the results .
For the Palestinians – most of whom , ironically , are Sunni Muslims , the same religion as the Ottoman Turkish murderers – it is a crucial issue .
For if Mr Obama cannot risk offending America 's Turkish allies about a 94 - year - old persecution , what chance is there that he will risk offending America 's even more powerful ally , Israel , by condemning the Israeli occupation of Palestinian land , the ever - growing illegal Jewish settlements on the West Bank and the constant destruction by Israel of Palestinian homes that prevent the creation of a Palestinian state ?

Starting on 24 April 1915 , Enver Pasha's Turkish army and militias rounded up almost the entire Armenian community , massacred hundreds of thousands of men and sent vast death marches of women and children into the deserts of Anatolia and what is now northern Syria .
Expert historians , including Israel 's own top genocide academic , insist that the shooting - pits , the organised throat - cutting , the mass rapes and kidnappings – even the use of primitive suffocation chambers – all constituted a systematic genocide .
And it is important to record exactly what Mr Obama said on his campaign website in January 2008 .
" The Armenian genocide is not an allegation , a personal opinion , or a point of view , but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence .
America deserves a leader who speaks truthfully about the Armenian genocide and responds forcefully to all genocides .
I intend to be that president . "
Which pretty much locks up any attempt to wriggle out of the promise .
Or so you would think .
But already the administration 's soft shoes have been trying to finesse away the pledge .
" At this moment , " Mike Hammer , a White House National Security Council spokesman , said last month , " our focus is on how , moving forward , the US can help Turkey and Armenia work together to come to terms with the past " .
That Mr Obama should allow such a statement to be made , along with the usual weasel clichés about " moving forward " and " coming to terms " , speaks volumes .
Neither the Palestinians nor the Arabs in general have tried to – or should – compare the 1915 slaughter with Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians , but there are some faint historical mirrors which rightly worry them .
The Turks allege that they began killing Armenians in the city of Van because Armenian insurgents , backed by a regional superpower , in this case , Tsarist Russia , attacked the Turks of eastern Anatolia .
Israel claims it bombarded Gaza last December and January because Palestinian " terrorists " , backed by a regional superpower – Iran – fired rockets at Israelis .
The political parallels are not exact , of course , but Israel can in any case scarcely debate them when it officially refuses to acknowledge the Armenian genocide in the first place .
But for Mr Obama , there are more pressing points .
US and Turkish officials are already discussing how Ankara can help in a US military withdrawal from Iraq , and Mr Obama desperately wants Turkey to help open up the Muslim world to his government to staunch the massive wounds the Bush administration inflicted .
Mr Johnson is calling for a " root and branch " examination of the system Gordon Brown should hold a national referendum on electoral reform , Health Secretary Alan Johnson has said .
The prime minister should offer the public a " genuinely radical alternative " to the present system , he wrote in the Times .
A referendum could be held on the same day as a general election , said Mr Johnson , who has denied his reform call is part of a Labour leadership bid .
The Electoral Reform Society said his idea was " a breath of fresh air " .
' Overhaul the engine ' Mr Johnson , who has been widely tipped as a potential successor to Mr Brown , urged the prime minister to involve the public in " a root and branch examination " of the political system in order to regain trust following the expenses scandal .
" We need to overhaul the engine , not just clean the upholstery , " he wrote .

Under the current system , sometimes called " first past the post " or " winner takes all " , the successful candidate is the one with the most votes , with no requirement for them to gain an absolute majority .
But Mr Johnson said the government had the mandate to change that and should hold a referendum on " a specific new system " .
However , the heath secretary later revealed he did not clear his article outlining his proposals with the prime minister before publication , although he said he did discuss it with people close to Mr Brown .
And he denied his call for a referendum was part of a bid for the Labour leadership .
" No , and it 's quite unfair to suggest that it is .
It is absolutely nothing to do with that , " he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One .
The system Mr Johnson favours is known as Alternative Vote Plus
The new system Mr Johnson favours is known as Alternative Vote Plus and was first suggested by the Independent Commission on Electoral Reform , led by Lord Jenkins , in 1998 .
Under AV
Plus , voters would have two ballot papers : one for their constituency representative and a second for their favoured political party .
Most seats in the Commons would be filled with locally elected MPs , but the remainder would be allocated by proportional representation according to the number of votes cast for each party .
Calling this an " elegant " option , Mr Johnson said : " This is a genuinely radical alternative that only Labour in government can facilitate . "
Fundamental issue Speaking to the BBC , he said the review of the voting system would be part of a fundamental examination of the political system .
" We 're going to look at fixed term parliaments , reform of the House of Lords , more power for Parliament over the executive , " he said .

Climate Change secretary Ed Miliband later said he agreed that any reform of the political system needed to go beyond the issue of expenses .
" We need to have a much wider debate in Britain about how a Parliament works , how we elect our representatives and how we can transform more power to people themselves , " he said .
Dr Ken Ritchie , chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society , said Mr Johnson should be congratulated for speaking out about the need to overhaul the " decrepit first - past - the - post system " .
" His proposal ... is a breath of fresh air in the debate on MPs ' expenses that risks turning into a cul - de- sac , " Dr Ritchie said .
The idea of proportional representation is simply not popular in our party , it 's not popular in the Tory party , and even if there was a referendum held , it would not be binding
Labour MP Sir Stuart Bell UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Johnson seemed to be the only Labour politician who had got the issue right .
" What the laws are , that 's properly the province of Parliament , however elected .
But how the laws are made is something that must be put to a referendum , " he said .
But Sir Stuart Bell , Labour MP for Middlesbrough , said Mr Johnson 's electoral reform proposals had little support in the House of Commons and would never be implemented .
" The idea of proportional representation is simply not popular in our party , it 's not popular in the Tory party , and even if there was a referendum held , it would not be binding , " he said .
" It could only be consultative , and a sovereign Parliament , elected after the next election , would simply ignore it . "

Experts and military contractors say that the Obama Administration ’s quest to build more and more coalitions across the world is going to mean boom times for the arms export industry , even as the world ’s economy faces a crippling recession .
A Boeing executive predicted that the Obama Administration would allow exports of even more advanced US weaponry than his predecessor George W. Bush did .
“ I think that all bodes well for our allies and the discussions that would take place on things they ’d like to have , ” the official said .
Despite the struggling world economy , many nations have an eye toward modernizing their militaries , and with the Obama Administration shifting its military budgets out of some of the more expensive projects , US contractors are looking for ways to pad their bottom lines .
The United States is by far the world ’s larger exporter of weapons , and that trend looks to continue under President Obama .
It has , however , normally restricted the sales of its most advanced technology to a select few nations .
If this changes , the lead could become even more pronounced .
The Italian mob has probably never had it so good .
Italy 's various crime syndicates – lumped together colloquially as Mafia Inc – are gobbling up petrol stations , muscling in on supermarket franchises , making loans to cash - starved businesses , taking over trattorias and acquiring buildings in swanky neighbourhoods in Rome and Milan , investigators say .
These mobsters have lots of what is in short supply these days – liquidity – as well as centuries - honed expertise in preying on the vulnerable .
It means the mob is free to sink cash into two areas at the heart of the global meltdown : property and credit markets .
The crime syndicates are flush with billions of euros from extortion , drug trafficking , and booming sales in fake designer clothing made in China expressly for the Italian mob .
Italy has scored some spectacular successes in its decades - long fight against the Mafia , capturing top bosses , persuading turncoats to testify , and encouraging citizens to resist shakedowns .
But the mob keeps growing .
In Rome , in the high - rent neighbourhoods around the Spanish Steps , Piazza Navona and Trevi Fountain , mobsters are snapping up property , anti-Mafia prosecutor Giancarlo Capaldo said .
" These places are well run because they want to make money , " Mr Capaldo said .
He declined to identify the establishments because the probe is ongoing , adding only " you 'll find some of them in tourist guide books " .
Capaldo 's office also confiscated car dealerships in Rome from suspected Camorristi or their allies .

And , in his Naples office , customs and tax police General Giovanni Mainolfi said : " The Camorra makes the money here in the south , but it invests it in legal activities up north . "
In an operation codenamed " Easy Money " , police this year seized a hotel in the exclusive Tuscan resort of Punta Ala , as well as a supermarket , two Ferraris , a petrol station in the wealthy Reggio Emilia region and other properties , totalling about $ 40 m ( £ 27 m ) .
All were believed to be owned by the Camorra , .
The Rome - based Eurispes think tank has estimated that in 2008 , " Mafia Inc " earned $ 167bn , or about 8 per cent of Italy 's GDP , from its criminal activities , nearly half of that from drugs .
And Eurispes , which analyses social , economic and criminal trends , said loan - sharking brought in an estimated $ 17bn of that income .
It calculated that some 180,000 business people got their loans , directly or indirectly , through organised crime in Italy .
A main engine of the mob 's recent strength – loan - sharking – is thriving as banks hoard cash .
SOS Impresa , an Italian business lobby dedicated to fighting organised crime , estimated in a report late last year that the Naples - based mob , the Camorra , has " multiplied by 100 , perhaps 1,000 times , its penetration of the economic and social fabric , stepping up its business presence in our country , in Europe and the world . "
In Rome , Camorra men , or those in their employ , have been spotted at pawnbrokers ' auctions , learning which businesses might be in financial straits , said Carabinieri Lt Col Roberto Casagrande .
The Camorra offers shaky businesses attractive interest rates , calculating that the businesses will end up part of its economic empire if the owner falls behind .
The mobsters sometimes leave the original owner as a figurehead to thwart suspicion , police said .
The ' Ndrangheta crime syndicate – based in Calabria , the " toe " of Italy 's boot – is also taking over struggling businesses and snapping up prime northern Italian property at a bargain .
Genoa Mayor Marta Vincenzi told a rally against organised crime in Naples late this spring that Mafia bosses , particularly from the ' Ndrangheta , were " gobbling up entire neighbourhoods " and pressuring merchants to pay " protection money " in the gritty , northwestern port city .
The Eurispes think tank estimated counterfeit designer goods earned the mob $ 8.5 bn last year .
The Camorra bosses have forged closer ties with mobsters in China , where fake designer clothing , shoes and accessories are churned out in factories for the mob .
The returns from fake designer goods are becoming more profitable for the Neapolitan syndicate than dealing in cocaine and hashish , said General Mainolfi .
He has calculated that for every euro spent making the goods , the Camorra earns 10 euros , while for every euro spent on drug trafficking , it earns six or seven euros .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The pace of private - sector U.S. job losses slowed dramatically last month , while future planned layoffs also declined , and the hard - hit housing sector showed signs of improvement last week .
Wednesday ’s reports are the latest indications that the U.S. economy is pulling out of freefall and may even be preparing to stop its descent , adding to hopes that have fueled a stock market rally over the last two months .
In housing , the original epicenter of the economic crisis , U.S. mortgage applications rose last week , even as interest rates jumped to their highest levels since mid-March .
The total number of U.S. private - sector job losses were much less than expected in April , hitting its lowest level since November last year , according to a report by ADP Employer Services .
Meanwhile , planned layoffs at U.S. firms fell for a third consecutive month in April , hitting their lowest level since last October , a report by global outplacement consultancy Challenger , Gray & Christmas , Inc said .
“ The mentality of economic improvement is taking hold , ” said John Spinello , chief fixed income technical strategist at Jefferies & Co in New York .
The data came ahead of Friday ’s more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report by the government .
Economists expect Friday ’s payrolls report to show the economy shed 620,000 jobs in April and the unemployment rate jumped to 8.9 percent from 8.5 percent .
On Wall Street , stocks were mixed after initially jumping nearly 1 percent , while U.S. Treasuries bounced off lows .
LESS BAD
ADP said private employers cut 491,000 jobs in April versus a revised 708,000 lost in March , originally reported as a loss of 742,000 jobs .
Economists expected 650,000 private - sector job cuts in April , according to a Reuters poll .
Though the report bolstered hopes the worst is over for the recession - bound U.S. economy , many analysts advised caution in interpreting the figures .
“ One month ’s number does not a trend make , ” Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers , told a teleconference for journalists .
However , Prakken , whose firm jointly developed the ADP Employer Services report , said the coming months ’ data on job losses should resemble April ’s improved figures rather than the steeper cuts seen in recent months .
“ Maybe improving gradually , but still fairly significant negative numbers , and I do n’t expect to see employment start rising really until sometime toward the end of the year , ” said Prakken .
He added that he expected modest but below - trend economic growth in the second half of the year .

Planned job cuts announced by U.S. employers totaled 132,590 in April , a 12 percent drop from 150,411 layoffs recorded the previous month , according to the Challenger report .
This was the lowest monthly total since 112,884 cuts were announced last October , but still up 47 percent from the 90,015 job cuts announced in the same month of 2008 .
LOAN DEMAND UP
Demand for home purchase loans , an indicator of home sales , far outweighed that for refinancing .
The increase may help gauge how the hard - hit U.S. housing market is faring this spring , the peak home - buying season .
The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage applications , which includes both purchase and refinance loans , for the week ended May 1 increased 2.0 percent to 979.7 .
Borrowing costs on 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages , excluding fees , averaged 4.79 percent , up 0.17 percentage point from the previous week , when it nearly matched the all - time low of 4.61 percent set in the week ended March 27 .
The survey has been conducted weekly since 1990 .
It was the highest since 4.89 percent in the week ended March 13 , though well below year - ago levels of 5.91 percent .
Western consumers still adjusting to losses in value of their stocks and homes are in little mood to start spending again on nonessential imports , said Joshua Felman , the assistant director of the Asia and Pacific division of the International Monetary Fund .
“ For trade to pick up , demand has to pick up , ” he said .
“ It ’s very difficult to see that happening any time soon . ”
So badly battered is the shipping industry that the daily rate to charter a large bulk freighter suitable for carrying , say , iron ore , plummeted from close to $ 300,000 last summer to a low of $ 10,000 early this year , according to H. Clarkson & Company , a London ship brokerage .
The rate has rebounded to nearly $ 25,000 in the last several weeks , and some bulk carriers have left Singapore .
But ship owners say this recovery may be short - lived because it mostly reflects a rush by Chinese steel makers to import iron ore before a possible price increase next month .
Container shipping is also showing faint signs of revival , but remains deeply depressed .
And more empty tankers are showing up here .
The cost of shipping a 40 - foot steel container full of merchandise from southern China to northern Europe tumbled from $ 1,400 plus fuel charges a year ago to as little as $ 150 early this year , before rebounding to around $ 300 , which is still below the cost of providing the service , said Neil Dekker , a container industry forecaster at Drewry Shipping Consultants in London .
Eight small companies in the industry have gone bankrupt in the last year and at least one of the major carriers is likely to fail this year , he said .
I always look forward to our annual bra makeovers , because believe it or not , 1 out of every 3 women is wearing the wrong bra size !
Although the women in our July issue had a different underlying " problem " , they were all wearing the wrong size , so along with the Town Shop here in NYC , we helped solved their biggest bra woes .
I stopped by NBC's Today Show this morning to share and here 's what we had to say :
DON'T : Choose a demi cup if you 're looking for full - sized support .
DO : Demi's have less breast coverage , so choose a full coverage style if you 're full - sized gal looking for the best support .
DON'T : Wear bras that are too big and gaping !
DO : Emily 's bra was way too big and had no structure -- leaving her bust completely shapeless .
The entire cup should lie flush against your breast with no excess fabric .
Are you wearing the right size bra ?

The eagle - eyed employees who scanned for flashing bare breasts at Disneyland and Disney 's California Adventure have been reassigned .
The move , which is sure to put the thrill back in thrill rides , took effect Sunday , according to the Associated Press .
Rides that will no longer be monitored include Splash Mountain , Tower of Terror , Space Mountain and California Screamin ' .
Disney has tried to keep exhibitionists in check over the past decade in an effort to stop nudity from appearing in souvenir photos snapped by the park and sold later to riders of the attractions .

WASHINGTON
In the last few years , an abundance of consumer demand , credit and investment coming from the rich nations combined to pull millions out of poverty worldwide .
Because the bubble - induced international conditions showered every corner of the planet , it was unpopular to point out that some countries were still in need of major reforms and would not continue to prosper indefinitely .
Now that the feast is over and the day of reckoning is here , one way to sort the chaff from the wheat is to look at the 2009 Institutional Quality Index , authored by economist Martin Krause for the International Policy Network .
It ranks countries according to how much economic freedom , democracy and rule of law they provide .
Since countries with higher scores have attracted more funds and capital than those with lower scores in recent years , the latter will likely be in deep trouble for years to come due to the changed international conditions .
In 2007 , net capital flows amounted to $ 929 billion in emerging countries ; this year the figure will be a mere $ 165 billion .
It sounds comical , but poor countries in the last couple of years have been lending more money to rich countries than the other way around .
The drying up of international funding and investment will make competition ferocious for whatever money is available ; only nations that improved their institutions when few were asking questions will get those dollars .
Having good institutions does not simply mean having an open economy .
It means underpinning the open economy with the rule of law that is , strong legal protections for persons and property .
In fact , the rule of law is so crucial that countries with relatively big and bureaucratic governments oftentimes do better than those with more open economies but more precarious legal safeguards .
This is why Latin America ranks behind Central Europe and Asia , or why Uruguay and Costa Rica are ranked much higher than Mexico and Peru , where economies are more open but the rule of law is weaker .
Cultural legacies may help explain the tendency of areas such as Central Europe ( pre-communism ) and those Caribbean islands with common law traditions ( British colonialism ) to outperform others .
And historical reasons may account for the fact that Chile , where institutional stability was greater in the 19th century , tends to do better than its neighbors even when reform stalls .
In any case , the evidence tells us that the countries with a greater combination of economic freedom and rule of law are going to be much more attractive in this post - bubble scenario characterized by very scarce international funding and investment .
Southeast Asia , Central Europe and Latin America are much better placed than , say , the Balkan nations or Eastern European laggards such as Russia , Ukraine and Belarus .
But there are big differences within each region .
The slowing down of what had been an impressive wave of reform in Vietnam and Hungary in recent years has made those countries more vulnerable than Malaysia and Slovakia to the international conditions likely to prevail in the next few years .
There is nothing predetermined about a countrys destiny : 632 million Chinese and 117 million Indians who overcame dire poverty in the last two decades attest to that .
But governments that did not reform their institutions in times of plenty are now going to face popular pressure to redistribute wealth and bend or trample the law in order to meet social claims .
The outcome will be even weaker institutions in those countries .
By all indications , Russia , Turkey , Argentina , Venezuela , Indonesia and Nigeria , to name but a few that profited from the commodities boom , will see their institutional flaws crudely exposed and their populations will suffer .
By contrast , those such as Peru , Colombia , Slovenia , Qatar , Botswana , Mauritius and Kuwait in which markets and the rule of law made progress , in some cases much more than in others , will probably outpace many of their neighbors .
The real stake for developing nations today is not so much the drying up of funding and investment but the winnowing and sifting process that is making clear which societies were living in the real world while others were simply dreaming .
The result will be the restoration of the link between institutions and economic growth that the bubble had temporarily severed .
' A Gift To History ' : The ' Vandenberg ' Slips Below The Waves As The Second - largest Intentionally Sunk Ship ; Sinking Picture Gallery
KEY WEST , Florida --
Thirteen years in the making , the plan to sink the decommissioned military ship “ Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg ” finally came to fruition today .
At 10:24 a.m. EST , cutting charges were detonated and ship quickly sank below the waves 114 seconds later .
Among the thousands on hand to witness the event , perhaps none other was as proud as Sheri Lohr , treasurer and secretary of Artificial Reefs of the Keys , the organization formed that conceived , designed and financed the Vandenberg project .
Sheri has been associated with the Vandenberg project since 1998 .
" It took 13 years to dream it and two minutes to sink " , she said .
" It stunned me .
Over the years we were delayed by fund raising , by bureaucracy , and , at the last minute by a sea turtle that wandered into the sinking zone . "
When asked what drove her to stick with the project for 13 years , she said , " I did it as a gift to history and for the town of Key West .
I held on when people did not believe it or understand it - because it was right . "
The ship , now resting 140 underwater , is second largest vessel ever intentionally sunk to become an artificial reef
Divers are working with a team of other underwater specialists to survey the ship to ensure it is safe for public diving .
Other divers are retrieving more than 20 cameras that were mounted on the ship to capture images of the “ Vandenberg ” as it sank .
Another team is securing mooring buoys near the ship .
Officials indicated the ship may be ready for public diving by Friday morning .

We ’re halfway through the Origins series of essays in honor of Charles Darwin ’s 200th birthday , and I ’d wager that the other writers who have contributed to it will agree that it ’s a guaranteed recipe for glorious failure .
The origin of life in 2000 words ?
That ’s just enough room to give a taste of the wide range of research going on these days but hardly enough to set up a proper banquet .
The same goes for my latest essay , on the origin of sex .
There , I focused on the intriguing question of why eukaryotes ( animals , plants , fungi , and protozoans ) have so much sex when it seems to come at a high cost compared with just cloning yourself .
But there ’s an equally intriguing question that I did n’t have room to address :
Do bacteria have sex , too ?
Anlace , English Wikipedia Project
If you define sex as the way we reproduce , then the answer is no .
Bacteria ( right ) are n’t born as males and females , and they do n’t make sperm and eggs .
And if you define sex as meiosis — the shuffling of two genomes to produce a new one — - again , the answer is no .
But if you define sex as the combining of DNA from two individuals , they ’ve definitely got it .
Viruses can move DNA from one bacterial host to another .
Many bacteria carry little extra ringlets of DNA called plasmids that can cause bacteria to join together so that copies of the plasmids can be transferred .
Sometimes the plasmids even drag along some of the DNA from the main chromosome .
Some species of bacteria will even secrete DNA into their surroundings and slurp up naked DNA they encounter .
This foreign genetic material can be smoothly integrated into a bacterium ’s own genome .
In some cases ( known as homologous recombination ) , the microbe takes up a different version of a gene it already has .
It swaps the new version for the old one .
In other cases ( nonhomologous recombination ) , it acquires a gene it never had before .
Like eukaryotic sex , bacterial sex has some evolutionary disadvantages .
It takes energy to secrete DNA into the environment , for example , and it also takes energy to pump it in and incorporate it into a genome .
The energy bacteria put into having sex could be used to grow faster and make more offspring .
So , once again , the question arises :
Why sex ?
In a review in this month ’s issue of Trends in Microbiology , Michiel Vos of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology takes a look at the potential answers .
A lot of them echo the answers that have been offered for the evolution of our own brand of sex .
Sex can speed up the evolution of adaptations , for example , by combining beneficial mutations from different bacteria .
Sex can bring about entirely new adaptations ( such as antibiotic resistance ) with the importing of entirely new genes .
Sex can add more variation to a population of bacteria , allowing them to adapt to an ever - changing environment , instead of getting stuck in an evolutionary dead end .
Sex may help some bacteria do a better job of making us sick by generating new variants that our immune system may not recognize very well .
It ’s possible , however , that these long - term benefits of sex do not account for their origin through the short - term , generation - by - generation process of evolution .
In fact , sex may actually be more of a side effect — what Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin termed a spandrel .
Taking in loose DNA can have an immediate benefit to bacteria that has nothing to do with sex :
It ’s good eating .
Some strains of bacteria can live on DNA alone .
The fact that sometimes some of the genes they devour end up inserted into their genome does not necessarily mean that the bacteria have evolved a full - blown sexual system .
The proteins that swap in new versions of genes during homologous recombination spend most of their time repairing damaged DNA .
They may plug new genes in purely by accident .
It ’s also possible that the adaptation for sex resides not in the bacteria but in their parasites .
Plasmids and viruses may evolve increasingly sophisticated ways to move their own DNA from host to host .
If they bring genes that benefit their new bacterial host , they benefit as well .
Vos ’s paper makes the evolution of sex in eukaryotes all the more remarkable .
Sex in eukaryotes is a far more complex process , and it ’s at the core of our biology .
Whereas bacteria occasionally swap a gene , eukaryotes blend their genomes every time they reproduce .
Biochemist Nick Lane , author of the new book Life Ascending , argues that eukaryotes became different because of a landmark event in their evolution :
A microbe took up residence in the eukaryote cell , becoming mitochondria , which we depend on to generate energy .
Now the eukaryotic genome was under constant invasion from foreign DNA , coming from close quarters .
Worst of all , this foreign DNA included viruslike segments that could make copies of themselves , swamping our own genes .
True sex — complete with meiosis — became our best defense .
If Lane is right , then it ’s bacteria we have to thank for not having sex like bacteria .
of alien dust and electrostatics
The most dangerous thing about living on the Moon is n't the radiation .
It 's the sharp , electrostatic alien dust ...
Illustration by John Hrubesch
Moon dust looks calm , gray and featureless .
That is until you disturb it and a blast of this sharp , abrasive powder hits you right in the visor .
Lunar regolith is more like our volcanic ash than anything else and eons without moisture make it so dry , it clings to anything and everything by electrostatic attraction .
On future Moon bases , this dust will get into machinery and get tracked into crew modules .
If its levels are n’t carefully managed and kept to a safe level , this microscopic hazard could cause some serious health problems .
So how exactly do you manage this unruly and dangerous alien powder ?
A previously lost data set from some experiments done by Apollo , shows that lunar regolith ’s stickiness is related to the angle of the Sun in the sky .
When our parent star ’s ultraviolet and X - rays bombard the dust during the lunar day , the tiny particles as wide as the human hair pick up a positive charge and cling to any surface on which they ’re deposited by … oh say the exhaust from a spacecraft or a bouncing astronaut .
But when the Sun is at an angle of 45 degrees or lower , the bombardment eases and the regolith loses some of its charge , allowing the lunar gravity to pull the dust down from vertical and angled surfaces .
Knowing that the Sun ’s rays give Moon dust its cling gives us an important consideration when designning a potential lunar outpost .
Not only does it have to support a crew , it should also be able to keep a good area around it in the shade .
This study also gives us something to consider when it comes to Mars .
Martian topsoil is also very dry and abrasive and the thin atmosphere , a hundredth of the Earth ’s , is n’t much of a barrier for UV and X - ray radiation .
Could the Sun give it an extra static charge as well ?
Of course on Mars , we have windy days that can clean the dust off solar panels and other equipment , but astronauts on a Martian outposts might still need to get an anti-static brush for equipment that weathered a dust storm .
An AP story ( 6/7/09 ) previewing today ’s European Parliament election is headlined on MSNBC , “ Europe Leans Right Ahead of Parliament Voting : Amid Economic Gloom , Conservatives Look Set to Win Big in Europe - Wide Poll . ”
The article , by Michael Weissenstein and Robert Wielaard , begins :
Europe was leaning to the right ahead of European Parliament elections Sunday , with voters in many countries favoring conservative parties against a backdrop of economic crisis .
Opinion polling showed right - leaning governments with edges over their opposition in Germany , Italy and France .
Conservative opposition parties were tied or ahead in Britain , Spain , and some smaller countries .
So how big is the right expected to win ?
In the 17th paragraph , after we ’ve been told “ the Europe - wide elections were most important as a snapshot of national political sentiment , ” we finally get some numbers :
An informal forecast by the political science website http://www.predict09.eu anticipated Conservatives winning 262 seats against 194 for the Socialists and 85 for the Liberals in 736 - seat European Parliament , roughly the same proportions as in the last parliament .
And then the article notes that “ right - leaning parties have taken up business regulation and social protection initiatives more traditionally associated with the left . ”
When you look at the site that AP references –which turns out to be a project of the PR group Burson - Marsteller–it turns out that its actual prediction is for slight gains for the left .
( On the chart on the site ’s main page , the left parties are in red , pink and green ; the centrist Liberal parties are in yellow ; the conservative parties are in blue and light blue ; and the far - right parties are in orange and gray . )
The main change the PR group predicts is that the left parties will take a slightly larger slice of the pie and the Liberal parties will have a slightly smaller one .
Of course , it ’s the actual voting results that matter , not the predictions , and it ’s certainly possible that the European right actually will make major gains .
But when the AP takes forecasts that Conservatives will do about as well as they did last time after moving their platforms to the left , and depicts that as evidence of “ Europe … leaning to the right , ” that would seem to say more about the news service ’s political sentiments than about Europe’s .
Interviewing bands as a fan or as a journalist is all well and good but there 's only so much insight a ' critic ' has .
Musicians are like a totally different breed and if we 've learnt one thing from our takeover weeks , it 's that musicians talking to each other is incredibly illuminating .
We 're yet to come up with a great title for this new feature ( Artist - on - Artist , Peer - to - Peer , Muso - mush ... ) but the concept of getting musicians we like to interview each other is a definite goer .
So far , we 've have Catherine AD picking Tori Amos 's brains and Ed Droste from Grizzly Bear chatting to Phoenix via Skype .
For the third instalment of Artist ' n ' Artist , former Les Incompétents and current Ox.Eagle .Lion .
Man man Frederick Blood - Royale meets former At The Drive - In and current Mars Volta spearhead , Cedric Bixler Zavala .
Distant PR person voice : Cedric meet Frederick ... Frederick meet Cedric .
... click ...
FBR : Obviously the first thing to bring up , is that having listened to Octahedron a few times , it 's clearly a pretty big departure from Bedlam .
Lighter , more straightforward , more commercial .
What 's the idea behind the record ?
Cedric Bixler - Zavala :
We wanted to make the opposite of all the records we 've done .
All along we 've threatened people that we'd make a pop record , and now we have .
FBR : Something deliberately more accessible ?
CBZ : Well , just for us really .
The first song was something that was meant to end up on Bedlam , but I guess it did n't fit .
What we wanted to make was an acoustic album .
So this is our version of that , but obviously not sticking to the rules .
It 's always good to get rid of one audience to gain another .
The old audience always knows what to expect .
And I 'm sure whatever audience comes from this album , we 'll disappoint them with the next record .
FBR : So you want a challenge for the fans who only want twenty minute guitar solos and no choruses ?
CBZ : We did have choruses before , just the libraries of music in people 's heads are so undeveloped that their ideas of choruses are training wheels and the Bay City Rollers .
FBR : In terms of your career as a whole , is this going to be as ' pop ' as The Mars Volta ever get ?
CBZ : I do n't know what 's going to happen .
The next record might be a combination of everything we 've done so far .
At the same time Omar 's releasing an album called Cryptomnesia with the drummer Zac Hill ...
FBR : From Hella ?
CBZ : Yeah exactly , so if anyone 's bummed that The Mars Volta record 's too simple or too pop , they can buy that album and it'll take them right back to that kind of sound .
It 's one of my favourite things I 've ever worked on .
It 's pretty much a Mars Volta record , just without Thomas , Ikey , and Marcel .
With Volta [ Octahedron ] was just our acoustic record that turned into our pop record .
FBR : And is it a concept record ?
CBZ : Not really .
I thought it was going to be but never really got around to writing about anything in particular .
Just a lot of instant song composing and regular themes that I would n't even want to elaborate on ...
FBR : Surely there imagery that stuck in your mind throughout the lyric writing process ?
CBZ : ... kidnappings , vanishings , ' what if ' scenarios about how to get Republicans out of the White House if they 'd got in .
FBR : What have you been listening to that influenced it ?
CBZ : A lot of Scott Walker ballads , ballads from Roky Erickson and the Raspberries .
FBR : Your lyrical vocabulary seems a lot more down to earth too .
CBZ : Yeah , probably .
But you think I 'm saying something and then you read the actual lyric and realise it 's pretty bent out of shape .
What people need to understand is that we 've been doing this for almost ten years now and everything we do is just our way of making things interesting for the band .
FBR : Looking at the number of solo albums Omar makes , he 's clearly constantly writing .
In terms of songs , how does he differentiate what 's for one of his own records and what 's for the band ?
CBZ : Some stuff he just feels passionately about , and that 's for Volta .
Or I 'll stick my head around the door and ask if we can use something for the band .
FBR : And can we expect a Cedric solo album any time soon ?
CBZ : Yeah , there 's a lot of music that 's ready .
I just need to get around to singing on all of it .
I 've been working a lot with a friend of mine called Deantoni Parks , a drummer who 's spent time with like , Tom Waits and John Cale .
He plays in this band Kudu who are pretty much a modern version of Vanity Sticks , and he toured with Volta for a while .
Omar 's made a couple of electronic records with him .
He 's known as like the live drummer that can sound like a machine .
FBR : There 's that sort of electronic sound that comes through subtly on Octahedron , especially on tracks like ' Copernicus ' ... an almost ' 90s Warp vibe in parts .
Can we expect more of that on future Mars Volta stuff ?
CBZ : Yeah , I 'd definitely push for more of that .
FBR : Have you got any current musical recommendations for Drowned In Sound readers ?
CBZ : I dunno , I 've just been really into my ballads ... and anything that ends up in murder , somehow .
You 've got to take the love story down that road .
A lot of time that 's just how it ends up ... [ laughter ] .
And I like a lot of dancehall , except the homophobic element of it .
I mean , I love to dance to it , but I can't dance when the hypocrisy of the statement ' one love ' excludes certain types of people .
FBR : What about the live shows for this record ?
Are they going to be lighter too ?
CBZ : I reckon we 'll play the majority of the record and then we 'll probably end the set with some of the older stuff that we can include improvisation on .
I think the game plan is to play all the new stuff as individual songs , unless something opens up and we recognise it as a spot to fool around with .
FBR : And after almost ten years in the band , do you think it 'll be going for another ten ?
CBZ : Yeah definitely , especially being around the people in the band right now just excites me .
Plus , to have as much time off as we 've had from it ... it 's a good break to remind you what you love doing .
I love it and I 'll always love it .
It 's the one outlet I have that wo n't get me arrested or get me in trouble .
I can get away with it .
I do n't know if I could collaborate with many other people .
The closest thing I 've found to like - minded people is when we curated ATP .
FBR : That was the first ATP I ever went to .
It blew my mind , you had everything going on from Acid Mothers Temple to Saul Williams to Lydia Lunch to Peanut Butter Wolf ...
CBZ : I was so excited that everyone would even say yes to sharing the stage .
Mastodon , Diamanda [ Galas ] , Antony [ Hegarty ] ...
I felt like a little kid , and I do n't even know if we deserved it , but I 've always thought ours was the most diverse so far .
Hopefully Barry will let us do it again ...
FBR : They 'll probably be up for paying you a lot to reform ' At The Drive - In ' , like they did with Sleep at few weekends ago .
CBZ : Oh yeah , they do that right ?
[ laughter ]
FBR : But I take it you probably wo n't be accepting any offers on that front any time soon ?
CBZ : I do n't know what to say about that really .
We 've been making amends with a lot of the members and having some really good talks with them .
And we 've been trying to get our financial business in order because a lot of people have been ripping off that band really badly ... as far as the business side goes .
I would n't mind it .
Y'know , it might happen , we just have to iron out a lot of personal things .
A lot of it we 've dealt with already and I 've apologised for a lot of things I 've said and the way it ended ... we 'll see what happens .
The Mars Volta 's fifth studio album , Octahedron is out on June 22 through Mercury .

A federal judge in Los Angeles has sentenced a medical marijuana dispensary owner to a year and a day in prison in one of the nation 's first cases since the Obama administration adjusted its pot policy .
U.S. District George
Wu on Thursday found that the case of 47 - year - old Charles Lynch merited an exception to the mandatory minimum five - year sentence that guidelines called for .
The judge felt , however , he was bound by the law to issue at least a one - year prison term .
Lynch could have been sentenced to up to 20 years in federal prison due to the amount of marijuana -- 100 kilograms -- involved
Lynch was convicted of five marijuana - related offenses last year for running a medical marijuana dispensary collective in Morro Bay in San Luis Obispo County .
He sought leniency after U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced earlier this year that federal agents will now target marijuana distributors only when they violate both federal and state laws .
At a previous hearing in March , Wu asked for legal briefs from the attorneys , and at the conclusion of a second proceeding the following month , the judge set Thursday 's hearing to resolve any remaining issues and finally sentence Lynch .
Wu indicated he was considering sentencing Lynch to one year , possibly in home confinement .
But prosecutors pointed out in court papers that the large quantity of marijuana in Lynch 's possession at the time of his arrest required a multiple - year prison term .
At the March 23 hearing , Wu asked for written clarification from U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder 's office as to whether recent recent statements regarding federal prosecutions of medical marijuana cases would have an impact on Lynch 's sentence .
The cultivation , use and sale of doctor - prescribed marijuana is legal in certain instances under California law but banned under federal law , which supersedes state law .
Attorney General Eric
Holder recently said , however , that federal agents would now target only marijuana distributors who violate both federal and state laws .
Wu indicated that the Justice Department 's clarification of its newly stated position on medical marijuana prosecutions would not change Lynch 's conviction but could affect his sentence .
In recent weeks ,
Wu seemed to be pondering whether Lynch can be sentenced for an activity that he believed to be legal under Morro Bay municipal codes .
Morro Bay 's city attorney , Robert Schultz , testified in April that Lynch had the blessings of the city council for his Central Coast Compassionate Caregivers and was a valuable and well - liked member of the approximately 10,000 - person city .
Lynch , he said , obtained a business license from the city , held a grand opening in 2006 , used discrete signage , stationed a security guard at his location , enforced membership rules , ran surveillance cameras and regularly gave guided tours of his pharmacy - like operation to anyone who asked .
Lynch operated his medical marijuana dispensary for 11 months before it was raided by Drug Enforcement Administration agents in March 2007 .

" I 'm so glad that they recognized that my rights were violated .
I don?t want this to happen to anyone else , " Savana Redding says .
WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court 's decision Thursday striking down the strip search of an eighth - grade girl for prescription - strength ibuprofen requires schools nationwide to weigh more carefully how intrusively they search for drugs .
By an 8 - 1 vote , the justices ruled that school officials in a rural Arizona district violated the Fourth Amendment rights of Savana Redding when they forced her to take off her clothes after an unverified tip that she had the pain relief pills .
The court emphasized the difference between a routine search of a backpack and a search that exposes a student 's private parts .
Justice Clarence Thomas dissented .
EARLIER COVERAGE : Justices review strip search case
The decision , which differs from signals the justices sent during oral arguments in April , also departs from a recent trend giving administrators wide latitude to search for drugs in schools .
Writing for the court , Justice David Souter said an official must have a " reasonable suspicion of danger " regarding the drugs sought and a belief they could be hidden in a student 's underwear before making " the quantum leap from outer clothes and backpacks to exposure of intimate parts . "
Matthew Wright , lawyer for the Safford school district , predicted the decision would have a " chilling effect " on administrators responding to threats of drugs .
Francisco Negron , lawyer for the National School Boards Association , said the decision could be confusing for school officials , who typically lack formal training in drugs yet would have to consider whether the contraband they seek is dangerous enough to do to a strip search .
Savana Redding , who was 13 at the time of the search and is now 19 , said , " I 'm so glad that they recognized that my rights were violated .
I do n't want this to happen to anyone else . "
Her lawyer , Adam Wolf , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who argued the case , added , " Today 's ruling affirms that schools are not constitutional dead zones . "
In October 2003 , after Assistant Principal Kerry Wilson heard from a student that Redding might have ibuprofen , he asked a school nurse and administration assistant , both women , to search Savana in the nurse 's office .
They asked her to take off her shirt and pants , then to pull out her bra and underpants to see whether she was hiding any pills .
No pills were found .
Savana 's mother , April Redding , sued , saying school officials breached Savana 's rights under the Fourth Amendment protection from unreasonable searches .
A lower U.S. appeals court ruled for Redding and said Safford officials were financially responsible for harm to her .
In affirming that her rights were violated , Souter said a strip search requires officials to have an " indication of danger ( and ) reason to suppose that Savana was carrying pills in her underwear . "
Souter was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices John Paul Stevens , Antonin Scalia , Anthony Kennedy , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer and Samuel Alito .
Dissenting Justice Thomas said the decision allows judges " to second - guess " officials trying to ensure student safety .
By a separate vote of 7 - 2 , the court said that because rulings in this area of the law have not been clear , Safford officials are shielded from financial responsibility for their actions .
Stevens and Ginsburg dissented from that part of the ruling in Safford Unified School District No. 1 v. Redding .
During oral arguments April 21 , many justices voiced more sympathy for school administrators than for Redding .
Several , including Souter and Roberts , appeared open to arguments that administrators need considerable leeway to look for drug abuse .
Ginsburg was most forceful on the other side .
In a concurring opinion Thursday , Ginsburg emphasized the humiliation Savana endured , including being forced to sit on a chair outside Wilson 's office even after the search found no pills .

Informal speed tests show that Windows 7 boots faster than Vista , and many users have reported that it " feels " faster during everyday operation .
( Maybe that 's because the User Account Control is more restrained in Windows 7 than in Vista and does n't pester them so often . )
But you can take some practical steps to goose Vista so that it will acquire some of Windows 7's pep .
Here 's how .
Faster Booting
What it is :
My two - year - old Acer Aspire laptop takes nearly 2 minutes to boot Vista .
Windows 7 is up and running in a sprightly 43 seconds on the same PC .
Hey , Microsoft , you owe me 70 - odd seconds of my life , multiplied by five days per week , carry the one -- oh , heck , a check for ten grand ought to cover it .
How to get it :
You have countless ways to make your Vista or XP system start faster .
First of all , if you 're still chugging along with just 1GB of RAM , it 's high time that you upgraded to at least 2GB .
That will accelerate both booting and general performance .
Next up : Recent PC
World favorite Startup Delayer , a free utility that postpones ( in accordance with your specifications ) initiation of various programs that normally run during your PC 's startup .
If you set unimportant apps to begin running 10 or 15 minutes after startup , Vista ( or XP ) will finish booting much faster .
If your system is a couple of years old , the best way by far to make it boot faster is to wipe the hard drive and reinstall your copy of Windows .
Do­­ing so is a radical and time - consuming procedure , but it will clear out every last bit of gunk and restore your system to speedy , factory - new condition .
To learn how to do that , see " Reinstall and Re­­store Your Windows PC in Eight Easy Steps . "
Less-Bothersome User Account Control
What it is : Despite all its arguably good intentions , UAC became the poster child for what 's wrong with Vista .
Either it bugs you continually or you turn it off and nullify its value as a safety net .
In Windows 7 , UAC tries to stay out of your way while still offering its Vista predecessor 's security benefits .
You can choose from four security levels , thereby dictating how often you 'll receive notifications from Microsoft .
How to get it : Vista users are stuck with all or none of UAC 1.0 , but you can always turn it off and opt for a third - party replacement .
For example , Norton User Account Control replaces the stock UAC with one that learns from your responses and consequently bugs you less often with information you do n't care about .
This download also gives you a ‘ Do n't ask me again ' option , and useful details about the nature of the security alert .
Another alternative is UAC Snooze , a system tray utility that puts the UAC to sleep for a designated period of time - - a helpful arrangement if you plan to do some system tweaking and do n't want to be bothered every step of the way .
Some of my friends were just arrested in Mississippi .
Here ’s a description of why they ’re traveling across the country :
The Motorhome Diaries is the story of three friends who took to the road in April 2009 to search for freedom in America .
Along the way the friends – Jason , Pete and Tom – interact with individuals and groups from diverse backgrounds and viewpoints at college campuses , homes , businesses and organizations that are united by one thing : increasing individual freedom and responsibility and decreasing the scope of government .
Here ’s the best and lastest info about the arrest ( follow the comment thread for updates ) :
It went down this morning in Jones County , MS .
Jason Talley posted this to MHD ’s Twitter : “ We are in Jones County MS and @adammueller has been arrested for filming cops after they pulled us over . ”
http://img15.imageshack.us/my.php?image=q72.jpg&via=tfrog
Later , other posts to Jason ’s facebook page revealed they were all arrested .
After asking for details and hearing nothing , I called the Jones County Jail at 601-649-7502 and confirmed they have all been imprisoned .
Adam Mueller – Disorderly Conduct and Disobeying an Officer
Pete Eyre – Possession of a Beer in a Dry County
Jason Talley – Disorderly Conduct , Disobeying , and Resisting Arrest
The bureaucrats at the jail think they will be arraigned tomorrow …
They were scheduled to be in Nashville tonight , but the good folks in Tennessee are n’t going to let their arrest go to waste .
Here ’s a Facebook message I received :
Subject : Bring your stash of bail $ tonight …
Greetings everyone !
Sorry to disappoint , but the Motorhome Diaries boys wo n’t be joining us tonight .
They are held up in Mississippi … in jail .
That ’s right .
Ironic that they are traveling across American searching for liberty and are arrested for filming a traffic stop ?
Yes , it is .
Read more here : http://www.facebook.com/l/;http://freekeene.com/2009/05/14/keenes-motorhome-diaries-crew-arrested-in-ms/
Please do n’t let this discourage you from joining us at Mafi ’s tonight .
We have to figure out how to help them – sounds like they ’re being arraigned tomorrow .
Allison Gibbs ( Campaign for Liberty ) is on her way now to bail them out , and they do need money .
Mafi ’s gives us a 2 for 1 special on drafts , so maybe you can use the money you ’re saving for bail ??????
See you tonight at 7 !
Jason and I have worked together on a variety of issues ( the latest being Fr33Agents ) over the years .
I ’m speculating at this moment that he was arrested for respectfully asserting his legal rights .
I know his style and I also know Mississippi cops .
They probably mixed like oil and water .
Fortunately for them , they were able to make bail without using a bail provider , but that is n’t the same for many people who find themselves in jail in America .
Those unfortunate enough to find themselves on that side of the law require the aid of bail providers similar to HB Bail Bonds in order to regain their freedom .
The guys are supposed to be in Alabama next week and I was looking forward to seeing them — now even more .
I ’ll update this post as more information becomes available .
UPDATE : Here ’s one of Pete Eyre ’s previous encounters with the police .
UPDATE II : From Twitter :
All 3 are coming out Â¡! @jdtalley @peteeyre @ammueller !
All under 1000 !
Now we have to get marv !
UPDATE III : Jason tweets :
The #MHD crew has been released from Jones County jail .
I was pepper sprayed and choked for refusing to give ID .
UPDATE IV : It ’s interesting that Jones County is notorious for KKK activity .
It is n’t not all that far from Prentiss , Mississippi .
Those who followed the Cory Maye story which Radley Balko broke have probably already figured out the real probable cause : simply being a libertarian in Mississippi .
In Alabama , we like Mississippi because it keeps us from being number 50 on a lot of lists .
UPDATE V : Pete Eyre has a while lot of additional details here .

What do the David Suzuki Foundation and Google Inc. have in common ?
Not much at first glance , but when you look beyond the surface you ’ll see many similarities .
Since 1990 , the David Suzuki Foundation has been using “ science and education to promote solutions that conserve nature and help achieve sustainability ” .
Google Inc. on the other hand is the high tech firm that strives to “ organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful ” .
Google started out as a Stanford research project in 1996 by two really smart men – Larry Page and Sergey Brin – and now employs over 20,000 full - time employees at its Mountain View , California “ Googleplex ” campus .
Like the David Suzuki Foundation , Google Inc. is also dedicated to sustainability , and unlike many other corporations , Google does n’t simply write fancy words about its social responsibility ; it is actually taking tangible steps to substantiate its commitment to sustainability .
For starters , at its “ Googleplex ” corporate headquarters , Google has installed 9,212 photovoltaic panels to supply 1.6 megawatts of electricity , or about 30 % of the electricity required to operate the 20 + buildings on its campus at peak times .
Google ’s commitment to sustainability manifests from the values espoused by its co-founders .
Page and Brin are seriously committed to making renewable energy a reality by investing in sustainability projects – such as Tesla motors electric car initiative , as well as allocating over $ 1 billion worth of Google shares to fund Google.org , the philanthropic arm of Google Inc. which focuses on environmental and global health issues .
In November 2007 , Google.org announced its “ RE ” ( Renewable energy for less than coal ) project with the aim of ( as the name states ) producing renewable energy from solar , wind , geothermal and other renewable energy sources at a cost cheaper than burning coal .
The goal of the RE pie in the sky ” project either ; Google plans to achieve their goal in years – not decades .
Back at the Google campus , hundreds of community bicycles are placed everywhere so that employees can quickly and easily travel between buildings .
They also provide a fleet of plug - in hybrid electric vehicles that are used in its free car - sharing program and Google.org ’s RechargeIT initiative invests in technology to accelerate the adoption of plug - in vehicles .
In a pilot program , Google.org has been able to achieve an amazing 115MPG in a Toyota Prius plug - in hybrid .

When it comes to food sustainability , Google ’s campus cafe is partially - supplied by its on - site organic garden and Google ’s Cafe 150 provides food grown within 150 miles of the Google campus .
On May 1st , 2009 , Google announced it was renting 200 goats from California Grazing as a low - emission approach to mowing the fields on its campus .
California Grazing is an environmentally - friendly company that boasts a fleet of 800 + cute goats that provide “ holistic land management and brush & weed control through grazing . ”
According to Google , “ It costs us about the same as mowing , and goats are a lot cuter to watch than lawn mowers ” .
Inside the Google buildings , Google purchases its furniture and materials that meet the stringent LEED certification as well as the Cradle - to - Cradle certification – an innovative and sustainable method of creating products that we discussed last July .
Google also exclusively uses sustainably - harvested wood for construction in its campus buildings .

Ten years ago , Google Inc. changed the world with its effective search algorithm .
Now its founders are changing how energy is produced and consumed .
Google ’s environmental initiatives are a reflection of the core ideology found in its young founders and it represents a new level of corporate social responsibility that was virtually nonexistent in most corporations just ten years ago .
I ’m excited about what Google ’s brilliant minds will be able to accomplish to help the environment ; and if I ever need to mow the lawn , I just might consider renting a bunch of cute sheep for a week .
Sustainitiatives is a section on The Urban Country where we highlight companies or individuals who are taking initiatives to help reduce our harm on the environment .

Next year 's Wimbledon Championships will take place as scheduled even if spectators cannot attend the grasscourt Grand Slam tournament amid the COVID - 19 pandemic , the Times reported .
Wimbledon was cancelled this year for the first time since World War Two due to the coronavirus , which has killed more than 42,000 people in the United Kingdom .
The All England Lawn Tennis Club ( AELTC ) , organisers of the tournament , was reluctant to stage Wimbledon without fans this year but the success of the U.S. Open and other sporting events have changed their opinion , the paper said .
Bob Crow 's letter to the mayor Transport Secretary Lord Adonis said he " deplored " the Tube strike , as services slowly returned to normal following the 48 - hour walkout .
The Rail , Maritime and Transport ( RMT ) action ended at 1859 BST but Transport for London ( TfL ) said a full service would not resume until Friday morning .
Liberal Democrat Lord Bradshaw called the behaviour of RMT leader Bob Crow and strikers " utterly reprehensible " .
The walkout followed a breakdown in pay talks with London Underground ( LU ) .
Map of extra services
Further talks between the LU and RMT - which wants a 5 % pay rise and a promise of no compulsory redundancies - will be held next week to try to end the dispute .
During a Lords debate on public transport , Lord Adonis said : " I deplore the underground strike in London today and urge the RMT to engage constructively with Transport for London to ensure that there is no repetition . "
Lord Bradshaw said : " The behaviour of Mr Crow and the RMT is utterly reprehensible .
There are mechanisms for dealing with disputes .
' Held to ransom ' " People working on the Underground are well paid and they have long holidays .
The strikers ' behaviour has been pretty disgraceful . "
He added : " Londoners are being held to ransom and many people who are in fear of losing their jobs are making extraordinary efforts to get to work because they think that if they are missed for a couple of days they can be missed for a good deal longer . "
On Thursday Mr Crow accused London mayor Boris Johnson of " playing politics " with the Tube by deliberately intervening to scupper a last - minute deal .
Mr Johnson said the allegation was " completely untrue " .
TUBE LINE UPDATES Northern Line - Full service District Line - Trains from Wimbledon to High Street Kensington and Ealing Broadway ; Whitechapel to Upminster Jubilee Line - Full service Metropolitan Line - Trains from Moorgate to Harrow - on - the - Hill and Watford ; Baker Street and Amersham Piccadilly Line - Trains from Arnos Grove to Cockfosters ; Heathrow ( terminals 123 ) and Acton Town Victoria Line - Trains from Seven Sisters to Victoria Bakerloo Line - Queen 's Park to Elephant & Castle Central Line - Liverpool Street to Epping and Hainault ; White City to Ealing Broadway and West Ruislip Circle Line - Suspended Hammersmith and City Line - Hammersmith to Baker Street Waterloo and City - Suspended
Workers battle through travel chaos
How has the strike affected you ?
However Labour 's Andrew Dismore told the Commons that a debate was needed to establish the mayor 's involvement in pre-strike talks .
" There 's a real suspicion that the mayor of London 's fingers are all over the provocation of this dispute , " Mr Dismore said .
A spokesman for Mr Johnson has denied that the mayor had any involvement in the negotiations before the walkout .
Nine
Tube lines were affected by the industrial action as commuters struggled to get in to work on overcrowded buses and gridlocked roads .
A service continued on the Northern and Jubilee lines , however , while London Overground and Docklands Light Railway services operated as normal .
TfL drafted in an extra 100 buses , offered escorts for cyclists and a free river ferry service .
The London Chamber of Commerce has estimated the capital 's economy will lose more than £ 100 m as a result of the strike .
On Thursday a TfL spokesman said : " There has been an exchange of letters this afternoon between London Underground and the RMT leadership via Acas to set out the basis for further discussions at Acas on the remaining issues in dispute , notably redundancy arrangements . "

I was perhaps 9 years old when it happened .
I had a terrible habit as a kid to want to sleep in until the last possible moment .
Ok , who am I kidding ?
I still do that .
I 'm usually about 30 seconds late for work everyday .
But when I was a kid , this drove my mother to the brink of sanity .
She put up with it for a long time , always managing to get me roused and dressed , books in hand and out the door for school just in the nick of time .
Sometimes she 'd peek her head in my bedroom door every 10 minutes and check in , making sure I was on track .
And generally I managed to get myself together with seconds to spare .
But there WAS that one time ...
6:45 am
Mom : " Sweetie , it 's time to get up and get dressed . "
Me : " Uhhhhaaaaaaaaaaamffff ... "
6:55 am
Mom : " Honey , we have to leave at 7:30 if we 're going to get you to school on time .
Please get up and start getting dressed or you wo n't have time for breakfast ! "
Me : " Ushdfgakjasgh ... "
7:05 am
Mom : " Justin , get out of bed .
I mean it .
You 're already going to be pressed for time to eat breakfast .
We 're leaving at 7:30 , whether you 're ready or not . "
Me : " Arrrrggghh ...
Ok , I 'm up , I 'm up . "
7:15 am
Mom : " Sweetie , are you dressed yet ?
I 've got your breakfast ready ... "
Me : " Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz ... "
Mom : " DAMN IT !
Wake UP and get READY !!!
I swear to you Justin , we 're leaving here at 7:30 .
I do n't care if you miss your breakfast .
I do n't care if you are n't dressed for school . "
Me : " Ok , sorry ... sorry .
I 'm up . "
7:25 am
Mom : " Are you still awake ?
Good ... why are n't you dressed ?
Get dressed NOW or you 're going in your underwear . "
Me : " Ok . "
7:30 am
Mom : " Alright , let 's go .
Grab your backpack . "
Me : " But Mom , I 'm not ready ... "
Mom : " Tough . "
She grabbed me by the arm and escorted me out the front door .
No shoes , no shirt , not a stitch of clothing besides my tighty whities .
She held me by the wrist and led me to the car .
I can't remember this very clearly because I was somewhat upset .
I do remember that I was crying uncontrollably .
Likely pleading and begging in some fashion .
She put me in the back seat , got in , and drove away casually as if nothing in the world was out of place .
And as I began to calm somewhat , I sat , mostly naked and full of fear , in the back seat pondering my next move .
I did n't have any more outs .
I had no clothing and no plan .
I was fucked .
I was going to school in my underwear .
Never once did it cross my mind that this could be a bluff .
My mother did n't bluff .
She was n't turning the car around .
Heck , we were halfway to school already !
Here I was , in my undies and headed toward certain ridicule and major embarrassment of the worst kind , the ridicule of grade - school peers .
And all because I 'd chosen to sleep when I should have been getting dressed .
When I should have been enjoying a nutritious breakfast .
I slept this upon myself .
I had learned my lesson .
It would n't happen again .
I 'd always get up from now on at first call .
Various other reasoning and begging followed .
I gazed into the rearview mirror , looking her in the eyes .
I grovelled .
And she stared back and me , cold and firm in her resolution .
We pulled into the driveway of my school , and up the lane to the front doors ; the main car - rider drop off point .
My mother did n't even put the car in park .
She just looked at me expectantly in the rearview .
Not a speck of emotion .
" Well ?... , " said her eyes .
I began to cry again .
She put the car in park , killed the engine , unfastened her seatbelt , and got out .
I was completely prepared .
I had mentally readied myself to be dragged from the car , in a cliched kicking and screaming fashion .
My mother went around back of the car and opened the trunk , from which she removed a brown paper grocery bag .
She came back around to the side and opened my door .
She stood there looking at me , like I was the worst child ever .
And she handed me the brown bag with my clothes inside .
" Get dressed . "
Indeed , that was the last time I ever failed to hearken to my mother 's wakeup call .

America does n't want its pot ... American potheads do !
Sure the debate is raging presently , but it 's as fictional in its need as whether pigs can fly or whether Superman was or was not faster than that bullet .
In the modern trumped up controversy over whether marijuana should be legalized for the masses , the biggest canard of all is the supposed demand that exists .
As a team that produces a weekly talk radio show now heard on 195 stations , we can earnestly say one thing is definitively true in the discussions we 've launched about the revival of the " Should pot be legal ? " question : " America does n't want its pot ... American potheads do ! "
CBS News has a pro/con feature today on marijuana legalization with a great piece from Ethan Nadelmann and an opposing view coauthored by Stephen Baldwin and Kevin McCullough .
Pete Guither properly demolishes the later here , but I just want to reiterate how crazy it is that Stephen Baldwin has become the poster boy for the war on marijuana .
It 's ridiculous .
Fortunately , Baldwin totally lives up to everyone 's expectations by ceasing to make sense the instant he gets started :
It 's hilariously false on multiple levels : 1 .
There 's an online poll embedded right there on the same page showing 94.86 % support for legalizing marijuana .
2 .
Baldwin claims only potheads want to legalize marijuana , despite having recently gotten his ass kicked in a debate with Ron Paul , who has never tried it .3 .
If the press could find someone more famous than Stephen Baldwin to oppose legalization , he would n't even get the opportunity to say these things .

Herschel and Planck launched together on an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana in South America ( Image : ESA )
See a gallery of the most important telescopes in history
The largest space telescope ever launched , called Herschel , took to the skies on Thursday , along with a companion called Planck that will make the most precise measurements yet of the radiation left over from the big bang .
The Herschel and Planck space telescopes launched together aboard an Ariane 5 rocket at 1312 GMT from Kourou , French Guiana .

Now the pair , which together cost more than € 2 billion , will make their way separately to L2 , one of Earth ’s five Lagrangian points , where the gravitational tugs from the Earth and the Sun cancel out .
L2 is situated some 1.5 million kilometres from Earth – four times the distance from Earth to the moon .
Herschel , which boasts a 3.5 - metre - wide mirror , is almost four times as big as its rival Spitzer .
Over the coming years , it will scan the sky ’s infrared light , allowing it to study cool celestial objects , from comets and asteroids in our own solar system to some of the universe ’s most distant galaxies .
By orbiting near L2 , Herschel will be naturally cooled to some 80 °C above absolute zero .
That will minimise the heat radiating from the telescope itself , and liquid helium will cool its detectors even further , to just 0.3 °C above absolute zero .
The telescope is expected to begin its scientific observations in September , after several months of testing out and calibrating its instruments .
Space - time ripples
Herschel ’s launch companion , Planck , will map the cosmic microwave background ( CMB ) , relic radiation from the big bang .
It is expected to have some 10 times the sensitivity and three times the angular resolution of NASA ’s WMAP satellite , which was launched in 2001 .
With detectors cooled to just 0.1 °C above absolute zero , Planck will spin around its own axis , which will always point towards the sun .
With each rotation , it will record a strip of sky , measuring the temperature of the CMB with an accuracy of about one millionth of a degree .
If all goes well , Planck could slash the uncertainties in astronomers ’ measurements of the curvature of space - time and the relative ratios of dark matter , dark energy , and ordinary matter in the universe .
It could also find the first evidence of gravitational waves that are thought to have rippled through space - time as a result of inflation – a period just after the big bang when the universe rapidly expanded in size .
The gravitational waves would have left a signature in the electromagnetic alignment , or polarisation , of CMB photons , that Planck may be able to detect .
Planck is expected to begin its scientific observations in July .

Anonymous but potentially vital information posted on the social networking site Facebook is frustrating police investigating the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence .
More than 30,000 people have joined dedicated internet groups swapping thousands of messages discussing the mystery of the missing university chef , who was last seen leaving her home in York a month ago .
Many postings amount to little more than crackpot theories and lurid conjecture .
But North Yorkshire police intelligence officers monitoring the websites have uncovered tantalising leads which they are unable to pursue because they are logged under nicknames or sent from public computers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
They are among hundreds of fresh posts added each day to the dozen or so different user groups originally set up by friends to aid the search but now swamped by people from all over the world deeply touched by the plight of the Lawrence family .
As he revealed two " very significant " developments in the search for the missing 35 - year - old , Detective Superintendent Ray Galloway said he welcomed any information that would help him make a breakthrough but admitted the scale of response to the viral appeal on the internet was difficult to manage .
He urged anyone who knew anything that might help to contact the police .
" That [ social networking sites ] is the way young people communicate , " said Det Supt Galloway .
" They are willing to impart information there in what they feel is a safe environment .
I want to assure them the police is a safe environment as well and we might be able to help Claudia . "
Some members of the public joining the internet groups have said that they know Ms Lawrence but police are unable to corroborate or " contextualise " the claims .
Piecing together her personal life has been central to the efforts of the 50 officers investigating the case .
Det Supt Galloway believes the woman knew her suspected abductor .
But he said mounting conjecture that her private life was " more complex " than her family or friends knew was irrelevant to the task of finding her .
" I want to know all about Claudia , " he said .
" I want to know all about her relationships , not to judge them . "
He said there was no evidence of a new relationship in her life prior to her disappearance .
Police also revealed that a motorist spotted a couple having an argument near York University 's Goodricke College at 6.10 am on 19 March , close to where Ms Lawrence last made contact with friends and family 10 hours earlier .
He said the fact that the passenger door of the car was open indicated that the woman may have been in the car and knew the driver , though was no description of either the couple or the car .
In another potentially significant development , it emerged that two men had been spotted outside Ms Lawrence 's home in the Heworth area of York several days before she went missing .
Police have already questioned friends and associates of Ms Lawrence and searched waste ground , sewers and rivers .
Posters showing her smiling face can be seen on shops , pubs and clubs throughout the city of York .
Ms Lawrence 's father , Peter , a solicitor from Malton , North Yorkshire , has made a series of emotional appeals pleading for information over her whereabouts .
The Archbishop of York , Dr John Sentamu , has also led prayers for her safe return .

A home surrounded by ice sits empty on the bank of the Red River in St. Clements .
Massive blocks of ice proved to be too much for temporary tube dikes as it was forced onto the shore at Breezy Point and St Clements , early Sunday morning .
Provincial flood forecasters said this afternoon that this year ’s Red River flood — at least in the area from St. Jean Baptiste to the floodway inlet — is now projected to be the second - greatest since the floods of the 1880s .
The predicted crest in Winnipeg on Saturday has been raised to 22.6 feet , relative to the normal winter river ice level at James Avenue -- only two feet below that of the 1997 Flood of the Century .
The normal summer water level at James Avenue is usually about seven feet .
B.J. SCHOFIELD / WINNIPEG FREE PRESS Free Press reader B.J. Schofield submitted today a photo taken Monday of a Breezy Point home destroyed by rising water and ice on Sunday night .
Only yesterday , the province had said that this year ’s Red River flood would go down as the third - worst in 100 years .
But senior flood forecaster Alf Warkentin said today that a combination of factors has led the province to revise its forecast , including an exceptionally broad crest at Emerson and higher flows from Red River tributaries , including the Assiniboine River .
Meanwhile , more homes are being evacuated and more roads are becoming impassable in southern Manitoba , thanks to overland flooding and rising rivers , the province says in its latest update .
Close to 170 residents of Peguis First Nation have been relocated to Winnipeg , as the rising Fisher River floods basements and crawl spaces .
About 50 homes on the reserve are flooded after sandbag dikes breached .
The First Nation declared a state of emergency late Tuesday in response to the threat of flood waters .
Manitoba Native Fire Fighters , along with 400 people , are continuing to sandbag and build up breached dikes in an effort to protect homes and buildings in the community .
Fisher River First Nation evacuated nine people from its personal - care home , and residents of approximately 10 homes around Rock Lake have decided to voluntarily leave their homes .
Three homes have been evacuated from the Boundary Creek / Winnipeg Beach area .
The rising Assiniboine River and ice is affecting four homes in Headingley , two homes in St. François Xavier and 15 homes in the Lido Plage Road area .
Ten homes are at risk in Elie from the LaSalle River .
Sandbagging efforts are underway .
In areas affected by the ice jam north of Selkirk , most residents have returned to their homes .
The RM of St. Andrews is continuing a mandatory evacuation order in place for properties north of 1621 Breezy Point Rd .
- P96xavpg.js " >
Sandbags are being sent to the Brokenhead First Nation where 11 houses have water in their basements and water is overtopping roads because of an ice jam at a nearby rail bridge which is causing water to rise .
Evacuations may be necessary if water continues to rise .
All evacuees are strongly urged to register with the Red Cross registration phone line at 1-888-662-3211 , which operates 9 a.m. to 8 p.m .
This will help connect people with their municipalities and other information about the flood .
A sandbag machine is going to the St. Adolphe arena to assist with sandbagging of homes south of St. Adolphe along PR 200 .
Volunteers will have to come down Hwy 75 , turn east on PR 210 and cross over the river into St. Adolphe .
Hwy 75 is local access only but not barricaded south of Winnipeg .
One home , 10 cottages and a number of local roads have been affected by flooding caused by an ice jam at Rock Lake .
Ice jams caused waters to rise overnight in Arborg but levels were reportedly staying constant today and diking is underway .
At Grande Pointe , flood - proofing measures are underway at the floodway outlet west of Hwy 59 and pumps are also being set up as a precautionary measure .
The Icelandic River near Riverton is experiencing ice jams which are affecting the town .
No homes or property are yet affected .
Melita has started diking to raise its primary dike and super sandbags are being installed along Highway 3 .
Additional super sandbags are being sent to Melita today .
Highway 3 at Brunkild is one - lane traffic because a dike is being constructed on the road and there is water on the shoulder .
It is restricted to local traffic only and there may be short delays .
The alternate route detour for Highway 75 has been changed and is now Hwy.
2 to Hwy 13 to Hwy 3 to Hwy 14 .
At Ste. Agathe , a one - kilometre dike closure along the river will be completed today or tomorrow .
Ring dike levels in the valley have been raised at Emerson , Letellier , St. Jean Baptiste , Morris , St. Adolphe , Dominion City and Ste. Agathe .
Partial ring dike closures are also complete at Rosenort , Aubigny and Riverside .
The valley ring dikes are being carefully monitored and assessed on an ongoing basis .
There is significant overland flooding across the Interlake affecting roads and crossings through out the area .
There are a number of roads washed out in the province .
The province has 37 steamers working to thaw frozen culverts and drains across southern Manitoba .
Three Flood Liaison Offices are open seven days a week from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. in Winnipeg ( 945-2354 ) , Morris ( 204-746-7325 ) and Brandon ( 204-729-1220 ) .
The province is warning motorists that frozen culverts and drains are causing flooding in locations that have never experienced flooding before .
Manitobans are advised to watch for rapidly rising water conditions .
If motorists encounter rapidly moving water , they should not try to drive through and should stay in their vehicle .
Closed barricade signs must be respected and motorists are advised to drive with extreme caution .
There have been reports of road barricades being moved in the Red River Valley .
Closed barricades on roads should not be moved under any circumstance .
Road conditions are changing quickly .
Check highway conditions before travelling at www.manitoba.ca or call 204-945-3704 or 1-877-627-6237 .

The profit at SunTrust Banks ( STI ) last year was half of what it was in 2007 .
The stock price was also cut in half , but the company 's board of directors approved a 75 % increase in the 2008 total compensation of CEO James Wells to $ 8.1 million , according to the SunTrust proxy filed late Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Financial stocks have been engulfed in a vicious downdraft , but SunTrust has until recently been held out as a bank that will weather the storm because it holds relatively few subprime mortgages and other toxic assets .
But although SunTrust stock jumped 18.5 % Tuesday to $ 9.34 a share , the stock remains down 68 % in 2009 , and that 's on top of a 50 % drop during 2008 .
SunTrust spokesman Mike McCoy says the proxy vastly overstates today 's value of Wells ' compensation because much of it came in the form of stock options and restricted stock granted a year ago , when SunTrust shares were $ 64.58 .
" Obviously , our stock has declined significantly since then , " McCoy says .
SunTrust has received some government bailout money .
It is among the nation 's 20 largest banks that will be evaluated Wednesday by the Treasury Department as it conducts a so - called stress test to estimate how well the banks will hold up if the economy worsens further .
The government would likely buy shares in banks it considers vulnerable .
Wells ' restricted shares , worth $ 4.7 million when granted , were valued at $ 560,012 as of last week , according to the Associated Press , which calculates CEO compensation using salary , bonus , incentives , perks , above - market returns on deferred compensation and the estimated value of stock options and awards granted during the year .
The calculations do n't include changes in the present value of pension benefits , and they sometimes differ from the total companies list in the summary compensation table of proxy statements .
Wells ' 2008 salary was $ 1,077,300 , a 7.7 % raise from $ 1 million in 2007 .
For 2008 , SunTrust earned $ 747 million , or $ 2.13 per share , less than half the $ 4.55 a share it earned in 2007 .
Bruce Ellig , a compensation adviser to corporate boards and author of The Complete Guide to Executive Compensation , said there was no justification for the salary increase unless Wells is woefully behind other CEOs in the industry .
But Ellig approves of performance - based stock options that tie the CEO 's future to that of the shareholder .
Wells was president of Crestar Bank when it was acquired by SunTrust in 1998 .
He became CEO at the beginning of 2007 .

どんな研究も、誤った研究課題からスタートしたり、誤った観点に立っていたり、この場合のように異なる相手と戦おうとすれば、誤った結論に至ってしまう。この場合の誤った敵とは、CAPTCHAを認識する自動化されたボットだ。
Googleは最近、適切な画像の回転を行う新たなCAPTCHA（Socially
Adjusted CAPTCHAs）について詳しく説明する論文を発表した。この方式の目的は、CAPTCHAを人間には使いやすく、ボットにはずっと認識しにくいものにすることだ。しかし、「ボット
VS CAPTCHA 」というテーマに関するこの論文や他の多くの研究論文では、新たなアプローチが増加傾向という問題を除外してしまっている。もしこの新たなCAPTCHAが実際に実装されれば、新たなアプローチによって以前よりも効率的に侵害されてしまうことになるだろう。
なぜだろうか。マルウェアに感染したホストがCAPTCHAを認識しようとしている状況が続いていることも事実だが、結局の所、CAPTCHA解読経済を動かしているのは、1日に20万件のCAPTCHAを解読することができ、1000件につき2ドルしか請求しない人間によるデータ入力チームだからだ。
「 Inside India 's CAPTCHA solving economy 」（インド のCAPTCHA解読経済の内部事情）を詳しく説明した調査が2008年に発表されてから、多くのことが変わった。
彼らの認識率が上昇したことに加え（CAPTCHA解読の従業員になるには、CAPTCHA解読速度のテストに合格しなくてはならない）、以前はこれらのサービスは多くの小規模なグループといくつかの統合された大きなグループによって提供されていたのだが、現在はロシアに拠点を置くCAPTCHA解読サービスが、インドの労働者に解読作業をアウトソースし、インド側に支払うよりも大きな金額を顧客に請求するのが主流という状況になっている。
2009年2月、CAPTCHA解読サービスを提供するロシアのグループによって、収益を分配するコミュニティベースの新たなCAPTCHA解読アプローチが導入された。このコンセプトは、reCAPTCHAの実装の容易さと偏在性を真似ながら、悪意を持って作られたものだ。これを使えば、ウェブマスターは、登録ページにCAPTCHA用フォームを置くことができるだけでなく、掲示板やコミュニティのメンバーに、空いた時間を使ってCAPTCHAを解き、その分だけ収入を得る手段を提供できる。そして、解読されたCAPTCHAは彼らのシステムに入力され、大量の偽アカウントの登録を行うために利用される。
Terminal , the seldom used gateway to Unix on the Mac , has its fair share of interesting features , chief among them being the ability to play games from within the app itself .
Here ’s how .
Assuming that you do n’t keep the Terminal app right at your disposal in the dock , you can find it by opening up the “ Applications ” folder located in the Macintosh HD .
Once the “ Applications ” folder is open , scroll towards the bottom and locate the “ Utilities ” folder .
Open that puppy up and scroll towards the bottom once again ; you should see the “ Terminal ” app sitting there in all its glory .
Or if you ’re not the clicking type , you can simply press “ command - spacebar ” to bring up spotlight and start typing in ‘ Terminal ’ to bring up the app .
Once you have Terminal up and running , type in the following command :
ls /usr / share / emacs/22.1/lisp/play
Once you do that , a list of game titles should appear .
You ’ll note that each entry is listed twice , each with a different suffix .
You can disregard those and focus solely on the name of each game .
With that Terminal window open , press “ command -n ” to open up a new Terminal window .
Once open , type
emacs
into the command line .
This brings up the emacs editor , and now you ’re almost ready to embark on an ancient gaming experience .
After typing in “ emacs ” to bring up the editor , press the “ escape ” key and the “ x ” key in quick succession .
You should now see a prompt preceeded by “ M - x ” .
If so , you ’re ready to game .
Now , all you have to do is refer back to the original Terminal window and simply type in the name of the game you want to play , sans the suffix .
For example , to play “ tetris ” , simply type out “ tetris ” and wallah !
Off you are playing what seems like the first ever version of Tetris without any sound .
To play another game , press the “ escape ” and “ x ” key at any time to bring up the prompt once again .
Refer back to your original Terminal window and start experimenting .

Taylor has re-discovered his form after losing his Premier League crown in May
Phil Taylor claimed a record hat - trick of wins in the UK Open with an 11 - 6 victory over Colin Osborne in the final at the Reebok Stadium on Sunday .
The 48 - year - old followed up his victories in 2003 and 2005 with a win which was worth £ 40,000 in prize money .
Osborne , appearing in his first major final , led 3 - 0 in the early stages but Taylor found his form to ensure glory .
Taylor beat Mark Lawrence in the quarter - finals and Ronnie Baxter in the semi-finals to reach the final .
Taylor dropped just six legs during finals day in his opening three games in the event , before whitewashing Lawrence 10 - 0 in the quarter - finals .
He also held off Baxter 's challenge in the semi-finals with the Evesham thrower coming back from 6 - 0 down to 7 - 6 , before eventually losing 10 - 6 .
Osborne won the opening leg of the final on double top , and hit the same bed to break Taylor 's throw in leg two and again in the third to make a brilliant start with legs of 15 , 14 and 13 darts .
Taylor then went 5 - 3 up , and that was extended to 9 - 3 on double ten before Osborne landed double 16 .
Double five put Taylor a leg away from the title , only for legs of 13 and 14 darts to see Osborne threaten a comeback at 10 - 6 .
However Taylor soon wrapped up the title by hitting a 13 - darter and double top .
WASHINGTON , June 21 , 2009  --
Despite public support for an optional public health insurance plan , President Obama 's plan to include one in his health - care bill is facing intensified opposition on Capitol Hill .
The president has insisted on a government - run insurance program that would compete with private companies .
" You will have your choice of a number of plans that offer a few different packages , but every plan would offer an affordable , basic package , " the president said in an address to the American Medical Association in Chicago last week .
" And one of these options needs to be a public option that will give a broader range of choices and inject competition into the health - care market so that forces waste out of the system and keep the insurance companies honest , " he said .
His repeated efforts to pitch that option have met a receptive audience .
A New York Times poll released today said that a striking 72 percent of Americans support a public health - care plan , and 57 percent are willing to pay higher taxes to cover all Americans .
Nevertheless , the president 's chances for an optional health care plan that would be run by the government may be fading .
Republicans and some Democrats have expressed skepticism .
That scrutiny intensified this week after a Congressional Budget Office report found a Democratic plan in the Senate would cost at least $ 1 trillion over 10 years and cover just one - third of the uninsured .
" The CBO estimates were a death blow to a government - run health - care plan , " Sen . Lindsey Graham , R - S.C. , said today on ABC's " This Week With George Stephanopoulos . "
Republicans have repeatedly hammered the president on the proposal .
Sen .
Mitch McConnell has taken to the Senate floor daily to lament what Republicans consistently describes as " a government takeover of health care . "
Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn. , who is shepherding a bill through the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee as chief deputy to committee chairman Edward Kennedy , D - Mass . , said he still prefers a public option .
But Democrats are clearly on the defensive .
" We 're not done with this at all , " Dodd said today on " This Week . "
" If this were easy , it would have been done decades ago . "
This week , Dodd 's committee continues its markup of their version of health - care reform and is expected to consider a proposal for a public health insurance option and a mandate for employers to contribute .
The Senate Finance Committee , which is pursuing its own , private bipartisan health - care effort , has slowed the pace of its closed - door negotiations .
It remains unclear if the panel can agree on a plan that covers everyone and pares down the $ 1.6 trillion price tag , with or without a public option .
Democrats are scrambling to muster support for the president 's plan , but even some of them are skeptical .
" Well to be candid with you , I do n't know that he has the votes right now , " Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , told CNN , referring to the president .
" I think there 's a lot of concern in the Democratic Caucus . "
As the American republic ’s long death - spiral continues apace , newer and ever more insidious technologies usher us towards an age of high - tech barbarism .
“ At first glance ” Newsweek reveals , “ there was nothing special about the blimp floating high above the cars and crowd at this year ’s Indy 500 on Memorial Day weekend . ”
“ Nothing special ” that is , until you took a closer look .
What you then discovered was another quintessentially American innovation , all the more chilling for its bland ubiquity .
A silent , hovering sentinel linking commerce and repression ; a perfect trope for our ersatz democracy .
“ Like most airships ” Newsweek continued , “ it acted as an advertising vehicle . ”
But the real promo should have been for the blimp ’s creator , Raytheon , the security company best known for its weapons systems .
Hidden inside the 55 - foot - long white balloon was a powerful surveillance camera adapted from the technology Raytheon provides the U.S. military .
Essentially an unmanned drone , the blimp transmitted detailed images to the race ’s security officers and to Indiana police .
“ The airship is great because it does n’t have that Big Brother feel , or create feelings of invasiveness , ” says Lee Silvestre , vice president of mission innovation in Raytheon ’s Integrated Defense division .
“ But it ’s still a really powerful security tool . ” ( Kurt Soller , “ Are You Being Watched ?
The blimp flying above your head may be watching your every move , ” Newsweek , June 11 , 2009 )
“ It does n’t have that Big Brother feel ” and yet here , as elsewhere , the “ feelings of invasiveness ” are implicit , unseen , invisible , the securitized DNA giving form and structure to the Empire ’s “ new normal . ”
Imported from America ’s aggressive wars of conquest in Iraq and Afghanistan and now deployed in the heimat , sprawling intelligence and security bureaucracies have teamed - up with corporate scofflaws to fill a market niche , inflating the bottom - line at the expense of a cherished freedom : the right to be left alone .
But as Antifascist Calling has noted many times , “ what happens in Vegas ” certainly does n’t stay there , a point driven home by Raytheon .
“ Anticipating requirements for innovative and affordable ways to provide intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ( ISR ) , ” according to a company press release , “ Raytheon is using aerostats –modern blimps or balloons –carrying high - tech sensors to detect threats on the ground and in the air at distances that enable appropriate countermeasures . ”
Known as RAID ( Rapid Aerostat Initial Deployment ) the system is kitted - out with “ electro- optic infrared , radar , flash and acoustic detectors . ”
According to the firm , some 300 have been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The same military version , as Newsweek reported and Raytheon confirmed , “ demonstrated to officials concerned with security and spectator safety its value by providing situational awareness in what is billed as one of the largest sporting events of the year . ”
Indeed Charles Burns , the director of Corporate Security for the Indy Racing League said in the company ’s press release : “ Conducting this demo with Raytheon gives us the opportunity to evaluate new and innovative technology that keeps our venues safe and optimizes the racing experience for our fans . ”
Along with a suite of sensors and high resolution video cameras , RAID ’s digitized mapping tools are similar to those developed for the National Geospatial - Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) .
In tandem with a preprogrammed mapping grid of the target location , the system can scan a wide area and relay video clips to a centralized command center .
Captured data known as GEOINT , or geospatial intelligence , is “ tailored for customer - specific solutions ” according to NGA .
That agency along with its “ sister ” organization , the National Reconnaissance Office ( NRO ) , the super - secret agency that develops and flies America ’s fleet of spy satellites are also among the most heavily - outsourced departments in the so - called Intelligence Community .
As investigative journalist Tim Shorrock points out in his essential book , Spies For Hire , giant defense firms such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman “ with assistance from Republican lawmakers from the House Intelligence Committee , ” helped launch a lobby shop for the industry in 2004 , the United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation ( USGIF ) .
Self - described as a “ not - for - profit educational foundation , ” USGIF “ is the only organization dedicated to promoting the geospatial intelligence tradecraft and building a stronger community of interest across industry , academia , government , professional organizations and individual stakeholders . ”
Since its formation , USGIF has expanded to some 154 companies and state agencies and has an annual budget that exceeds $ 1 million .
“ Strategic partners ” include the usual suspects , corporate heavy - hitters such as Northrop Grumman , Raytheon , Science Applications International Corporation , Boeing , Booz Allen Hamilton , Lockheed Martin , BAE Systems , IBM , Google , AT&T , Microsoft , The MITRE Corporation , and L3 Communications .
Additionally , niche companies such as Analytical Graphics , Inc. , DigitalGlobe , GeoEye , Intergraph , PCI Geomatics , TechniGraphics , Inc. , flesh - out USGIF ’s roster .
In this context , the public roll - out of RAID is all the more pressing for securocrats and the companies they serve since Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano “ plans to kill a program begun by the Bush administration that would use U.S. spy satellites for domestic security and law enforcement , ” the Associated Press reported June 22 .
That program , the National Applications Office ( NAO ) was first announced by the Bush regime in 2007 and was mired in controversy from the get - go .
As Antifascist Calling reported last year , NAO would coordinate how domestic law enforcement and “ disaster relief ” agencies such as FEMA utilize GEOINT and imagery intelligence ( IMINT ) generated by U.S. spy satellites .
But as with other heimat security schemes there was little in the way of oversight and zero concern for the rights of the American people .
The intrusiveness of the program was so severe that even Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , the author of the despicable “ Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ” ( H.R. 1955 ) vowed to pull the plug .
Chairwoman of the Homeland Security Committee ’s Intelligence , Information Sharing and Terrorism Risk Assessment subcommittee , Harman introduced legislation earlier this month that would have shut down NAO immediately while prohibiting the agency from spending money on NAO or similar programs .
When the bill was introduced , Harman told Federal Computer Week : “ Imagine , for a moment , what it would be like if one of these satellites were directed on your neighborhood or home , a school or place of worship–and without an adequate legal framework or operating procedures in place for regulating their use .
I daresay the reaction might be that Big Brother has finally arrived and the black helicopters can’t be far behind .
Yet this is precisely what the Department of Homeland Security has done in standing up the benign - sounding National Applications Office , or NAO . ”
According to the Los Angeles Times , Napolitano reached a decision to cut NAO off at the knees “ after consulting with state and local law enforcement officials and learning that they had far more pressing priorities than using satellites to collect information and eavesdrop on people . ”
Perhaps those “ pressing priorities ” could be better served by a low - key approach , say the deployment of a system such as RAID ?
After all , what ’s so threatening about a blimp ?
It comes as no surprise then , that the next target for Raytheon marketeers are precisely local police departments and sports facilities “ that want to keep an eye on crowds that might easily morph into an unruly mob , ” as Newsweek delicately put it .
Nathan Kennedy , Raytheon ’s project manager for the spy blimp told the publication , “ large municipalities could find many uses for this [ technology ] once we figure out how to get it in their hands . ”
While the company refuses to divulge what this intrusive system might actually cost cash - strapped localities drastically cutting social services for their citizens as America morphs into a failed state , municipalities “ without a Pentagon - size police budget ” could look at the airship ’s “ potential to display ads [ that ] may assist with financing . ”
Raytheon claims that local authorities fearful of succumbing to what I ’d call a dreaded “ surveillance airship gap , ” could install “ a built - in LED screen to attract sponsors , generate revenue and defer operating costs . ”
How convenient !
However , Raytheon ’s slimmed - down surveillance airship is a spin - off from a larger Pentagon project .
Among other high - tech , privacy - killing tools currently under development is the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency ’s ( DARPA ) Integrated Sensor Is Structure ( ISIS ) program .
As conceived by the agency , ISIS will be a high - altitude autonomous airship built for the U.S. Air Force that can operate at 70,000 feet and stay aloft for a decade .
Washington Technology reported April 29 , that Lockheed Martin won a $ 400 million deal to design the system .
“ Under the contract ” the publication revealed , “ Lockheed Martin will provide systems integration services , and Raytheon Co. will furnish a high - energy , low - power density radar , Lockheed Martin officials said . ”
Operating six miles above the earth ’s surface , well out of range of surface - to - air missiles , the airship will be some 450 feet long , powered by hydrogen fuel cells and packed with electronic surveillance gear and radar currently being field - tested by Raytheon .
Projects such as ISIS reflect a shift in Pentagon planning and spending priorities .
Under Bush regime holdover , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , the military plans to leverage America ’s technological advantage to improve intelligence and surveillance capabilities at the expense of over - inflated big ticket items such as the F - 22 Raptor or new Navy destroyers .
Gates and others in the Pentagon believe a shift towards “ robust ISR platforms ” will better facilitate the Pentagon ’s new paradigm : waging multiple , counterinsurgency wars of conquest to secure natural resources and strategic advantage vis-à - vis imperialism ’s geopolitical rivals .
But military might and technological preeminence , however formidable , represented by the Pentagon ’s quixotic quest for total “ situational awareness ” promised by platforms such as ISIS and RAID , will no more ameliorate the Empire ’s extreme political weakness than putting a band - aid over a gangrenous lesion changes the outcome for a dying patient .
Malcom Gladwell kicked off this morning ’s New Yorker summit with a talk about the causes of the financial crisis in general , and of the collapse of Bear Stearns in particular , and started provocatively , by saying that if his diagnosis of the problem is correct , then really “ there are n’t any solutions ” .
Gladwell ’s diagnosis is simple : massive amounts of overconfidence , as revealed by its two most common symptoms , miscalibration and the illusion of control .
Both of which can be seen in spades in the person of Jimmy Cayne , whose interviews with William Cohan for House of Cards show a man who ’s really very deluded about what Cohan , and Cohan ’s readers , are going to think of him .
More generally , said Gladwell ,
What ’s going on on Wall Street is n’t the result of experts failing to act as experts : it ’s the result of experts acting exactly like experts act .
It ’s not a result of incompetence , it ’s a result of overconfidence .
When we look for evidence of miscalibration in people , he said , we find it overwhelmingly in experts .
We find it when people are in conditions of great stress and complexity and competitiveness .
And we find it overwhelmingly with older , more experienced people , doing difficult things which they feel very strongly about .
Jimmy Cayne , said Gladwell , is the picture of overconfidence — and he ’s quite typical when it comes to heads of Wall Street banks .
And so , Gladwell concluded :
Our goal is not to enhance the expertise on Wall Street .
Expertise they have in spades .
Our goal is to rein in the expertise on Wall Street .
Wall Street needs to be slower , less competitive , and a lot more boring .
This is undoubtedly true — the difficult thing , of course , is how to legislate it , in a world where banks are falling over themselves to repay TARP funds and start taking on lots of risk again .
Here ’s Matthew Richardson and Nouriel Roubini write in the WSJ this morning :
Consider also recent bank risk - taking .
The media has recently reported that Citigroup and Bank of America were buying up some of the AAA - tranches of nonprime mortgage - backed securities .
Did n’t the government provide insurance on portfolios of $ 300 billion and $ 118 billion on the very same stuff for Citi and BofA this past year ?
These securities are at the heart of the financial crisis and the core of the PPIP .
If true , this is egregious behavior — and it ’s incredible that there are no restrictions against it .
But if there were restrictions against this behavior in particular , the same banks , or other banks , would find other ways to chase risk , just because they ’re so confident that they can make billions of dollars — and get themselves out of their present hole — by doing so .
They might even be right : 95 % of the time , they probably are right .
But that ’s the Rubin trade : it works until it does n’t .
And although it ’s the easy solution to the problem , it ’s also a very worrying solution to the problem , because it just sets up yet another inevitable meltdown at some unknown point in the future .
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s defense minister insisted on Saturday it would only use its military for defense , a long - standing position that has been tossed up for debate by Japanese lawmakers as they worry about a nuclear North Korea .
Anxiety over Pyongyang ’s intentions , after a nuclear test and a series of missile launches this week , has sparked calls for Japan to develop the capability to strike at enemy bases in the event of an imminent attack , despite its pacifist constitution .
“ We will never start an action as such , ” Yasukazu Hamada told a meeting of Asian defense ministers in Singapore .
“ We have also made clear that we do not use force in order to resolve conflict situations and so whatever the steps we take it will only be for defense . ”
The first of 12 high - tech U.S. F - 22 fighter jets landed on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa on Saturday , after U.S. President Barack Obama reassured Prime Minister Taro Aso this week of Washington ’s commitment to the defense of its Asian ally .
Hamada said Japan was still considering buying more U.S. fighter jets but these would not be for an attack .
“ We are of course looking at other procurements such as F - 22s etc , but only for the defense of the country as such , ” he said .
“ We have mentioned that North Korea is a threat only because of what has happened in the past . ”
After a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his South Korean counterpart , Hamada said North Korea ’s test violated U.N. Security Council resolutions and called on the isolated state to abandon its nuclear and missile programs .
“ We are the only country that has had an atomic attack , and we are very aware of that , and we of course will be making ultimate efforts for anti-proliferation as well as abandonment of nuclear weapons , ” Hamada told the Asia Security Conference in Singapore .
The annual meeting , also known as the “ Shangri - La Dialogue ” after the hotel where it is taking place , brings together defense chiefs and military brass from 27 countries , along with arms dealers and security analysts .
Today , just three months after our February budget , we once again face a $ 24 - billion deficit .
California 's day of reckoning is here .
In order to deal with our ....
We are now back to the same level of revenues we had in 2003 , and when you adjust for inflation and population , we are back to the level of the late '90s .
Now , as I stand here today , we are in the midst of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression .
In the past 18 months one - third of the world 's wealth has vanished .
And because of that and because of California 's outdated and volatile tax system , our revenues have dropped 27 % from last year .
And you can see this right here on the charts next to me ; it 's very clear .
But as you know , part of our budget agreement required us , by law , to go back to the people for approval , right at a time when the people wanted to send Sacramento a powerful message .
And that message was clear :
Do your job .
Do n’t come to us with those complex issues .
Live within your means .
Get rid of the waste and inefficiencies and do n't raise taxes .
Today I want to talk about financial crisis .
Three months ago the members of this body came together to set aside their ideological differences and did what they believed was best for California .
We solved $ 36 billion of a $ 42 - billion deficit .
First of all , I want to thank you for the gracious invitation to address you here today and to address the people of California .
Thank you .
Thank you very much , Speaker Bass , Senate Leader Steinberg , Assemblyman Blakeslee , Sen.
Hollingsworth , my fellow constitutional officers and my fellow servants of the people .
Following is the complete text of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's budget speech to the Legislature this week , which his office also released as weekly remarks .
An obvious attempt to save money :
... limited amount of money , I have proposed some dramatic changes in our May revision .
Those spending cuts represent much more than the hard decisions necessary to balance our budget .
They represent the transformation of what services Sacramento can provide and how those services are delivered .
The immediate task before us is to cut spending to the money that is available to us .
We have no time to waste .
The controller has told us that we have 14 days to act or California is at risk of running out of cash .
I 've already used my executive authority to reduce the state payroll and I 've proposed the necessary cuts to the three largest areas of our budget , which is education , healthcare and prisons .
I know the consequences of those cuts are not just dollars .
I see the faces behind those dollars .
I see the children whose teachers will be laid off .
I see the Alzheimer 's patients losing some of their in - home support services .
I see the firefighters and the police officers who will lose their jobs .
People come up to me all the time , pleading , " Governor , please do n't cut my program . "
They tell me about how those cuts affect them and their loved ones .
I see the pain in their eyes and I hear the fear in their voices and I hear the demonstrations outside of our Capitol .
It 's an awful feeling , but we have no choice .
Our wallet is empty , our bank is closed and our credit is dried up .
I know for many of you these will be the hardest votes that you will ever make .
But the people sent us here to lead not only in times of prosperity but also in times of crisis .
We must make these cuts and live within in our means , because what is the alternative ?
If we do n’t act , the state will simply run out of money and go insolvent .
You see , we are not Washington .
We cannot print our own money , we can not run trillion - dollar deficits , and we can only spend the money that we have .
That is the harsh but simple reality .
Now , at the same time , we cannot take this budget and make it just about cuts .
There are also some great opportunities here for structural reform .
Like Winston Churchill said , " A pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity , but an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty . "
So let 's use this crisis as an opportunity to make government more efficient and to find innovative ways to stretch the taxpayer dollar .
Can we not find a way to provide those services at a lower cost ?
For example , I 've asked our State Board of Education to make textbooks available in digital formats .
Now , we expect the first science and math books to be digital by this fall .
If we expand this to more textbooks , schools could save hundreds of millions of dollars a year , and that 's hundreds of millions of dollars that could be used to hire more teachers and to reduce class sizes .
In so many areas of government there are opportunities like this for reform .
All we have to do is go out and seize them .
Spending on prisons has nearly doubled in the last five years .
We spend $ 49,000 per inmate per year ; the national average is only $ 32,000 .
Now , other states have privately run correctional facilities that operate at half of the cost .
Why can't we ?
We must also restructure the relationship between state and local government .
We all hear from the local officials about the heavy hand of Sacramento .
If we are providing fewer resources we have an obligation to cut most of the strings and mandates and to get out of the way .
Right now we are cutting billions of dollars from our schools , so should n't we give districts more freedom and flexibility and not tie their hands with strict rules like who is allowed to mow the lawn or fix the roof , or do the plumbing ?
I ’m also proposing once again to eliminate and consolidate more than a dozen state departments , boards and commissions .
These include the Waste Management Board , the Court Reporters Board , the Department of Boating and Waterways and the Inspection and Maintenance Review Committee and so on .
There is absolutely no reason to hold onto those redundant boards in the crisis .
We should not , and I will not , cut a dollar from education or a dollar from healthcare or a dollar from public safety or a dollar from our state parks without first cutting the Waste Management Board and other boards like it .
[ Applause ]
Every dollar that we save from those boards and commissions is a dollar that can help vulnerable citizens .
I 'm also proposing to sell off state property , because Sacramento should not be in the real estate business , especially when we are in a fiscal crisis like this .
Now , I know that the money that we receive from this property wo n't go directly to the general fund ; it will pay off debt .
But that lowers our debt payment , which then does help the general fund .
Everywhere I go , I hear stories about families selling off their boats and motorcycles to make ends meet .
They have garage sales , they have yard sales .
They know that you do n't have or keep a boat at the dock when you can't put food on the table .
All of these proposals I have talked about for years and yet they never got done .
I remember in 2004 , I talked about blowing up the boxes and consolidating agencies .
But now we are here in a crisis .
Then we had the revenues go up and we had the economy come back in a big way , so we could n’t get it done .
Now we 're in a crisis and we are running out of excuses and we have run out of time .
And the people have run out of patience .
Early this year we began consolidating all of our IT departments .
My proposal to consolidate all of our energy functions is in the legislation before you right now .
So is a proposal to consolidate the departments that oversee financial institutions , and I will soon send you legislation to merge our tax - collection operations .
These are all actions that we here can take , on our own , to save money and to make government more efficient , and we do n’t have to bother the people with those things and we do n't need permission from the federal government .
Now , I know that Sen .
Steinberg is talking about reforming and restructuring the relationships between the state and local government , and Sen. Hollingsworth and the Republicans have some great ideas about performance - based budgeting .
And in July , we should receive the bipartisan recommendation from our tax - modernization commission .
This will be a tremendous opportunity to make our revenues more reliable and less volatile and to help the state avoid the boom and the bust budgets that have brought us here today .
Let 's all work together on all of those issues and make it happen .
I do n’t expect every single one of those reforms to happen within the next 14 days , but we can certainly get them done before this party adjourns for summer recess on July 17 .
Now , there are other big reforms that I continue to believe in very strongly , like a spending cap and the rainy - day fund in order to further stabilize our revenues , but I ’m not going to talk to you today about that because those reforms require voter approval .
As we all have learned just a few weeks ago , the voters will never trust us on those big issues until we show that we can do our job in this Capitol and make the tough decisions .
There is no doubt that the challenges before us are enormous .
They will test our will .
They will test our resolve .
They will test our leadership .
Many of those things that I ’m proposing are despised by the special interests that rely on the status quo , and we are all too familiar with the interest groups and their army of lobbyists .
But let ’s not forget , it is our job .
We have been sent here to Sacramento to lobby on behalf of the people and on behalf of the great state of California .
So in the coming days and weeks , the entire nation will be watching how we react and respond to this crisis .
Last week Paul Krugman from the New York Times wrote that California is at a state of paralysis and that our political system has failed to rise to the occasion .
People are writing California off .
They are talking about the end of California dream .
They do n’t believe that we in this room have the courage and the determination to do what needs to be done , or that the state is even manageable .
Let ’s prove all the pundits wrong .
Let us use this crisis as an opportunity , as an opportunity for great changes , lasting changes .
Let ’s not think just in short term ; let ’s think big ; let ’s think outside the box .
Let ’s think long - term and lay a new foundation for California ’s future .
Let ’s meet those challenges head - on without gimmicks .
I do n’t want to hand these problems to the next governor , and I know that you do n’t want to hand them to the next Legislature .
So I have faith in all of you .
I have faith in our ability to once again come together for the good of our state .
So I say let ’s move forward and put California back on the path to prosperity .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .

Chemists at New York University and Harvard University have created a bipedal , autonomous DNA " walker " that can mimic a cell 's transportation system .
The device , which marks a step toward more complex synthetic molecular motor systems , is described in the most recent issue of the journal Science .
Two fundamental components of life 's building blocks are DNA , which encodes instructions for making proteins , and motor proteins , such as kinesin , which are part of a cell 's transportation system .
In nature , single strands of DNA — each containing four molecules , or bases , attached to backbone — self - assemble to form a double helix when their bases match up .
Kinesin is a molecular motor that carries various cargoes from one place in the cell to another .
Scientists have sought to re-create this capability by building DNA walkers .
Earlier versions of walkers , which move along a track of DNA , did not function autonomously , thereby requiring intervention at each step .
A challenge these previous devices faced was coordinating the movement of the walker 's legs so they could move in a synchronized fashion without falling off the track .
To create a walker that could move on its own , the NYU and Harvard researchers employed two DNA " fuel strands . "
These fuel strands push the walker ( blue ) along a track of DNA , thereby allowing the walker and the fuel strands to function as a catalytic unit .
The forward progress of the system is driven by the fact that more base pairs are formed every step — a process that creates the energy necessary for movement .
As the walker moves along the DNA track , it forms base pairs .
Simultaneously , the fuel strands move the walker along by binding to the track and then releasing the walker 's legs , thereby allowing the walker to take " steps " .
The track 's length is 49 nanometers — if the track was one meter long , an actual meter , enlarged proportionally , would be the approximate diameter of the earth .
For a video demonstration of the walker , go to http://www.nyu.edu/public.affairs/videos/qtime/biped_movie.mov.
The walker was created in the laboratory of NYU Chemistry Professor Nadrian Seeman , one of the article 's co-authors .
The paper 's other authors were Tosan Omabegho , a doctoral candidate at Harvard 's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences , and Ruojie Sha , a senior research associate in the NYU Chemistry Department .
Last week an unknown gamer somewhere in the world unpacked and fired up the 100 millionth Nintendo DS to be sold by the Japanese gaming giant .
That 's a hell of a lot of Dual Screen hand - held consoles – and sets the DS franchise apart as the fastest - selling system in gaming history .
It took Nintendo more than 11 years to sell 100 million Game Boys .
The touchscreen DS , which will appear next month in its third incarnation , the DSi , did it in just four years and three months ( that 's a rate of 45 sales every minute ) .
It 's a measure of the might of the games industry that Nintendo can knock out sleek slabs of hinged plastic at such a furious pace , but such is the feverish dedication of gamers that the industry is full of jaw - dropping figures ...

What is it that you like to do most ?
What burning desires do you have ?
Do you know how to tap into your internal / external energy ?
Do you know what your dominant personality trait is ?
Most likely , you ’re going to have to ponder somewhat to find the answers to the above questions , but that ’s okay .
I had to do the same .
There was a time , when I did n’t like myself and did n’t know where I was going , let alone how to get there .
I wanted to make a substantial income , who does n’t that ’s breathing , and I wanted to help others do the same .
I had a growing and somewhat successful construction business , renovating homes , but I felt that there was something else far more important , than lining my pockets out there , waiting for me .
I prayed long before I stumbled upon an ebook on the internet .
I knew network marketing was my ticket even though I failed several attempts .
It is vaguely memorable now when I think about the webpage I found , I may have googled it , I think , for a mentor .
See , I knew that if I was going to succeed in network marketing , I would have to have a mentor .
Why ? , because I was n’t confident enough in myself or knowing how to choose the right company .
I was already in a company that was n’t living up to its promises and when I really got determined that this was the right industry , wrong company , I started searching .
I downloaded an ebook , read 16 pages , got busy , and a few nights later , received a call asking me if I was able to download and open it okay , which I did .
Even though I told “ her ” that I was looking for a new company , she would n’t tell me hers .
Her main purpose was to have me read the book and listen to some audios that she was sending me links to , as we spoke .
I never had that happen before , have you ?
Everyone wants you in their deal !!!
Well , I finished reading the book that night , listened to the recordings and my life has never been the same !
That ’s a Good Thing !
If you ’re still out there searching for the right company , if you ’re not sure who you are or where you want to be , if you ’re looking for a mentor and / or coach , do yourself a favor and click on the book cover on the upper right corner .

UCLA scientists have discovered a variant of a gene called CACNA1G that may increase a child 's risk of developing autism , particularly in boys .
Classic autism strikes boys four times more often than girls .
When including the entire spectrum of autism disorders , such as the milder Asperger syndrome , boys are diagnosed 10 times more often than girls .
The journal Molecular Psychiatry publishes the findings in its May 19 advance online edition .
" This is a strong finding , " said Dr. Stanley Nelson , professor of human genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA .
" No one has scrutinized the role that CACNA1G plays in autism .
" We found that a common form of the gene occurs more frequently in the DNA of families that have two or more sons affected by autism , but no affected daughters , " he explained .
" Our study may explain why boys are more susceptible to the disorder than girls . "
Nelson and his colleagues zeroed in on a region of Chromosome 17 that previous studies have tied to autism .
The research team scoured the DNA of 1,046 members of families with at least two sons affected by autism for common gene variants .
A variant is a gene that has undergone subtle changes from the normal DNA yet is shared by a significant portion of the population .

The researchers used tools of the Human Genome Project to scan thousands of variants across all genes in the suspicious region of the chromosome and to pluck out the most common forms .
" We wanted to identify what was happening in this region of Chromosome 17 that boosts autism risk , " said Nelson .
" When the same genetic markers kept cropping up in a single region of the DNA , we knew we had uncovered a big clue . "
The researchers traced the genetic markers to CACNA1G , which helps move calcium between the cells .
They discovered that the gene has a common variant that appears in the DNA of nearly 40 percent of the population .
" This alternate form of CACNA1G consistently increased the correlation to autism spectrum disorder , suggesting that inheriting the gene may heighten a child 's risk of developing autism , " observed Nelson .
How the gene contributes to higher autism risk remains unclear , but Nelson emphasized that it cannot be considered a risk factor on its own .

" This variant is a single piece of the puzzle , " he said .
" We need a larger sample size to identify all of the genes involved in autism and to solve the whole puzzle of this disease . "
The UCLA team 's next step will be to sequence the gene in people who possess the altered variant in order to identify the exact change that increases autism risk .
These subtle variations offer potential markers for the real mutation causing greater susceptibility to the disease .
Nelson 's coauthors included Samuel Strom , Jennifer Stone , John ten Bosch , Barry Merriman , Rita Cantor and Daniel Geschwind , all of UCLA .
The study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and Cure Autism Now , which has since merged with Autism Speaks .
The DNA samples and clinical data were provided by families who donated blood to the Los Angeles–based Autism Genetic Resource Exchange ( AGRE ) , a program created and funded by Cure Autism Now .
" When parents like me first formed AGRE , this was our dream , that talented scientists would use our gene bank to collaborate and bring us closer to understanding autism , " said Jon Shestack , co-founder of Cure Autism Now and a board member of Autism Speaks .
" AGRE has played an important role in almost every major autism genetics paper in the past five years . "
Autism is a complex brain disorder that strikes in early childhood .
The condition disrupts a child 's ability to communicate and develop social relationships and is often accompanied by acute behavioral challenges .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that one in 150 American children is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder .
The diagnosis of autism has expanded tenfold in the last decade .
* At age 8 , she sent a petition with 300 signatures to President Eisenhower asking that girls and African Americans be allowed to play Little League baseball .
* Age 8 also found Linda showing other early signs of activism .
She uniformly drank from water fountains marked “ colored ” instead of the ones marked “ white ” and made sure to ride in the back of the bus ( for which she was “ thrown off ” the bus more than once ) .
* In 1961 , her widely known pit - bull stubbornness was evidenced at a piano recital .
After having blown the heck out of the Moonlight Sonata in 1960 , she announced to her mom and dad she would not be playing in the recital of ’ 61 .
Her mother announced back -- and louder -- that indeed she would play in the recital … end of subject .
So , Linda found a poison ivy field , bathed her hands up to her elbows in the stuff and spent the next 6 weeks wrapped in bandages .
However , she did NOT play in the recital of ’ 61 or any thereafter !
* In ’69 she started college and was elected President of the Freshman Class .
She neglected her studies woefully and spent all of her time marching in the Civil Rights movement and plotting with her friends as to how to save the world .
They had almost accomplished it ( saving the world ) when they graduated and were dispersed .
Linda ’s mom blames the 60’s for almost everything she does n’t understand about Linda .
In what looked -- at least from the outside -- like one of the most unlikely outcomes of the 2008 election cycle , Democrat Linda Ketner came within two percentage points of beating entrenched Establishment wingnut Rep. Henry Brown in a gerrymandered South Carolina district specifically drawn to be an easy win for Republicans .
At the same time , Obama only managed 42 % in the district .
Linda was the only South Carolina Democrat who came close to ousting an incumbent last year .
Until near the end of the campaign the DCCC and the punditocracy did n't have a clue .
The fact that Linda is openly gay and openly progressive on social issues -- and very outspoken -- caused quite a few people to not even give the race a second look .
I 've been trying to persuade her to run again in 2010 , and asked her to come by and meet our community today .
Before asking you to join us in the Firedoglake comments section , let me share with you a helpful bio her brother had some fun with : I asked her if she thought being upfront about being gay , even campaigning with her partner of 9 years , Beth Huntley , impacted the race .
" When you lose by such a tight margin , anything could have played a role . "
In focus groups she found that people did n't care about her personal sexual preference but respected her honesty .
" We have more gay people serving in South Carolina than probably in anyplace in the United States ; they 're just not out of the closet .
We have an awful lot of people in the closet -- Lindsey Graham , Glenn McConnell who 's our Senate president pro tem , our Lt Governor ...
I obviously lost the conservative , religious crazy vote , but I would have anyway because I 'm pro-choice ...
It got more national attention than it did local attention ; it was no secret to anybody around here . "
She actually won in Charleston County .
Speaking with Linda on the phone this week she reminded me a lot -- in her attitudes towards taxpayers ' money , towards corruption , towards the abuses of incumbency -- of Alan Grayson .
Somehow she has the idea that her impetus towards reform gives her something in common with Blue Dogs .
I almost fell out of my chair .
She promised to do some research into Grayson .
She 'll be blogging live for 2 hours at FDL today starting at 2 pm ( ET ) .

Content of HTML table cells can be dragged to another cell or another table .
It is n’t difficult to define onMouseMove handler and change top / left element styles to move the object .
In case with tables , you will have to determine somehow target cell .
Attaching onMouseOver handler on TD elements will not work , because browser does n’t fire events to the elements below the dragged object .
Anyway , after taking care of the current scroll position and calculating TD positions , REDIPS.drag should work in recent major browsers like Google Chrome , Firefox , Safari , Internet Explorer , Opera and mobile devices as well .
Click on image below , will open live demo where you can drag green , blue or orange bordered DIV elements , change properties ( radio button and check - boxes ) and click on “ Save ” button .
Download latest version redips2.tar.gz
REDIPS.drag example01
In this example “ Save ” button will scan table content , create query string and send to PHP page .
Demo shows how to collect content and accept parameters on the server side .
More about accepting parameters you can read at Reading multiple parameters in PHP .
“ Clone ” elements ( orange in this demo ) will be duplicated first because of “ redips - clone ” keyword contained in class name .
If you drop object on cell named “ Trash ” , object will be deleted from the table ( with or without confirmation ) .
Library has built in autoscroll and option to forbid landing to non empty cells or cells named with class “ redips - mark ” .
Table can contain rowspan / colspan TDs and different background color for every cell .
Here are minimal steps to enable content dragging in table :
put < script type=” text / javascript ” src=” redips-drag-min.js ” ></ script > to the head section
to the head section initialize REDIPS.drag library : < body onload= ” REDIPS.drag.init ( ) ” >
place table (s ) inside < div id =” redips - drag ” > to enable content dragging
to enable content dragging place < div class= ” redips - drag ” > Hello World < / div > to the table cell
Other features of REDIPS. drag library :
methods and data structure are defined in namespace ( easier integration with other JS frameworks )
all JavaScript code is checked with ESLint
REDIPS.drag documentation generated with JsDoc Toolkit
drag and drop table rows
movable DIV element can contain other HTML code ( images , forms , tables …)
forbidding or allowing TDs marked with class name “ redips - mark ”
option to define exceptions and allow dropping certain DIV elements to the marked cell
option to define single content cell on the table declared with “ multiple ” drop option
cloning for unlimited cloning add “ redips - clone ” class name to the DIV object
< div class= ” redips - drag redips - clone ” > Hello World < / div > to limit cloning and transform last object to the ordinary movable object add ‘ climit1 _X ’ class name
< div class= ” redips - drag redips - clone climit1_4 ″ > Hello World < / div > to limit cloning and transform last object to immovable object add ‘ climit2 _X ’ class name
< div class= ” redips - drag redips - clone climit2_4 ″ > Hello World < / div > where X is integer and defines number of cloned elements ( in previous examples , each climit will allow only 4 cloned elements )
unlimited nested tables support
dropping objects only to empty cells
switch cell content
switching cell content continuously
overwrite TD content with dropped element
shift table content
table cell with “ redips - trash ” class name becomes trashcan
enabled handlers to place custom code on events : changed , clicked , cloned , clonedDropped , clonedEnd1 , clonedEnd2 , dblClicked , deleted , dropped , droppedBefore , finish , moved , notCloned , notMoved , shiftOverflow , relocateBefore , relocateAfter , relocateEnd , rowChanged , rowClicked , rowCloned , rowDeleted , rowDropped , rowDroppedBefore , rowDroppedSource , rowMoved , rowNotCloned , rowNotMoved , rowUndeleted , switched and undeleted
deleting cloned DIV if the cloned DIV is dragged outside of any table
enabling / disabling dragging
animation ( move element / row to the destination cell / row )
added support for touch devices ( touchstart , touchmove , touchend )
How REDIPS.drag works ?
Script will search for DIV elements ( with class name “ redips - drag ” ) inside tables closed in < div id=” redips - drag ” > and attach onMouseDown event handler .
When user clicks with left mouse button on DIV element , onMouseMove and onMouseUp handlers will be attached to the document level .
While dragging DIV element , script changes its “ left ” and “ top ” styles .
This is function of the onMouseMove handler .
When user releases left mouse button , onMouseUp event handler will unlink onMouseMove and onMouseUp event handlers .
This way , browser will listen and process mousemove events only when DIV element is dragged .
As I mentioned , onMouseDown is defined on the elements you want to drag .
Elements beneath the dragged object will not be able to catch onMouseOver event .
Why ?
Because you are dragging object and that object only can catch the onMouseOver event .
So , to detect destination table cells , script calculates all cell coordinates ( with scroll page offset ) and store them to the array .
Array is searched inside onMouseMove handler and after left mouse button is released , DIV will drop to the current ( highlighted ) table cell .
In redips2.tar.gz package you will find many examples including example of how to save / recall table using PHP and MySQL .
Package also contains and redips - drag - min.js – a compressed version of REDIPS. drag library ( compressed with Google Closure Compiler ) .
Happy dragging and dropping !
There are two problems with Obama 's attempts to stave off foreclosures through mortgage modifications .
First , the program is a drop in the bucket ( at best , a couple of million mortgages will be modified out of tens of millions that are underwater ) .
Second , even homeowners whose payments are reduced usually go on to default .
Why ?
Because they can't afford ANY payment , not even a smaller one .
And also because many homeowners see no reason to keep making payments on houses when they owe more on the house than its worth .
John Mauldin relays the following from Diana Olick at CNBC :
" Yesterday Fitch ratings estimated that up to 75 percent of the modifications now being done through the administration 's Making Home Affordable program will re-default in six months to a year .
I 'm not talking about the old modifications , which were largely repayment plans that could actually raise monthly payments .
I 'm talking about the new mods , which lower monthly payments to 31 percent of a person 's income .
I could n't understand Fitch 's reasoning , so I called them .
" Diane Pendley , managing director at Fitch , said the problem is not on that " front - end " ratio , but on the back end , which is all of the borrowers other debt ( credit cards , car loans , student loans , etc. ) .
She said that in talking with servicers , she 's hearing other debt is so high that most of today 's troubled borrowers cannot afford any loan payment at all , even at a very modest debt - to - income ratio .
' Just getting the house payment done does n't mean their lifestyle is sustainable , ' she said .
" Another problem is that with home prices continuing to fall , more and more borrowers , who are essentially just renting their mortgages now because they will never see any home equity , are walking away .
Even if the mortgage payment is low , the property taxes and home maintenance costs are padding that payment , and without an upside to the investment , there 's simply no reason to pay .
Suffice it to say , the foreclosure crisis , on the high and low ends , is not getting any better . "
The quickest fix to the housing market is not stopping foreclosures or trying to stop the fall in prices .
( That 's just kicking the can down the road ) .
It 's allowing prices to fall to a level at which the market will clear and then making it as easy as possible for those who can't afford their houses to move into housing they can afford .
This is actually happening in Phoenix , as investors are buying up foreclosed houses at auction and then renting them to their former owners .

Coffee was cultivated in Africa as early as the 9th century , but it did not reach Europe until the 17th century .
However , when it did , it was met with many varying opinions .
It still caught on like a wildfire , even with the people that detested its existence .
The 18th century London coffee house was the center of controversy , in many ways , even to the point of the king trying to ban coffee and close the establishments .
Being the place for political discussion , some of the policies of our newly formed country might have originated in one of these places .
Coffee did not come via a direct route from Africa , but found its way to Britain through Mediterranean trade routes with the Muslim world .
Queen Elizabeth
I irritated her European neighbors by opening up diplomatic relations with her new - found Moroccan and Ottoman friends , establishing good trading relations and sea-faring agreements .
This trade allowed goods such as tea from Asia , coffee , and chocolate to filter into England .
The Middle East had coffee houses over a hundred years before they ever appeared in England .
In 1652 Pasqua Rosee , the servant of a merchant trader and an immigrant from Ottoman Smyrna , opened the first coffee house in London , which later became known as “ The Turks Head . ”
“ Rosee ’s coffee - house , in St Michael ’s Alley , Cornhill , was located in the centre of the financial district of the City of London , and his first clientele were merchants of the Levant Company , the trading house that organised and regulated trade with the Ottoman Empire . ”
1
In 1662 , the “ Great Turk Coffee House ” opened , “ Apparently , inside could be found a bust of Sultan Almurath IV himself , ‘ the most detestable tyrant that ever ruled the Ottoman Empire . ’
The customer could not only find coffee , tea and tobacco here , but also chocolate and a range of sherbets , which , according to the Mercurius Publicus ( 12 - 19 March 1662 ) , were ‘ made in Turkie ; made of lemons , roses , and violets perfumed . ' ”
5
Not only did the coffee catch on among the people , but so did some of the Turkish culture .
Some people began to wear turbans in the coffee houses .
Possibly because of the Islamic culture , and for other reasons , coffee houses were viewed as a place for renegades of Christianity .
The new interest in other cultures continued past the fascination of the Middle East all of the way to the Orient .
The Georgian period is marked by an Asian influence in art , literature , and academics .
Coffee houses caught on very quickly , so by 1663 there were more than 83 coffee houses in London .
By the beginning of the eighteenth century there were as many as five or six hundred .
2 The Prussian nobleman Baron Charles Louis von Pollnitz , who visited London in 1728 , described them as one of the great pleasures of the city .
He describes how it is “ a Sort of Rule with the English , to go once a Day at least ” to coffee - houses “ where they talk of Business and News , read the Papers , and often look at one another . ”
2
Some very famous companies even started as coffee houses .
Lloyds of London , an insurance brokerage company , began as Edward Lloyd ’s coffee house on Tower Street around 1688 .
Today when we think of a coffee shop , we think of Starbucks .
However , the coffee shops of the past were drastically different with their Middle Eastern culture .
One thing they have in common is the social aspect , a place for discussion of new ideas , and that is what we ’ll look at next month .
The coffee house , which originated in the Middle East around 1511 , began simply as a place to enjoy an exotic drink , coffee , but soon evolved into a place that helped change the course of history .
Before coffee houses arrived in London , the normal social gathering place was a pub or tavern .
The first attraction to coffee might have been its newness or the exhilaration from the caffeine , but quickly it became another reason to meet , and the coffee house was a place for socializing .
A traveler to London in 1668 remarked , “ Coffee - Houses , which are very numerous in London , are extremely convenient .
You have all manner of news there ; you have a good Fire , which you may sit by as long as you please ; you have a Dish of Coffee ; you meet your Friends for the transaction of Business , and all for a penny , if you do n’t care to spend more . ”
4
Some men spent so much time there that their mail was delivered directly to the coffee house !
An interesting fact is that almost every coffee house allowed only male patrons , women being relegated to the home or elsewhere for coffee .
Not allowing women into these coffee houses did cause a few problems , which were outlined in the “ Women ’s Petition Against Coffee ” published in 1674 .
Really a mock petition , but rumors and claims against coffee drinking could have been taken serious whether or not they were true .
And as stated in the previous quote , they charged only a penny for a cup of black coffee !
This gave rise to their nickname , “ Penny Universities . ”
Women ’s Petition Against Coffee
Soon there emerged a distinct difference between the pub and the coffee house , “ Rumors of the health benefits of coffee were abundant , and coffee - houses encouraged sobriety , rational thought , and articulate political discussion , whereas taverns merely provided a haven for irreverence and intoxication . ”
5
This was n’t a place to escape the world and dull the senses , but rather a place to debate current events and create new ideas for how life should be .
Until this time there did not exist a forum for the merchant or trading class to have such discussions .
The London Stock Exchange began with this atmosphere of bringing buyers and sellers together , setting market prices .
The famous insurance underwriter , Lloyd ’s of London , began in 1688 in a coffee house with Lloyd providing a free information service on shipping , publishing “ Lloyd ’s List . ”
It prospered as a place for marine insurance .
6
And as far as politics are concerned , men met in the coffee house to discuss hot political topics , even stirring up fear in the king .
Some of our founding fathers may have sat in these coffee houses discussing the future of the colonies or how government should be , noting the pitfalls or failures of the monarchies of England and France .
In 1675 King Charles II of England wrote a proclamation to have all of the coffee houses shut down ; however , after a struggle with the owners of the coffee houses and other businessmen the proclamation was overturn .
Almost as quickly as they sprang up , the London coffee houses began to decline .
They …
“ had served their purpose and were no longer needed as meeting places for political or literary criticism and debate .
They had seen the nation pass through one of its greatest periods of trial and tribulation ; had fought and won the battle for individual freedom ; had acted as a steadying influence in an age of profligacy ; and had given us a standard of prose - writing and literary criticism unequalled before or since . ”
7
In the 1500 ’s the worldwide coffee revolution began , and well after the decline of the London coffee house emerged a new generation , the “ Starbuck ’s Revolution . ”

The Espresso Revolution
Just as coffee houses spread all over Europe in the 17th century , they were also opened in America in the late 17th century .
The Merchant ’s Coffee House in Philadelphia , also known as the City Tavern , was the meeting place of some of the finest gentlemen of the time , including Washington , Jefferson , Franklin , Lafayette and John Adams .
The Tontine Coffee House in New York , in similar fashion to Lloyds of London , became the home of the New York Stock Exchange .
Not only were the coffee houses places of intellectual trading , but hubs of business and opportunity .
As coffee became more widely used and known , there arose many new inventions pertaining to the process of brewing coffee .
So many , in fact , that there is a museum in London ( the Bramah Museum of Tea & Coffee www.teaandcoffeemuseum.co.uk) that is filled with these devices .
The original European and American coffee houses served traditional black coffee brewed by steeping the grounds in near boiling water , but in the early 1900 ’s there came about a new method that would revolutionize the coffee industry .
In Italy , Luigi Bezzera filed a patent for a machine that pushed steam and water through a “ group ” that held the coffee grounds in a filter .
Later this patent was purchased by Desiderio Pavoni , and in 1905 the Pavoni company began manufacturing machines based on the Bezzera patent .
In 1927 the first espresso machine was brought to America .
This La Pavoni machine is still on display at the place where it was first installed , Caffe Reggio in New York , with a title of “ Home of the Original Cappuccino . ”
Although this method increased the speed dramatically , from a brewing time of 4 minutes to about 20 seconds , hence the name espresso , the coffee tasted bitter because the steam was too hot .
Through more fine tuning of the idea , from Cremonesi to Rosetta Scorza to Achille Gaggia in 1946 , we have the piston lever espresso machine .
The Gaggia Coffee Bar in Italy was the first location to use these machines and to offer espresso along with the regular coffee .
The modern age of coffee houses was born .
And today , we have super automatic machines that can do everything , grinding the coffee and pouring the completed drink into the glass .
It is these super automatic machines that Starbucks relies on every day .
The espresso machine and the Italian coffee house were two ingredients necessary to the formation of the coffee house giant , Starbucks , but oddly enough , Starbucks did not start out having anything to do with espresso .
Named after Starbuck , the coffee loving first mate in Herman Melville ’s Moby Dick , the company started out as a roaster and retailer of coffee beans , located in Seattle ’s busy Pike Place Market .
Starbucks Coffee , Tea , & Spice sold high quality coffee makers , from Hammarplast , for patrons to use at home , but focused on roasting high quality coffee beans from regions around the world and not on preparing the coffee .
Their mentor was Alfred Peet who had his store , Peet ’s Coffee & Tea , in Berkeley , CA , which was also only a roaster and retailer of fine Arabica beans .
As their customer base grew , Howard Schultz , the VP and US manager for Hammarplast , took notice of their quickly increasing sales numbers and soon paid them a visit .
By this time Starbucks already had four stores in the Seattle area , was profitable every year , and was buying more from Hammarplast than Macy ’s .
Schultz was so impressed by the founder ’s passion and authenticity that he even stated there was something magic about the place , and so he wanted to go to Seattle and work for them .
It took over a year of courting before they finally agreed to let him take over as head of marketing .
A couple of years after he was hired to this position the company sent him to Milan , Italy , to attend a trade show .
While he was walking from his hotel to the convention he discovered something – the Italian coffee house , which actually in Italy is a coffee bar .
There was Italian opera music playing in the background , the smiling barista making the espresso drinks and socializing with the clientele , and surprisingly very few chairs .
He was struck by the large number of coffee bars in this town and how they were all bustling with activity .
He was inspired and brought his passion back to Seattle , where it was met with great distaste and resistance .
Starbucks was a roaster , not a restaurant or bar ; the beverage business would distract them their mission as a coffee retailer .
The answer , “ NO . ”
At the same time the owners were excited about the opportunity that had opened up to purchase Peet ’s Coffee and Tea , which they did .
Now traveling back and forth between the companies , Schultz still pursued the idea of a coffee bar .
After a year , they finally agreed to allow an espresso machine in one location , and that day they served 400 people , well above their 250 customer average .
In two months it grew to 800 people and the lines stretched outside the door .
Even through this success , the original owners did not want to pursue this venture .
Schultz decided the only thing he could do was leave and start his own company , Il Giornale Coffee Company .
It did great and quickly grew to three profitable stores .
Starbucks Original Store Pike Place Market
In April of 1987 the owners of Starbucks decided to sell the business , one owner wanted to cash out and the other was going to focus on Peet ’s Coffee & Tea , and he said that Peet ’s was original and it was better .
Schultz knew that he needed to purchase Starbucks , and after raising enough capital he did , afterwards changing the name of all of his Il Giornale coffee bars into Starbucks .
His vision , dedication , and leadership skills propelled Starbucks into the world class company it has become .

To much of the general public , hydrogen fuel - cell vehicles remain a novelty from a distant future .
And hydrogen advocates have n’t done a very good job in demonstrating fuel - cell vehicles to those outside of Los Angeles or Sacramento .
It might pique the interest of more than a few gearheads to see how quickly fuel - cell vehicles can be refueled and what respectable long - distance capabilities they have compared to EVs .
But with hydrogen stations clustered in the Los Angeles region , longer drives have been difficult to implement .
This year , fuel - cell advocates , eight automakers , and their vehicles have taken to the road , with the Hydrogen Road Tour , which TheCarConnection.com caught up to in Portland .
Going from Chula Vista , California , to Vancouver , British Columbia , the tour has plenty of hands - on stops along the way , and the general public is invited to most events .
Making it all possible is a mobile refueling truck provided by PowerTech Labs , a company out of Surrey , BC .
Many fuel - cell critics say that , cost of the vehicles aside , hydrogen is what big oil wants as it will keep us relying on their established infrastructure .
Yet oil companies as well as individual stations have been reluctant to invest in hydrogen facilities because the cars simply are n’t out there in numbers yet .
That ’s begun to change — with about 300 fuel - cell vehicles out in service ( they ’ve traveled , altogether , more than 2.5 million miles on California roads ) — but not as quickly as expected .
Earlier this decade California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger envisioned , by 2010 , a California with 150 or more hydrogen stations in the state , including a hundred stations along the stretch of Interstate 5 .
Of course by then it was anticipated that thousands of hydrogen cars would have been delivered .
To date , and GM is leasing and testing 100 fuel - cell Chevrolet Equinox SUVs and Honda has delivered seven of its FCX Clarity sedans .
The real cost of these vehicles is tremendous , but the National Hydrogen Association ( NHA ) , an advocate , points out that projected vehicle costs have been reduced by 75 percent .
In revised projections , there will be 700 fuel - cell vehicles in California by 2011 and 4,300 vehicles by 2014 , with a 50,000 target for 2017 .
And by far , Southern California has the largest number of hydrogen - fueled vehicles , and there ’s an effort to create hydrogen communities in Santa Monica , Irvine , Torrance , and Newport Beach .
California will stay on course toward a future of hydrogen fuel - cell vehicles , according to remarks last week from California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
Schwarzenegger ’s speech seemed a response of sorts to the federal government ’s decision just three weeks earlier to make massive cuts to federal funding for fuel - cell projects , with Department of Energy Secretary Steven Chu explaining that hydrogen vehicles are still 10 to 20 years from viability , with a comprehensive infrastructure or hydrogen economy even more distant .
Although we ca n’t say that Schwarzenegger was aiming to criticize the federal budget decision , he did take issue with the federal government ’s record of abandoning renewable energy and alt - fuel vehicles when the price of oil goes down .
California has invested $ 24 million in hydrogen and fuel cells since he took over the state ’s top office ; that ’s been matched with about $ 300 million per year from the auto industry , with automakers investing up to a billion dollars each to develop their respective vehicles .
And that ’s all small change compared to the state of California ’s $ 24 billion ( yes , with a ‘ B ’ ) budget deficit .
“ We , of course , not only celebrate hydrogen - fueled vehicles , we also celebrate electric cars , battery cars , biofuel cars and all of this , said Schwarzenegger .
“ We do n’t want to choose the winners ; I think the market will decide that . ”
Shell Hydrogen Station in Reykjavik Iceland
The so - called Hydrogen Highway — a plan to implement hydrogen infrastructure — has been one of Schwarzenegger ’s pet projects since taking office in 2003 .
California now has more than a third of the hydrogen refueling stations in the U.S. , with 26 in the state and 62 total in the U.S. , with seven more new public - access stations coming online in California by the end of the year .
The plan , with Shell , is to build a chain of hydrogen fueling stations from California up to Vancouver , in time for the Olympics , and then to continue to Alaska .
From here on , the emphasis is on public - access stations , and primarily stations that are open 24 hours a day .
Tours like this , showing fuel - cell cars as practical vehicles that can travel long distances and refuel quickly , go a long way toward swaying public opinion and getting people interested in the cars — so that the infrastructure might quickly follow .
What do you think ?
Is there still a hydrogen future in our lifetime ?

It is probably every developer ’s dream to create a programming language .
It is a complex and difficult task , so it will remain just an unfulfilled dream for many .
But there is a chance to create something simpler – a domain specific language ( DSL ) .
A language , that covers a specific ( and limited ) domain .
Ruby helps here a lot – to create a DSL is really simple and easy .
A domain specific language provides a comfortable way how to express and perform operations in a specific domain such as spreadsheet functions , financial operations , transformations , AI .
Another advantage is that a DSL program could be defined externally , e.g. by a user , so your solution could easily reflect changes in a domain logic .
A financial example :
transfer_between_accounts(100 , 123456789 , 987654321 ) # transfer $ 100 close_if_empty ( 123456789 ) # close the account if empty
A semaphore example :
light :red wait 30 light : red , : orange wait 5 light : green wait 30 light : orange wait 5
DSLs ( implemented in Ruby ) are based on Ruby so it is possible to use Ruby language structures such as loops or conditions .
Let ’s create a real DSL – a tape domain specific language .
I. Tape
A tape is an unlimited space divided into cells .
A head is a device that is capable to move left or right on the tape and can read and write symbols from / to a cell on the tape .
This tape is a ( very ) simplified tape of a Turing machine .
II . Basic Tape DSL
We would like to achieve this result on the tape : 3,1,2
There are many ways how to achieve this , here is one of them :
write 1 right write 2 left left write 3
III .
Common Code for Various DSLs
So , how to create a Ruby program that will understand a DSL ?
The main magic is done with a method that executes a Ruby code .
The method is located in the Object class and its name is instance_eval , for more details see its Ruby doc .
Create a class , a good name could be Tape .
Add a method to this class that calls the instance_eval method .
I named it as load .
It loads a file and executes its content : def self.load ( filename ) new.instance_eval ( File.read( filename ) , filename ) end
And the last thing is to call the load method .
Place this line on the very end of the file , out of the body of the Tape class .
It constructs a new instance of the Tape class , takes the first parameter from the command line as a tape program file name that is passed to the load method .
Tape.load( ARGV.shift )
This is a common part that could be reused for any DSLs .
( Just rename Tape to your favourite DSL name . :)

Tape State
We defined a tape as something with a state : tape content and head position .
A tape content will be stored in the array @tape and a head position in the variable @pos as an integer .
It would be nice to initialise these variables ; add the class constructor :
def initialize @pos = 0 @tape = [ ] end
V. Tape DSL Commands
Almost done :) , just the DSL commands are missing .
They will be implemented as normal Ruby methods .
The command right is defined as a Ruby method in the Tape class .
The right command increments the head position and , if necessary , extends ( adds a cell at the end of ) the tape .
def right @tape .
push nil if @tape.size == @pos @pos += 1 end
Similarly , the left command , is defined as a method .
It decrements the head position and , if necessary , extends ( adds a cell at the beginning of ) the tape .
def left if @pos == 0 @tape.unshift nil else @pos -= 1 end end
To read a content of the tape or write there a value is even simpler :
def write ( val ) @tape[@pos ] = val end def read @tape[ @pos ]
end
The last command that is missing is to display the state of a tape – the dump method .
It shows cells of a tape separated by the comma and the head position is highlighted with two vertical bar characters ( or pipes if you like ) .
def dump t = @tape.map { |c| " #{c} " } t[@pos ] = " |#{@tape[@pos ] }| " puts " [ #{t.join ( ' , ' ) } ] "
end
We created five commands : left , right , read , write and dump .
( download the tape.rb file )
VI . Run a Tape Program
To see steps of the 123 tape program , add the dump command after each write command :
write 1 dump right write 2 dump left left write 3 dump
( download the 123.tape file )
To run the 123 tape program ( stored in the 123.tape file ) type this on the command line :
ruby tape.rb 123.tape
The result should be :
[ |1 | ] [ 1 , |2 | ] [ |3| , 1 , 2 ]
Try to change the program and see / check the result of your changes with the dump command .
VII .
Combination with Ruby
As mentioned before , a DSL implemented in this way is a Ruby code , that is , you may use Ruby language structures .
The repeat example , writes numbers from 1 to 5 to the tape ( download the repeat. tape file ) :
( 1..5 ) . each do |i| write i right dump end
The result will be ( command line : ruby tape.rb repeat. tape ) :
[ 1 , || ] [ 1 , 2 , || ] [ 1 , 2 , 3 , || ] [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , || ] [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , | | ]
Another more complicated example that is using some Turing machine related techniques : the invert program writes 0 , 1 , 0 on the tape and then inverts the content .
Beginning and end of the content is defined by the special characters B and E . ( download the invert.tape file )
# prepare tape write ' B ' right write 1 right write 0 right write 1 right write ' E ' dump # return to the beginning while read !=
' B ' do left end dump # invert right while read != ' E ' do if read == 0 write 1 else write 0 end right end dump
The output is ( command line : ruby tape.rb invert.tape ) :
[ B , 1 , 0 , 1 , |E| ] [ | B| , 1 , 0 , 1 , E ] [ B , 0 , 1 , 0 , |E | ]
You could try to change the program to invert the content in just two steps – generating the content and inverting the content while returning to the beginning .
VIII .
Hide Obvious Dependencies or Too Much Ruby in DSL
From the definition of our tape DSL , the only relevant information for conditions and loops is a tape cell content , where the head is pointing to .
Let ’s define another two tape DSL commands that hide this necessary dependency ( so it not necessary to specify it ) .
The check command is replacing the while read != part :
while read != ' B ' do left end
to
check ' B ' do left end
if read ==
if read == 0 write 1 else write 0 end
condition command is replacing thepart :
to
condition 0 , lambda {write 1} , lambda {write 0}
lambda {code} is one of the ways how to define a block of code ( i.e. a method body ) in Ruby .
The commands implementation is slightly more complicated .
The check command also examines the provided block of code , if it requires one parameter ( check ' x ' do |c| ) or none ( check ' x ' do ) .
def check ( val , & block ) return unless block_given ?
while read != val do if block .arity == 1 yield read else yield end end end def condition ( val , positive , negative ) if read == val positive .
call else negative .
call end end
Additionally , a tiny command comment is added - to show usage of the check command with one parameter required in the provided block of code .
def comment ( text ) puts text end
( download the tape.rb file )
The modified invert tape program ( download the invert2.tape file ) :
# prepare tape write ' B ' right write 1 right write 0 right write 1 right write ' E ' dump # return to the beginning check ' B ' do left end dump # invert right check ' E ' do |h| comment " Inverting # {h} " condition 0 , lambda {write 1} , lambda {write 0} right end dump
The result is ( command line : ruby tape.rb invert2.tape ) ( download : tape.rb and invert2.tape files ) :
[ B , 1 , 0 , 1 , |E| ] [ | B| , 1 , 0 , 1 , E ] Inverting 1 Inverting 0 Inverting 1 [ B , 0 , 1 , 0 , |E | ]
IX . Further Extending
So far all commands were statically added to the class representing ( and implementing ) a DSL .
There is a way how to catch and process requests for a non-existing method : the method_missing method of the Kernel module ( see the Ruby doc ) .
It allows to solve situations such as assignments to variables ( of course , with names defined by a user ) , to access user 's dynamic data ( parsers , mappings ) or to wrap a dynamic functionality ( web services ) ...
In the tape DSL it is only used to show an error message to a user if he / she specifies a non-existing method name .
def method_missing ( sym , * args , & block ) puts " # unknow #{sym} with args #{args} #{block_given ? ? '' : ' and code '} " end
The End

Translated Wednesday 24 June 2009 , by
Yet another bloody clash at the Israel - Gaza border , on June 8 2009 , reminds us just how explosive the situation remains .
Four dead and twelve injured on the Palestinian side , with no losses for the Israelis .
In the Gaza Strip , only thirty to forty products from a list of four thousand previously authorised by Israel ( before the blockade imposed in June 2007 ) are tolerated today , and 1.5 million people are trapped inside Gaza ’s borders , exposed to total arbitrariness .
Israel has maintained its blockade on Gaza for the past two years .
Books , records , clothing , fabric , shoes , needles , electric bulbs , candles , matches , musical instruments , sheets , blankets , mattresses , cups , glasses …are all forbidden and have to be transported via fragile tunnels from Egypt which are the targets of repeated bombings .
In 2008 , more than fifty people died in tunnels collapsing .
None of the materials needed to rebuild them ( cement , doors , glass , windows , etc. ) are authorised either , following the devastating attacks of December 2008 - January 2009 .
Tea , coffee and semolina remain banned items ( see Amira Hass ’ study : “ Israel bans books , music and clothes from entering Gaza ” , Haaretz , May 17 2009 ) .
Sixty Nobel Laureates , of whom 10 received the Nobel Peace Prize , two hundred European Parliament Members ( 2004 - 2009 ) and other important people are working with the NGO Peace Lines as part of their Open the doors !
campaign for a permanent end to the Gaza blockade and the release of prisoners on humanitarian and legal grounds .
We ask all political leaders and members of the new European Parliament to do everything they can to ensure these releases – including that of Corporal Gilad Shalit and the former Education Minister Al Shaer , re-arrested on March 19 in conditions which violate international law .
Europe and the Union for the Mediterranean cannot continue to allow such deprivation and suffocation to take place on their doorstep .
Appeal : [ 1 ]
“ Open the doors !
Israel must end its blockade on Gaza , stop the killing and allow Gaza to open up to the world so as to guarantee the possibility of a viable economy .
Palestinians must cease all rocket attacks on Israel and the Israeli people .
Human beings are not bargaining chips .
Consequently :
The Palestinians must free Corporal Gilad Shalit , whom they have held prisoner for almost three years .
The Israelis , who hold more ten thousand people in their prisons , must free a significant number of female , elderly and infirm prisoners who have served long sentences , as well as prisoners held under administrative detention , including all the elected members of the Palestinian legislature . ”

A US drone aircraft killed at least 45 Pakistani Taliban militants in south Waziristan yesterday when it fired missiles at the funeral of an insurgent commander killed earlier in the day , Pakistani intelligence officials said .
" Three missiles were fired by drones as people were dispersing after offering funeral prayers for Niaz Wali , " one intelligence official said , referring to a Taliban commander who was one of six militants killed in an earlier drone attack .
The army had no information on the attack on the funeral in the remote area under the control of Baitullah Mehsud , the country 's enemy number one , a military official said .
One local security official , who could not be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media , said that more than 60 had died of whom " half are civilians " .
Funerals of Taliban are attended by local villagers , not just militants .
Waziristan , which borders Afghanistan , is part of Pakistan 's lawless tribal area , where US forces have mounted about 60 drone attacks against suspected militants since early last year .
But bombing a funeral is unusual and may be unprecedented .
Local media reports said a local commander named Sangeen , originally from Afghanistan , was among the dead .
Mehsud , an al - Qaida ally accused of plotting the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007 , had been in the area but was not hurt , a Taliban official said .
The US has offered a reward of $ 5 m for information leading to Mehsud 's location or arrest .
The attacks came as Pakistan 's efforts to tame the burgeoning Taliban movement in the west of the country suffered a blow when a rival of Mehsud was shot dead , apparently by one of his own guards .
Qari Zainuddin , who had repeatedly criticised the Pakistani Taliban 's chief for targeting civilians , was shot in his office in the town of Dera Ismail Khan .
Baz Mohammad , one of Zainuddin 's aides who was wounded in the attack , said a guard barged into a room at the leader 's compound after morning prayers and opened fire .
Mohammad accused Mehsud of being behind the attack and vowed to avenge the death .
" It was definitely Baitullah 's man who infiltrated our ranks , and he has done his job , " Mohammad told AP .
The guard , who is thought to have insinuated himself into Zainuddin 's circle about four months ago , fled in a waiting car after the attack .
Mehsud , described as the mastermind behind much of the terrorist activity in Pakistan , has yet to comment on the killing .
Zainuddin was estimated to have about 3,000 armed followers in Dera Ismail Khan and nearby Tank .
Earlier this month , he denounced Mehsud for the killing of civilians in recent attacks , which were apparently launched in retaliation for the army offensive in the Swat valley .
The country 's armed forces are driving militants from the valley and have been pounding Mehsud 's strongholds in the South Waziristan tribal region , near Afghanistan , in apparent preparation for a big offensive against the warlord .
While some saw the killing as a sign of a schism within the Pakistani Taliban , other analysts argued that Zainuddin 's death removes from the scene an important threat to Mehsud .
Some believe Mehsud feared Zainuddin more than the Pakistan army because he was an opponent from within , with intimate knowledge of his methods and personnel .
Zainuddin could have rallied the Mehsud tribe , perhaps the only way of eliminating Baitullah Mehsud and his network .
For the first time since Mehsud became leader of the main group of the Pakistani Taliban four years ago , Zainuddin 's bold stance had given others in the Mehsud clan the courage to speak up against his vicious reign , which broke all tribal traditions .
A tribal leader from South Waziristan , too scared to be named , said : " The message from Baitullah Mehsud is that who -ever wants to come openly against me will meet the same fate . "
Zainuddin , 30 , was protected by two dozen armed guards at his compound , but the security was not as strong as might be expected for someone who had taken on so violent an enemy .
The danger was obvious .
Mehsud had demonstrated his ruthlessness by killing hundreds of the Mehsud tribe 's traditional elders - who might have led resistance - as he came to power .
WASHINGTON , June 3 ( UPI ) --
A confidential list of U.S. civilian nuclear sites was inadvertently posted online for about a day before the information was removed , officials said .
The draft declaration of U.S. nuclear facilities for the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency contained descriptions of civilian sites , including storage locations for enriched uranium and other materials used in nuclear weapons , The Washington Post reported Wednesday .

Posted Monday , the document was available on a Government Printing Office Web site before media inquiries prompted its removal Tuesday .
The draft document was intended to be a formal declaration to the International Atomic Energy Agency , fulfilling part of U.S. obligations under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , the Post said .
The Obama administration submitted the document last month to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs for technical review .
Nuclear experts told the Post the listings possibly could benefit terrorists considering an attack on one of the facilities .
However , the experts said the information was unclassified and most of it is publicly available through other sources .
The information is considered confidential but not classified , The New York Times said .
" It is probably not that dangerous , but it is a violation of the law , " said David Albright , a former U.N. nuclear inspector and president the Institute for Science and International Security .
" You do n't want this information out there , any more than you would want a thief to know the location of a vault in your house . "
Gary Somerset , a spokesman for the printing office , told the Times the office " produced " the document " under normal operating procedures " but removed it from its
Web site pending review .
Chelsea expect Ricardo Carvalho and Deco to join Internazionale this week , with the London club prepared to sanction the departures of the Portugal internationals for less than half the £ 27.95 m that was spent on recruiting them .
Talks are ­ongoing between the two clubs but a deal is believed to be close , with Chelsea willing sellers and Carvalho and Deco keen to be reunited with Jose Mourinho , the Inter manager whom they have played under before .
Carvalho yesterday confirmed his desire to work again with Mourinho as he criticised Chelsea , claiming they could have done more for him last season while he was injured .
" The club should have supported me more , which did not happen , " the defender said .
" When a player plays , everything is beautiful but , when things do not run so well , there is no support .
I believe my time at Chelsea has come to an end .
I am happy such a big club as Inter is interested in me .
It would be good to return to working with Jose Mourinho . "
The injuries and loss of form suffered by Carvalho and Deco last season prompted concerns within Stamford Bridge that age – they are both 31 – is starting to catch up with them and that their best football could be in the past .
Carvalho has been an influential presence at Stamford Bridge for four of his five years at the club but Deco , who joined last summer from Barcelona in an £ 8 m deal , faded badly after a bright beginning and managed only 22 starts in all competitions .
Chelsea hope the exits of Carvalho and Deco will be followed by the return of Glen Johnson , with the England international set to make a decision early next week as to where he will be playing his football next season .
Portsmouth are resigned to losing the right - back and it is understood that Johnson , despite interest from Manchester City , has narrowed his options to a straight choice between Chelsea , whom he first joined from West Ham United in 2003 , and Liverpool .
Liverpool were reported last night to have had a bid accepted for Johnson of a similar size to the £ 18 m Chelsea are believed to have offered Portsmouth .
They are unlikely to match the personal terms the 24 - year - old can expect at Stamford Bridge but Rafael Benítez , the manager , remains hopeful he can ­convince Johnson to move to Anfield .
There is certainly little chance of him joining Manchester City , with Champions League football known to be a key motivation and Johnson underwhelmed by the prospect of moving to a club in a transitional phase .
City have a far more realistic chance of signing Carlos Tevez when the striker 's loan at Manchester United expires at the end of this month , although Chelsea are set to make a late attempt to persuade him to move to Stamford Bridge .
Their manager , Carlo Ancelotti , is understood to have called the Argentinian to emphasise his regard for him .
In the meantime Inter hope to complete the transfers of Carvalho and Deco , who were both part of the successful Porto side that won the 2004 Champions League under Mourinho .
" Mourinho has asked us for Deco and Carvalho and we are working towards making him happy , " said Massimo Moratti , Inter 's president .
" Our wish is to sign both players and I have seen that the players ' intention is to join us .
We still have n't reached an agreement with Chelsea but I think we will do in a short time . "
While few Chelsea supporters will shed a tear at the sight of Deco moving on , Carvalho was a key figure during the club 's renaissance under Mourinho and for a period was seen as a more steadying influence in defence than John Terry .
Yet he managed only 11 Premier League starts last season and struggled to displace the Brazilian Alex as Terry 's first - choice ­partner in central defence after recovering from injury .
Mourinho believes Carvalho 's experience will be a key asset to Inter , particularly in European fixtures , while Deco has been identified as the ideal mentor for Philippe Coutinho , an exciting 17 - year - old attacking midfielder who has agreed to join the Serie A club from Vasco da Gama and who plays in a similar position to the former Barcelona playmaker .
" We are interested in Carvalho primarily for the Champions League , " added Moratti .
" He has the right experience , he is calm under pressure and brings ­experience in the defensive line .
Deco will have two tasks : to do well immediately and to help Coutinho mature as a player .
Coutinho will arrive next season and plays in the same role as Deco . "
Were the ELVs more exciting ?
The stats .
When SANZAR introduced a number of Experimental Law Variations for the 2008 season , supporters were led to believe they would make rugby faster and more exciting to watch .
“ We ’re introducing the new laws to Super 14 to super - charge Super rugby , ” ARU deputy CEO Matt Carroll gushed at the time .
“ The SANZAR nations have always been at the forefront of the game and yet again SANZAR is to lead the world . ”
Among the changes implemented was that backlines had to stand five metres back from the scrum and that quick throw - ins to lineouts were allowed to go backwards .
All offences except offside and foul play were to be punished by a free kick rather than a penalty .
The main aim of the changes was to keep the ball in play longer with fewer stoppages and more running rugby , thereby creating a faster and more exciting style of play .
After two seasons of the anticipated adrenalin - charged rugby , has the promise been fulfilled ?
It would be reasonable to expect that fast , exciting games would result in higher points scored and a greater number of tries .
Let ’s look at the evidence from the last ten seasons of Super rugby .
Firstly we have average points scored and average number of tries ( in brackets ) for teams which finished in the Top Four :
2000 31.9 ( 3.5 )
2001 28.5 ( 2.9 )
2002 34.3 ( 4.0 )
2003 32.6 ( 4.2 )
2004 29.8 ( 3.6 )
2005 31.0 ( 3.8 )
2006 28.0 ( 3.2 )
2007 28.5 ( 3.3 )
2008 23.2 ( 3.0 )
2009 24.8 ( 3.0 )
Looking at average points scored , we have the apparently perverse result that the application of the ELVs has resulted in significantly lower scorelines for the top teams .
The data on average number of tries is even more instructive .
The high - water mark was reached in 2003 with an average of 4.2 tries being scored per team , after which it declined appreciably .
2006 is generally recognised as the year when defensive patterns became dominant .
But there has been a further decline in the two ELV seasons .
The top teams are scoring fewer tries under the experimental laws .
The situation is quite different for the Bottom Four teams :
2000 22.6 ( 2.2 )
2001 24.6 ( 2.5 )
2002 20.8 ( 2.3 )
2003 23.7 ( 2.6 )
2004 24.7 ( 3.0 )
2005 18.9 ( 2.2 )
2006 18.2 ( 1.9 )
2007 17.4 ( 1.6 )
2008 18.8 ( 2.3 )
2009 19.6 ( 2.5 )
Since 2004 there has been a definite decline in both points and tries scored , but the introduction of the ELVs has apparently yielded an increased ability for lesser teams to score tries .
A possible reason for this could be the experimental rules taking a lot of structure out of the game ; thereby introducing a greater element of chance .
But for many aficionados the great attraction of rugby is its complexity relative to other codes and the expectation that teams that master its structural requirements are rewarded .
Let ’s look at the percentage of their games in which both the Top Four and Bottom Four teams earned a four try bonus ( Top Four first ) :
2000 45.5 15.9
2001 36.4 27.3
2002 52.3 15.9
2003 61.4 29.5
2004 45.5 36.4
2005 45.5 15.9
2006 40.4 11.5
2007 40.4 7.7
2008 36.5 11.5
2009 34.6 26.9
Again it appears that Top Four teams have a lower propensity to earn a try - scoring bonus under the experimental laws .
Although the pattern is less clear , it would seem that Bottom Four teams may be benefiting from the ELVs in terms of earning these bonuses .
A tentative conclusion is that rather than leading to more exciting rugby as measured by number of points and tries scored , the experimental laws have reduced the scoring margins between good and bad teams .
For those who prefer to watch close games this could be seen as increasing excitement .
For the rest of us this is not necessarily a desirable outcome .

* 25 percent of households have trouble paying
* 40 percent expect to delay care this summer
* Baby boomers hardest hit
WASHINGTON , June 22 ( Reuters ) - Americans are struggling to pay for healthcare in the ongoing economic recession , with a quarter saying they have had trouble in the past 12 months , according to a survey released on Monday .
Baby boomers -- the generation born between 1946 and 1964 -- had the most trouble and were the most likely to put off medical treatments or services , said researchers at Center for Healthcare Improvement , part of the Healthcare business of Thomson Reuters TRI.N .
The study , availablehere , found that 17.4 percent of households reported postponing or delaying healthcare over the past year .
The U.S. Congress is working on a way to cover more of the 46 million people who lack health insurance , lower costs and coordinate care better .
President Barack Obama has made it one of his administration ’s top priorities .
Americans pay more per capita for healthcare than people in any other country , yet have high rates of infant mortality , diabetes , untreated heart disease and other conditions .
Americans are often dissatisfied with their access to care .
Thomson Reuters -- the parent company of Reuters news agency -- used its annual Pulse survey that queries 100,000 households to get information about health behavior .
Gary Pickens , George Popa and colleagues at the Michigan - based center interviewed more than 6,000 people in March and April about job losses , what healthcare they had used and their plans for future treatment .
UNEMPLOYMENT FACTOR
“ April numbers showed a significant increase in the percentage of households in which a member had lost a job in the last three months ( 13.5 percent ) , ” the researchers wrote .
In March , 11 percent said they had lost jobs .
“ The percentage of households that had difficulty in paying for care in the last year was statistically unchanged between March and April ( about 25 percent ) . ”
They found 40 percent of all households planned to postpone care in the coming three months , with about 15 percent planning to put off routine doctor visits .
People born before 1946 were the least likely to delay care , probably because most can take part in Medicare , the federal health insurance plan for the elderly , the researchers found .
Baby Boomers were four times more likely than seniors to have trouble paying for healthcare , according to the report .
People born after 1984 were also unlikely to put off care , probably because they are too young to need much medical attention , the researchers said .
Income was also a big factor -- homes where people made less than $ 50,000 a year were three times as likely to say they had trouble paying for medical bills as homes with combined incomes of $ 100,000 or more .
“ It is important for healthcare providers , employers and policymakers to consider how the economy and healthcare policies affect demographic segments differently , ” Pickens said in a statement .
CIA Continues To Suppress Information From Detainee Tribunals With Heavy Redactions
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK –
The CIA today released still - highly redacted documents in which Guantánamo Bay prisoners describe abuse and torture they suffered in CIA custody .
The documents were released as part of an American Civil Liberties Union Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) lawsuit seeking uncensored transcripts from Combatant Status Review Tribunals ( CSRTs ) that determine if prisoners held by the Defense Department at Guantánamo qualify as " enemy combatants . "
In previously released versions of the documents , the CIA had removed virtually all references to the abuse of prisoners in their custody ; the documents released today are still heavily blacked out but include some new information .
" The documents released today provide further evidence of brutal torture and abuse in the CIA 's interrogation program and demonstrate beyond doubt that this information has been suppressed solely to avoid embarrassment and growing demands for accountability , " said Ben Wizner , a staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project and lead attorney on the FOIA lawsuit .
" There is no legitimate basis for the Obama administration 's continued refusal to disclose allegations of detainee abuse , and we will return to court to seek the full release of these documents . "
The newly unredacted information includes statements from the CSRTs of former CIA detainees , including Khalid Sheikh Muhammad , Abd Al Rahim Hussein Mohammed Al Nashiri , Abu Zubaydah and Majid Khan , including descriptions of torture and coercion .
These statements include :
• Abu Zubaydah : " After months of suffering and torture , physically and mentally , they did not care about my injuries that they inflicted to my eye , to my stomach , to my bladder , and my left thigh and my reproductive organs .
They did n't care that I almost died from these injuries .
Doctors told me that I nearly died four times . "
" They say ' this in your diary . '
They say ' see you want to make operation against America . '
I say no , the idea is different .
They say no , torturing , torturing .
I say 'okay , I do .
I was decide to make operation . ' " • Al Nashiri : " [ And , they used to ] drown me in water . " • Muhammad : " This is what I understand he [ CIA interrogator ] told me : you are not American and you are not on American soil .
So you cannot ask about the Constitution . " • Khan :
" In the end , any classified information you have is through …agencies who physically and mentally tortured me . "
" The information released today sheds some new light on the CIA 's torture program , but there are still unanswered questions , " said Jameel Jaffer , Director of the ACLU National Security Project .
" The Obama administration should make good on its commitment to transparency , stop suppressing information about torture and abuse and hold accountable the officials who put unlawful policies in place . "
Attorneys in this case are Wizner and Jaffer of the ACLU National Security Project , Judy Rabinovitz and Amrit Singh of the ACLU Immigrants ' Rights Project , and Arthur B. Spitzer of the ACLU of the National Capital Area .

Jupiter ’s moon Europa has an icy crust made up of blocks , which are thought to have broken apart and ‘ rafted ’ into new positions ( Image : NASA / JPL / University of Arizona )
A tiny bacterium has been coaxed back to life after spending 120,000 years buried three kilometres deep in the Greenland ice sheet .
Researchers who found it say it could resemble microbes that may have evolved in ice on other planets .
Officially named Herminiimonas glaciei , the bug consists of rods just 0.9 micrometres long and 0.4 micrometres in diameter , about 10 to 50 times smaller than the well - known bacterium , Escherichia coli .

“ What ’s unique is that it ’s so small , and seems to survive on so few nutrients , ” says Jennifer Loveland - Curtze of Pennsylvania State University , whose team has described the new species .
She speculates that thanks to its tiny dimensions , it can survive in minute veins in the ice , scavenging sparse nutrients that were buried along with the ice .
It also has extensive tail - like flagella to help it manoeuvre through the veins to find food .
“ Along with the snow , you get dust , bacterial cells , fungal spores , plant spores , minerals and other organic debris , ” says Loveland - Curtze .
“ So we postulate that it lives in these microniches in the ice . ”
Coaxed back to life
Researchers in the team coaxed it back to life by keeping it at 2 °C for 7 months , then at 5 °C for a further four - and - a - half months , after which they saw colonies of very small purplish - brown bacteria .
Loveland - Curtze speculates that similar microbes may have evolved in the ice on other planets and moons , such as the ice at the poles of Mars and the ice - covered ocean on Europa , one of Jupiter ’s moons .
“ All we can say is that because ice is the best medium to preserve nucleic acids , other organic compounds and cells , the potential for finding them in these environments is quite high because of the cold , ” says Loveland - Curtze .
“ It gives us hope that if something is there , we can locate it . ”
The oldest known ice on Earth yielded a bacterium that grew after 8 million years .
Journal reference : International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology ( DOI : 10.1099/ijs.0.001685-0 ) .
Researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara have published a paper ( PDF ) detailing their findings after hijacking a botnet for ten days earlier this year .
Among other things , the researchers were able to collect 70 GB of data that the bots stole from users , including 56,000 passwords gathered within a single hour .
The information not only gave them a look at the inner workings of the botnet , they also got to see how secure users really are when it comes to online activities .
( Hint : they are n't . )
The botnet in question is controlled by Torpig ( also known as Sinowal ) , a malware program that aims to gather personal and financial information from Windows users .
The researchers gained control of the Torpig botnet by exploiting a weakness in the way the bots try to locate their commands and control servers — the bots would generate a list of domains that they planned to contact next , but not all of those domains were registered yet .
The researchers then registered the domains that the bots would resolve , and then set up servers where the bots could connect to find their commands .
This method lasted for a full ten days before the botnet 's controllers updated the system and cut the observation short .
During that time , however , UCSB 's researchers were able to gather massive amounts of information on how the botnet functions as well as what kind of information it 's gathering .
Almost 300,000 unique login credentials were gathered over the time the researchers controlled the botnet , including 56,000 passwords gathered in a single hour using " simple replacement rules " and a password cracker .
They found that 28 percent of victims reused their credentials for accessing 368,501 websites , making it an easy task for scammers to gather further personal information .
The researchers noted that they were able to read through hundreds of e-mail , forum , and chat messages gathered by Torpig that " often contain detailed ( and private ) descriptions of the lives of their authors . "
( Comically , the report notes that 0.1 percent of Torpig victims love " exchanging insults " online , with another four percent spending their time looking for sex online .
The rest are doing relatively mundane things like worrying about grades , looking for advice from doctors and lawyers , looking for jobs , and playing video games . )
Of course , the primary goal of Torpig is to steal financial information like credit card numbers and bank logins .
In just ten days , Torpig apparently obtained credentials of 8,310 accounts at 410 financial institutions , including PayPal , Capital One , E*Trade , and Chase .
The researchers noted , too , that nearly 40 percent of the credentials stolen by Torpig were from browser password managers , and not actual login sessions , and that the Torpig controllers may have exploited these credentials for between $ 83,000 and $ 8.3 million during that time period .
Interestingly , a large number of the financial institutions that had been breached required " monumental effort " in order to notify the victims , according to the report .
In fact , financial institutions were n't the only ones — interacting with registrars , hosting facilities , and law enforcement were all " rather complicated , " indicating that there 's a long way to go in order to make notifying botnet victims easier .
Not becoming a victim in the first place is the most ideal situation , however .
The researchers concluded that victims of botnets are usually those with poorly maintained machines and who choose " easily guessable " passwords . "
This is evidence that the malware problem is fundamentally a cultural problem , " reads the report .
" Even though people are educated and understand well concepts such as the physical security and the necessary maintenance of a car , they do not understand the consequences of irresponsible behavior when using a computer . "

Home food production is an ' entry - level ' survival tactic , says Scott McKeown .
Three years ago , David Fridley purchased two and a half acres of land in rural Sonoma County .
He planted drought - resistant blue Zuni corn , fruit trees and basic vegetables while leaving a full acre of extant forest for firewood collection .
Today , Fridley and several friends and family subsist almost entirely off this small plot of land , with the surplus going to public charity .
But Fridley is hardly a homegrown hippie who spends his leisure time gardening .
He spent 12 years consulting for the oil industry in Asia .
He is now a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a fellow of the Post Carbon Institute in Sebastopol , where members discuss the problems inherent to fossil - fuel dependency .
Fridley has his doubts about renewable energies , and he has grave doubts about the future of crude oil .
In fact , he believes to a certainty that society is literally running out of gas and that , perhaps within years , the trucks will stop rolling into Safeway and the only reliable food available will be that grown in our backyards .
Fridley , like a few other thinkers , activists and pessimists , could talk all night about " peak oil . "
This catch phrase describes a scenario , perhaps already unfurling , in which the easy days of oil - based society are over , a scenario in which global oil production has peaked and in which every barrel of crude oil drawn from the earth from that point forth is more difficult to extract than the barrel before it .
According to peak oil theory , the time is approaching when the effort and cost of extraction will no longer be worth the oil itself , leaving us without the fuel to power our transportation , factories , farms , society and the very essence of our oil - dependent lives .
Fridley believes the change will be very unpleasant for many people .
" If you are a typical American and have expectations of increasing income , cheap food , nondiscretionary spending , leisure time and vacations in Hawaii , then the change we expect soon could be what you would consider ' doom , ' " he says soberly , " because your life is going to fall apart . "
The Great Reskilling
But is it the end of the world ?
Fridley and other supporters of the Transition movement do n't believe it is .
First sparked in 2007 in Totnes , England , Transition was launched when one Rob Hopkins recognized that modern Western society cannot continue at its current pace of life as fast access to oil begins to dwindle .
Global warming and economic meltdown are the two other principle drivers of the Transition movement , but in an ideal " Transition Town , " society would be ready for such changes .
With limited gas - powered transport or oil - based products , a Transition community 's citizens would live within cycling distance of one another in a township built upon complete self - sufficiency , with extremely localized infrastructure for agriculture , clothes making , metal working and the other basics of life which the Western world largely abandoned to factories in the late 1800s , when oil power turned life into a relatively leisurely vacation from reality .
Now , Transitionists say , it 's time to get back to work — and quick .
Localized efforts have sprouted from the ground up in Santa Cruz , Cotati , Sebastopol , San Francisco and many other towns worldwide , where residents and neighbors are putting their heads together and collaborating on ways to relocalize themselves , bolster self - sufficiency and build the resilience that communities will need to absorb the shock of peak oil .
Scott McKeown is among several initiators of Transition Sebastopol .
A 53 - year - old event coordinator by vocation , McKeown believes that as early as 2012 the global economy could founder .
" That 's when it 's really going to hit the fan , " he says .
" We 're not there yet , but we will be very soon . "
McKeown founded Peak Oil Sebastopol in late 2007 as a public discussion forum for what was then becoming a popular topic of relevance among social reformers .
Yet Peak Oil Sebastopol eventually proved a bit too heavy on the talking for McKeown .
" I wanted to shift from a discussion group to an action - based effort , " he explains .
" Transition attracted me as a way in which we could actually begin doing something . "
Transition Sebastopol was born in 2008 as the ninth Transition Town in the United States .
Boulder was the first ; Sandpoint , Idaho , the second .
Today , 27 Transition Towns , also called Initiatives , have assumed life across the nation , and what began as an idea has become a concrete reality in which people are taking action .
In particular , McKeown has seen tremendous community interest in the growing of food .
Currently , the average parcel of food comes from untold distances away .
The common estimate is 1,500 miles , though some experts assure that most food travels much farther .
Such external dependence will no longer be feasible after peak oil , and communities must be capable of producing all their own goods in fields , orchards and gardens within miles .
In and around Totnes , for example , community nut trees have been planted as a sure source of protein and calories in an uncertain future .
In outlying regions of the Bay Area , backyard food production is already an after - work hobby for thousands , and interest in edible gardens appears to be growing fast .
At Harmony Farm Supply in Sebastopol , demand for edible plant seeds , starters and saplings has never been greater , according to nursery manager Kirsten Tripplett .
She estimates that sales of lettuce , kale and tomato seedlings has jumped by 25 percent this year , with a particularly large portion of sales going to customers who have never before gardened .
Fruit and nut saplings , too , sold out weeks ahead of schedule this winter .
" My reading is that this is the silver lining to the economy going south , " she says .
McKeown , though , calls food production " the entry - level thing to do " among Transitionists ; other essential actions must be taken for a Transition Town to cushion itself against the drastic changes predicted in post -oil society .
A viable Transition Town must be capable of producing its own materials , tools and other products that society now imports from half the globe away .
With machines and factories no longer readily available , almost every citizen would need to participate at some level in production of food , energy and goods .
To address this , Transition founder Hopkins details a 12 - part process in The Transition Handbook , which has sold more than 10,000 copies nationwide .
In its pages he describes , among other essentials , " the Great Reskilling , " an effort in which communities must retrain men and women in such trades and artistries as seed - saving and food - growing , pickling vegetables , building simple structures , installing rain catchment systems , building composting toilets , and many other fundamental life skills which most of us simply know nothing about .
Crude Scenario
Yet it was only a little over a century ago that society first got swept up on the thrilling wave of oil - age progress .
In the 1850s , societies functioned largely as local entities , without deep reliance on global economies or crude oil .
Many , if not most , Americans lived on or near farms .
We knew how to labor with our hands and feed ourselves .
In short , people worked — and our elders can just about remember that era .
In fact , The Transition Handbook includes a chapter titled " Honoring the Elders , " urging Transitionists to dredge from old - timers information and anecdotes from the days before cheap oil .
McKeown is currently at work on such a project for Transition Sebastopol , seeking out locals in their 80s and 90s who were young adults during or before the Great Depression .
" It would do us good to talk with these people who remember what it was like to live in a pre-hyperconsumption era , " he says .
Michael Levy , a private music teacher who helped found Transition Santa Cruz last summer , agrees that scaling back on individual consumption is among the most fundamental of actions in the Transition movement .
" Most of us do n't know how to grow food or preserve food so that we can have things in the winter that grow in the summer .
We also do n't know how to make basic things , like structures and buildings .
Even simple tasks like repairing clothes , we just do n't even bother anymore .
We 've become a throwaway society . "
With peak oil and economic ruin looming over us like teetering skyscrapers , Transitionists argue that we can no longer afford such wastefulness .
For a while , perhaps even a few more years , this matter may remain one of individual choice and lifestyle , but eventually prices will rise , imported products will begin dwindling from shelves , and we will have no choice but to move into a new era .
Fridley says too many Americans believe in solutions to all problems , but peak oil is a terrible anomaly among crises , he explains , because there is no solution .
Fridley does n't even see any hope in solar , wind , water and other renewable energy sources .
Even nuclear power creates only electricity , while crude oil is the basis for thousands of synthetic products .
" There is nothing that can replace oil and allow us to maintain life at the pace we 've been living , " he says .
" Crude oil is hundreds of millions of years of stored sunlight , and we 're using it all up in a few generations .
It 's like living off of a savings account , whereas solar energy is like working and living off your daily wages . "
The sheer cost - efficiency of oil eclipses all supposed alternatives .
Removed from the ground and burned , oil makes things move almost miraculously .
A tank of gasoline in a sedan holds enough energy to equal approximately five years of one person 's rigorous manual labor .
Historically , too , oil has been very easy to get since the world 's first well was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859 ; for each barrel 's worth of energy invested in the process of accessing crude oil , 30 barrels are produced , says Fridley .
By contrast , ethanol is a paltry substitute ; each barrel 's worth of ethanol invested in ethanol production produces a mere 1.2 barrels of raw product .
Other renewables offer similarly poor returns .
" The thermodynamics just do n't add up , " Fridley says .
Put another way , societies of the pre–oil age worked their butts off .
They had to .
Roughly 90 percent of the population toiled in jobs that produced our energy , food and water , while just 10 percent reaped the rewards , holding soft - palmed positions in politics , the arts , begging and prostitution , to name several fields .
Today , by contrast , merely 5 percent of Americans work jobs that relate to producing food and energy , while 95 percent reap the rewards , many working at abstract tasks in offices .
In a world suddenly without machine labor , this top - heavy imbalance is poised to capsize .
Post - Peak Pleasures
Asher Miller , executive director of the Post Carbon Institute , has been trying to convey the urgency of peak oil to the North Bay community for several years .
Miller , a full supporter of the Transition movement , believes global peak oil occurred last summer .
From here on out , we will see severe price instability of many foods and products as change comes unfurling .
The age of cheap , easy energy is over .
Miller likens the last 150 years to a feeding frenzy .
" This kind of thing happens to any species that suddenly finds an abundant food source .
Its population explodes and things go way out of balance .
Oil was our food source , and we went crazy for a while . "
The theory of abiotic oil counters that of peak oil .
The theory holds that forces within the mantle of the earth create crude oil just as fast as we burn it up .
Proponents of the notion believe , then , that oil is a renewable resource and that peak oil cannot happen .
Some of these same theorists have called peak oil a lie promoted by greater powers as a means of artificially hiking prices .
Little to no evidence , however , supports the existence of abiotic oil .
Even the peak oil theory does not claim that oil will ever run out entirely ; it will only become increasingly scarce and expensive .
Miller believes the things we have today may still be available in the simpler times ahead ; there will just be fewer of them and they 'll be more expensive .
" I 'm sure you 'll always be able to get something if you pay for it , " he says .
" It just might cost you $ 10,000 to buy a computer . "
Fridley does not see peak oil as doomsday , though he predicts that there might be " die-off , " just as marine algae bloom and crash periodically .
In fact , Fridley views Transition as a process of world improvement .
The environment around us has been falling apart for decades due to our excessive lifestyles , he notes .
In our oceans and wildlands , doomsday has already arrived with deforestation , water pollution , fisheries collapse , extinction and other plagues .
Peak oil presents an urgent cause to rethink and reshape our lives and the world for the better , he says .
Jennifer Gray , who founded Transition United States in Sebastopol two years ago , also believes peak oil could open doors to happiness that most Americans never knew were there .
A native of the United Kingdom , Gray moved to Mill Valley in 2007 after helping to get Transition rolling in Totnes .
She believes that redefinition of wealth is one of the essentials to the Transition movement .
" We need to make that paradigm shift that having less may actually mean that you have much more , and in this country it 's hard to convince people of that . "
Shit Has Hit
But the worst - case predictions of post - oil society come from Santa Rosa attorney Matt Savinar , a controversial figure in peak oil premonitions .
His website , Peak Oil : Life After the Oil Crash ( www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net), offers an informational survivor 's guide for what he is certain is an impending disaster .
While other peak oil thinkers frequently talk about " when " the shit hits the fan , Savinar says it already has .
" The shit is hitting the fan now , " he says unequivocally .
" It 's just happening in slow motion , and it 's not hitting equally in all places . "
Asked what individuals can do to ease their way into life after the oil crash , the 30 - year - old advises people to " learn basic camping skills . "
Wilderness survival tactics will also be handy in the world that 's dawning .
He urges Americans to relocate geographically to within miles of their families , as social support networks will be crucial in the coming age .
For himself , Savinar hopes to marry into a large family .
While Transitionists see the coming change as one of potential enrichment — community gardens , cycling , skilled artisans at every corner — Savinar 's outlook is a bleak and shadowy contrast .
He warns that in the foreseeable future the world will experience " staggering horror . "
While life in remembered times has been about " the pursuit of victory and money , " life in the near future , he predicts , " will be about tragedy .
We 've been able to externalize this reality to the future and to other places only because we had access to this incredibly dense source of energy , " he says .
No longer .
Savinar can't say when , but he believes that a time will come well within just one generation when even supermarkets must close their doors .
Then , unless the goal of Transition — to build resilience into communities — takes effect soon , chaos could only ensue in a culture so spoiled by excess and mass consumption as ours .
In the North Bay , says the Post Carbon Institute 's Miller , residents have the open space , the soil , the sun , the water and the resources to hit the ground running when peak oil arrives .
What the community does n't have , he says , is a full collective understanding of how much people need to cut back on individual consumption and how quickly they need to do it .
Savinar says too many people 's happiness depends dearly on external items and flimsy concepts of wealth .
These people must reprioritize their value systems now and quit " waddling through Wal - Mart . "
They must wean themselves from the comforts of supermarkets , leisure time and television .
They — we — must forfeit luxuries ; instead of feasting on steak , one may have to give thanks to a plate of beans and rice .
Instead of vacations to Europe , we might have to settle for camping weekends at Salt Point State Park .
Because , if the predictions are true , we will not always have Paris .
Forever Growth ?
Fridley has seen peak oil coming for years .
From his small Sonoma farm , he may be prepared to feed himself , but our world 's dependence on oil goes far beyond food production .
Even electric machines need crude oil byproduct .
" Every single machine in the nation runs on lubrication , " Fridley says .
" If that lube is n't there , then what ? "
In theory , the world freezes up .
A person may first digest this concept as an abstract , distant nebula , like climate change , extinctions , water pollution and other newspaper headlines .
However , when the reality of peak oil hits — when it hits a person so that his or her personal life is deeply affected — it hits hard .
" It 's hard to internalize , " says Miller , who has seen many people react in many ways to being told that the world in which they have grown so comfortable is about to end .
" One tendency is for people to believe that there is a solution , that technology will fix it or that the powers that be will fix it . "
But technology and the powers that be run on oil .
Santa Rosa author Richard Heinberg , a senior fellow with the Post Carbon Institute , described peak oil in his much lauded 2003 book aptly titled The Party 's Over : Oil , War and the Fate of Industrial Societies , and indeed , most experts on the matter now agree that the party is over .
Transitionists are readying for the new era with open arms while struggling to convince others of the severity of the matter .
In Santa Cruz , several city figures , including councilman Don Lane and the city 's climate action coordinator Ross Clark , have stepped up and proven themselves allies of the Transition movement , attending multiple community meetings .
San Francisco , too , has acknowledged peak oil , and a city - appointed task force recently submitted to the supervisors a 120 - page report detailing the city 's vulnerabilities to the crisis .
Savinar has been trying for years to invite government participation in peak oil preparation .
In 2005 , he sent a letter of warning to each member of the Santa Rosa City Council , advising that they begin aggressively readying the community for peak oil and its aftermath .
The letter was articulate and " lawyerly , " he says , and included a copy of Heinberg 's Party 's
Over in each package , yet not one councilperson responded .
" And I guarantee that if I was a car manufacturer and I scribbled out a letter with crayons , they would have answered me , " he says with a short laugh .
Fridley also believes assistance will not come from the world 's leaders .
Transition can only be a grass - roots revolution .
He points out that Secretary of Energy Steven Chu was previously the director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , where Fridley has done much of his thinking about peak oil and Transition .
" [ Chu ] was my boss , " Fridley says .
" He knows all about peak oil , but he can't talk about it .
If the government announced that peak oil was threatening our economy , Wall Street would crash .
He just ca n't say anything about it . "
Thus , world leaders would like to have the populace believe that this oil - age feeding frenzy will continue forever , that the economy will continue to expand and grow .
At the 2008 G - 8 Summit on the Japanese island of Hokkaido , for example , our leaders declared a resolution to resume economic growth .
Fridley says such a goal is impossible , yet no one wants to face the fact .
" Ask scientists if something can grow forever exponentially , and they 'll say , ' No . '
Then ask how our economy can keep on growing , and they 'll say , ' Well , it has to . ' "
Elsewhere , many politicians and leaders have been reluctant to address peak oil , and full governmental leadership may never arrive .
Levy believes that politicians locally and nationally will be even more reluctant to discuss peak oil than they 've been to address climate change .
" Transition is probably going to grow from the ground up before the government comes onboard , " he predicts .
Observers using the Anglo - Australian Telescope took this series of 1 - second exposures , each snapped 0.6 - seconds apart , around the predicted time of impact .
A bright flash can be seen in the second image ( centre of frame ) , and faintly in the third and fourth as well ( Image : Jeremy Bailey / University of New South Wales / Steve Lee/ Anglo - Australian Observatory ) Kaguya is set to crash into the moon at a lunar latitude of 65.5° south and longitude of 80.4° east ( Image : ESA / SMART - 1 AMIE / B. Grieger / B.H. Foing )

Japan ’s Kaguya lunar orbiter will end its nearly two - year mission when it collides with the moon at 1825 GMT on Wednesday .
Observers in Asia and Australia may be able to spot a bright flash or plume of dust from the crash , and researchers will study its impact site to watch how radiation and micrometeoroids weather the newly exposed lunar soil over time .
Launched in September 2007 , Kaguya , formerly known at SELENE , sought to shed light on the formation and evolution of the moon by studying its composition , gravitational field and surface characteristics .
Kaguya deployed two smaller satellites after reaching lunar orbit that allowed it to relay data to Earth while it was on the moon ’s far side and to better measure anomalies in the moon ’s gravitational field ( see First gravity map of moon ’s far side unveiled ) .
It also made the world ’s first HD video of the lunar surface .
Like previous lunar orbiters , including China ’s Chang’e 1 and Europe ’s SMART - 1 probes , Kaguya will end its voyage in a violent rendezvous with the moon ’s surface .
Heat and light
It is set to impact in the lower - right section of the moon ’s near side ( see image ) .
Coming in at a very shallow angle – nearly parallel to the ground – the probe has a high chance of skipping across the surface , like a stone across a pond .
Ground - based observers are unlikely to see this skipping .
But those in Asia and Australia might be able to spot a plume of dust raised by the impact , if it is backlit by the sun , like snow thrown up by a skier ploughing through powder , says Bernard Foing , project scientist of the European Space Agency ’s SMART - 1 probe , which impacted the moon in 2006 .
Viewers may also see a brief flash as some of the kinetic energy of the probe , which will be moving at 6000 kilometres per hour , is converted to heat and light in the collision .
“ It ’s a final show for the Japanese people , ” says Shin-ichi Sobue , a researcher and spokesperson for the Kaguya mission .
Foing says researchers can learn from these crashes .
“ Impact is the destiny of each orbiter , ” he told New Scientist .
“ We try to make use of it as a research opportunity . ”
Space weathering
Peter Schultz , an expert on lunar impacts at Brown University in Providence , Rhode Island , agrees .
Depending on the specific terrain of the impact site , the crash could leave an elongated scar , exposing fresh soil , or regolith , to the harsh environment of space .
Scientists could watch how the lunar soil weathers over time under solar radiation and bombardment by smaller meteoroids .
It would be like “ watching a wound heal ” , according to Schultz .
After the crash , attention will turn to NASA ’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) and Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) missions , set to launch a week after Kaguya ’s demise .
LRO will orbit the moon , studying its composition and topography and searching for possible sites for future human bases , while LCROSS will bombard one of the moon ’s polar craters with two heavy impactors in search of water ice there .
I was THIS CLOSE to making strawberry shortcake one day , and came up with this instead .
It ’s a cross between strawberry shortcake and strawberry cake .
Delicious !
IMPORTANT : Be sure to use a cake pan that ’s at least 2 inches deep !
Before baking , the batter should not fill the pan more than halfway .
Sift together flour , salt , baking soda , and corn starch .
Cream 9 tablespoons butter with the sugar until light and fluffy .
Add eggs one at a time , mixing well each time .
Add sour cream and vanilla and mix until combined .
Add sifted dry ingredients and mix on low speed until just barely combined .
Pour into greased and floured 8 - inch cake pan .
Bake at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes , or until no longer jiggly like my bottom .
Remove from cake pan as soon as you pull it out of the oven , and place on a cooling rack and allow it to cool completely .
Stem strawberries and slice them in half from bottom to top .
Place into a bowl and sprinkle with 3 tablespoons sugar .
Stir together and let sit for 30 minutes .
After 30 minutes , mash the strawberries in two batches .
Sprinkle each half with 1 tablespoons sugar and allow to sit for another 30 minutes .
Make icing : combine cream cheese , 2 sticks butter , sifted powdered sugar , vanilla , and dash of salt in a mixing bowl .
Mix until very light and fluffy .
Slice cake in half through the middle .
Spread strawberries evenly over each half ( cut side up ) , pouring on all the juices .
Place cake halves into the freezer for five minutes , just to make icing easier .
Remove from freezer .
Use a little less than 1/3 of the icing to spread over the top of the strawberries on the bottom layer .
Place the second layer on top .
Add half of the remaining icing to the top spreading evenly , then spread the remaining 1/3 cup around the sides .
Leave plain OR garnish with strawberry halves .
IMPORTANT : Cake is best when served slightly cool .
The butter content in the icing will cause it to soften at room temperature .
For best results , store in the fridge !

IMPORTANT : Be sure to use a cake pan that ’s at least 2 inches deep !
Before baking , the batter should not fill the pan more than halfway .
I was bored ( read : hungry , ravenous , craving sugar ) yesterday and I had a bunch of strawberries in my fridge .
I also had a laundry room filled with dirty laundry , a sink full of breakfast dishes , and a major ax to grind .
So I decided to bake .
It ’s what I do when I have an ax to grind .
I came * this close * to making strawberry shortcake — I had plenty of heavy cream in my fridge as well , which I could easily have sweetened , whipped , and plopped over the top of sweet biscuits and syrupy strawberries .
Been there , done that …dozens of times .
But yesterday , I wanted to be different .
So I created something else .
I created …a cake .
It ’s a cross between strawberry shortcake and strawberry cake .
And get this : I got really creative and decided to name it … Strawberry Shortcake Cake .
I ’m creative that way .
The Cast of Characters ( for the cake ) : Unsalted Butter , Sugar , Eggs , Sour Cream , Vanilla , Baking Soda , Flour , Salt , and Cornstarch .
For the icing / topping : Fresh Strawberries , Unsalted Butter , Cream Cheese , Powdered Sugar , and Vanilla .
And a dash of salt , too .
Begin by sifting together flour , salt , baking soda , and cornstarch .
This cake is adapted from one of my favorite sponge cake recipes of all time .
I knew it would be perfect for this cake — I ’ll show you why later .
Sift the ingredients onto a sheet of waxed paper ; that way , you can fold it up and carry it over to the mixer in a minute .
Throw the butter and sugar into the mixing bowl .
Cream it till it ’s light and fluffy .
( Do you write till ?
Or do you write ’til ?
I wrote ’til till someone recently set me straight . )
( Or do you write until , like most literate people do ? )
Never mind .
Do n’t answer that .
Add in the eggs one at a time , mixing gently after each addition .
Next , add the sour cream …
And the vanilla .
Mix together until smooth .
Now dump in the sifted ingredients …
And mix it just until ingredients are combined .
I usually stop just short of it being totally combined so I can give it a stir or two with the rubber spatula .
You need an 8 - inch cake pan .
I decided to do 8 - inch instead of 10 - inch because it ’s smaller and cuter .
Very unlike my bottom .
VERY generously spray the bottom and sides of the pan with cooking spray , which , let ’s face it , is SO much easier than rubbing the inside of the pan with butter , then tapping flour all over it .
I praise the DAY I discovered cooking SPRAY .
That could be a jingle , a poem , or a rap , depending on your needs .
Pour the batter into the greased pan …
Then , with an offset spatula , get the surface as level as you can .
Then bake the cake at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes , or until no longer jiggly .
And please note : the cake tends to get pretty golden brown on the outside when it bakes … but it ’s perfect inside .
Here , I ’ve inverted the baked cake onto a cooling rack and placed it by an open window ( it was cool outside yesterday ) so it ’ll hurry up and cool down — it has to be completely cooled before I can ice it .
Meanwhile , stem and slice the strawberries .
I love using the tip of a spoon to stem strawberries ; that ’s how my mom always did it .
Once they ’re stemmed …
Slice them in half from top to bottom .
Throw the strawberry halves into a bowl …
Sprinkle the sugar over the top .
Then give ’em a little stir .
Now , let the strawberries sit for 30 minutes .
They ’ll begin to give off juice , which will mix with the sugar to form a nice syrupy liquid .
Delish .
After 30 minutes , mash the strawberries on a plate with a fork .
Once they ’re mashed ( you can mash as much or as little as you ’d like ) , sprinkle on a little more sugar .
Let them sit for another 30 minutes to get nice and juicy and syrupy .
( I halved the strawberries and mashed them on two separate plates . )
( And for you adventurous types : here ’s where you could splash just a little bit of Grand Marnier over the strawberries .
It ’ll make the cake extra yum , and will cure your aches and pains . )
Once the cake is completely cooled , make the icing .
Throw the cream cheese and unsalted butter into the mixing bowl …
Mix it together till light and fluffy .
Sift the powdered sugar and throw it in .
Add the vanilla here , too , along with a dash of salt .
Beat the icing until it ’s light and fluffy , about a minute on high .
This is where the whisk attachment of your mixer comes into play — it really gets the air into the icing .
( A hand mixer works just as well ! )
Mmmm .
Cream cheese icing .
The stuff that dreams are made of .
Make sure the cake is n’t the least bit warm .
Then , with a long , serrated knife , slice the cake perfectly in half .
The texture of this cake is really something .
Here ’s why I decided to use it :
It ’s substantial enough to hold up when you spread the strawberries over the top .
Half the berries go on the bottom …
Be sure to pour all the sweet juices over the top .
They ’ll soak into the cake and make you a happier person .
Now , repeat with the other half the cake and the other half of the berries , then place both halves into the freezer for about five minutes .
Go ahead and stick the icing into the freezer , too .
This ’ll cool everything down just a bit and help the icing process .
( Just do n’t let the icing stay in much longer than that ; the butter will become firm very quickly . )
When you ’re ready , place the bottom half onto a pretty cake plate or pedestal .
I love this dadgum pedestal .
I got it on eBay , like , last century .
Quite literally .
Fenton Milk Glass .
Totally kitschy , man .
Plop a little less than a third of the icing on top of the strawberries …
And spread it out , being careful not to disrupt the strawberries too much .
No need to be overly neat .
The icing can hang over the sides a little .
Next , place the other strawberry - covered half on top .
Plop half of the remaining icing on top …
And spread it out evenly , being careful not to disrupt the strawberries too much .
* Important : at this stage , I stuck the cake back into the freezer for about 5 to 7 minutes before icing the rest of it .
It ’s a crazy habit of mine .
When you pull it out , begin to panic when you realize you ’re losing daylight fast .
Use the remaining icing to cover the sides of the cake .
Mmmm .
Looking good !
If you get icing on the plate or pedestal , just use a damp paper towel or cloth to clean it right off .
Marlboro
Man always makes fun of me when I do this , especially when I ’m serving the kids Spaghetti- O’s .
Well HELLO , my beautiful lover !
It ’s very nice to finally meet you face to face .
I think the cake looks nice the way it is — you can see hints of strawberries peeking through the icing , and it ’s sort of natural and uncontrived .
But if you wanted to , you could artfully arrange strawberry halves all over the top in any number of designs .
But I ’d rather spend that time eating it .
I can’t really talk about how good this was .
If I tried , I might start crying .
It ’s the best strawberry shortcake cake I ’ve ever eaten .
An absolute delight !

Ministers have defended their expenses claims saying all were made within the rules , as police are asked to probe how the details were leaked to a newspaper .
Downing Street says there was " nothing wrong " with Gordon Brown 's £ 6,500 claim to pay his brother for a cleaner .
Lord Mandelson , who claimed £ 2,850 for his home , before quitting as an MP and selling it for a large profit , said the claims were for essential repairs .
The Telegraph published the details and says other parties ' claims will follow .
But some ministers are annoyed that details had been leaked , before they were due to be published in July , and have claimed that it was a politically motivated story by a Conservative - supporting newspaper .
System ' does n't work '
The BBC 's political editor Nick Robinson said it did not appear any one allegation would be enough for a minister to lose their jobs - but an impression had been created that , at best , MPs were casual about claims and at worst , were deliberately trying to get every penny from the system .
The Commons authorities have made a complaint to the Metropolitan Police , who have confirmed they are considering a request to launch an investigation into the leak .
And the BBC understands House of Commons Commission , a supervisory body chaired by Speaker Michael Martin , will meet on Monday to decide whether to release the details of all MPs ' claims early .
In a separate development police have also confirmed that they have received a complaint about work minister Tony McNulty 's expenses claims .
He has said his second homes claim - for a property in which his parents live , eight miles from his main home - was within the rules and said he had made " considerable " use of the property .
Scotland Yard confirmed it was considering a complaint that Mr McNulty may have " obtained pecuniary advantage by deception " .
Gordon Brown , who is in Bradford for a memorial ceremony , has said a " better system " for expenses is needed - but one that recognises that MPs must live in two places , Westminster and their constituency .
" The system does n't work , " he told the BBC .
" I 've said it does n't work , it 's got to be changed .
We voted for change and that change has got to come quickly . "
His spokesman said any suggestion there was something wrong in the arrangement whereby Mr Brown paid his brother for a cleaner they both shared was " wholly unjustified " .
The Telegraph revelations include Communities Secretary Hazel Blears claiming three different properties within a year were her " second home " - the first in her Salford constituency , the second two in London .
MPs can claim up to £ 24,000 a year towards the costs of their second home .
' In good faith '
Ms Blears said the claims were " entirely in accordance with the rules " adding : " I have only ever had one small , one - bedroom flat at any time in London . "
Justice Secretary Jack Straw said he had repaid £ 1,500 which he claimed to cover the full rate of council tax on his constituency home - when he was getting a 50 % discount .
He told the BBC he had acted " in complete good faith and within the rules " but regretted the " error " on council tax .
But asked how his colleague - Environment Secretary Hilary Benn - apparently managed to claim only £ 140 for the whole year under the allowance , Mr Straw added : " I will talk to Hilary about how he manages it . "
Lord Mandelson said the Daily Telegraph report created " the perception of wrongdoing " about his claims for his constituency home - lodged after he said he would be standing down as an MP .
He reportedly went on to sell the property for a £ 136,000 profit but denied he had claimed to improve the house - he said the claims were to repair a roof which was letting in water .
The Telegraph has not confirmed if it paid for the details but says it was in the public interest to publish them and they will be publishing details of other parties ' claims .
' Systemic abuse '
The newspaper also says the Commons authorities had planned to blank out the addresses of MPs , potentially concealing the way some had regularly changed homes in order to maximise their income .
Its chief political commentator Benedict Brogan said : " For the first time after years of trying to get this information , Telegraph readers and the general public will have an idea of the systemic abuse of parliamentary allowances that has been going on for years and has grown up out of a system that clearly is no longer suitable for what it 's designed to do . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
Having a clean house is not requisite to being an MP , so why are we paying for it ?
Alex , Pontyclun
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg told BBC
News the issue " affects all politicians of all parties " .
Repeating his call to stop MPs buying properties using public money , he said : " I think people will just simply despair that all politicians look either ridiculous at best or corrupt at worst . "
Explain claims
Conservative leader David Cameron said : " I completely understand how angry the public are about this and we desperately need change .
" I have argued for a long time that we 've got to cut the cost of the expenses regime ... we 've got to radically reduce the number of things that MPs can claim for and we 've got to sort out the system . "

He said every MP had to explain their claims themselves .
" That 's what I will do when mine are published and I look forward to that happening , " he added .
More than 2 million receipts to back up claims made by all MPs since 2004 are being digitised and edited ahead of their publication in July .
The Commons authorities fought and lost a High Court battle last year to prevent their publication under the Freedom of Information Act .
Last week MPs voted through some changes to the second homes allowances including making all claims require a receipt and stopping MPs representing greater London constituencies from claiming it .
But more widespread reform has been left to Sir Christopher Kelly 's independent committee on standards in public life - which is carrying out a review and is expected to report back by the end of the year .
A ROUND -UP OF OPINION ON THE EXPENSES LEAK
Newspapers and blogs are not short of comment about , analysis of and reaction to the MPs ' expenses figures published in today 's Telegraph .
Most despair at some of the receipts submitted by the Cabinet before anticipating what 's coming next .
In a leader column , the Telegraph deftly swipes away any objections to its reporting ( such as those expressed by Sir Stuart Bell ) , commenting that " it is right that the public should know what has been going on " :
But in order for the Augean stables to be cleansed , it is first necessary to show how filthy they have become .
Today , The Daily Telegraph does just that .
At Tory Diary , a similar metaphor .
Tim Montgomerie braces himself for the forthcoming details when we find out about the other parties ' expenses :
The other parties are not innocent , however .
The Telegraph says MPs from all parties are implicated by their expenses exclusive .
We all paid £ 1,775 for Farrow and Ball paint for the renovation of a Tory shadow minister 's country home , for example .
One wealthy Tory MP charged £ 10 for a bag of manure .
[ Mild scatological wordplay deleted ]
At the Spectator 's Coffee House , James Forsyth is more sanguine about the likely effect on the Conservatives , on the basis that there are " only three members of the shadow Cabinet who have anything approaching national name recognition : Cameron , Hague and Osborne .
Labour , by virtue of being in government for more than a decade , has far more politicians who the country [ is ] aware of " :
As long as the Tories the country knows have n't made any outrageous claims then this story will hurt Labour more than it does the Tories .
Also at Coffee House , Fraser Nelson recalls Plato 's insistence that politicians should live in communal accommodation .
Over at the Sky blog run by Adam Boulton and his team , Joey Jones reserves judgment for the moment but reflects on another hebdomada horribila for the PM :
Led a merry dance by his fragrant nemesis Joanna Lumley , now the saviour of the world economy stoops to publishing his cleaner 's contract .
Airing his clean washing in public .
Too much information , surely ?
The BBC's Martin Rosenbaum looks at the story from a Freedom Of Information angle at his FOI blog , Open Secrets :
[ O ]ne of the most interesting pieces in the Telegraph today argues that without [ MPs ' ] addresses , the newspaper would not have been able to shed light on some of the questionable practices it reveals .
So some of today 's revelations may be as much as about leaking , or " chequebook journalism " , as about freedom of information .
At the one - stop shop for those who like a punt on matters ministerial , Political Betting , Mike Smithson cheers " an amazing period for political news " and asks the big question - big , that is , if you 're thinking of gambling on the identity of the next Labour leader :
So what are the betting implications of all of this ?
Is it good news for Alan Johnson backers ?
Finally , in a pithy post headed A Certain Amusement , economics blogger Tim Worstall notes :
Leave aside the reality of all this expenses stuff for a moment .
Just savour the frothing outrage over expenses coming from journalists .
Iran ’s president waved an apparent intelligence file on his challenger ’s wife in the air Wednesday night , accusing her of violating government rules in an explosive televised debate that laid bare the rifts within the country ’s establishment .
Mir -Hossein Mousavi , the aging former prime minister who is the leading contender against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the presidential election next week , kept his cool and struck back forcefully , defending his wife as a dedicated scholar and artist and accusing the incumbent of using the instruments of state to dig up dirt on his opponents .
“ This is typical of your government , ” he told Ahmadinejad .
“ Instead of finding solutions , you send your deputies to make files on the people . ”
The long - anticipated 90 - minute encounter , watched by more than 40 million people , was the second in a series of seven live one - on - one debates among the four presidential contenders .
Advertisement
The two candidates attacked each other unremittingly , touching on sensitive issues such as human rights , Iran ’s involvement in the Arab - Israeli conflict and its relations with the United States in a freewheeling format rare on state television .
Mousavi , struggling with his words during the beginning of the debate , hammered hard at Ahmadinejad ’s foreign policy , accusing him of needlessly alienating other countries .
He mocked what he described as Ahmadinejad ’s erratic behavior during several crises and trips abroad and repeatedly criticized Ahmadinejad for questioning the existence of the Holocaust , which he said hurt Iran ’s national interests and unified the world behind Israel , Tehran ’s rival .
“ Relations between Europe and Israel had become a bit bad due to its crimes in Gaza , ” he said .
“ Due to those remarks , [ Europe ] stood behind Israel . ”
Advertisement
Ahmadinejad , smiling and often sarcastic , fought back forcefully .
In crisp diction and barbed words , he noted that during Mousavi ’s 1981 - 89 tenure as prime minister , he too had called for Israel ’s destruction , shuttered newspapers and jailed students .
The president grabbed credit for expanding Iran ’s nuclear program and standing up to the West .
“ For 27 years the Americans were pursuing a policy of regime change against us , ” he said .
“ Now they are saying they are not .
Whose foreign policy brought that about ? ”
Ahmadinejad painted Mousavi as part of a cabal that includes Hashemi Rafsanjani , an influential ayatollah and former president , and is dedicated to defeating him to secure vested interests .
He named names , accusing several key political figures and their families of corruption and hinting at evidence showing Mousavi ’s alleged wrongdoings .
Advertisement
Mousavi was calm and quiet throughout much of the debate , but his body language showed contempt for the president .
He rarely looked him in the eye except while delivering a searing , 12 - minute final segment that sounded like a prosecutor ’s closing argument .
He took Ahmadinejad to task for harassing students , shuttering newspapers and banning books and accused him of cronyism for appointing an interior minister who had a fake university degree , the gambit that probably prompted Ahmadinejad to raise the issue of Mousavi ’s wife .
Mousavi likened Ahmadinejad ’s populist giveaways to the behavior of 19th century monarchs who used the public treasury to curry favor with the masses by tossing them a few coins .
“ We should be trying to increase jobs and production , ” he said .
Advertisement
He argued several times that Ahmadinejad had put the country in danger and did not adhere to the laws , leafing through a thick packet of paper and citing example after example .
“ I do n’t think you ’re a dictator , ” he said , “ but your attitude will lead to dictatorship . ”

False Health - Scare
Ad on CNN A right - wing group called Conservatives for Patients ’
Rights is airing a political attack ad against the idea of a public option for health insurance by turning upside down an analysis showing that 119 million Americans would jump from their private health insurer to a government plan if one existed .
Email
Printer friendly According to that analysis , 119 million Americans – roughly two - thirds of those now on private plans – would defect to a public option if they had a choice .
But the right - wing group , in airing its ad on CNN , presents that number as a case of denying those Americans the choice of staying on their private plans .
“ Experts say a government plan could result in 119 million Americans coming off their existing coverage , ” a woman ’s voice intones over the image of a Wall Street Journal article .
“ They ’d end up on a government - run plan . ”
However , those 119 million Americas would be “ coming off their existing coverage , ” according to the analysis , because many would choose a public health option over their existing private plan .
In other words , what the CPR group wants to do is to deny those 119 million Americans the choice that many of them want .
In opening the ad , CPR leader Rick Scott explicitly flips the issue of “ choice , ” maintaining that a public option “ could mean taking away your choice . ”
Scott is a multimillionaire who built Columbia / HCA into the largest U.S. health - care company before being removed by the board of directors in 1997 after a fraud investigation that led to a guilty plea for the company on overbilling state and federal health plans and to a record $ 1.7 billion in fines .
Coordinating Scott ’s anti-public - option attack ads is the CRC Public Relations firm that devised the “ Swift boat ” attacks on Sen. John Kerry ’s war record during Campaign 2004 .
[ Washington Post , May 11 , 2009 ]
In one of the strange twists of the current health - care debate , the industry ’s defenders have repeatedly cited the potential 119 million American defectors to a public option as an argument for denying them that choice .
The argument is that so many Americans would vote with their pocketbooks against the private insurers and in favor of a government - run plan that the private industry would collapse .
“ As many as 119 million Americans would shift from private coverage to the government plan , ” one of the industry ’s chief protectors , Sen. Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa , wrote in a column for Politico.com , arguing that the result would be cataclysmic for the industry .
Though some analysts question the accuracy of the 119 million estimate , its use by industry defenders represents a remarkable admission of failure by private health insurers to meet the needs of their customers .
That failure was underscored again on Wednesday by the findings of a congressional investigation that two - thirds of the industry used a faulty database that overcharged patients for seeing out - of - network doctors .
The use of the flawed database cost private insurance subscribers billions of dollars that they should not otherwise have paid , the report said .
At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing , three health - care experts explained how insurers duck payments for sick people by using incomprehensible documents and by selling “ junk ” policies that do n’t meet the needs of their customers .
The witnesses included Wendell Potter , insurance giant Cigna ’s former vice president for communications , who said insurers deliberately make the paperwork confusing to deter customers from obtaining the payments they may deserve .
Now , Potter said the industry ’s goal is to “ shape reform in a way that benefits Wall Street far more than average Americans . ”
To do so , he said , " The industry and its backers are using fear tactics , as they did in 1994 , to tar a transparent and accountable -- publicly accountable -- health - care option , " Potter said .
[ Washington Post , June 25 , 2009 ]
Given the many complaints that Americans have expressed over the years about denials , limits and cost of health insurance , it probably should n’t be a surprise that millions of Americans would trust a government - run insurance plan over a private one .
But the main point of U.S. public opinion has been that health care reform should offer a choice for Americans to pick one or the other .
According to a New York Times / CBS poll , 72 percent of the American people favor “ offering everyone a government administered health insurance plan like Medicare that would compete with private health insurance plans . ”
However , the attack ad appearing on CNN has turned the choice issue inside out , with the goal of leaving the American people with only the choice of signing up with a private insurer or going without insurance .

The entire governing body of a comprehensive school was sacked yesterday by Children 's Secretary Ed Balls following a row over bonus payments to its head and senior staff .
An interim board will now be set up to run Copland Community School in Brent , north - west London , after it emerged that its head , Sir Alan Davies , was paid a bonus on top of his salary of £ 80,00 last year and £ 50,000 two years ago .
Mr Balls said he was " very concerned " about allegations of serious financial mismanagement at the school .
These are now being investigated by the National Audit Office while Sir Alan and the school 's bursar have been suspended .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In all , it has been alleged that bonus payments worth £ 1.6 m have been paid to senior staff at the school over a number of years .
The payments came to light when a teacher at the school , Hank Roberts , highlighted them at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers conference at Easter and claimed it was bringing the world of banking bonuses into education .
He was subsequently suspended over another matter , but later reinstated .
They were defended by Dr IP Patel , chairman of the school 's governing body , who said Sir Alan – one of the first " superheads " to be knighted under the Blair government – was " worth every penny " .
The interim board to run the school will be appointed by Brent Council .
Mr Balls said : " Robust governance and management must be established as soon as possible at Copland . "
He said there was " no alternative in putting Copland back on track " to replacing the governing body .
North Carolina 's government is reportedly promising tax breaks to Apple in return for building a large server farm , eventually worth $ 1 billion , within the East coast state .
A " state official " has told the Charlotte Observer that a bill nearing approval that would bend tax rules for a single , unnamed company are actually meant to accommodate a specific Apple project , which might otherwise be located in another state .
The deal would give the tax breaks to companies with a minority market share in North Carolina , but with a disproportionately large amount of property and staff located in the region .
Apple would stand to save as much as $ 46 million in the space of 10 years but , in return , would have to invest $ 1 billion within nine years and locate itself in one of the state 's poorer counties ; Catawba and Cleveland counties are on the short list .
North Carolina is facing steep , double - digit unemployment and could thus soften the blow by giving incentives to companies to do business within the state .
Google has been operating a server farm of its own in the state since 2008 .
Just what this project would entail is n't clear , but legislators supposedly see it in terms of " juicy " long - term rewards that would be worth even timid beginnings .
At first , the Apple server farm would need under 100 full - time staff — less than 1 percent of the 35,100 employees the Mac maker relies on today .
Server farms are usually intended to handle the very largest sets of data a company has to offer and are often located outside of regular company offices both for size reasons and , sometimes , as a physically separate backup .
A post came to my attention today covering " Best of breed controllers for MVC Web Frameworks . "
It covers , again , toolkits like Ruby On Rails , Django , CherryPy , and so on .
The author initially treated this as a recent phenomenon of the last few years , but he was quickly corrected by Philip Eby in the first comment .
Publishing objects on a nice URL is nothing new , and one of the best toolkits to do this sprang up in 1996 - Bobo , aka , The Python Object Publisher .
In the comments , some of the legends and myths are covered and dispelled concerning Bobo 's origins .
My former boss and all - around - great - guy Paul Everitt mentions in the comments ( and on his on weblog ) :
I remember thinking last year , after all this time , most packages have n’t caught up to what Jim had on his laptop after the plane ride back .
So many systems seem more like the “ Gateway ” in CGI , than systems that adopt the object model of the web .
A few days ago I started writing a post on my own about my experiences with this back in the mid-nineties .
Now that the history of Bobo has been covered elsewhere , I can just tell of my experiences with it prior to my joining Digital Creations in mid 1997 .
The problem of " numerous web frameworks " is nothing new for Python .
In 1996 I had crafted my own , taking some ( very light ) inspiration from the great WebObjects .
I was aware of this tool " Bobo " but I did n't quite grasp its significance at the time .
When I published the first version of my tool , netstijl , to the Python web - sig , Paul responded with a " yeah , we 've done that too " reply .
A few months later , at a rarely - paying job high on the east benches of Salt Lake City , I was growing frustrated with an application I was working on .
My responsibility was writing a socket server that queried closed - caption text feed archives from television , and returning responses to a Java Applet Client which would show the results and also pull down still images associated with those results .
This was before server side Java , RMI , etc .
My part of the code was written in Python , and was a good model - controller separation .
But the Java client development was coming along atrociously slow .
So sometime in early spring , 1997 , I decided one day that I was going to turn my work into a web application and not care about the applet .
I turned to Bobo for my work .
By the end of the day , the conversion was done .
I worked on a new set of controllers for a few hours in the morning , had lunch , and spent the rest of the day making the HTML look pretty .
One Day was all that took .
Over the next couple of weeks , new features were added .
The biggest of these was the " advanced search " which used HTML Frames and " multipart /x- mixed - replace " to push data to the client , such as the images that were shown next to the search results .
All of this on my model from the socket server implementation , but now published via Bobo and my controllers and templates .
In short time , I had done what we were having trouble accomplishing with the Java Applet , but now using just HTML , Bobo and Python 1.3 and 1.4 .
Ever since that spring , I have been using that same basic toolkit .
In September 1997 I joined Digital Creations as ' Principia 1.0 ' was being developed , and worked applications built on Principia and Zope ( which was the open source Principia ) there for the next four years before coming back to Utah to be poor ( wink ) as both on my own and with a couple of different companies I 've continued to develop and deploy Zope based applications .
I 've done just about every different kind of Zope development imaginable .
DTML Scripting , ZClasses ( Briefly ) , ZPatterns ( a Philip Eby invention ) , CMF , scripts and templates over RDBMS based data ( often still published along a readable URL ! ) , ' Product based ' , building our own frameworks over Zope , and through gateways to our own data management frameworks that had little knowledge of Zope but could communicate through a new model layer and take advantage of Zope for managing not only views and web publishing , but for managing transactions .
Other things that made Bobo cool were some of the little features that you did n't necessarily need , but were useful when you did - security and transactions .
Security has always been a feature of Bobo , Principia , and Zope .
Bobo also came with a transaction manager that - to this day - starts a transaction at the beginning of a request and commits if the response is successful and aborts if there 's an error .
With it , I never had to worry about half - written data ( so long as I was using a persistent database manager ) , or data being written in one database and not the other ...
Unless of course that database was pre-InnoDB MySQL or an LDAP directory ( and I even made a couple of valiant efforts to do transactional LDAP writing , at least within Zope .
They never quite worked properly though ) .
I remember coming across this feature in 1997 , before I joined Digital Creations , and how happy it made me .
Web development was still very tough at the time , and I still bore many scars from CGI programming where I 'd often have half - written data before an exception happened and I did n't get a full file made .
When I started using BoboPOS , the persistence system that became the ZODB ( Zope Object Database ) , such problems magically disappeared !
Bobo was even doing REST - ish communications back in the day .
There was a ' bobo Client ' library which basically allowed for RPC / Corba-ish communication , but using HTTP as the backbone .
Again , this was long before XML , XML - RPC , SOAP , webMethods , ICE , and so on .
I used it many times to script batch updates that I needed to make to an application server .
I do n't have any code in front of me , but basically it looked like this :
john = boboclient .
Object ( ' http://www.example.com/people/johndoe') john.setJobTitle(jobtitle='Vice President , Software Engineering ')
On the ' Object ( ... ) ' call , you could set up authentication parameters , what HTTP method to use , etc .
And basically all that the bobo client stuff would do is turn the method call , ' setJobTitle ' into a GET or POST to the url with the method name attached .
As a GET , it would look like this :
http://www.example.com/people/johndoe/setJobTitle?jobtitle=Vice%20President....
Bobo on the server would then turn that into a traversal path and method call , like :
root ( ) [ ' people ' ] [ ' johndoe '].setJobTitle(jobtitle= 'Vice President ....')
And all that John Doe 's class might have to do is something like this :
class Person (... ) : def setJobTitle ( self , jobtitle ) : " " " Update the job title for this person " " " self .
_jobTitle = jobtitle
That 's a very simple example , but not really that far of a cry from what I still do today .
In fact , using Ajax and Zope 3 has been extremely easy because of things like this , and I have some MochiKit based helpers that let me construct Javascript client objects to server side ' browser views ' ( which are also being controllers in this case ) to do operations that are very similar to the simple example above .
It 's now been about nine years since I started programming Python .
For almost all of that time , I 've developed for the web .
And for all but the first seven or eight moths , I 've used Bobo or one of its descendants .
Now I 'm using Zope 3 , which is the completely re-architected Zope framework and application server .
And I 'm amazed at what we 've done in the past month and a half on it .
We 've watched so many frameworks and concepts come and go , go into vogue and then out .
All this time , Bobo has been sitting at the heart of Zope and even larger systems built on top of Zope ( CMF , Plone , CPS , to name a few ) , doing the simple job of publishing objects on the web .
How complex and overburdened those objects may have gotten in Zope 2 is a different debate .
For as long as Django has been alive as an internal project before bursting its way onto the public scene recently , Zope and the CMF have been quietly and steadily managing many large television and newspaper sites around the world .
On fads ...
I remember fondly when it seemed of utmost importance to make Perl work in or with Zope .
And then it was Java - " yeah , but could it work with J2EE / JSP ? " and early PHP .
But I believe that the core Bobo ideas are still extremely valid .
Because although Zope 3 is a new and clean architecture compared to the jungle of Zope 2 , the principal ideas ( and even some of the very core code ) seem to have changed very little , even as other trends have come along for the rest of the Python community to try to duplicate ...
I never understood servlets in Java .
And the Python implementations were even harder to understand .
Bobo ... I got it .

By “ no one , ” I mean those who have been around long enough to be realistic in expectation and understanding of how the world — both human and natural — functions .
This excludes people who are prone to panic , who have no understanding of science and critical theory ( that ’s a logical AND , there , meaning “ both or no dice ” ) , and those who are using political issues to make themselves seem more important , moral , etc .
People who are in the know in realistic ways are not surprised at two trends that define modern society :
An endless flood of panics from the media A different stream of actual threats unnoticed by the crowd
Fear sells , and the best panic is one that resolves into ambiguity , so it or something like it can be sold again .
However , because people are looking for marketable panics , they downplay the mundane — which is where threats are most likely to occur , in our assumptions and daily actions .
Immanuel Kant wrote about “ radical evil ” which is evil in the most mundane places , participated in by most people , and unnoticed because hey others are doing it .
Radical evil is present in both false panics and ignoring mundane threats , instead preferring to bloviate about Satan or totalitarian governments , neither of which compare to the real threat to us , which is our own inattention and distraction .
So now we find out that this Bisphenol - A stuff , which is in just about everything , is bad news and we ’ve been using it since the 1950s :
Exposure to bisphenol A , the hormonally active chemical used to make the linings of most tin cans and hard plastic bottles , may be able to alter brain function , impairing the ability to learn and remember , according to a new study by researchers from Canada and the United States .
The study , conducted on monkeys , whose brain development is similar to that of humans , raises the possibility that ailments such as depression , Alzheimer ’s disease and schizophrenia may be linked to the controversial chemical .
Almost all people living in industrialized societies are exposed to BPA as a result of trace amounts leaking from food and beverage containers .
The Globe and Mail
The topic immediately became politicized .
Conservatives and many scientists , tired of the panics , lashed out by saying that this was a liberal agenda to gain more control .
Liberals returned fire by saying it was a clear case of entrenched industry corrupting government to protect a bad but lucrative practice .
And then , at the end of the day , it was the giant Satan retailer that everyone loves to hate who led the way in solving the problem .
( Whether that ’s free markets at work , or lawyers afraid of future lawsuits , or just enlightened leadership deciding that if they have the power , why not go for the best outcome , is up to you . )
Now that the dragon is slain , and Bisphenol - A ( or BPA ) is falling out of use , we face an urge to conduct a postmortem and figure out where we went wrong .
While others are pointing fingers at big conspiracy theories ( left ) or overreaction ( right ) , I submit a simpler , more mundane , and boring yet infinitely more likely scenario : apathy and that kind of corruption that only happens when “ do n’t rock the boat ” and “ that ’s the way it has always been around here ” replace an urge to drive toward truth regardless of consequences .
Because truth , like Satan , knows no master .
What would this corruption look like ?
For starters , you have to please a crowd .
That may be voters or a series of disaffected people working in the chemical industry who are so tired of internal politics they smash dissent as a way of keeping on course .
It could even be FDA inspectors who use lab results to find immediate problems , but do not have the funding to follow up with real - world studies or statistical measurements over a lifetime .
This corruption could even be an environment where a new product , once it becomes trendy , forces its way into every place because you do n’t want to oppose what ’s making your neighbors money and keeping them happy , right ?
I mean , they say they ’re happy and all , so we assume it ’s true .
Imagine a federal agency , like the FDA .
There ’s immense pressure on this agency to approve products because jobs and national prestige are riding on the issue , as is the convenience of voters .
If you do n’t approve a medication or product that the people want , a world of hell is coming down on your shoulders .
This is where it gets interesting .
Organizations are composed of people ; we tend to forget that .
People have multiple allegiances .
They want to do what ’s right , but they must please their superiors as those superiors must please politicians and voters .
But they also have allegiance to themselves and their family .
If you find a problem with a product , as a researcher , and you see that the forces promoting that product are strong , you need to make a choice : truth or career .
When your wife and kids look up at you in a homeless shelter , moral good is a distant theory .
These people leaning on you can be politicians , industry , or most likely , the voter : they want their products and want them now .
The voter also influences industry , with what the voter wants to buy , and politicians , with what public opinion is .
Think of it another way : if you as a genetics researcher found out that all Irish or Italian people carried a gene that made them low - IQ sociopaths inclined to cause social decay , would you publish ?
I sure would n’t .
You know you ’d face big guns empowered by the outrage of the crowd at singling any group out , and someone with less scientific honor would cook up some study “ proving ” that you ’re an idiot , probably through dubious statistical means .
Twenty years later , you ’d be vindicated — maybe — which would probably not mean much to your divorced family and homeless shelter housemates .
In addition to the mundane evil of social pressure skewing results , there ’s another problem of method .
Scientists often say that a product is safe when they find no ill results after overexposure .
However , that ’s a lab result — in any meaningful reality , with other toxins and chemicals present , unforeseen interactions and consequences may occur .
We thought we were past all these problems .
Hatters going mad from mercury , and ladies poisoned by lead in their makeup — those are problems from ancient history when people must have been dumber , right ?
We ’d never make such errors ; we have Science !
But science is undercut by the social factors , individual motivations , and political maneuvering , and so we repeat history in a cyclic fashion .
History , after all , is both linear — our progression from ape to man to whatever better thing comes after man — and cyclic , in that if you respond the same way to roughly a similar situation , you ’ll get the same results no matter how advanced your science or social thinking is .
Bisphenol - A shows us making the mistakes of the past again because we have the same corruption of logic by politics and individual greed , apathy , distraction , oblivion , confusion and pretentious obsessive self - focus .
And how long have we known ?
Hunt , a geneticist , was exploring why human reproduction is so rife with complications .
She had a hunch the chromosomally abnormal eggs that plague human pregnancies were tied to our hormones .
A paper outlining the results of Huntâ€™s experiments on the hormone levels of female mice was ready for publication .
All she needed was to ensure that her control population , the mice left alone in the study , was normal .
Instead Hunt stumbled on a disturbing resultâ€ ” 40 percent had egg defects .
Hunt shelved hopes of publication and scrutinized every method and piece of lab equipment used in her experiment .
Four months later she finally fingered a suspect .
It was the janitor .
In the laboratory .
With the floor cleaner .
A single breach in protocol had turned the rodentsâ€™ safe environs into acutely toxic habitats .
A maintenance worker had used an abrasive floor cleaner , instead of the usual mild detergent , to wash out cages and water bottles .
The acidic solution scarred the hard , polycarbonate surface of the plastic and enabled a single chemical culprit to leach outâ€ ” bisphenol - A ( BPA ) .
Scientific American
That was in 1998 .
Bisphenol - A went into use in the 1950s .
You mean no one followed up on the original idea ?
Well , they thought they did n’t have to :
But during the manufacturing process , not all BPA gets locked into chemical bonds , explains Tim A. Osswald , an expert in polymer engineering at the University of Wisconsinâ € “ Madison .
That residual BPA can work itself free , especially when the plastic is heated , whether itâ€™s a Nalgene bottle in the dishwasher , a food container in the microwave , or a test tube being sterilized in an autoclave .
They had been assuming that because a chemical tends to form bonds , it always does , and that those bonds then remain consistent despite far more vigorous conditions than those in a laboratory .
Really ?
This ignorant thinking is borne of a single tendency : politics .
Do n’t rock the boat .
Millions of jobs are on the line .
Millions of people want their products .
Shaking this tree will make you unpopular .
So do n’t — and if you get bitter , say “ screw it ” and hope they all die of BPA poisoning , join the club .
We ’re all heart - poisoned by politics too .
This is why a lower - case -c conservatism makes sense : each new thing we add has potential threats , and because of social pressures , no one is watching .
We need to be aware of our tendency to delude ourselves with politics , and distract ourselves to death , and guard against that bad logic — no matter how popular , meaning profitable and self - promotional , it is .
If we want to move on to our next evolutionary stage , where we evolve to a consciousness broader than self - consciousness , and so can make better decisions , we ’re going to have to kick this politics addiction and some point and become truthful , less polite , more direct , and more attentive .
No more spacing out like watching afternoon TV with a vodka martini .
No more pretending problems solve themselves , or that the problem is governments , industries , etc. when the real problem is our inattention .
Let ’s hope that we continue to find more horrible toxic products so that we learn this lesson well — from pain and tragedy , as that is the only way that humans seem to learn .

Men are almost 40 per cent more likely than women to die from cancer , according to research published today .
They are also about 70 per cent more likely to die from cancers that affect both men and women , excluding breast cancer and prostate cancer .
The findings are based on cancer rates in the population , adjusted for age , and are part of a new report from the National Cancer Intelligence Network ( NCIN ) , Cancer Research UK and the Men 's Health Forum .
There is " no known biological reason " why men should be more likely to develop cancer and die , the researchers said , but they suggested " stereotypical " male behaviours , such as down - playing early symptoms and not visiting the doctor , could be to blame .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The study found men were 16 per cent more likely to develop any type of cancer than women and more than 60 per cent more likely to develop cancers that can affect both sexes .
Professor David Forman from the NCIN said : " Men have a reputation for having a ' stiff upper lip ' and not being as health - conscious as women .
What we see from this report could be a reflection of this attitude , meaning men are less likely to make lifestyle changes that could reduce their risk of the disease and less likely to go to their doctor with cancer symptoms . "

Psion Teklogix , based in Mississauga , Ontario , first filed for a trademark on the term netbook in 1996 and began using it in 1999 , and amended it in September of 2000 .
In November of 2006 , Psion Teklogix renewed the trademark with the U.S. Trademark Office , according to documents from the USPTO .
Dana C. Jewell and Anna Kuhn , the attorneys who filed the petition for cancellation for the Round Rock , Texas - based Dell , allege that Psion Teklogix should lose the trademark because the company abandoned it , committed fraud and that the term has become generic .
The first two claims filed by Dell with the USPTO are closely linked .
In order to keep a trademark active a company must re-register it with the USPTO every five years and show that they are , in fact , actively using the trademark .
In its petition for cancellation , the Texas computer manufacturer believes that Psion Teklogix " is not currently offering laptop computers under the netbook trademark . "
Dell also argues that Psion intends " not to resume the bona fide use of the Netbook name in the ordinary course of trade . "
Dell believes those assertions show that Psion has abandoned the trademark .
The allegation of fraud , according to Dell , stems from the fact that Psion had abandoned the mark but still approached the USPTO to have it renewed .
Dell believes Psion " attached a specimen of use consisting of an advertisement for [ Psion 's ] netbook laptop computer , the sale which , on information and belief , had already been discontinued by [ Psion ] for three years . "
Keith Toms , attorney with Bromberg and Sunstein LLP , a Boston - based intellectual property firm , explains that the charge of fraud on the USPTO has special meaning .
" Generally , when you think of fraud , you think of a bad act , but it carries a high standard of proof in most cases .
When dealing with PTO , there is a duty of candor on a company to provide all relevant information to the Patent and Trade Office , " Toms said .
" What 's important to note here is that if a company does n't provide enough information -- or makes false declaration -- that fraud effectively makes that declaration invalid .
Marks can be cancelled on the basis of fraud . "
The most damaging claim by Dell might be the claim of " genericness . "
When a term becomes a common part of the lexicon , a trademark loses its power , a phenomenon Toms call " Genericide . "
Dell is claiming that there is no other way to talk about netbooks , which fuels its argument of genericness .
The computer manufacturer points out that in addition to the use of the word netbook by Dell , others , including HP , Lenovo , Acer , Asus , Sony , Sylvania , Samsung , MS Wind , LG , Fujitsu all make netbooks , making the term generic .
" The generic claim is the nuclear strike here , " Toms said .
" This is Dell saying that not only has Psion Teklogics lost its rights , but it can't get rights to the phrase ' netbook ' back ever again as a descriptor of source .
This is an aggressive move for Dell to take , but reasonable because the term netbook seems to be used widely across industry . "
" The term ' netbook ' has become generic in that the primary significance of the term to the relevant public is as the name for small and inexpensive laptop computers , " Dell claims .
If the claim of genericness is upheld , the phrase netbook would become free game in the industry .
" Additionally , the generic claim would result in the term netbook being used across the industry , " Toms added .
" Not only can [ Psion ] not use it , but since it is generic , everyone else can all use it too .
Dell is attempting to clean off the register and make sure it , and anyone else , can use the term netbook in connection with laptops . "
Psion Teklogix did not respond to numerous attempts to contact the company for comment .
The irony here is that in August of 2008 Dell tried to trademark the term " cloud computing . "
The computer manufacturer actually got pretty far through the process with the USPTO before a public outcry had the move canceled .
The Burma Campaign UK today called for an intense diplomatic effort to secure the release of Aung San Suu Kyi , after she was detained in custody in Burma ’s notorious Insein Jail .
Aung San Suu Kyi is being tried for breaking the terms of her house arrest , which forbids visitors , after an American man , John Yettaw , swam across Inya Lake and refused to leave her house .
Her trial is due to begin on 18th May .
“ The United Nations and ASEAN must dispatch envoys to Burma to demand the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and all Burma ’s political prisoners , ” said Zoya Phan , International Coordinator at Burma Campaign UK .
“ Burma ’s generals will use any excuse to keep Aung San Suu Kyi detained .
If strong action is n’t taken , Aung San Suu Kyi could face the rest of her life in jail . ”
The Burma Campaign UK is calling on the British government , EU and USA to use their influence to ensure the UN sends an envoy to Burma .
“ Aung San Suu Kyi has committed no crime , she is the victim of crime , ” said Zoya Phan .
“ There was an intruder in her house who refused to leave , but she is the one being imprisoned . ”
Today Aung San Suu Kyi will have spent a total of 13 years and 202 days in detention .
The United Nations has ruled that Aung San Suu Kyi ’s detention is illegal under international law , and also under Burmese law .
The United Nations Security Council has also told the dictatorship that they must release Aung San Suu Kyi .

Student Friederike Dollinger , a stranger to Ohnesorg , is holding him crying : " What did you do , you 've killed him , he is dead and now look at that ! "
Cross-posted at
.
On June 2 , 1967 , Benno Ohnesorg , a German student of Romance and German literature , was shot dead by a plain clothes police officer during a rally against the visit of the Shah of Iran , Mohammad Reza Pahlavi .
As a pacifist , Ohnesorg was a member of a Christian Protestant community .
He was a poet and aspired to become a grammar school teacher , married , his wife being pregnant with their first child .
This had been the first rally he had ever attended .
He was 26 .
Karl - Heinz Kurras , the fatal shooter , was found not guilty of negligent homicide on November 21 , 1967 .
Benno
Ohnesorgs death led to the militant radicalisation of the extreme left and became the central argument for the self - justification of those who later killed almost hundred people .
The Movement 2 June was named after the day of his death .
The rest is history .
Now two historians , Cornelia Jabs und Helmut Müller - Enbergs , have made an interesting , potentially explosive , discovery .
In an article in the respected historic specialist magazine , " Deutschlandarchiv " , they published an article " Der 2 . Juni 1967 und die Staatssicherheit " .
While doing research in the Stasi archives , they found documents such as the signed formal obligation of Karl - Heinz Kurras , his SED - membership book and several personnel reviews by his case officers .
Kurras had belonged , so it seems , to " Linie IV " within the Stasi , known to have been responsible for " less than pretty dealings " , so Müller - Enbergs und Jabs .
Kurras , so the historians , got a radio message from the DDR - Ministerium für Staatssicherheit following Ohnesorge 's death , saying : " Destroy material at once .
Stop work for now .
Consider event as deplorable mishap ... " .
Anyway , Kurras was , following June 2 , 1967 , not expelled from the SED and as a member of a special task force of the West Berlin police , a unit that was set up to detect traitors within their own ranks , he was working at an extremely sensitive spot indeed .
So far , the historians can not tell for sure , whether Kurras had killed Ohnesorg at East Berlin 's instigation or not .
Facts are , that he was a crack shot who was unlikely to have hit Ohnesorg by chance , that he had n't been " attacked " by anybody and certainly not by Ohnesorg , that he had hopelessly entangled himself in contradictions in the aftermath of the fatal event , and that investigation authorities had done everything to clear the name of " one of them " .
Asked 40 years later whether he had , then , made a mistake , Kurras , then 79 , replied : " Mistake ?
I ought to have blasted them to send the scraps flying and not just once ; I ought to have shot five , six times .
Everybody who attacks me will be destroyed and that 's that " , letting , incidentally , slip that his defence about the warning shot he had allegedly fired had been a lie .
Elsewhere , Gesine Schwan , professor of political sciences , Greens - backed nominee of the Social Democratic Party for the upcoming federal presidential elections and possessor of a face she duly deserves , informed us , that she refuses to use the epithet " Unrechtsstaat " ( lawless state ) for the former GDR because not everything had been bad there

The writing 's been on the wall for years : GM would have to declare bankruptcy if it had any hope of restructuring in order to survive in the long - term .
And though the Obama administration 's effective take - over of General Motors was hardly the first case of the government nationalizing a private company , President George W. Bush did n't want to be the one to do it .
This , according to former vice - president Dick Cheney , who reportedly admitted in a recent interview on Fox News that the Bush administration floated the $ 17.4 billion auto industry bailout package in order to give the outgoing administration enough time to exit and for the next administration to settle in before the house of cards in Detroit came tumbling down .
According to Cheney , President Bush " decided that he did not want to be the one who pulled the plug just before he left office . " [ Source : Motor Authority | Image : Mark Wilson / Getty ]
The King of Pop is dead !
Long live the King of Pop !
Who would ’ve thought that I ’d be sitting here on June 25 , 2009 , drinking to the memory of Michael Jackson ?
Not me , that ’s for goddamned sure .
I ’d been following the various stories about his upcoming residency at London ’s O2 Arena , idly wondering if perhaps the outrageous number of sold - out shows might well inspire Michael to tour the States again .
As it happens , my wife was pondering the very same possibility .
She and I have our own informal lists of artists we ’ve never caught in concert but hope to see someday , and he was a lock for both of us .
That ’d probably explain why , when I told her the news of Michael ’s death earlier today , she burst into tears .
We have seen the Elvis Presley of our generation , and he was Michael Jackson .
You ca n’t overstate Michael ’s importance to people who grew up in the ‘ 80s .
Sure , his time with his brothers in the Jackson 5 during the ‘ 70s resulted in some damned fine music , and I ’ll gladly trumpet the merits of his 1979 album , Off the Wall , as the second best thing he released in his career , but you know it and I know it : Thriller was the shit .
It sold 26 million copies , it produced an unprecedented seven Top 10 singles , and it was the soundtrack to my teen years .
No matter how “ alternative ” my tastes in music may have gotten , from the Sex Pistols to the Velvet Underground , Robyn Hitchcock to Social Distortion , I have never hesitated to acknowledge that Thriller is one of my favorite albums of all time .
I get how people who did n’t live through the astronomical success of the record can’t conceive how you can know that Michael was accused of pedophilia and yet still declare that he was and , to a certain extent , always will be the King of Pop .
But it ’s true .
He is .
That ’s not to say that his reign had n’t been without its problems , obviously , and the problem with an album like Thriller is that , after the dust has settled , there ’s only one question left to be asked : how the hell do you follow it up ?
It ’s easy to say that Michael never came anywhere near matching that record , but , hey , I just listened to “ Dirty Diana ” and followed it up with “ Smooth Criminal , ” so do n’t tell me that Bad does n’t have some kick - ass moments on it , too .
I do n’t necessarily have the same level of love for Dangerous ( although “ Remember the Time ” has definitely withstood the test of time quite well ) , but I do think that , had he opted to release the new - material disc of HIStory – known as HIStory Continues – separately rather than couple it with a best - of disc , a lot more people would be praising it today .
I still think “ Stranger in Moscow ” is one of the best songs the guy ever did , and if you ’ve ever been sympathetic to the plight of a young boy growing up in the spotlight and never getting a chance to be a kid , then the song and video for “ Childhood ” just might make you tear up … like it ’s doing to me right now .
But I ’ve got to be honest : Michael ’s last studio album , 2001 ’s Invincible , did n’t do a whole lot for me ( “ You Rock My World ” and “ Butterflies ” excepted ) , and I ’ve spent most of the last five years doing nothing but criticizing the guy for not doing everything in his power to mount a comeback .
Back in 2004 , Michael released his poorly named Ultimate Collection – a seemingly random selection of singles , album tracks , rarities , demos , and previously unreleased material from the vaults – and I took him to task for it .
“ With everything he ’s gone through in his personal life in recent years , ” I said , “ what he really needs far more than anything else is to kick - start his musical credibility .
The perfect way to do that would ’ve been to put together a definitive collection of all of his hits , spread out across as many discs as it takes to do the job properly … and I ’m talking somebody - shake - the - cobwebs - off -‘ Farewell My Summer Love ’ definitive . ”
But he did n’t .
In 2005 , he announced that he was busy producing an all - star charity single called “ I Have A Dream ” to help raise relief funds for victims of Hurricane Katrina .
But he never released it .
And when the 25th anniversary of his most iconic album rolled around , he celebrated the event not by taking the opportunity to release a new album but , rather , to drag a bunch of newer artists into the studio to either remix or re-record songs from Thriller .
At the time , I said …
It ’s clear that Michael Jackson has brought in these younger and – let ’s face it – hipper artists in order to make the statement , “ Hey , world , I ’m still relevant , ” but , as ever , he just does n’t get it .
Nowhere is this more evident than on the DVD that ’s included in this package , which provides the album ’s three iconic videos ( “ Billie Jean , ” “ Beat It , ” and “ Thriller ” ) , along with the performance of “ Billie Jean ” from the “ Motown 25 ” television special that serves as the 1980s version of the Beatles on “ The Ed Sullivan Show . ”
He did n’t need to bring in a bunch of young upstarts ; all he had to do was take this DVD and the original nine - song CD version of Thriller , hold them aloft , and say , “ This is why you should respect me ! ”
But he did n’t .
What hurts the most about Michael dying now is that , finally , it looked like he was going to get off his arse and do something about reclaiming his legacy as a superstar of pop .
He had these sold - out dates in the UK , and for once , despite all of the false starts he ’d offered over the course of the last half - decade , it looked like he was actually going to come back .
And , then , he was gone .
I found out about Michael ’s death just as I was walking out the door to take my three - year - old daughter along with me to the grocery store .
She was already in the car , in fact , so when I went outside and got behind the wheel , I felt obliged to tell her why I ’d taken so long .
I said , “ Michael Jackson died , sweetie .
That ’s why I ’m a little upset . ”
“ You liked him ? ” she asked .
“ I did , ” I replied .
“ He was one of Daddy ’s favorite singers . ”
Then I hesitated for a second and clarified , “ Well , maybe he was n’t one of my favorite singers .
But he was very , very important to me and Mama .
We listened to him all the time when we were growing up .
And that ’s why we ’re sad . ”
And , then , my daughter – God bless her – put the whole thing in perspective by asking a single question : “ But you can still listen to his music , right ? ”
Absolutely right .
And that ’s why , when we sat down to dinner at the Harris household tonight , we did so listening to Thriller .
Goodbye , Michael .
Thanks for the memories … and the music .
There are fears of drought if the rains are patchy Indian officials say that monsoon rains in the country are likely to be " below normal " triggering off fears about crop failure and high food prices .
Forecasters say that rainfall is likely to be lower than predicted in April , when they said it would be near normal .
The government says there is no need for panic , and that heavy rains in July are likely to avert a drought .
A heat wave is sweeping the country and rains are delayed in many parts .
Rains usually last from June to September .
" It [ the monsoon ] is late , " federal minister Prithviraj Chavan told reporters .
North - west India appeared to be worst affected by the slow rains with only 81 % rains forecast .
Critical Monsoon rains are critical to India 's farm prospects , which account for a sixth of economic output .
Up to 70 % of Indians are dependent on farm incomes , and about 60 % of India 's farms depend on rains .
Irrigation networks are dismissed by critics as inadequate .
The summer rains are crucial to crops such as rice , soybean , sugarcane and cotton .
The Indian media has been full of reports about the patchy rains so far .
A heat wave is scorching the country " Praying for rain , bracing for worst " headlined the Hindustan Times on its front page on Wednesday .
The newspaper said that in at least eight states , monsoon rains so far had been 60 to 90 % below normal .
" There is concern but no worry as yet .
There is still time , " Farm Secretary T Nanda Kumar told the newspaper .
One analyst said delay in the rains in some parts of India could hit economic growth .
" Delay in monsoon will play the spoilsport and may hit GDP by at least 1 to 1.5 percentage points , " stockbroker VK Sharma , told the Reuters news agency .
Economists agree that the delay will cause further stress in a country where food prices are already high .
" The delay is not a good signal .
Food prices are already high and any delay could push food prices higher .
Food price inflation could emerge as a concern , " said DK Joshi , principal economist at credit ratings agency Crisil .
Politicians in many states are holding special prayers for the rains - the farm minister in central Chhattisgarh state held a prayer for the state to get rains soon .

Tehran 's demonstrators rose up by themselves .
But the technology that helped them organize – and helped them connect with the rest of the planet – was funded in part by the U.S. government .
Early in the pro-democracy protests , everyone made a big deal out of the State Department 's call to Twitter , asking the short - messaging firm to reschedule maintenance so the Iranian opposition movement could keep communicating .
In retrospect , that might have been one of least meaningful moves an American agency made on the activists ' behalf .
More important , it now appears , are the millions of dollars invested over the years in technologies that could pry open the Iranian firewall – and avoid the Supreme Leader 's web censors .
" Our goal was to promote freedom of speech for Iranians to communicate with each other and the outside world .
We funded and supported innovative technologies to allow them to do this via the Internet , cell phones and other media , " former State Department Iran democracy program coordinator David Denehy tells Eli Lake of the Washington Times .
Forget the driven - by - DC mock - populism and the all - too - clever schemes ; this is how America should be promoting democracy abroad .
Give activists the tools – and then let them decide how and when to use 'em .
The Broadcasting Board of Governors ( BBG ) , which oversees the Voice of America and the Farsi - language Radio Farda , has a three - person anti-censorship team that focuses on China and Iran .
" Iran has a growing audience of young activist Internet users and we have repurposed our tools to work in Farsi and make it available to Iranians , " BBG 's Ken Berman says .
" We open up the channels so the Iranian blogosphere is more accessible to Iranians in Iran . "
One of those projects : design the Firefox Web browser to embed the TOR network .
That 's the " onion router " anonymous surfing service , which throws off the Supreme Leader 's online goons by " distributing your transactions over several places on the Internet , so no single point can link you to your destination , " the project 's site explains .
" The idea is similar to using a twisty , hard - to - follow route in order to throw off somebody who is tailing you — and then periodically erasing your footprints .
Instead of taking a direct route from source to destination , data packets on the Tor network take a random pathway through several relays that cover your tracks so no observer at any single point can tell where the data came from or where it 's going . "
" There are plenty of programs political dissidents can use to route their Internet traffic through third parties and escape censorship and avoid monitoring , " one know - it - all blogger tells Lake .
" But TOR is different because it is an encrypted network of node after node , each one unlocking encryption to the next node .
And because of this , it is all but impossible for governments to track Web sites a TOR user is visiting .
TOR is a great way to give Ahmadinejad 's Web censors headaches . "
That onion routing approach was originally developed by the Naval Research Lab and by Darpa , the Pentagon 's leading science and technology arm .
UPDATE : * Slate 's Farhad Manjoo , on the other hand , thinks all this tech has actually made it easier for the regime to repress the activists .
" On Wednesday , a reader alerted the Lede * to an Iranian government Web site called Gerdab.ir , where authorities had posted pictures of protesters and were asking citizens for help in identifying the activists .
That 's right — the regime is now using crowd - sourcing , one of the most - hyped aspects of Web 2.0 organizing , against its opponents .
If you think about it , that 's no surprise .
Who said that only the good guys get to use the power of the Web to their advantage ? "

Renters caught up in foreclosure face a tangle of often unreachable banks and fears of losing their security deposits along with their homes .
For Ms. Barnes and Mr. Letriz , foreclosure was terrifying , beginning with the eviction notice .
“ I thought , ‘ Oh , my God , I ’m going to be out on the street with my kids , ’ ” said Ms. Barnes , 30 , a mother of two who is studying to be a nurse .
Then in December , Fannie Mae notified her that it would temporarily halt evictions , and planned to extend leases to renters until it sold the foreclosed buildings .
Freddie Mac adopted a similar policy in March .
Though Ms. Barnes still does not have a lease , the company ’s promises have eased the stress on her family .
She has not paid the rent since receiving the eviction notice in September , but said she was ready to resume payments as soon as she got a lease .
She laughed mildly over some of the house ’s maintenance problems , including a rotting front step .
“ I told my kids it ’s a go , ” she said .
“ No more being sick from worry .
Plans can be made now  no more what ifs . ”

Mr. Letriz , 39 , has had no such reprieve .
With a degenerative disc disorder that requires him to use a walker , Mr. Letriz is on disability leave from his job as an assistant dean at Yale College .

I 'd sit with Rosa Parks for the right to take a bus .
I 'd march with Martin Luther King for the right to vote .
I 'd probably even take up arms with Nelson Mandela for the right to be a citizen in my own land .
But there 's no way I 'd go to court with Trevor Phillips for the right to join a party that would want to expel me and my family from the country .
Of all the equality issues to be taking a stand on , surely this must be the most ridiculous ever conceived .
On Tuesday the Equality and Human Rights Commission , which Phillips chairs , wrote to the British National party over " possible breaches of anti-discrimination law " .
The commission says it " thinks " the BNP 's constitution and membership criteria " may discriminate on the grounds of race and colour " .
It thinks ?
In case it had n't noticed , the BNP 's own constitution says the party 's membership is " strictly defined " within " the legal ambit of a defined ' racial group ' this being ' Indigenous Caucasian ' and defined ' ethnic groups ' emanating from that Race " .
This is consistent with its stated mission , to represent the " collective National , Environmental , Political , Racial , Folkish , Social , Cultural , Religious and Economic interests of the indigenous Anglo - Saxon , Celtic and Norse folk communities of Britain and those we regard as closely related and ethnically assimilated " .
Is the BNP ­racist ?
Well , is the Pope Catholic ?
I 'm all for taking action to counter these bigots – restricting the BNP 's ability to spread its message of hate and banning its members from public service roles such as teachers and police .
But what would the commission 's course achieve ?
If the BNP wins the case , it gains masses of publicity , is able to claim it has seen off the PC brigade – and Nick Griffin 's smirk and his odious propaganda will be all over the media .
If the commission wins , the BNP gains masses of publicity and can bemoan an oppressive PC brigade – and Nick Griffin 's smirk and his odious propaganda will be all over the media .
Even if the BNP agrees to amend its membership rules before the case goes to court , it will be reported that the party has done the " decent " thing – giving more weight to Griffin 's ludicrous , though worryingly effective claim that his is a respectable and legitimate party .
And what will the commission have gained from all of this ?
The right for black or Asian people to join a party which spreads fear and hatred about them ; which claims they can never be British ; and which wants , ultimately , to repatriate them .
Who does Phillips think will be signing up ?
Turkeys , you really can vote for Christmas .
These are worrying times .
The BNP is filling a vacuum which other parties , especially Labour , created by running after middle England 's votes while ignoring the working classes .
Among large swaths of the population it is no longer shameful to speak up for the BNP , and the party has been helped by the useful idiots fighting their corner in arguments over free speech .
Would these people – most of whom have no understanding of what it 's like to be the victim of race discrimination – have backed Hitler ?
Do they not see that blaming minorities for social and economic problems appeals to a gut instinct that is not easily overcome by learned arguments ?
Above all , publicity , and the sense that others think like you , is what drives support for these groups .
Rightly or wrongly , the BNP is a legal party – and its membership rules are true to its core philosophy .
The last thing we want is to needlessly martyr it or give it a respectability it does n't deserve .
The commission must call off its action before granting Griffin and his cronies any more photo - opportunities .
PEORIA , Illinois ( Reuters ) -
An accused sleeper agent for al Qaeda labeled an “ enemy combatant ” and held in isolation in a U.S.
Navy brig for six years pleaded guilty in court on Thursday to a terrorist conspiracy charge .
Suspected al Qaeda operative Ali al - Marri is seen in this undated photograph released to Reuters on January 6 , 2009 .

Ali al - Marri , a 43 - year - old with dual citizenship in Qatar and Saudi Arabia , could face up to 15 years in prison depending on whether U.S. District Court Judge Michael Mihm gives him credit for time served at sentencing on July 30 .
Marri pleaded guilty to conspiracy to provide material support to al Qaeda .
A second charge of providing material support for terrorism will be dropped based on a plea agreement that was finalized only minutes before Thursday ’s hearing , Marri ’s attorney said .
“ The government would liked to have taken this to trial but I believe it was the right move for all , ” Marri ’s attorney Andrew Savage told reporters .
“ Without a doubt , this case is a grim reminder of the seriousness of the threat we as a nation still face , ” said Attorney General Eric Holder .
“ But it also reflects what we can achieve when we have faith in our criminal justice system . ”
U.S. authorities said Marri had his first contacts with al Qaeda in 1998 and learned terror “ tradecraft ” through 2001 at the group ’s military training camps in Pakistan .
There he met Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the accused mastermind of the September 11 terror attacks , who directed him to meet with Mustafa al - Hawsawi , the suspected paymaster for the September 11 attackers .
Hawsawi gave Marri $ 10,000 , they said .
CODED EMAILS
The Justice Department said Marri communicated by email in code with Mohammed , whom he referred to as “ Muk ” while calling himself “ Abdo , ” and provided progress reports on his efforts to enter the United States .
Marri arrived with his family on a student visa on September 10 , 2001 , and went to Peoria , where he had previously been a student at Bradley University .
Prosecutors said he did not attend classes and instead used his new laptop computer to do research on cyanide compounds and sulfuric acid with the goal of creating a lethal gas .
They said he also collected information about U.S. dams and tunnels , using a computer program that permits the user to anonymously search websites .
Savage said Marri would “ state unequivocally that he would never engage in any violent actions that would harm an innocent person . ”
Authorities said Marri plotted to follow up the September 11 attacks with chemical or biological assaults and cyber-attacks on the U.S. financial system .
“ Ali al - Marri was an al Qaeda ‘ sleeper ’ operative working on U.S. soil and directed by the chief planner of the 9/11 attacks , ” said Arthur Cummings of the FBI ’s National Security Branch .
“ Al - Marri researched the use of chemical weapons , potential targets and maximum casualties . ”
ORIGINAL CHARGES DROPPED
Marri collected information about how to hack into protected computer systems , and obtained stolen credit card numbers and driver ’s licenses , prosecutors said .
He was originally arrested in Peoria in December 2001 as a material witness in a New York investigation of the September 11 attacks .
Marri was then returned to Peoria and charged with credit card fraud and lying to the FBI .
But the charges were dropped in 2003 and then - President George W. Bush declared him an “ enemy combatant ” and sent him to the Consolidated Naval Brig in South Carolina .
He was held in the military prison without charge and in extreme isolation for nearly six years .
Following a review ordered by President Barack Obama , Marri ’s case was transferred to the U.S. court system , and he was indicted in Illinois in February on terrorism charges .
Some legal experts have said Marri ’s case offered a preview of how the administration plans to deal with more than 200 inmates of the prison in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , if it is closed as planned .
Holder was in Europe earlier this week , seeking help in relocating Guantanamo detainees .

Galactic colonization is likely to be limited by the Fermi Paradox .
Image credit : NASA
( PhysOrg.com ) --
For more than 50 years , many have taken the so - called Fermi Paradox to indicate that the existence of intelligent alien civilizations is an impossibility .
However , a recent re-examination of the paradox points out that , rather than discounting the spread of an intelligent civilization , the Fermi Paradox merely points out that advanced civilizations with exponential growth are unlikely to exist .
Enrico Fermi speculated ( during a lunch break ) that the age of the universe , as well as its size , meant that there should be a number of advanced societies keeping Earth company , in a galactic sense .
Growth of these civilizations would be exponential , Fermi implied , and therefore if they existed , we would have encountered them already .
Ergo , advanced alien societies must not exist , since their expansion has n't brought them into the range of our detection .
A new take on the Fermi Paradox , though , changes the equation a bit .
At Pennsylvania State University , two scientists suggest that the key to the paradox is the assumption that civilizations would colonize the universe at an exponential rate .
Jacob Haqq - Misra and Seth Baum point out that finite resources preclude exponential expansion .
Technology Review offers a look at the problem of exponential growth :
" The problem is that this kind of growth may not be possible , and they look at Earth as an example .
For any expansion to be sustainable , the growth in resource consumption cannot exceed the growth in resource production .
And since Earth 's resources are finite , and it has a finite mass and receives solar radiation at a constant rate , human civilization cannot sustain an indefinite , exponential growth . "
This means that , if we decide to colonize our galaxy , Earth 's civilization will be unable to do so at an exponential rate .
If you apply the realities of Earth to possible alien civilizations , then it becomes much more likely that there are other advanced societies out there .
Like Earth , though , they are limited in their expansionary capabilities .
Perhaps there are thousands of alien societies out there , just trying to effectively colonize their moons or settle on planets in their solar systems .
It is possible that , if that is the case , the question of existence of intelligent alien life may not be answered in our life times .

In the 1960s and '70s , scientists linked blood cholesterol with heart disease and gave eggs a bad rap .
More recent studies have found that saturated and trans fats in a diet are more likely to raise heart disease risk .
An egg has only 1.6 grams of saturated fat , compared with about 3 grams in a cup of 2 per cent milk .
At 213 milligrams of cholesterol , one egg slips under the recommendation of no more than 300 milligrams a day .
Just watch the cholesterol levels in the other food you eat that day .
3. Myth : Cancer can not be prevented .
As many as 50 per cent or more of cancer deaths are caused by social and environmental conditions and unhealthy choices , according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention .
In general , you can help your body prevent cancer if you quit smoking , avoid second - hand smoke , avoid drinking too much alcohol , avoid weight gain , eat five or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day , eat a low - fat diet and be physically active .
4. Myth : Shaved hair grows back faster , coarser and darker .
A 1928 clinical trial compared hair growth in shaved patches to growth in nonshaved patches .
The hair that replaced the shaved hair was no darker or thicker , and did not grow in faster , according to Indiana University School of Medicine researchers who debunked seven commonly held medical beliefs in a 2007 report .
When hair first comes in after being shaved , it grows with a blunt edge on top .
Over time , the blunt edge gets worn so it may seem thicker than it actually is .
Hair that 's just emerging can be darker too , because it has n't been bleached by the sun .
Today is the dreaded April 15 , but at least in Oregon it 's even going to cost you more to drown in your tax sorrows .
In their sober unwisdom , the state 's pols plan to raise taxes by 1,900 % on . . . beer .
The tax would catapult to $ 52.21 from $ 2.60 a barrel .
The money is intended to reduce Oregon 's $ 3 billion budget deficit and , ostensibly , to pay for drug treatment .
If it passes , Oregon will overnight become the most taxing state for suds , one - third higher than the next highest beer tax state , Alaska .
The state may do this ...
The health of the alleged thieves will be assessed before the amputation Hardline Islamists have condemned four young Somali men to a double amputation for stealing mobile phones and guns .
They will each have a hand and a leg cut off after being convicted by a Sharia court in the capital , Mogadishu .
The al - Shabab group has carried out amputations , floggings and an execution in the port of Kismayo but such punishments are rare in the capital .
Al - Shabab and its allies control much of southern Somalia and are battling the UN - backed government .
Hundreds of residents attended the hearing in north Mogadishu .
Armed al - Shabab militants were on guard , while the accused were chained around their ankles .
' Too hot to amputate '
Three mobile phones and two assaults rifles were displayed , which the accused had allegedly stolen , reports the AFP news agency .
" The defendants admitted the charges brought against them and were sentenced accordingly .
Each one of them will have his right hand and left leg amputated publicly , " said Judge Sheikh Abdallah al - Haq .
Somali justice - Islamist - style Somali president calls emergency Should troops enter Somalia ?
It is not clear where the leg will be cut .
No date was set for the punishment , which will be carried out after the health of the accused is assessed .
Furthermore , Monday was very hot and the court decided that carrying out an amputation in such conditions could lead the accused to bleed to death .
Amnesty International said the four men had not been given a fair trial .
" We are appealing to al - Shabab not to carry out these cruel , inhuman and degrading punishments , " said Tawanda Hondora , a spokesperson for the human rights group .
" These sentences were ordered by a sham al - Shabab court with no due process or guarantees of fairness . "
The punishments already carried out in Kismayo have shocked many Somalis , who traditionally practise a more tolerant form of Islam .
The transitional government says that al - Shabab has links to al - Qaeda and has brought hundreds of foreign fighters to Somalia .
President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed , a moderate Islamist , has declared a state of emergency and has appealed to Somalia 's neighbours to send troops to help fight the hardliners .

Hong Kong officials said they found traces of cocaine in cans of energy drink Red Bull , Agence France Press reported Tuesday .
The discovery comes days after Taiwanese officials confiscated 18,000 cans of Red Bull .
Officials at the Centre for Food Safety said a laboratory analysis found tiny amounts of the illegal drug in samples of " Red Bull Cola , " " Red Bull Sugar - free " and " Red Bull Energy Drink " , a spokesman told AFP .
Hong Kong has pulled the drink from major supermarkets .
The company responded with a strong denial that traces of the illegal drug had been found .
" It would have been absolutely impossible for Asian ( or any other ) authorities to have found traces of cocaine in Red Bull Energy Drink , " the company said in a statement .
" We believe that Asian authorities mistakenly applied concerns about Red Bull Simply Cola to Red Bull Energy Drink , a completely different product with an entirely different formula . "
" Nevertheless , we had Red Bull Energy Drink product samples from Asia analyzed by an independent and accredited institute and confirmed that Red Bull Energy Drink does not contain any cocaine , " the company said .
Last week , Austria 's health ministry said it found traces of cocaine in samples of Red Bull Cola , but that the traces did not pose a health risk .

Anthony and Colleen Hauser have been clear all along about how they wanted to treat their son's cancer .
Prior to Danny and Colleen 's disappearance the parents told Minnesota Public Radio News that they were building Danny 's immune system .
" The mind can do wonders with the healing of the body when it's in the right setting , " Colleen Hauser said .
" What you need to do is build an immune system and keep him in a good environment so his mind can actually heal his body , " added Anthony Hauser .
Daniel Hauser , 13 , shown here with his father Anthony at their Sleepy Eye home earlier this month .
Daniel and his mother Colleen have fled to avoid court - ordered treatment for Daniel 's Hodgkin 's lymphoma .

Their treatment involved feeding Danny raw green vegetables , fish and vitamins .
That sort of nutritional dosing is some of the treatment the Danny Hauser could be getting in Mexico , according to Diane Miller , with the Minnesota - based National Health Freedom Coalition , a group that promotes access to alternative health treatments .
" A lot of those clinics have chemotherapy but they are in micro-dosing so they have very small amounts , " Miller said .
" They do hyper - thermia treatments .
They do flaxseed oil diets , or the Doctor Clark protocols for parasites or the auto - immune customized vaccinations . "
Most of the cancer clinics in Mexico are in Tijuana , according to Miller , and are often run by American health practitioners who are able to practice their methods away from U.S. regulation .
She said the Hausers are probably deciding what treatment to follow based on their own research .
" And that is what many Americans do , " Miller said .
" They met someone who has been cured of cancer overseas or in a different country or underground in a group of people who use different cancer things .
They find out for themselves how people get better and then they go do that . "
Scientific research shows that alternative therapies , like acupuncture , are effective for conditions like migraines , but not for serious illnesses , like cancer , according to Mary Jo Kreitzer , the director of the Center for Spirituality and Healing at the University of Minnesota .
Daniel Hauser , 13 , has Hodgkin 's lymphoma , but has left his Sleepy Eye , Minn .
home with his mother Colleen rather than undergo court - ordered chemotherapy .

" There are situations like the situation we 're talking about today , " Kreitzer said , " the diagnosis of a very serious childhood cancer where there is a preponderance of evidence that conventional medicine does have a treatment that works that will be effective and there is no evidence that a treatment like acupuncture or an integrative therapy would have a success rate . "
But many in the naturopathic community disagree with that assessment .
They feel the lack of evidence actually reflects a lack of research .
Lise Alschuler recommends pulling from both medical approaches .
Alschuler is the president of the Association of Naturopathic Practioners .
She 's also a naturopathic oncologist who practices in Arizona .
She frequently recommends her cancer patients undergo conventional treatment along with the integrative medicine she prescribes .
But she said some of her patients have decided to go to Mexico for treatment , and they do return feeling better , according to Alschuler .
" They are typically converting people to a really healthful , nutrient dense diet , " Alschuler said .
" But it 's possible to feel well and have a cancer growing rapidly at the same time . "
That 's what happens with some of her patients , but not all .
" I 've also had patients who have come back and have had some reduction with their tumors , even had a couple of patients who had significant reduction with their tumors , " she said .
In all of her patients who visited clinics in Mexico , the tumors eventually returned , Alschuler said .
The internet is playing such a key role in ­getting information out of Iran that attention has focused , once again , on how much Iran controls the internet within its borders .
Iran controls the internet gateways into the country , and in 2006 the government outlawed any connection faster than 128 kbps – until the policy met stiff opposition from business leaders and even members of the Iranian parliament .
It 's easy to point to countries such as Iran , which the Open Net Initiative says maintains some of the most extensive internet controls in the world , while overlooking the increasing filtering and surveillance of the internet in Europe .
Yaman Akdeniz , the director of Cyber - Rights and Cyber - Liberties , spoke at the recent Deutsche Welle Global Media Forum about the increasing number of websites blocked in Turkey .
In 2007 , the Turkish parliament fast - tracked ­legislation to regulate the internet , ­passing the bill in just 59 minutes .
Supporters defended the legislation on the grounds that it would protect children .
In two years , the number of sites blocked went from zero to 2,600 .
But many of the sites being blocked have little to do with protecting children from inappropriate content .
Blogger , Google 's blogging service , was blocked temporarily because one blog was being used to distribute pirated videos of football matches .
Richard Dawkins 's site was blocked over complaints from Turkish creationists , and Turkey is one of a handful of countries in the world that completely blocks YouTube , Akdeniz says .
The Turkish government had asked YouTube to remove videos seen as defamatory to the founder of modern Turkey , Mustafa Kemal Atatürk .
YouTube 's owner , Google , offered to block Turkish users from seeing the offending videos , but the Turkish government demanded the videos be taken down from the global site .
Of course , whether in Iran or Turkey , the filters are ineffectual .
The Turkish government may be able to block YouTube on computers , but they have n't figured out how to block the service on Apple 's iPhone .
But it 's not just on the edge of Europe , in Turkey .
Let 's look to the heart of Europe , to Germany , which has just passed a law to crack down on child ­pornography sites by adding offending sites to a DNS blacklist .
German net activists launched an e-petition opposing the plan .
They needed to get at least 50,000 signatures in six weeks for the petition to be read in parliament , but they needed only three days to get that number .
When the ­petition was closed six weeks later , it had 130,000 signatures , making it the most successful e-petition .
Instead of using filtering technology , the internet community suggested targeting the offending sites .
Using leaked blacklists – such as Germany was proposing – net activists were able to get 60 sites containing child pornography shut down , by contacting international internet service providers , the internet activist and blogger Markus Beckedahl said .
The German government backed down on completely blocking the sites after civil rights and even victims ' rights groups joined internet activists to oppose the plan .
Now , internet users coming to a restricted site will see a ­government warning telling them viewing child pornography is a crime , but the user will still be able to access the site .
Child pornography is an easy target , and it has long been used as a rallying cry by internet censors .
But we often do n't know what is being blocked .
Here in the UK , it is illegal to even look at the list of blocked sites kept by the Internet Watch Foundation .
And while a crackdown on websites makes good headlines , net activists question whether the filtering works or tackles the issue of the exploitation of children .
" Instead of effectively investing time and efforts to have illegal content removed from the internet , the German government is choosing censorship and blocking – an easy and dangerous way out , " says Beckedahl .
Akdeniz told Deutsche Welle , " In a sense , blocking access to these Web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
We just push it off our computer screens — whether in Germany or the United Kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the Internet . "

Conclusion
In 1959 Erving Goffman released The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life ; a book that went on to heavily influence future understanding of social interactions within the sociology discipline .
In it , he discusses social intercourse under the metaphor of actors performing on a stage .
Specifically , in the second chapter he shares the idea of a front and backstage to social interaction .
As with the theater , we have a place where we manage the performance and a place where we give that performance .
As social interlocutors engaged in interaction , we are presenting an impression of ourselves to an audience ; we 're acting out a role that requires constant management at the whim of the interaction .
The front stage is the grounds of the performance .
The backstage is a place we rarely ever want to reveal to others , it contains the truth to our construction and to reveal it would be to defraud our identity in front of the audience - it simply spoils the illusion of where we 're placing ourselves in the interaction .
The narrative of 2007's Portal by Valve Software is grounded heavily in Goffman 's work both in social performance and institutions .
The running of an institution requires a front and backstage .
A restaurant is an institution which has an obvious front and back stage , both in architectural layout and in the management of performance .
A waiter passing through one area to another will shift their presentation accordingly .
In the dining area he will be polite to guests , hold himself strongly and compose himself with great dignity .
Moving into the kitchen though , he is away from the front stage and can loosen his shoulders , yell requests at the chefs and do other despicable acts which would n't be acceptable out in the dining area .
All institutions have a backstage that mask their inner workings .
The events within Portal represent the management of performance used to conceal backstage in a constant tug - of - war battle to have institutional control over the player .
This phenomena is due predominately ( but not restricted to ) the use of language in static dialogue , the following is a critique of how Portal achieves such a task : Portal 's narrative component can be dissected into two key parts ; the static , compulsory narrative ( the relationship between the protagonist and Glados ) and the variable player narrative ( everything else , ie .
the game world ) .
Since the relationship between the player and Glados is purely built on language , we can then derive that Portal 's narrative is constructed by Glados ' dialogue and the game world .
Furthermore , these two narrative components are the two respective devices used to define Aperture Science as an institution ; the tangible and actual institution .
The dialogue provides the language and the game world provides the context .
I think I 've just stepped upon a some kind of axiom here .
Do n't get too caught up in details , let 's flesh this out a little ; The latter part should be fairly clear .
You wake up as an inmate to a landscape that visually portrays itself as an institution , and once the actual institution delivers you a routine ( the first pieces of dialogue ) , the tools in the game world ( portal gun , level design etc. ) allow you to achieve the requested outcome .
Even before that first utterance is spoken the player has a sense of who and where they are , due to the visual , aural and agency clues .
While the player narrative is obviously the game 's largest component ( because it is " the game " ) , it 's only a minor increment of the overarching narrative .
In terms of narrative alone , the game world purely provides the context by characterizing the landscape , telling you that you 've made the transition from visual front to visual backstage of the compound , giving Glados a visual avatar and providing the medium in which the compulsory narrative ( Glados 's dialogue ) can operate - that 's all ..
You 've got the furnishings , the white - wash decor , the building itself and all that jazz .
It 's also the context required to justify the dialogue ( language cannot exist without context ) .
The larger chunk of Portal 's narrative exists in Glados ' dialogue ; language and language only .
While the game world may present the player narrative and set the initial context , it 's Glados ' language that ultimately defines Aperture Science as an institution .
Language is the medium that constructs the institution , it 's front and backstage .
When you go to the supermarket to buy food , the language that is spoken to you ( even if it 's just " twelve dollars fifty " ) defines you as the customer and the checkout chick as the manager of that process within the institution .
The building , food , signage and furnishings are meaningless to the key construct .
They 're just props that aid in institutionalizing yourself as the customer , as the portal gun , turrets and elevators aid in institutionalizing you as a convict .
In Portal , Glados defines your position , she states your role and no outcome within the game will occur until you obey her instructions .
Her dialogue and your reception of that dialogue is the actual institution .
That is , until the point where you intentionally break her orders .
Therefore , Aperture Science would not operate as an institution if there was no language to define the roles within it .
Now that we 've dissected the game into the two well - defined chunks , I can introduce the intention of this piece .
Today I would like to move away from culture for a moment to critique Portal on the grounds that it is an interactive showcase of how language is used in performances to manage institutional processes .
There is a front stage and a backstage to Aperture Science , and as one progresses the game 's narrative , the institution falters allowing backstage to become front stage .
This is done through the combined use of the game world ( context ) and Glados ' dialogue ( language ) .
The two devices are self reliant , that is language ( compulsory narrative ) , cannot exist without context ( player narrative ) , hence I shall be analyzing how both these tools operate to reach my conclusion .
Paraphrased to length already , there are two parts to Portal 's institution , this essay shall be assessing how Portal deconstructs the actual institution ( part ) .
To do so references need to be made to the tangible institution - one cannot exist without the other .
The player already knows about the deconstruction of the tangible institution as this is presented as the destruction of the physical place at the end of the game , hence explaining this is useless for the essay .
We 're looking at the " invisible " here .
Introduction - Chamber 04 Finally , let 's begin shall we ?
The player wakes up in the Aperture Science compound in a glass chamber alongside a series of objects ; table , radio , ( incubation ) bed and toilet .
The game provides some short breathing room for the player to take in the surroundings and to ponder where exactly they 're located .
Visually , the game presents itself as a holding cell , looking through the glass it 's clear that your being held in an institution of sorts .
The sanitary cleanliness , minimal objects and grey - white washes of colour all set the context of the tangible institution .
These set pieces act as objects to institutionalize your initial role .
Your observations are interrupted by " Hello and , again , welcome to the Aperture Science computer - aided Enrichment Center " .
The utterance confirms your suspicions .
The front stage is set and remains unscathed .
The talk continues as the PA runs through routine precautions when suddenly an electrical fault occurs , sparks fall from the ceiling and bed , the sound sifts , speeds up and then jumps to the next line of script .
We witness some kind of problem occur and the system ( seemingly ) provides quick repair by relaying to the next step .
The repair offers a glimpse of backstage as improvisation occurs .
This is the first flaw in the routine of the institution , and a slight break in the performance .
The previous incident also contains some nuggets of interesting language .
" Hello and , again , welcome to the " suggests that some part of the institutional process ( unknown to the player ) occurred previously .
" Your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin the test proper . "
Again , what specimen and what test ?
The institution is withholding information from us , flaunting it even .
The performance instills a role onto the player of inferiority in an inexplicit manner .
Everything said to the player is also wrapped in the typical , false politeness that one receives in such institutional contexts .
This is of course , a re-occurring theme in the text .
Lastly , we have no knowledge of the identity of the speaker - how did we ever figure out her name was Glados ?
A portal appears and Glados continues to talk rules .
The linear design shuffles you into the next room with a large red button and a box that falls from an overhanging chamber .
The game allows you to fill in the blanks and once it 's done more procedural conversation is projected .
" This Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grid will vaporize any unauthorized equipment that passes through it - for instance , the Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube .
"
The lengthy names and unrelenting reference to official equipment is a trick the writers employ to make fun of institutional processes which usually require the use of official titles in formal interaction .
While there is nothing systematically incorrect with using titles , the elongated names sounds downright silly .
You 'll find that the humour , works as it's own device to ridicule the testing procedure and institution itself .
The humour does n't so much break the performance in the conventional sense ( ie. disobeying assumed norms of interaction ) , rather it illegitimizes the performance .
Therefore , each joke made regarding institutional protocol peels away at the front stage performance .
In the next room ( Chamber 01 ) , the previous joke is repeated to a further extent " Fifteen Hundred Megawatt Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super - Colliding Super Button " .
These two jokes together represent the subtle way in which the writers introduce performance - breaking devices .
In the first instance , we 're introduced to a device ( technique , function , whatever ) and it appears slightly odd in context but negligible , a small flaw .
Later the same device is used to greater effect , increasing the presence of backstage .
The devices work on a continuum of strength , increasing a notch as you climb each storey .
Sometimes these devices will take a back seat and then re-emerge later in the game .
I 'll continue to point there out as we go .
Once you complete the test , the welcoming line " Please move quickly to the chamberlock , as the effects of prolonged exposure to the Button are not part of this test . " hints at backstage knowledge being withheld - that is the effects of prolonged exposure ( another device ) .
On entering Chamber 02 Glados compliments you ( " You 're doing very well ! " ) in an almost patronizing tone , asserting your lesser positions .
The uncertainty of safety surrounding the equipment is further played on : " Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill , which may , in semi-rare cases , emancipate dental fillings , crowns , tooth enamel , and teeth . "
This utterance is a combination of several different techniques .
Firstly we again see the overlaying polite language .
Secondly , the understating of the possibility of danger are standards of institutional talk , yet the consequences are usually kept behind doors .
In this case , they 're said out in the open , with full brutality , instilling a weary sense of fear .
The game occasionally waves around such information , because it acts to lesser you to ( in this case ) the risks .
A proper institution would n't dare put participants in such a position of risk , yet here it is done and presented as " normal " .
Placing the protagonist where they probably do n't wish to be .
Once you obtain the portal gun , similar jokes are made regarding the safety of the device , before another electrical cut out .
This time there is no immediate repair , the device ( power out ) has moved along the scale to greater effect , more cracks are showing .
The repetition confirms the worry that something is awry behind the scenes .
Occurs once , okay , occurs twice , perhaps not .
More humour in Chamber 03 with Glados making mention of the " Aperture Science Bring Your Daughter to Work Day " stating that it " is the perfect time to have her tested . "
Jokes aside , this message suggests something about the origins of the organisation .
Something relating to the testing of females .
Certainly falls in line with the female protagonist .
Again , crucial background information withheld .
We still have no clue as to why we 're taking these orders and completing the exercises , reinforcing your position as the unwilling participant .
Chamber 04 features some encouraging words .
Glados also states that the next room wo n't be monitored .
Makes you consider how they 're monitoring you , eh ?
By now the player has probably noticed the translucent windows with the desk on the other side and may have connected the dots .
The security cameras similarly may also be monitoring your actions .
Both instruments institutionalize your role , they 're unknowns , inaccessible information which insinuate paranoia .
They are elements of the front stage that feed information to the back .
Chamber 05 - Chamber 10
In Chamber 05 Glados says " As part of a required test protocol , our previous statement suggesting that we would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication . " which again has several functions .
Firstly , the actual institution mislead you outright and by later informing you of this , it only pushes you further into a position of unwilling submission .
Secondly it continues to break any faith that you might have had of the institution .
On the other hand , this utterance could be interpreted as a mistake on behalf of Aperture Science making it another instance of floundering in the performance .
She then follows " As part of a required test protocol , we will stop enhancing the truth in three , two , one . "
The fact that this is part of some required test protocol unbeknown to yourself only strengthens your role as the submissive inmate .
What would misleading the protagonist have to do with the testing ?
Are these tests somehow psychological ?
The game embeds this initial perception here .
Also what is the intended meaning of " enhancing the truth " ?
Chamber 06 has more darkly humoured , procedural talk regarding safety and concludes with another false complement " Unbelievable !
You
The lack of names points out unintended holes in the performance of the institution , creating a lose of face but at the same time , the utterance is patronizing to the player , giving position and declaring roles .
Chamber 07 and 08 play with safety messages adding a sharp twist of dark humour " Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an ' unsatisfactory ' mark on your official testing record followed by death .
Good luck ! "
The dark humour is created by the dialogue prioritizing the face of the institution over your own well - being and safety .
The two points are two ends of the balancing act that institutions must keep in favourable equilibrium during a performance .
In the case of Portal though the institution puts itself before the patient and while it 's humourous to the player , it serves to subordinate you to the institution , maintaining the front stage and keeping you well away from the back .
" Please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device to enhance your testing experience . "
This last quote is perhaps ultimate submission of the player , the institution does n't just warn of danger , it 's saying that is a part of the routine which you have no control over .
Chamber 09 again teases the player by incorporating decipt into the routine , normalizing it .
Glados alarmingly states " The Enrichment Center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible .
Make no attempt to solve it " and then later ( once you 've solved it ) " Fantastic !
You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism . "
The language here toys with the institutional knowledge gained so far .
You know that if you do n't complete the task , the elevator doors wo n't open and you wo n't be able to proceed into the next area of the exercise .
All of this was taught to you by the exercises of the last 8 levels .
This is perhaps the most powerful technique in the whole game .
It institutionalizes the player by unfairly forcing you to play the part .
By playing your role , you are allowing the actual institution to continue playing their own , in which case , this is a front - stage - strengthening exercise .
The mightier the front stage control , the more control the institution has over the player .
Glados ' speech cuts out again at the entrance of Chamber 10 ( " Hello again .
To reiterate our previous warning :
This test [ garbled ] momentum [ garbled ] " ) .
This device has been used for the third time and is now common place within the performance .
The word momentum is left in as a clue on how to use the portals to solve the next puzzle .
Glados attempts to reiterate a previous warning but again the system cuts out .
Starting with " This test " it seems as though what she tried to convey was a rule previously garbled earlier in the game .
Even " unintentionally " , important information is withheld and the dominant role is unintentionally carried out .
In Chamber 10 , the game breaks more rules of front stage performance by insulting and patronizing the player .
This was negligible before , but due to it 's continual use and exaggeration is now prominent .
It 's first presented as " You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum , or to be more precise , how it does not . " denoting your failure to achieve the requested goal .
Glados then continues the assault by referring to momentum " In layman 's terms , speedy thing goes in , speedy thing comes out . "
The childish use of the word speedy is diminutive of the player .
Honesty that may be harmful to the face of the institution is something never said out in the front stage and usually reserved for backstage chatter .
For instance , you do not insult a customer in a department store to their face , but you may talk jokingly about them with another staff member in the lunch room .
Glados begins to air open honesty towards the protagonist in a way that institutional acts do n't normally permit , we see this subtly crawling between the cracks of politeness .
Chamber 11 - Chamber 16 Rarely is the ' actual instiuition ' discussed , it 's socially destructive .
Unless you 're not conforming to routine , there is no need for a supermarket to declare you as the shopper and themselves as the storefront .
We just subconsciously play the performance of a shopper when entering a supermarket , alerting us of the performance is intrusive and denotes that something is wrong ; someone is either not playing their role or there is an error in the institutional processes .
In Chamber 11 , Glados states the actual institution by way of referring to safety ; " The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment .
In dangerous testing environments , the Enrichment Center promises to always provide useful advice . "
This much should be assumed , so by mentioning it , Glados only conjures up skepticism of the security among the player .
I mean , what reason would there be to state this unless there is some sort of breach ?
The writers play on the gamer 's mentality here .
Glados then delivers another indirect insult " For instance , the floor here will kill you - try to avoid it . "
You obtain the second Portal gun and shortly after Glados continues " As part of an optional test protocol , we are pleased to present an amusing fact : - The Device is now more valuable than the organs and combined incomes of everyone in This cold fact is wrapped in institutional politeness and is a stiff pill to swallow .
To the player it 's no doubt amusing , but in terms of the performance , Glados is now breaking etiquette in a manner that straddles the line .
She is still talking through her teeth , but the inferred meaning only shows us how the use of personal attacks has peaked at this stage .
Not terribly much is said in Chamber 12 , Glados ' voice becomes garbled again and she expresses some childishness is her talk ( " Wheeeeeeeeeeee " ) .
We can see that she 's also losing a professionalism in her performance , she 's becoming more casual with her speech .
All insults thus far have been implicitly delivered .
In Chamber 13 , the barrier is removed " Now that you are in control of both portals , this next test could take a very , VERY , long time . "
Unlike the other jabs , this one loses the politeness .
The dark humour continues with Glados providing excessive amounts of detail to possible situations that should be censored or destated for the patient " If you become light headed from thirst , feel free to pass out . " and " An intubation associate will be dispatched to revive you with peptic salve and adrenaline . "
Afterwards she then reinstates her honesty ( as required by the test protocol ) and out of nowhere shares some emotion " When the testing is over you will be , missed . "
In institutional performance strong emotion ( crying , strong affection ) that could possibly jeopardise the front stage should be suppressed , here the seed is planted .
Although it 's suspicious due to the raised tone of " missed " which sounds artificial .
In Chamber 14 the writers take a few more digs at institutional procedures .
" All subjects intending to handle high - energy gamma leaking portal technology must be informed that they MAY be informed of applicable regulatory compliance issues .
No further compliance information is required or will be provided " Glados then continues to compliment the player , this time more heavily " and you are an excellent test subject !
Very very good .
A complimentary victory lift has been activated in the main chamber . "
This could be interpreted as repair of the prior smattering of insults .
On the other hand , all of the compliments come out forced and sound purposely polite , almost as though Glados is restraining herself .
This scaffolding provides a slight glimpse into the management of her performance , by switching between polite and rude identities we can make out the bones of her performance .
In Chamber 15 Glados attempts to continue repair of front stage by personalizing the procedure " Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test . " , only to defy this by making clear the intentions of the institution " Thank you for helping us help you help us all .
" At this point the front stage has been lightly damaged and elements of backstage have appeared briefly in each of the chambers so far .
Still , as far as an operating institution , Aperture Science maintains its front quite comfortably .
In Chamber 16 two devices are heavily utilized to open the door to the backstage .
The first is the inclusion of security drones .
While the sludge and laser beams threatened your life before , they were passive devices , so getting injured or dying by either of these was mostly a fault of your own clumsiness .
The drones on the other hand are active agents that seek to harm you , they 're obstacles that must be dealt with to proceed .
They justify the sinister undertones of language that have underlined the talk so far , and force the player to consider the motives behind the institution since they [ the drones ] are featured so prominently in the player narrative .
Shortly into the exercise you 'll notice two cubes wedged into an opening which reveals the first visual backstage .
Inside are messages scribbled on the wall such as " The cake is a lie " and " I 'm watching you " with respective pictures of a cake and security camera .
" Help ! " is also marked on the floor by the opening .
Advancing to the next segment of the floor reveals a pile of cubes , a radio and some other utensils lying around discarded .
Both are well unkept .
The visual state of the front stage is proper confirmation of the situation at hand .
Instead of a few suspicions caught in your head , it 's now much more serious .
Add to this to frightening messages scribbled in the visual front stage and the game begins to affirm the sinister undertones as well .
Glados ' text only acts to reinforce the sinisterness of what 's witnessed in the player narrative .
She first apologise for the inconvenience and then casts your role again in the last part of this line ; " Well done , android .
The Enrichment Center once again reminds you that android hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance . "
Now the front stage is well and truly falling apart as the sinister intentions are becoming more evident .
Chamber 17 - Backstage RevealChamber 17 is all about the companion cube ; a device used to heighten the psychological undertones instilled by the institution .
Glados first assigns a series of mental conditions as symptoms possibly contracted by using the cube .
" The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are superstition , perceiving inanimate objects as alive , and hallucinations .
" She then consoles you to believe that the cube wo n't threaten to stab you , nor can it speak , implying that you may have thought otherwise , suggesting the protagonist is insane / delusional .
She then encourages you to disregard the cube 's talk if it does indeed talk - further suggestion .
After de-humanizing the cube she begins to personalize it in order to bridge affection between player and cube .
She asks you to " escort " the cube , that you must " euthanize " it , she labels it as a " faithful companion " that does n't wish to " burden you " and finally that the cube will feel no pain from the process .
We see that she initially hints that the player may be mentally insecure , then goes to the effort of creating a personal attachment to the cube before concluding by reminding the player about mental instability " You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record .
Congratulations . "
This last statement ties the player to the cube , to the sickness .
The aim of her technique here is to link the player to mental instability through use of the cube ( both in language and game world ) .
Of course , the technique is an obvious failure since the player does not feel any strong personal attachment to the cube to the point of mental instability .
It 's a hole in the performance , but one I doubt many players realized due to the layers of implementation .
In Chamber 19 Glados ' performance falters by stating that " The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked and then there will be cake . "
Her words are the actual truth ; the institution later attempts to cook you alive , Glados reveals the intentions and delivers backstage directly .
She continues the safety jokes and normalizing of the institution by spruiking additional safety seminars to the player ( " For more information , please attend an Enrichment Center Electrical Safety seminar . " ) .
Upon reaching the end of the exercise , the player is on a direct course , destined for an open furnace .
Glados continues to place the organisation over the player 's safety " All Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4000 degrees Kelvin . " and " Rest assured that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous equipment malfunction prior to your victory candescence . "
Institutions avoid the sticky end of business where possible , which explains why this part of the procedure was never mentioned before - it 's awkward .
How does Glados explain that you 're now to be killed while maintaining a believable front ?
Even while the player is being escorted to the flames , she makes no word of it .
The player escapes ( maybe after dying some ) by portalling to the platform above , turning the whole game on its head .
The fire reveals the hidden intentions that you were to be killed at the end of the exercise .
Of course , at this point , the institution is exposed .
The front is now the back and it's impossible to repair the situation once the performance has been defrauded .
The analysis up to this point has looked at how Glados ' performance has attempted to maintain and impose front stage control .
Now , after having the front stage pulled from under her , we look at how Glados is trying to buy back the front stage .
At first Glados expresses her disbelief and responds with a knee - jerk reaction " What are you doing ?
Stop it !
I.. I. .
We are pleased that you made it through the final challenge where we pretended we were going to murder you . "
She slips up and begins to talk on behalf of herself , before quickly trying to maintain institutional control by pretending the escape is part of the routine .
Her tone says otherwise , expressing restraint and urgency .
She then uses compliments and the prospect of a party to persuade the player to conform to her demands , leveraging all that she has left .
The player then begins to explore the visual backstage which portrays many things such as semi- build turrets , the mechanical process that levitate platforms , storage , exists , air vents , the back offices and even returns back into one of the earlier levels .
Glados can no longer monitor you in these areas and her dialogue represents that struggle of control .
" Hello ? / Where are you ? / I know you 're there .
I can feel you here ./ Hello ?/ What are you doing ?/ You have n't escaped , you know . / You 're not even going the right way . / Hello ? / Is anyone there ?
" You 're now a deviant that has been given control .
Glados begins to plead with the player , she 's desperate to return to procedure .
" Okay .
The test is over .
You win .
Go back to the recovery annex .
For your cake .
It was a fun test and we 're all impressed at how much you won .
The test is over .
Come back . "
She then tries to persuade by leveraging the cake " Uh oh .
Somebody cut the cake .
I told them to wait for you , but they did it anyway .
There is still some left , though , if you hurry back . " and then attempting to convince the player that they 're lost " You 're not even going the right way .
Where do you think you 're going ?
Because I do n't think you 're going where you think you 're going .
" She then vouches for affection , playing the previous incident off as a joking charade " Remember when the platform was sliding into the fire pit and I said ' Goodbye ' and you were like ' No way ' and then I was all ' I was just pretending to murder you ' ?
That was great ! "
In fact she goes through a whole manner of techniques to gain her role back , but fails every time .
When it all becomes too much , she digs deep into the backstage and shares her deepest opinions " You 're not a good person .
You know that , right ?/
Good people do n't end up here ./ Can you hear me ?/ This is your fault .
It did n't have to be like this .
/ I 'm not kidding now .
Turn back or I will kill you ./ I 'm going to kill you and all the cake is gone .
" This is the first instance where the backstage is completely unveiled to the player , Glados can not retreat from here .
In fact , Portal now begins to go beyond Goffman 's specialization .
The player has travelled from front to backstage and from backstage , right into the psychology of the antagonist .
Her words transcend the socially accepted and are pure evil .
Unlike everything leading up to this part of the dialogue , the institution is now gone , destroyed .
Glados is no longer scrambling for front stage , these utterances admit defeat and all of the dialogue that precedes has no adherence to the institution .
All further performance is unrelated to the institution .
In the final chamber , the " boss battle " if you like , Glados 's performance attempts to convince the player to a ) not attack her b ) die .
For this reason , we have finished the analysis , as the instuition is gone .
Portal is a game fragmented into two slices , with each slice aiding in the delivery of narrative .
What we can draw from the lengthy ( but necessary ) analysis is how through the use of both language and it's required context , a performance is created and maintained by the antagonist , and used to tell a metaphoric tale of a power struggle of identity roles within an institution .
We see this through the flaws in performance , that break down the front stage allowing the player to witness parts of the back .
From there the process concludes and the institution 's intents are revealed .
and then undermined which result in complete destruction of the institution and a desperate scramble for performance control .

This Thursday at 6 pm , we ’ll be doing the very first Lambda Lounge Language Shootout !
Everyone is working on a version of a Vending Machine problem in different languages and we ’ll be looking through the code from everyone ’s examples .
At this point it looks like there are people actively working on examples in the following languages at least :
Clojure
Ruby
Fan
Groovy
Haskell
Python
Perl 5
Should be a blast !
Coming up in the next few months we already have a fantastic line - up of talks and speakers :
June – rich client development with JRuby ( Mario Aquino ) and a Haskell overview ( Alex Stangl )
July – metaprogramming in Groovy ( Jeff Brown ) and a Fan overview ( Scott Bale )
August – Perl : Not Dead Yet ( Matt Follett ) and Haskell ’s STM ( Aditya Siram )
Lots of tasty language goodness there .
If you ’re in St. Louis ( or even if you ’re not ) , feel free to stop by and get your lambda on .
One of the biggest recent breakthroughs in stem cell research is the ability to reprogram non-stem cells into stem cells using genetic engineering .
The hitch with this technique is that genetic engineering like this can have side effects : stem cells produced in this way can turn into tumors in mice ( and presumably humans , but we have n't tried that yet ) .
And thus researchers have been looking for ways to reprogram stem cells without genetic engineering .
One promising way to do this is to use chemicals that can mimic the effects of the genes typically used for reprogramming .
( The jargon for these genes is ' reprogramming factors ' - who says technical jargon has to be opaque ? )
The trick is finding these chemicals .
If you watch 20 /20 or read the magazines in the A&P checkout line , you may be under the impression that this should be an easy task , since it seems like we 're swimming in hormone - mimicking chemicals that leach out of just about everything , from zip - loc bags to water bottles to the box your Big - Mac came in .
It is true that there are a lot of chemicals out there with bioactive properties , but to find chemicals with the right reprogramming properties is not trivial .
The biggest problem is developing a quick way to test hundreds of thousands of chemicals .
Determining whether you 've got a batch of stem cells in your petri dish is difficult and time consuming ; you can't just drop your chemical on a sample of cells and see whether you 've got stem cells there in the morning .
Doing the requisite testing for one chemical would be laborious ; doing it for thousands of chemicals ( at various doses to boot ) is impossible .
A group of researchers based primarily at the Scripps Research Institute and MIT has come up with a a clever way to find those chemicals that can reduce or eliminate the need to genetically modify the cells that are to be reprogrammed into stem cells .
The scientists used what is known as a ' reporter gene ' system to quickly identify which chemicals have the biological activity to replace a stem cell reprogramming gene .
It works like this : the reprogramming gene the researchers were interested in replacing is called Klf4 .
Klf4 turns on another gene called Nanog .
What you want is a chemical that can ( among other things ) turn on Nanog without the need for Klf4 .
To know quickly whether the Nanog gene has been flipped on , you hook up the regulatory DNA surrounding the Nanog gene and hook it up to an easily detectable gene , such as one the fluoresces or otherwise lights up .
( It 's easy to detect light ; it 's much harder to detect mRNA . )
That way , if Nanog gets switched on , your light - generating gene also gets turned on , and all you have to do is look for cells that are lit up .
So the researchers made a reporter gene system that was responsive to things that turn on Nanog , and tested their library of chemicals on a cell line harboring the reporter gene .
Any chemical that caused the cells to light up was subjected for more extensive testing to determine whether that chemical could in fact functionally replace the reprogramming factor Klf4 .
Using this reporter gene strategy , the researchers were able to narrow down their list of 500,000 chemicals to just 135 that seemed like promising Klf4 replacements .
As is typically the case , these 135 chemicals fell primarily into three different classes : flavones , lysergamides , and paullones .
This is a key result , since once you have an idea of which class of chemicals is going to give you the biological effect you want , you can focus your resources on finding ( or designing ) an optimized drug within that class of chemicals , one with much more effective properties than the initially discovered compound .
The researchers found that one chemical in particular , kenpaullone , was able to work well for reprogramming stem cells , although not as well as the original genetic factor , Klf4 .
But with a lead compound in hand , the researchers can begin working on finding a more efficient variant of kenpaullone .
One possiblity to keep in mind is that no single drug may be able to replace a single reprogramming gene ; however , drug treatment is easy ( and genetic engineering is hard ) .
Scientists want to reprogram with as few foreign genes as possible , but there is no such limitation on drugs .
If it ultimately takes 10 drugs to replace the 4 reprogramming factors , that 's OK .
The ultimate goal is to be able to make stem cells using only drugs .
Drug delivery is still a much , much more efficient process than genetic engineering ; if we want to reprogram stem cells with ease , drug treatment is a promising way to go .

A Reply to Bryan Caplan 's Essay " The Anarcho - Statists of Spain : An Historical , Economic , and Philosophical Analysis " by Iain McKay Also titled : " Objectivity and Right - Libertarian Scholarship " For general information on Anarchist Theory , see the
Anarchism FAQ File
1. Introduction
In his essay , Caplan decides to expose the secret statist nature of the Spanish Anarchist movement .
He states that " many discussions of the Spanish Civil War overlook , minimize , or apologize for the atrocious behavior and tyrannical aspirations of perhaps the most powerful faction of Spanish Republicans : the Anarchist movement . "
It is , of course , true that some anarchists in Spain did act in atrocious ways and in non- ( even anti - ) anarchist ways .
However , things are quite different from what Caplan claims in many cases .
This rebuttal will indicate where Caplan 's biases lie and show how they undermine the objectivity of the evidence he selects and presents .
In so doing , I shall indicate that Caplan 's " analysis " is lacking and that his thesis is wrong in all its major conclusions .
I shall make points in line with his headings and will concentrate on the parts with which I disagree and present evidence that disproves his claims .
This means that many of his statements are apparently " ignored , " but only in the sense we do not wish to quote extensively just to state " we agree with this . "
Like all myths , Caplan's " analysis " does contain elements of truth .
However , as will be proved , in the end his case falls apart in light of all the facts .
In producing this critique of Caplan 's work , I was reminded of the following words by Albert Meltzer :
" The fact is that Liberal - Democracy seldom voices any arguments against Anarchism as such -- other than relying on prejudice -- because its objections are purely authoritarian and unmask the innate Statism and authoritarianism of liberalism .
Nowadays conservatives like to appropriate the name " libertarianism " to describe themselves as if they were more receptive to freedom than socialists .
But their libertarianism is confined to keeping the State out of interfering in their business affairs .
Once anarchism makes it plain that it is possible to have both social justice and to dispense with the State they are shown in their true colours .
Their arguments against State socialism and Communism may sound ' libertarian ' , but their arguments against Anarchism reveal that they are essentially authoritarian .
That is why they prefer to rely upon innuendo , slanders , and false reporting , which is part of the establishment anti-anarchism , faithfully supported by the media . "
[ _Anarchism : Arguments for and against_ ]
Unfortunately , Caplan 's work proves his point .
I hope to prove that Caplan 's wrote is mostly false reporting , based upon selective presentation of evidence in order to paint a radically false picture of the Spanish Anarchist movement .
In this I think that Caplan is more motivated by ideology than by objectivity .
For example , when discussing the activities of Spanish Anarchists he constantly takes those anarchists who act in non-libertarian ways as " typical " and so ignores the vast majority who did stick to their principles - for example , he seems to consider that the few anarchists who committed assassinations after July 19th , 1936 , as more typical of Spanish Anarchism than the many others who did not commit murders .
This in itself suggests that his " case " is somewhat lacking , but I suppose its easier to concentrate on the few who " make the headlines " than the majority who spent their time creating collectives , at the front or spent their time educating others about the need for freedom and cooperation and what anarchism is .
Also , before going on , I will state here that I oppose the CNTs decision to collaborate with the government against the greater evil of fascism .
I agree with the vast majority of anarchist writers on this subject that the first and greatest mistake of the spanish anarchist movement was the mistaken belief that they could work with one side of capitalism ( the democratic state ) against another ( fascism ) .
As the history of the compromise proves , the struggle against fascism is best achieved by also fighting the system that created it ( capitalism ) .
The real alternative facing the CNT - FAI was not " the war or the revolution " but " revolutionary war or defeat " .
Finally , I dedicate this to all individuals who desire a free society and who do not blind themselves with ideology when looking at the past or at the present .
Liberty requires a mind free from ideology and so with the ability to think for itself .
2. History and the Spanish Anarchists
A. The Militants and Terror
Caplan starts with the following : " In July of 1936 , officers throughout Spain tried to orchestrate a coup detat against the Republican government .
In Catalonia , Aragon , and other areas , Anarchist militants defeated the military uprisings .
Finding themselves more powerful than the regional governments and possibly the central government , the Spanish Anarchists seized the moment to implement some radical changes in those regions of Spain where they had a large following .
" One of these radical changes was to beginning large - scale murders of people believed to be supporters of the Nationalists .
In most cases , these supporters had taken no specific action to assist the Nationalist rebellion ; they were singled out for their beliefs , or what people guessed their beliefs were . "
Firstly , the statement that the anarchist militants " implemented " the radical change of " large - scale murders " of Nationalists is somewhat loaded ( to say the least ) .
This suggests that the CNT - FAI policy was " implemented " at this time and nothing could be further from the truth .
It is commonly agreed by historians that the wave of assassinations that occured in the three months after the uprising was " at bottom a spontaneous movement , corresponding to the necessities of a revolutionary war , where the enemy within may be as dangerous as the enemy outside . "
[ Gerald Brenan , _ The Spanish Labyrinth_ , p. 318 ]
As we note later , all the libertarian organisations officially opposed assassinations and acted to stop them .
Therefore to say that one of the " radical changes " that " Anarchist militants " introduced was " large - scale murder " is simply false .
Yes , * some * anarchist militants took part in assassinations , the vast majority did not .
Notice how Caplan takes the few as " typical " , not the majority .
It should also be pointed out here that the use of the words " large - scale murders " does not present a fair picture of the level of the killings .
In Burnett Bolloten 's book , _ The Grand Camouflage_ , page 41 , Diego Abad de Santillan is quoted as saying :
" It is possible our victory resulted in the death by violence of four or five thousand inhabitants of Catalonia who were listed as rightists and were linked to political or ecclesiastical reaction . "
Given that the population of Catalonia was nearly 3 million in 1936 , a figure of 5 000 deaths hardly amounts to " large - scale " murder by any means .
Perhaps he meant that it was 5 000 too many , in which case I would agree - the assassination of unarmed individuals is not a libertarian act , even in the face of a fascist coup .
However , Caplan 's use of the expression does present a certain mental image to the reader , as intended .
However , to see whether this picture is true or not , it is important understanding in what context and * why * these murders took place otherwise a distinctly * false * image will be created .
As we will prove , these murders occured mostly as acts of revenge by individuals and small groups and as a result of the total breakdown of ' law and order ' .
Perhaps , to get a better picture of the context of the wave of assassinations in Catalonia , we should contrast what occured there with the events in Zaragoza .
Zaragoza , in Aragon , was a CNT stronghold .
The town had 20 000 CNT members .
Unlike the CNT in Barcelona , the CNT believed the words of the Popular Front government and did not arm themselves by direct action .
The solid general strike by the CNT failed and the fascists used the city 's Bull rings to organise the murder of 3 000 anti-fascists , mostly CNT members .
Franco 's regime was backed by capitalists inside and outside Spain .
In other words , the forces supported by capitalists murdered almost as many people * in one town * as the armed population did in the whole of Catalonia .
After Franco won the civil war , he murdered tens of thousands more ( probably hundreds of thousands ) and produced a nation into which capitalists happily invested .
As capitalists have discovered across the world , terror is an effective means of ensuring high profits and employer power .
Caplan then quotes Oliver and De Santillan about these murders in which they indicate that they were the result of arming an oppressed population .
He then states that " De Santillan 's comment typifies the Spanish Anarchists ' attitude toward his movement 's act of murder of several thousand people for their political views : it is a mere ' natural phenomenon , ' nothing to feel guilty over . "
However , as noted , De Santillan is pointing out the facts of what happened .
Is he to " feel guility " for actions which members of his organisation commited and which he had no power to stop ?
As one historian points out " Barcelona was convulsed by a wave of random killings " by " execution gangs " some of whom had links to political and union organisations .
[ Benjamin Martin , _ The Agony of Modernization_ , p. 385 ]
According to one eye - witness " The libertarians controlled all the most important ' secretariats ' -- but in reality power lay still in the streets . "
[ _Blood of Spain_ , p. 143 ]
Another states that " There was a deep , very deep wave of popular fury as a result of the military uprising which followed on so many years of oppression and provocation . "
[ Op. Cit. , p . 151 ]
In other words , after years of violent repression by the state and capitalists , in the face of a military uprising , backed by these same elements , which aimed to create a fascist state , many people , * some * of whom were members of libertarian organisations , took the " law " into their own hands .
This accurately sums up the nature of the murders - essentially revenge killings by small groups and individuals , some of whom were members of the anarchist movement .
Caplan , however , ignores this fact and instead suggests that the CNT - FAI organised these deaths ( " his movement 's act of murder " ) while in fact they occured outside of anyones control .
To quote a Basque Nationalist , a Republican and a Catholic on the nature of the terror in Republican Spain :
" Blood , a great deal of innocent blood was shed on both sides .
. .
But the most radical difference as far as the Republican zone was concerned -- which does not justify , but at least explains , the excesses -- lies in the very fact of the [ military ] insurrection .
The army , almost the entire secret police , the administration of justice , whatever police forces there were , whose duty it was to maintain order , revolted , leaving the legal government defendless .
The latter was compelled to arm the people , the jails were opened to release friendly political prisoners , and the common - law criminals who came out with them acted on their own account .
Furthermore , with the stirring up of the lower depths of society , the malefactors that exist in every city , in every nation , came to the surface , and found an easy field for their work .
.
.
Is it surprising that during the first days of the revolt these uncontrolled elements dispensed justice in a rude and elementary fashion , the justice of men who had suffered and had been molded in an atmosphere of hatred ?
All this does not justify the crimes committed in the Republican zone , but it readily explains them . "
[ _ The Spanish Civil War_ , p. 53 ]
In other words , the anarchists can hardly be blamed for the fascist coup and the social breakdown which occured after it , nor for the actions during that time of individual CNT and FAI members acting on their own initiative .
Caplan goes on to claim that " Political belief was not the only kind of heterodoxy which the Spanish Anarchists refused to tolerate . "
This is a strange statement , since members of the UGT , republicans , socialists and communists were not singled out for repression .
The shootings were often motivated by revenge or were murders of supporters of the fascist coup i.e. those who desired to create a totalitarian regime in Spain like those in Italy and Germany .
The Spanish Anarchists were well aware what their fate would have been if the coup had succeeded .
Given this obvious fact , we can state that Caplan 's claim of lack of tolerance for political opinions on the part of the Spanish Anarchist movement is simply false .
In other words , Caplan 's statement is hardly an accurate account of the situation .
The main reason for the many revenge killings can be traced to the many years of capitalist repression of the working class that had preceded the revolution , a period during which bosses and factory owners had routinely hired gunmen , _pistoleros_ , to assassinate labour leaders and break strikes by the most brutal methods ( see below ) .
It 's hardly surprising that those who had family members or close friends killed by the ruling class seized the opportunity to settle old scores .
Reading Caplan , one would have no inkling of this reason for the killings .
This leads us to suspect that Caplan 's purpose in this essay is to make the anarchists look as bad as possible , hiding the facts where necessary .
And we must note that the CNT - FAI as organisations opposed the wave of revenge killings and acted to stop them .
According to _Blood of Spain_ [ page 149 ] " leading CNT militants , like Joan Peiro , fulminated openly against such actions " and " both the CNT and FAI issued statements categorically condemning assassinations "
The FAI stated : " we must put an end to these excesses . "
" Anyone proven to have infringed people 's rights would be shot -- a threat which was carried out when some anarcho - syndicalist militants were executed . "
Another example is the following statement issued by the FAI on July 30th :
" We declare coldly , with terrible calm and with full intention to act , that if the irresponsible people who are spreading terror throughout Barcelona do not stop , we will shoot every individual who is proven to have acted against the rights of the people .
Every individual so charged by the CNT or FAI will be tried before a commission composed of elements of the anti-fascist front .
And Barcelona knows , and Spain and the entire world know , that the men of the FAI never fail to carry out their promises . "
[ Quoted in Gomez Casas ' _ Anarchist Organisation :
The history of the FAI_ , p. 190 ]
And let 's not forget that Fraser states that " it should be noted that in Barcelona and elsewhere the FAI was automatically blamed for assassinations and crimes " [ p .
148 ] Seems like Caplan is following in this tradition .
Caplan then goes on to blame the CNT and FAI for * every * act of repression against the Church , ignoring the fact that attacks on the Church had occurred during every previous popular revolt in Spain .
In other words , the Church was not a well - liked institution , because it took the side of the ruling class , and people took advantage of every opportunity to destroy it .
This can be seen from the fact that " Protestant churches were not attacked " [ Hugh Thomas , _ The Spanish Civil War_ , p. 269f ] and suggest , rather than a result of anarchist anti-religious feeling , the repression against the church was a popular wave of protest against the reactionary nature of the Catholic church and its support for state and capitalist oppression , exploitation and repression against the working class ( as Frazer notes , " From the preceding period of absolutism , the church provided the ideological categories to justify the repression + and intolerance necessary to maintain the system " p. 525 ) .
Of course , * some * anarchists did take part in church burning but to claim that anarchists were responsible for the majority of such acts cannot be proved either way ( and , of course , many anarchists opposed the firing of churchs and the assassinations of priests ) .
After stating , without evidence , that " it is clear that Anarchist militants were at the vanguard of the murder squads on the Republican side " he continues and asks :
" In any case , whether the murders were centrally ordered , completely decentralized , or ( as is most likely ) somewhere in between , what difference does it make ? "
In other words , are the CNT - FAI to be blamed for all the actions its members did ( even the ones which they had no power to stop ) ?
Caplan obviously thinks the answer is yes .
Thus he states : " Does it matter if the widespread Nazi attacks on Jews known as the Kristallnacht were centrally organized or ' spontaneous ' ?
No ; if an ideology categorizes many people as sub - human , urging ever greater brutality , and recommending restraint only when it is tactically convenient , it is perfectly reasonable to castigate the entire movement centering around that ideology , whether that movement be Nazism or Spanish anarchism . "
Did Spanish Anarchism categorise members of the ruling class as " sub - human " ?
No , they were described as exploiters and oppressors , a description that even a cursory examination of the history of Spanish capitalism would reveal to be quite accurate .
Caplan then states that " [ i] t is quite clear that the rhetoric of the Spanish anarchists focused on crushing the enemies of the workers by any means necessary ; making sure that the rights of innocent people who happened to despise everything Anarchism stood for was simply not on their agenda . "
And he quotes Fraser 's interview of Juan Moreno , a CNT day - laborer :
" We hated the bourgeoisie , they treated us like animals .
They were our worst enemies .
When we looked at them we thought we were looking at the devil himself .
And they thought the same of us . "
Does the fact that the bourgeoisie treated workers " like animals " merit comment by Caplan ?
No , it does not .
Does he mention that part of treating the workers " like animals " involved a twenty - year reign of terror in which labour leaders were routinely beaten up and brutally murdered ?
No , not a word .
Does he criticize the capitalists for hating the workers just as much as the workers hated them ?
No .
Obviously , capitalists categorising and treating workers as animals is okay , while workers ' having the same attitude toward capitalists is evil and wrong .
In Caplan 's view , the workers ' hatred toward their masters was created solely by " Anarchist ideology . "
Could it be , however , that in reality it was the capitalist * system , * defended by Caplan , which created a class of people whose authority resulted in other people being " treated like animals , " and that these others , strangely enough , resented their treatment and hated their oppressors ?
Reading Caplan one gets the impression that such a result is perfectly natural and so unworthy of comment .
And did the * capitalists * in Spain " make sure of the rights of innocent people " who happened to be anarchists ?
Not at all .
Anarchists were rounded up by the fascists , undoubtably identified with the help of bosses .
Again , one searches in vain for any mention of the years of repression directed against the anarchist movement as an explanation for the revenge killings .
One wonders , for example , why Caplan does not quote Ronald Fraser 's _ Blood of Spain_ , a work with which he is familiar :
" After the economic boom of the First World War and increasing proletarian militancy , Catalan employers confronted lean times by attempting to crush the anarcho - syndicalist movement in Barcelona .
The crushing took the form of creating ' yellow ' unions and .
. . the hiring of gunmen to assassinate CNT leaders . " [ p. 547 ]
Where was the concern for " individual rights " then ?
Perhaps the assassinations after July 19th were a case of reaping what had been sown ?
If you treat people like animals , oppress them , hate them , it can hardly be unsurprising that they settle the score when they get the chance ?
Needless to say , Caplan ignores the extensive evidence of anarchists protecting " class enemies , " particularly ones that treated their workers fairly and as human beings .
Also , we must note , Caplan ignores the bloody and violent repression directed against the miners revolt in north - west Spain in 1934 , headed by General Franco .
This resultes in 1500 - 2000 dead , many of the deaths occuring after the end of the fighting .
And , indeed , the violent repression directed against CNT organised insurrections and strikes all through the 1930s and before .
So , quite possibly , being treated like an animal and seeing one 's fellow CNT members assassinated by capitalists would have had a serious impact on how one viewed the bourgeoisie .
However , class hatred only seems to matter when it 's members of the working class who do the hating .
Caplan sums up by stating that " In short , it is perfectly just to impugn the Anarchist movement as a whole for the numerous atrocities of its members , because these actions flowed logically from the central ideas of the movement rather than their misinterpretation by extreme fringe groups . "
In other words , capitalist murder and repression does not matter , it is the reaction to it by anarchists and workers that that counts .
Their violence shows that the blame really lies with " Anarchist ideology , " which Caplan apparently believes should have conditioned workers to accept their oppression with patient resignation .
How very " objective ! "
Therefore , given the picture of the social context of the murders that occured in the Republican zone after July 19th , Caplan 's " conclusion " can be seen to be totally wrong .
It is * not* " perfectly just " to impugn the anarchist movement for the reactions of some of its members to years of oppression , beatings and assassinations by the supporters of capitalism .
In addition , as indicated , the CNT - FAI acted to stop assassinations and murders .
Caplan , in order to make his " case " must distort history .
Few , except die - hard anti-anarchists , could take his case seriously .
B. The Leaders and Collaboration
Caplan next states that " public records concerning the Anarchist leadership 's record of collaboration with the central and regional governments throughout Spain provides ample documentation of a long series of abuses and betrayals of what good principles the Anarchist movement held dear . "
This is very true .
However the reason for these abuses and betrayals is not mentioned .
This handily creates an impression that the CNT - FAI were just " secret statists " all along .
Unfortunately for Caplan , this is not the case , as the overwhelming reason for the long series of abuses and betrayals is the fact that a fascist coup had occurred and there was a need to stop it .
It is hardly surprising that many in the CNT and FAI considered fascism to be a serious threat .
Caplan 's failure to mention this little fact suggests that the threat posed by fascism does not weight very heavily in his mind .
In this he follows those many capitalists , both in and outside of Spain , who supported fascism .
He then presents the discredited claim that the FAI acted like a dictatorship and controlled the CNT .
This claim was started by the dissident treintista CNT members when they were replaced by the more radical anarchists in union elections ( see _Anarchist Organisation : The History of the FAI_ ) .
If the FAI members * did* " impose their decisions . . . " against the wishes of the CNT membership , then why was the CNT a mass organisation ?
And why did only 35,000 workers join the treintista union split ?
The simple fact is that the more radical anarchists and syndicalists convinced their fellow workers of their ideas and they elected them to union positions .
He goes to to say that " [ w ] hile the CNT and especially the FAI repeatedly condemned political participation before the Civil War , it was extraordinarily easy to induce CNT leaders to accept ministerial positions in the central government . "
Could the war against fascism and the need for weapons and support for industry not have something to do with it ?
It 's very true that power corrupts , even anarchists , and this can be seen from the desire of many " anarchists " to join any government after the initial compromises had been made .
Caplan correctly quotes Bolloten when the later notes that " Not only did this decision [ to join the government ] represent a complete negation of the basic tenets of Anarchism , shaking the whole structure of libertarian theory to the core , but , in violation of democratic principle , it had been taken without consulting the rank and file . "
Again , all the anarchists who have written on this subject have argued the same point .
The rank and file should have been fully consulted .
However , and this point is important , the fact that the rank and file did not oppose the decision says that the decision was not at odds with desires of the CNT membership .
This is confirmed by the fact the rank and file agreed to return to work and leave the streets during the May Days when asked to by the CNT leadership and by the fact that a sizable minority of anarchists opposed collaboration and activity put its ideas across to the rest of the CNT membership .
For example , " Ruta , the mouthpiece of the Libertarian Youth of Catalonia , had been opposed to the CNT 's collaborationism since November 1936 " [ Agustin Guillamon , _ The Friends of Durruti Group : 1937 - 1937 _ , p. 43 ] and the Friends of Durruti themselves held well attended public meetings during the Spring of 1937 in Barcelona .
Neither , after the May Days , could the CNT leadership expell the Friends of Durruti because they " never could get that measure ratified by any assembly of unions " [ op. cit. , p. 61 ] .
And , again , I must add these other examples of the CNT decision making process during the Civil War :
" At a conference of local unions in Barcelona , the leadership sought and obtained the support of the unions to continue to collaborate with the government of Catalonia after the May Days .
However , the unions refused to withhold financial support for the Libertarian Youth , who opposed the policy of collaboration vigorously in their publications .
And the unions also refused to call upon the transit workers not to distribute these opposition publications in the public transit system , or the milk drivers to stop distributing the Libertarian Youth papers together with the daily milk .
And then I saw a Libertarian Youth conference which was prepared to vote almost unanimously to condemn without debate the policy of government collaboration .
However , the chairman insisted that supporters of collaboration be given a chance to speak and be heard .
I saw six young men go to the platform and argue earnestly and eloquently for their viewpoint .
There were no interruptions , no booing .
The vote remained almost unanimous in favour of opposing collaboration . "
[ Abe Bluestein , introduction to _Anarchist Organisation : The History of the F.A.I. _]
Therefore , Caplan is correct to state that the decision to join the government was made within consulting the rank and file ( particularly at the front , where the majority of militant anarchists actually where ) but the decisions were reached at various local and national plenums , plenums ( as I noted above ) which could not have forced unions to go along with decisions they opposed .
Therefore , to state that the rank and file were not consulted is correct ( they should have been ) but the fact is that if the majority of union members had not supported that decision then the decision would not have been allowed to happen .
Obviously the majority of the CNT supported the policy of collaboration against the greater evil of fascism , as can be seen from the support the CNT leadership continued to have and the failure of the union assemblies to expell the Friends of Durruti or withhold financial support to the Libertarian Youth .
So , yes , Caplan is correct to state that the rank and file was not consulted , but he is wrong to leave it at that .
The various union , collective , militia , etc. assemblies and plenums ( distorted as they were due to the circumstances of the war ) provided a voice for the rank and file , a rank and file who were subject to arguments against collaboration by a significant minority of anarchists .
Strangely enough , the rank and file seemed to have viewed collaboration in the government as a necessary evil in order to win the war and were not convinced by the anarchist minority within their ranks who disagreed with that policy .
Perhaps Periats sums up the process best when he writes that " [ c]ertainly , circumstances required quick decisions from the organisation , and it was necessary to take precautions to prevent damaging leaks .
These necessities tempted the committees to abandon the federalist procedures of the organisation . "
[ Jose Periats , _Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution_ , p. 188 ]
Periats criticism's of the CNT ( like most anarchist writters ) are far more critical than Caplan's , and also ( unlike his ) place these criticism 's in the context of the civil war .
Caplan continues : " Anarchists were even more eager to assume governmental powers in Catalonia , where they were strong enough to overshadow the regional Catalonia government , the Generalitat .
Rather than officially enter the Catalonian government , the Anarchists chose to retain the Generalitat as a legal cover ; but real power shifted into the hands of the Anarchist - controlled Central Anti-Fascist Militia Committee . .
. It should be further noted that these Anarchist - run councils and committees were not mild - mannered minimal states , maintaining order while allowing the workers to organize themselves as they pleased .
They were modern states , concerning themselves with the economy , education , propaganda , transportation , and virtually everything else . "
Unfortunately , this hypothesis fails to explain how the creation of the collectives occurred outside the control of the Militia Committee .
Thus , the Committee * did* leave workers to organise themselves -- that is , education , transportation and so on were organised by the workers involved .
As for propaganda , the CNT and FAI had its own presses and radio stations .
In other words , while the Militia Committee did " intervene " in the economy , the reorganisation of that economy was going on beyond its control .
It also seems strange to think that this body , set up to organise resistance to the fascist coup , should * not* have taken a " pro-active " stance .
Perhaps Caplan thinks that market forces would have organised , armed , and fed the militias after the total social breakdown from July 19th ?
He then writes :
" The Anarchists ' position in both the central government and in Catalonia slowly but surely declined after their entered into coalition governments with the other anti-Franco factions . "
In other words , the CNT was powerless in the face of political parties who considered defeating the revolution to be more important than defeating fascism .
And if the CNT was secretly totalitarian and as powerful as Caplan implies , why did it join these coalitions as a minority ?
It 's pretty clear that for a " totalitarian " organization , the CNT acted in a strange ways , joining with other political parties , unions , and so on as a minority , and as a result , to see whatever position it had decline .
Next , Caplan states the obvious : " While the members of the CNT who held positions in the Catalonian government kept trying to reach an understanding with their fellow ministers , the rank and file Anarchists seem to have become increasingly alienated from their leaders . "
He then maintains that " A raid on the Anarchist - controlled telephone company brought these feelings to the surface .
( The non-Anarchists ' objected to the Anarchists ' use of wiretaps to listen in on important conversations . )
The CNT ministers merely demanded the removal of the main people responsible for the raid ; but hundreds of the rank - and - file Anarchists responded with rage , setting up barricades . "
Where to start ?
Firstly , the telephone company was run under workers ' control by a joint CNT - UGT committee .
The non-Anarchists objected to workers listening in on important conversations within the government .
Personally , I prefer the " open government " this implies .
Or should the governed not listen in on such conversations ?
Caplan then notes , correctly , that " The Anarchist leadership was .
. . out of step with the rank - and - file ; they urged the militants to stop the fighting .
Their requests were not heeded . "
But he does not mention that before " reinforcements from the central government arrived and firmly placed power into the hands of the Generalitat , " the workers of the CNT did leave the barricades and go back to work .
The reinforcements arrived after " the city was almost back to normal " [ Fraser , p. 382 ] .
Which raises the question : * why * did the CNT workers follow their leaders ?
The fact that they did seems to indicate some support for them , in spite of the numerous compromises .
Given the pressing need for unity against the Fascists , we can understand why the rank and file of the CNT returned to work - we may not agree with it , but we can understand it .
Therefore , it can be stated that support for the CNT and FAI was still strong within the Catalan working class , inspite of the actions of the union 's leadership .
After discussing the communist repression against the anarchists , Caplan states that " Even though many Anarchists eventually realized that the defeat of Franco would lead to the establishment of a Soviet satellite state , they kept fighting .
Clearly the Anarchists ' opposition to the Nationalists dwarfed their distaste for Leninist totalitarianism . "
The " Nationalists , " it should be noted , were the fascists .
Simply put , if the fascists did win , what was left of the CNT militia would have been disarmed ( not to mention murdered , Franco 's regime killed hundreds of thousands of anti-nationalists during and after the war ) .
At least by fighting on the Republican side , they would still have had arms at the end .
Obviously this consideration meant that their opposition to fascist totalitarianism ( which was what " the Nationalists " represented ) dwarfed their " distaste " for the Leninist form .
Caplan then discusses the negotiations between the " new clandestine secretary general of the CNT , Jose Leiva , in Madrid , with the Falange , stating that " This was the Anarchism of the CNT : an Anarchism which not only allied with the Communist totalitarians , but attempted to strike a deal with the Fascist totalitarians six years after the end of the civil war . "
As if the great majority of CNT militants who came back to Spain to re-organise the CNT and try to assassinate Franco would have agreed with this activity !
Simply put , Caplan 's suggestion that this negotiation reflects the anarchism of the CNT is utter nonsense , unworthy of an objective historian ( and typical , I may add , to his continual tendency to take the actions of a minority of anarchists are " typical " while remaining silence about the majority ) .
However , as indicated , Caplan is anything * but* objective .
( Nor , may I add , does Caplan denounce the many capitalists who supported Franco and invested in Spain once his regime had slaughtered hundreds of thousands of trade unionists , anarchists , socialists , etc .
Obviously capitalists making deals with fascism is perfectly acceptable , which indicates that * real * capitalists are more than happy to support fascism if the returns are high enough -- " convinced of where its real interests lay , international capital subscribed to the nationalist war effort in no uncertain manner " Frazer , p. 279 ) .
Of course , there are many examples of right - libertarians supporting the Fascist totalitarians in Pinochet 's Chile , with which we could make similar criticisms about the " anarchism " of " anarcho " capitalism .
However , there are plenty of other areas in " anarcho " - capitalist theory and practice that show up its claim to be anarchistic to be utterly false .
C. The Urban Collectives
Here Caplan discusses the CNT urban collectives , starting with the CNT policy of closing down many small plants .
" What is odd , " he writes , " is that in the midst of massive unemployment the Anarchists closed down a large percentage of the remaining firms . "
Could the reason be , perhaps , that much of the plant which was closed down was unhygenic or unsafe and so on ?
Obviously , as a supporter of capitalism , Caplan does not regard workers ' safety as an issue .
Moving on , Caplan states that " initially , the workers ( rather than an Anarchist nomenklatura ) usually assumed control over their places of employment .
. . .
Yet government control quickly followed .
In October , the government of Anarchist - dominated Catalonia passed the Collectivization and Workers ' Control Decree , which legally recognized many of the de facto collectivizations . "
We should point out that this government was not anarchist - dominated , and the collectivisation decree was a compromise between the forces represented in that government .
However , as both Fraser and Bolloten point out , the decree was often ignored in practice .
Caplan goes on to note anarchist opposition to this decree and to discuss a " loophole " in it .
The loophole was that " firms had to pay a percentage of their _profits_ .
To eliminate the exaction , one merely need eliminate the profits .
With worker control , there is a simple way to do this : keep raising wages until the " profits " disappear .
Taxes on profits - which is what the Decree amounted to - will raise revenue if the workers and the owners are different people ; but with worker control such taxes are simple to evade .
Witness after witness reports the abolition of piece - work , better working conditions , lavish non-wage compensation , and so on .
This is initially surprising ; if the workers run the factory , do n't they pay the price of hampering production ? "
Of course Caplan obviously puts all these improvements down to the desire of workers not to pay taxes .
The idea that better working conditions , the abolition of piece work , etc. came about because the workers did not desire to work in the bad , demeaning conditions imposed by capitalists does not enter his head .
Nor , of course , the massive disruption of the Catalan economy by the war does not even factor into Caplan 's " thesis " - all the evidence suggests that difficulties in getting raw materials , access to markets , etc. played a key role in the Catalan economy .
However , to back his thesis with some evidence Caplan must indicate that profits existed between July and September 1936 ( i.e. before the " profits tax " was introduced ) .
However , there is no evidence that states " we had profits until September then there was n't any . "
In other words , Caplan 's thesis has no basis in fact and the most obvious thesis ( namely workers ' desired to have decent working conditions and the disruption of the economy caused by the war reducing profits ) looks far stronger .
Looking over the results of collectivisation , Caplan states that " [ i ] n short , after being told that the workers now owned the means of production , the workers often took the statement literally .
What is the point of owning the means of production if you can't get rich using them ?
But of course if some workers get rich , they are unlikely to voluntarily donate their profits to the other members of their class . "
The unstated assumption , of course , is that getting rich is the only motivation people have .
Perhaps to a capitalist , this premise is " self - evidently " true , but according to the accounts of Augustine Souchy , Gaston Leval , Jose Peirats , and other eyewitnesses , there was a remarkable spirit of cooperation in most of the collectives .
It should also be pointed out that if people are " unlikely to voluntarily donate their profits , " then the standard " anarcho " capitalist claim that charities will boom in their system does not hold water .
But as " anarcho " capitalism is based on telling people what they want to hear , that 's hardly surprising .
Caplan goes on to state the following :
" Bolloten repeats a remark of CNT militia leader Ricardo Sanz : " ' [ T ] hings are not going as well as they did in the early days of the [ revolutionary ] movement ...
The workers no longer think of workings long hours to help the front .
They only think of working as little as possible and getting the highest possible wages . ' "
Bolloten attributes this decline in enthusiasm to Communist repression , but it is at least as consistent with the simple observation that people often prefer improving their own lot in life to nourishing revolution . "
Or could it be that they had seen the revolution destroyed and so did not care how the war would end ?
Improving their own lot and nourishing revolution need not be incompatible .
As this quote is from after May 1937 , it is likely that the communist repression did have an effect on the spirit of the workers in Spain .
And , as Caplan documents below , the economy of Catalonia was under great strain because of the war .
Hardly surprising if people facing great economic difficulties start to concentrate on their own survival regardless of wider issues .
Editorializing further , Caplan states that " [ i ] n short , practical experience gradually revealed a basic truth of economics for which theoretical reflection would have sufficed : if the workers take over a factory , they will run it to benefit themselves .
A worker - run firm is essentially identical to a capitalist firm in which the workers also happen to be the stockholders .
Once they came to this realization , however dimly , the Spanish Anarchists had to either embrace capitalism as the corollary of worker control , or else denounce worker control as the corollary of capitalism .
For the most part , they chose the latter course . "
This is false .
There is no denying that workers will run a workplace for their own benefit .
This is obvious .
However , this is not the whole story .
Could not workers also see the need for cooperation beyond the workplace and support the end of capitalism in their own self - interest ?
Of course , this was the CNT policy of " socialisation " ( as opposed to nationalisation ) which Caplan refers to as " call[ing ] absolute dictatorship by a different name . "
But if interworkplace organisation is " absolute dictatorship , " then many capitalist firms can also be classed as such .
Hence , if democratic union control is " absolute dictatorship , " what does that make the anti-democratic capitalist company ?
Caplan does not ask the question , strangely enough .
And , as should be obvious , a worker - run firm is * not* " essentially identical " to a capitalist firm because in a worker - run firm workers control their own activity themselves .
In other words , there is no hierarchical forms of authority within the workplace and so , unlike a capitalist firm , is far more anarchistic .
This explains the long standing anarchist support for cooperatives .
Of course , as Caplan himself points out , capitalism is * not* the " corollary " of workers control as he argues that wage labour and investors would appear - in other words , capitalism will destroy workers control in favour of control of workers by capitalists .
A strange " corollary " !
And I think these words by Proudhon ( from _ The General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century_ ) indicate well that a worker - run firm is * not* " essentially identical " to a capitalist one :
Proudhon argues that employees are " subordinated , exploited " and their " permanent condition is one of obedience , " a " slave " within a capitalist firm [ p .
216 ]
Indeed , capitalist companies " plunder the bodies and souls of wage workers " and they are " an outrage upon human dignity and personality . " [ p. 218 ]
However , in a co-operative the situation changes and the worker is an " associate " and " forms a part of the producing organisation . . . [ and ] forms a part of the sovereign power , of which he was before but the subject . " [ p. 216 ]
Without co-operation and association , " the workers . . . would remain related as subordinates and superiors , and there would ensue two industrial castes of masters and wage - workers , which is repugnant to a free and democratic society . " [ p. 216 ]
Therefore , Caplan 's claim that the issue of " dividends " is the key to understanding the nature of cooperatives totally misses the point .
It seems strange that an self - proclaimed " anarchist " is more concerned about who gets the dividend than about the authority relations within an association .
This indicates well that " anarcho " - capitalism is * not* anarchist , its opposition to * archy * is so limited as to be non-existant .
As Proudhon , and those anarchists who followed him realised , is that the issue of who runs the workplace is a key one in determining whether a system is socialist or not ( along with , I must note , whether there is separate class of owners who get a slice of the workers profits - in other words , whether capitalist exploitation exists ) .
As the collectives had workers control and provided no profits for a capitalist class , then they were most definitely socialistic and not capitalistic .
He quotes Bolloten as follows : " In the opinion of the Anarchosyndicalists , socialization would eliminate the dangers of government control by placing production in the hands of the unions .
This was the libertarian conception of socialization , without state intervention , that was to eliminate the wastes of competition and duplication , render possible industrywide planning for both civilian and military needs , and halt the growth of selfish actions among the workers of the more prosperous collectives by using their profits to raise the standard of living in the less favored enterprises . "
It should be noted that this policy of socialisation existed * before * the revolution and was based on workers control .
Therefore , as " evidence " that the anarchists " denounced " workers control as the problems of collectivisation became clear is hardly convincing .
The socialised industries were still organised by workplace assemblies and elected management committees .
In other words , socialisation was built and based upon workers control and so Caplan 's statement is * false . *
Bolloten 's quote indicates that the long standing CNT policy of socialisation called for cooperation between workplaces based on democratic workers control .
Caplan then states that " Of course , one could refuse to call a union with such fearsome powers a ' state , ' but it would need all of the enforcement apparatus and authority of a state to execute its objectives .
The ' more prosperous collectives , ' for example , would be unlikely to submit voluntarily to industrywide planning funded by their profits . "
If this was the case , then the same problem afflicts the capitalist company ( particularly one with multiple workplaces ) .
Why should a workplace submit to the funding of stockholders ?
Hence capitalism needs an enforcement apparatus and authority of a state , particularly as the workplace is not democratic .
So , if socialisation is " absolute dictatorship , " so is capitalism ( and capitalist firms , unlike collectives , are not democratic internally ) .
We doubt that Caplan would accept such a statement , however .
Caplan then states that the " Nationalists conquered Catalonia before the government made any concerted , official effort to nationalize the workers ' factories . "
However , this is somewhat false as after the May Days , the position of the collectives changed .
According to Frazer in _ Blood of Spain_ , " the PSUC , faced still with a militant CNT working class , attempted rather to centralise the collectives under Generalitat ( or PSUC ) control from June 1937 .
. . [ they ] modified many essential aspects of the collectivisation decree [ which the CNT ignored anyway - IM ] . . .
Such modifications could have paved the way for a later move from centralisation to nationalisation . " [ p. 578 ]
Frazer is clear , the Stalinists centralised power away from the collectives into the states hands .
Within the workplace , mass assemblies and elected management committees no longer run the workplace nor had a say in any industrial bodies that existed .
In other words , Caplan gets the facts wrong and implies a situation within the Catalan economy radically different from the facts .
In other wors , the government * had * made official efforts to start the process of nationalisation before the fascists took Catalonia .
A process , I may add , which had started well before June 1937 but which the May Days ensured the outcome of .
After highlighting how the state used the lack of cooperation between many collectives to undermine and control the collectives , Caplan states that " The simplest way that the collectives could have avoided dependence on the government would have been to issue debt ; in short , to borrow from the general public rather than the government .
But undoubtedly the fear of revealing surplus wealth to lend would make such a scheme impossible .
Even if their physical safety were not their concern , investors could hardly expect to ever get their money back .
The insecurity of property rights thus made it very difficult to borrow from the public , so the collectives mortgaged themselves piece by piece to the government until finally the government rather than the workers owned the means of production . "
It should be noted that Caplan acknowledges , implicitly anyway , that capitalism needs a state to propert " property rights . "
In other words , for capitalism to exist , a state must have have enough power to ensure that workers do not take over and ignore the " rightful owners . "
Caplan , against his intentions , indicates that capitalism can never be anarchistic .
And I should note that in capitalist economies , industry finds about 90 % plus of its funds from its own resources ( e.g. in the USA , since 1952 , internal funds covered 91 % of capital expenditures , 96 % from 1990 ) - an option which the collectives , struggling to survive in the difficult situation of the war time economy , had little chance to pursue .
The issuing of stock play a minor , almost non-existant , role in generating income for companies .
But what stock * does * do is allow a rich minority to control a countries economy and to enrich themselves at the expense of the many ( in the words of Doug Henwood , author of _Wall Street_ and editor of _ Left Business Observer_ , " Stock markets .
. . . [ are ] a way for the very rich as a class to own an economy 's productive capital stock as a whole , rather than being tied to the fate of a single firm .
. .
Stock market's , in Joan Robinson 's phrase , are a convenience for rentiers " ) .
So , far from protecting the collectives share issues would have seen the workers ( and society ) become subject to the wishes of capitalists and workers control would have disappeared .
Caplan also acknowledges the basic anarchist point that cooperation between collectives would have ensured workers ' control -- in other words , that the " capitalistic " tendencies Caplan documents ended up in destroying freedom in the economy .
In fact , the " simplest way " for the collectives to have survived would have been to socialise and work together .
In this way they would have been in a position to determine their own fates instead of being slowly taken over by the state or a new capitalist class .
He notes that " almost all sources indicate that profits were almost non-existence ; possibly , as I have indicated , because workers were smart enough to realize that raising their wages and improving working conditions was an easy route to avoid any profits tax . "
Of course , workers improving their working conditions and raising their wages may have been due to the fact that the capitalists had paid them little for working in bad conditions before the revolution .
And it should be noted that all the sources indicate that profits were almost non-existance * before * the decree as well .
In other words , Caplan 's thesis is based purely on ideology and not on fact .
I should also point out here that Caplan ignores one of the most common complaints within the collectivised economy during this time , namely lack of raw materials and funding .
It is hard to produce profits when your workplace does not have enough raw materials to produce goods !
However , this fact is ignored by Caplan in favour of his own theory .
Caplan then does discuss the possibilities of socialisation between collectives :
" Even if this could have prevented the collectives from becoming dependent on the central government , the end result would have been to make them dependent on a union so powerful that it would be a state in everything but name . "
But investors having property rights do need a state powerful enough to enforce their claims .
In other words , even if we take Caplan 's claims at face value , he has no option but to support the recreation of the state in order to protect property rights .
As for the " powerful " union , that depends on what the workers decided to form .
We doubt that cooperation between collectives would have created a " powerful " body above the collectives unless the collectives desired to create such a body ( which is unlikely ) .
Caplan finishes by quoting Albert Perez - Baro , a civil servant and a former CNT member :
" This truly revolutionary measure [ the 50 per cent profits tax ] - though rarely , if ever , applied - was n't well received by large numbers of workers , proving , unfortunately , that their understanding of the scope of collectivization was very limited .
Only a minority understood that collectivization meant the return to society of what , historically , had been appropriated by the capitalists ... "
Notice that Perez - Baro states that the profits tax was rarely , if ever applied .
This suggests that the collectivisation policy was not enforced , meaning that workers saw that their " profits " would have been save .
However , such profits did not seem to exist even in the face of non-collection !
So , I would suggest , that Caplan 's " thesis " on the lack of profits is false .
Caplan then states : " In other words , most workers assumed that worker control meant that the workers would actually become the true owners of their workplaces , with all the rights and privileges thereof .
Only the elite realized that worker control was merely a euphemism for " social control " which in turn can only mean control by the state ( or an Anarchist ' council , ' ' committee , ' or ' union , ' satisfying the standard Weberian definition of the state ) . "
Funny how a minority of workers becomes " an elite " for Caplan .
Could it be that he expects * all * workers to agree with him ?
Could it not be that many of the CNT membership who agreed to the policy of socialisation at their previous congresses had their own ideas of what workers ' control meant and tried to convince their fellow workers of it ?
Does having a different viewpoint mean you are part of an elite ?
No , it does not , but Caplan provides the right sort of " atmosphere " for twisting the quote .
So , how did this minority in favour of socialisation act ?
Did they impose their wishes on the majority by state action ?
No. Socialisation was not collectivisation and came about through discussion with the unions and workplaces .
For example , Fraser notes that the stores were not socialised because the workers did not agree , whereas the woodworkers union did agree to socialisaton because the minority originally in favour of it convinced the rest .
Hardly examples of " an elite " running the economy .
Of course few anarchists expect an anarchist society to appear overnight .
There will be a period in which left - overs from capitalism co-exist with aspects of anarchism .
This is to be expected .
However , Caplan by pointing out the obvious ( namely that the collectives in Spain were * not* instantly anarchist ) just shows the standard " anarcho " capitalist assumption that anarchists expect perfection instantly .
Strangely enough this is another aspect of their ideas they share with Marxist - Leninists .
D. Militarization
Caplan starts by noting that " the Anarchist militias resisted it [ militarization ] vigorously because they took their ideals seriously . "
However , he then claims that " [ i] t did not take long for the Anarchist leadership to decide that military success was more important than the voluntaristic notions of the rank - and - file " and quotes Solidaridad Obrera as being in " favor of the strictest discipline " : " ' To accept discipline means that the decisions made by comrades assigned to any particular task , whether administrative or military , should be executed without any obstruction in the name of liberty , a liberty that in many cases degenerates into wantonness . ' "
Just to place this into context , I would wonder what Caplan would say if the workforce in a capitalist workplace decided to ignore the need for discipline , the need to coordinate join activity , because it was created on a " voluntaristic " notion ?
Of course , in any joint activity discipline is required and in the context of a militia force at the front line , this is doubly true .
Such support for discipline cannot be identified with the hierarchical control of a capitalist workplace or capitalist army , but instead is an attempt to ensure that when a militia attacks that it gets the required support from its neighbours , that weapons arrive on time and so on .
George Orwell indicates in Homage to Catalonia the democratic nature of the " discipline " Solidaridad Obrera was recommending :
" At this time [ late 1936 ] and until much later , the Catalan militias were still on the same basis they had been at the beginning of the war .
. . until [ June 1937 ] . . . the militia - system remained unchanged .
The essential point of the system was social equality .
. .
In theory at any rate each militia was a democracy and not a hierarchy .
It was understood that orders had to obeyed , but it was also to be understood that when you gave an order you gave it as comrade to comrade and not as superior to inferior .
There were officers and N.C.O.s , but there was no military rank in the ordinary sense ; no titles , no badges , no heel - clicking and saluting .
They had attempted to produce within the militias a sort of temporary working model of the classless soceity .
Of course there was not perfect equality , but there was a nearer approach to it than I had ever seen or than I would have thought conceiviable in time of war .
" In practice the democratic ' revolutionary ' type of discipline is more reliable than might be expected .
In a workers ' army discipline is theoretically voluntary .
It is based on class - loyalty , wheras the discipline of a bourgeois conscript army is based ultimately on fear .
. .
In the militias the bullying and abuse that go in an ordinary army would never have been tolerated for a moment .
The normal military punishments existed , but they were only invoked for very serious offences .
When a man refused to obey an order you did not immediately get him punished ; you first appealed to him in the name of comradeship .
Cynical people with no experience of handling men will say instantly that this would never `work , ' but as a matter of fact it does `work ' in the long run .
The discipline of even the worst drafts of militia visibly improved as time went on .
. . ` Revolutionary ' discipline depends on political conciousness -- on an understanding of * why * orders must be obeyed ; it takes time to diffuse this , but it also takes time to drill a man into an automaton on the barrack - sqaure .
. .
And it is a tribute to the strength of `revolutionary ' discipline that the militias stayed in the field at all .
For until about June 1937 there was nothing to keep them there , except class loyalty .
. .
At the beginning the apparent chaos , the general lack of training , the fact that you often had to argue for five minutes before you could get an order obeyed , appaled and infuriated me .
I had British Army ideas , and certainly the Spanish militias were very unlike the British Army .
But considering the circumstances they were better troops than one had any right to expect . "
[ _Homage to Catalonia_ , p. 26 ]
This indicates that Caplan 's attempt to raise the bogey - man of " discipline " is somewhat flawed .
Strangely enough , in war , discipline is required .
Its a question of whether it is imposed by hierarchy and fear ( as in capitalist companies ) or by cooperation , argument and equality ( as in the anarchist militias and collectives ) .
Caplan then states that " [ w ] hile many of the rank - and - file resisted , military discipline swiftly became common in the Anarchist militias . "
Which , given the context , implies that it was decision to militarise was forced upon the anarchist militia by the anarchist leadership .
However , the simple fact is that the militias were agreed to militarise , after intensive debate by the militias themselves , in order to get arms and supplies .
The capitalist state used its control of supplies to force the militias to accept army organisation .
As Agustin Guillamon puts it in regards to the Iron Column " Repudiation of militarization was debated inside the Iron Column as it was in every other confederal column .
In the end , the Column 's assembly gave its approval to militarization , since it would otherwise be denied weapons and provisions . " [ _ The Friends of Durruti Group_ , p. 31 ]
These facts are well known and that Caplan ignores them says a lot about his objectivity ( later he does note that " [ m ] ost of the militia columns swiftly fell into line , although it is unclear to what extent this was because they were following the orders of the Anarchist leadership , or enticed by the central government 's money and weapons .. " while in fact it * is* clear that the decision to militarize was the produce of central government blackmail , * not* " enticement " ( which , I must add , is a somewhat unusual way of describing what is obviously blackmail - " you do n't militarise , you do n't get arms " is not an " enticing " offer and again highlights Caplan 's lack of objectivity ) .
After noting that the anarchist militias resisted the militarization desired by the government , he notes that it " took scarcely two months for the Anarchists to openly advocate conscription - enslaving young men to kill or be killed - so long as the conscripts were forced to risk their lives for the cause of the CNT . "
Or to translate into English , to risk their lives fighting fascism .
In this connection it 's interesting to note that David Friedman ( a noted " anarcho " capitalist guru ) has presented arguments in favour of conscription in the light of greater dangers to freedom .
Thus the CNT cannot be claimed to hold a monopoly of " anarchist " support on conscription .
Given the very likely possibility of a fascist victory , many anarchists supported the " lesser " evil of conscription .
Caplan , being safe behind a desk , can bemoan " enslaving young men " to fight fascism .
Obviously if fascism won , then the greater evil offers less problems -- after all , fascism and capitalism can and do exist happily together .
Now , as far as " the Anarchists " advocating conscription it is worthwhile noting that " [ d ] uring those first months of the war enlistment was voluntary only .
The government made continual mobilizations by decree , but there were on the whole ineffective . "
[ Periats , _Anarchists in the Spanish Revolution_ , p. 265 ] and indeed , even by early 1937 the Catalan government was not enforcing the draft ( those who were subject to call - up were asked to go to join union based units and there is little indication that this was based upon force - see Bolloton for details ) .
So , when the CNT was largely control of Catalonia , there was no conscription and the militias were voluntary for over 6 months .
Only when the balance of power had started to move towards the newly strengthening state was conscription enforced .
And , to place some important context to this issue , let us not forget that in those areas under Franco thousands , probably tens of thousands , of people were being murdered ( according to the historian Gabriel Jackson , the fascists murdered 200 000 people * during * the civil war , 200 000 afterwards - _ The Spanish Republic and the Civil War : 1931 - 1939 , p. 539 ) .
It is only in this context , the desire to end a civil war and stop fascist totalitarians murdering tens of thousands more , can " the Anarchists " support for conscription be understood .
It is significant that Caplan does not provide this context - obviously the systematic murder of hundreds of thousands of people is a lesser evil than conscription .
In discussing the Iron Column , Caplan states that " [ l ] est one praise their idealism too highly , it should be noted that the Iron Column apparently saw no contradiction between Anarchism and terrorism and robbery . "
Obviously he thinks that the militia should have quietly starved to death at the front and not acted to confiscate food , money and so forth .
So , while the charge of " robbery " holds , " terrorism " ( given its usual meaning ) can hardly be applicable in this case .
When the militias were militarized , the CNT tried to ensure that the CNT workers stayed together in their own units .
This would be very useful to ensure that the communists did not totally control the army .
However , Caplan states that " most of the Iron Column joined units which , while nominally part of the army of the central government , were actually part of the private fiefdom of the CNT . "
In other words , damned if you do , damned if you do n't .
Above Caplan bemoans the fact the CNT collaborated with the communists .
However , now , when the CNT tries to undermine communist power in the army , they are creating their own " private fiefdom . " ( as the Catalan regional committee correctly pointed out , " it would be very childish to hand over our forces to the absolute control of the government " - but apparently thats want Caplan prefers .
And I may note that under CNT " control " the militias would have remained far more democratic / libertarian than under state control .
A point not lost on the government ) .
The CNT just cannot win .
As for the decree on conscription , the CNT was a minority in the government , and even if it did oppose conscription could not have stopped it .
Capan then goes on to say that " the CNT made no attempt to subsist merely on voluntary donations of time and resources .
It readily accepted government hand - outs . "
Actually , according to Fraser , " thousands of workers contributed their wage increases to the support of the militias at the front " [ p.
232 ]
But as Fraser points out , many workers saw their wages being eaten by inflation and rising prices .
Many were not in the position to donate .
In addition , rural collectives did provide troops with voluntary donations of time and resources , as did industrial ones .
And as far as government " hand - outs " go , obviously the anarchists at the front should have * not* accepted funds or weapons from the state in the name of theoretical purity .
But hungry and weaponless men would find it hard to fight fascism .
Caplan finishes by stating " as the next section reveals , when the Anarchists realized that food and valuable agricultural commodities could be extorted out of forced collectives of terrorized peasants , they saw an opportunity that was simply too good to refuse . "
The truth of this is discussed below .
E. The Rural Collectives
In this section Caplan " review [s ] the history of the Anarchists and rural collectivization " using Burnett Bolloten 's _ The Spanish Civil War_ as the base .
He states that " After the attempted military coup in July 1936 , there was a revolution in many rural areas somewhat similar to that in urban areas .
It should be noted , however , that the power of the CNT was centered in the cities rather than the countryside , so it would be extremely surprising if the rural revolution were as ' spontaneous ' as the urban revolution . "
He quotes Fraser as follows :
" Very rapidly collectives , in which not only the means of production but also of consumption were socialized , began to spring up .
It did not happen on instructions from the CNT leadership - no more than had the collectives in Barcelona .
Here , as there , the initiative came from CNT militants ; here , as there , the ' climate ' for social revolution in the rearguard was created by CNT armed strength : the anarcho - syndicalists ' domination of the streets of Barcelona was re-enacted in Aragon as the CNT militia columns , manned mainly by Catalan anarcho - syndicalist workers , poured in .
Where a nucleus of anarcho - syndicalists existed in a village , it seized the moment to carry out the long - awaited revolution and collectivized spontaneously .
Where there was none , villagers could find themselves under considerable pressure from the militias to collectivize . . . "
Caplan then states " Note well Fraser 's point that the anarchists in rural Aragon relied heavily on urban Catalonian anarchists to get off the ground .
However over - stated the Anarchists ' claim to represent ' the people , ' was in Barcelona , in rural Aragon such a claim was absurd . "
But Fraser does mention the " nucleus of anarchosyndicalists " that existing in many villages , meaning that the CNT did have a presence in Aragon .
Fraser states that in " some [ of the Aragonese villages ] there was a flourishing CNT , in others the UGT was strongest , and in only too many there was no unionisation at all . "
[ _Blood of Spain_ , p. 348 ]
Elsewhere , Fraser points out that the Aragon rural collectivisation was " carried out under the general cover , if not necessarily the direct agency , of CNT militia columns . " [ p. 370 ]
So , what does this mean in practice ?
Before the revolution , the Spanish countryside was marked by high concentrations of land owned by a handful of people ( 67 % of the land was owned by 2 % of the population ) .
Life in this capitalist rural economy was dominated by powerful caciques [ local bosses ] .
Hence , when the balance of class forces changed in Aragon ( i.e. when the caciques would not get state aid to protect their property , ) many landless workers took over the land .
In other words , the presence of the militia ensured that land could be taken over by destroying the capitalist " monopoly of force " that existed before the revolution .
Therefore , by removing the capitalist " monopoly of force , " the CNT militia allowed the possibility of experimentation by the Aragonese population .
Caplan suggests that to claim that the CNT had strong support in Aragon is " absurd . "
However , the evidence suggests that it is Caplan 's claims that are absurd .
Murray Bookchin summarises the situation well :
" The authentic peasant base of the CNT [ by the 1930s ] now lay in Aragon . . . [ CNT growth in Zaragoza ] provided a springboard for a highly effective libertarian agitation in lower Aragon , particularly among the impoverished laborers and debt - ridden peasantry of the dry steppes region . "
[ _ The Spanish Anarchists_ , p. 220 ]
Graham Kelsey , in his social history of the C.N.T. in Aragon between 1930 and 1937 , provides the necessary evidence to more than back Bookchin 's claim of C.N.T. growth .
Kesley points out that as well as the " spread of libertarian groups and the increasing consciousness among C.N.T. members of libertarian theories . . . contribu[ ting ] to the growth of the anarchosyndicalist movement in Aragon " the existence of " agrarian unrest " also played an important role in that growth [ _Anarchosyndicalism , Libertarian Communism and the State_ , pp.80 - 81 ] .
This all lead to the " revitalisation of the C.N.T. network in Aragon " [ p. 82 ] and so by 1936 , the C.N.T. had built upon the " foundations laid in 1933 .
. . [ and ] had finally succeeded in translating the very great strength of the urban trade - union organisation in Zaragoza into a regional network of considerable extent . "
[ Op. Cit. , p. 134 ]
Kelsey and other historians note the long history of anarchism in Aragon , dating back to the late 1860s .
However , before the 1910s there had been little gains in rural Aragon by the C.N.T. due to the power of local bosses ( called * caciques * ) :
" Local landowners and small industrialists , the * caciques * of provincial Aragon , made every effort to enforce the closure of these first rural anarchosyndicalist cells [ created after 1915 ] .
By the time of the first rural congress of the Aragonese CNT confederation in the summer of 1923 , much of the progress achieved through the organization 's considerable propaganda efforts had been countered by repression elsewhere . "
[ Graham Kelsey , " Anarchism in Aragon , " p. 62 ]
A C.N.T. activist indicates the power of these bosses and how difficult it was to be a union member in Aragon :
" Repression is not the same in the large cities as it is in the villages where everyone knows everybody else and where the Civil Guards are immediately notified of a comrade 's slightest movement .
Neither friends nor relatives are spared .
All those who do not serve the state 's repressive forces unconditionally are pursued , persecuted and on occassions beaten up . " [ cited by Kelsey , Op. Cit. , p. 74 ]
However , while there were some successes in organising rural unions , even in 1931 " propaganda campaigns which led to the establishment of scores of village trade - union cells , were followed by a counter - offensive from village * caciques * which forced them to close . "
[ Ibib . p. 67 ]
But even in the face of this repression the C.N.T. grew and " from the end of 1932 .
. . [ there was ] a successful expansion of the anarchosyndicalist movement into several parts of the region where previously it had never penetrated . "
[ Kesley , _Anarchosyndicalism , Libertarian Communism and the State_ , p. 185 ]
This growth was built upon in 1936 , with increased rural activism which had slowly eroded the power of the * caciques * ( which in part explains their support for the fascist coup ) .
After the election of the Popular Front , years of anarchist propaganda and organisation paid off with a massive increase in rural membership in the C.N.T. :
" The dramatic growth in rural anarch - syndicalist support in the six weeks since the general election was emphasized in the [ Aragon CNT 's April ] congress 's agenda .
. . the congress directed its attention to rural problems . . . [ and agreed a programme which was ] exactly what was to happen four months later in liberated Aragon . "
[ Kesley , " Anarchism in Aragon " , p. 76 ]
In the aftermath of a regional congress , held in Zaragoza at the start of April , a series of of intensive propaganda campaigns was organized through each of the provinces of the regional confederation .
Many meetings were held in villages which had never before heard anarcho- syndicalist propaganda .
This was very successful and by the beginning of June , 1936 , the number of Aragon unions had topped 400 , compared to only 278 one month earlier ( an increase of over 40 % in 4 weeks ) .
[ Ibib. , pp. 75-76 ]
This increase in union membership reflects increased social struggle by the Aragonese working population and their attempts to improve their standard of living , which was very low for most of the population .
A journalist from the conservative - Catholic _Heraldo de Aragon_ visited lower Aragon in the summer of 1935 and noted " [t ] he hunger in many homes , where the men are not working , is beginning to encourage the youth to subscribe to misleading teachings . " [ cited by Kesley , Ibib. , p. 74 ]
Little wonder , then , the growth in CNT membership and social struggle Kesley indicates :
" Evidence of a different kind was also available that militant trade unionism in Aragon was on the increase .
In the five months between mid-February and mid-July 1936 the province of Zaragoza experienced over seventy strikes , more than had previously been recorded in any entire year , and things were clearly no different in the other two provinces . . . the great majority of these strikes were occuring in provincial towns and villages .
Strikes racked the provinces and in at least three instances were actually transformed into general strikes . "
[ Ibib. , p. 76 ]
Therefore , in the spring and summer of 1936 , we see a massive growth in C.N.T. membership which reflects growing militant struggle by the urban and rural population of Aragon .
Years of C.N.T. propaganda and organising had ensured this growth in C.N.T. influence , a growth which is also reflected in the creation of collectives in liberated Aragon during the revolution .
Therefore , the construction of a collectivized society was founded directly upon the emergence , during the five years of the Second Republic , of a mass trade - union movement infused by libertarian , anarchist principles .
These collectives were constructed in accordance with the programme agreed at the Aragon C.N.T. conference of April 1936 which reflected the wishes of the rural membership of the unions within Aragon ( and due to the rapid growth of the C.N.T. afterwards obviously reflected popular feelings in the area ) .
In the words of Graham Kesley , " libertarian dominance in post - insurrection Aragon itself reflected the predominance that anarchists had secured before the war ; by the summer of 1936 the CNT had succeeded in establishing throughout Aragon a mass trade - union movement of strictly libertarian orientation , upon which widespread and well - supported network the extensive collective experiment was to be founded . "
[ Ibib. , p. 61 ]
Additional evidence that supports a high level of C.N.T. support in rural Aragon can be provided by the fact that it was Aragon that was the center of the December 1933 insurrection organised by the C.N.T .
As Bookchin notes , " only Aragon rose on any significant scale , particularly Saragossa . . . many of the villages declared libertarian communism and perhaps the heaviest fighting took place between the vineyard workers in Rioja and the authorities " [ M. Bookchin , Op. Cit. , p. 256 ]
It is unlikely for the C.N.T. to organise an insurrection in an area within which it had little support or influence .
According to Kesley 's in - depth social history of Aragon , " it was precisely those areas which had most important in December 1933 . . . which were now [ in 1936 ] , in seeking to create a new pattern of economic and social organisation , to form the basis of libertarian Aragon " [ G. Kesley , _Anarchosyndicalism , Libertarian Communism and the State_ , p. 161 ]
After the revolt , thousands of workers were jailed , with the authorities having to re-open closed prisons and turn at least one disused monastrey into a jail due to the numbers arrested .
Therefore , it can be seen that the majority of collectives in Aragon were the product of C.N.T. ( and UGT ) influenced workers taking the opportunity to create a new form of social life , a form marked by its voluntary and directly democratic nature .
For from being unknown in rural Aragon , the C.N.T. was well established and growing at a fast rate - " Spreading out from its urban base ... the CNT , first in 1933 and then more extensively in 1936 , succeeded in converting an essentially urban organisation into a truly regional confederation . "
[ Ibib. , p. 184 ]
Additional evidence that refutes Caplan 's claim of little CNT support in rural Aragon can be provided by the fact that it was Aragon that was the center of the December 1933 insurrection organised by the CNT .
As Bookchin notes , " only Aragon rose on any significant scale , partcularly Saragossa . . . many of the villages declared libertarian communism and perhaps the heaviest fighting took place between the vineyard workers in Rioja and the authorities " [ M Bookchin , Op. Cit. , p. 256 ]
It is unlikely for the CNT to organise an insurrection in an area within which it had little support or influence .
According to Kesley 's indepth social history of Aragon , " it was precisely those areas which had most important in December 1933 . . . which were now , in seeking to create a new pattern of economic and social organisation , to form the basis of libertarian Aragon " [ G. Kesley , Op. Cit. , p. 161 ]
Therefore , Caplan 's claim ( a claim , I should note , unsupported by any direct evidence that the CNT militia imposed collectivisation in Aragon by force is false .
The historian he quotes does not state this and the pre-war history of Aragon suggests that CNT support was far stronger than Caplan cares to admit .
This suggests that Kesley 's summary is truer that Caplan's :
" Libertarian communism and agrarian collectivisation were not economic terms or social principles enforced upon a hostile population by special teams of urban anarchosyndicalists . . . " [ G. Kesley , Op. Cit. , p. 161 ]
And I should add that Gabriel Jackson notes that " [ i ] n large portions of .
. .
Aragon practically no revolutionary violence occured . "
[ _ The Spanish Republic and the Civil War : 1931 - 1939 _ , p. 532 ]
This , combined with Kesley 's important work in demonstrating the massive and rapid growth of the Aragon CNT before the war , places Caplan 's claims in a new light .
Caplan then quotes Bolloten on how the collectives were formed and then states that " It barely took a month for Anarchists to set themselves up as the government of those parts of Aragon until their control , euphemistically dubbing themselves the ' Regional Defense Council of Aragon . ' "
This council was set up in a conference which contained delegates from those collectives which had been created as well as the militia columns .
It should be noted that most the militia columns opposed the setting up of the defense council .
Caplan considers that this council showed " the actions of the government of Aragon reveal the proclivities of undivided Anarchist rule . "
And what were the actions of this council ?
To encourage the formation of collectives and ensure that the front line was supplied with food .
The council also kept records of surplus ' delivered to it and used them to buy the collectives machinery ( for example , " The collective procured a Czech machine powered by an electric motor .
. .[ i]t was ' paid for ' by the collective 's produce .
. . with which it had run up a credit with the Council of Aragon " [ Frazer , p. 356 ] ) .
In other words , the collectives and the council allowed the pooling of resources which enabled new investments that otherwise the Aragon population would * never * have seen .
Next he notes that " Many people fled for fear of their lives .
Their land was seized almost immediately .
After all , who but a ' fascist ' would flee ?
The expropriation of land from anyone too terrified of the new regime to even wait to see what their new life would be like provided the nucleus for the collectives . "
In other words , those who could afford to flee did so .
And as they had fled , their land should have been left untouched ?
No , strangely enough , landless farm workers and tenent farmers took it over .
Given the role of cacique 's in rural life , it 's hardly surprising that many left .
Treating day - workers as " animals " becomes dangerous when these people are no longer held down by the state .
And , I must add , it seems strange that Caplan does not acknowledge the nature of oppression within the Aragon countryside when making the above statement .
Yes , many people did flee for their lives , because they had either supported the uprising ( and so favoured totalitarianism ) or knew that their lives would be in danger for their pre-war oppression of the rural population .
Caplan goes on to say :
" Farmers who fled for their lives were obviously not voluntary participants in the Anarchists ' collectivization experiment .
What about the remainder ?
One of the persistent claims of defenders of the Anarchists ' collectives was that the farmers were usually `free to choose ' : they could either join the collective , or continue to farm individually so long as they hired no wage labor . "
Obviously those who fled for their lives were not participants ( voluntary or forced ) of the collectivisations - * they were not there to take part *!
Perhaps Caplan is applying the usual neo-classical technique of confusing the owners of capital with the capital itself ?
As for those who were left , this was a population of day - workers , poor peasants with barely enough land to feed themselves , and various small and medium peasants .
Unsurprisingly , the day - workers and the poor ( who had flocked to join the CNT before the war ) also flocked to join the collectives .
Therefore , Caplan fails to discuss the differences in the rural population and so paints a picture of rural Aragon which is misleading to say the least .
Perhaps he thinks that only those who own land are worthy of mention when evaluating the Aragon collectives ?
If so , his argument fails to base itself on the reality of Aragon life and so is flawed .
He concludes that " The overwhelming majority of the evidence reveals that the collectives ' defenders are simply wrong " on the issue of peasants being " free to choose " , quoting Bolloten as saying :
" Although CNT - FAI publications cited numerous cases of peasant proprietors and tenant farmers who had adhered voluntarily to the collective system , there can be no doubt that an incomparable larger number doggedly opposed it or accepted it only under extreme duress . "
However , Caplan ignores an important point about rural Spain .
Not everyone was a peasant or tenant farmer .
As Bolloten points out :
" If the individual farmer viewed with dismay the swift and widespread collectivisation of agriculture , the farm workers of the Anarchosyndicalist CNT and the Socialist UGT saw it as the commencement of a new era . "
[ _ The Spanish Civil War_ , p. 63 ]
In other words , Caplan only considers one side of the picture and does not mention the other .
How objective -- obviously day labourers ( the ones " treated like animals " ) and other farm workers and poor peasants do not matter here .
This means that there is no such " overwhelming " body of evidence and what evidence that does exist suggests a conclusion radically different from Caplan's .
He then argues that " Bolloten goes on to explain that it was the presence of the Anarchist militia which made collectivization possible .
The Anarchist militants , convinced of their superior wisdom , arrived carrying a plan for a new way of life for the farmers :
" 'We militiamen must awaken in these persons the spirit that has been numbed by political tyranny , ' said an article in a CNT newspaper , referring to the villagers of Farlete .
' We must direct them along the path of the true life , and for that it is not sufficient to make an appearance in the village ; we must proceed with the ideological conversion of these simple folk . ' "
The arrogance and paternalism of these remarks is clear ; is there no possibility that the farmers might be right and the Anarchists might be wrong ? "
How dare the anarchists try to convince people of their ideas !
Of course , many people ( not just anarchists ) are convinced of the truth of their ideas and express them in such arrogant ways .
We have come across many " anarcho " capitalists who do so as well .
However , the question arises how did this " conversion " take place .
Here is an example of such " arrogance and paternalism " in action :
" There were , of course , those who did n't want to share and who said that each collective should take care of itself .
But they were usually convinced in the assemblies .
We would try to speak to them in terms they understood .
We 'd ask , " Did you think it was fair when the cacique [ local boss ] let people starve if there was n't enough work ? " and they said , " Of course not " .
They would eventually come around .
Do n't forget , there were three hundred thousand collectivists [ in Aragon ] , but only ten thousand of us had been members of the C.N.T..
We had a lot of educating to do " .
[ Felix Carrasquer , quoted in _ Free Women of Spain_ , p. 79 ]
In other words , by discussion and debate within democratic assemblies .
Hardly " arrogance " or " paternalism " and far more in fitting with true libertarian ideas - that people are convinced of new ideas by debate and by positive examples .
Caplan then quotes Bolloten as follows :
" The fact is that many small holders and tenant farmers were forced to join the collective farms before they had an opportunity to decide freely .
Although the libertarian movement tended to minimize the factor of coercion in the development of collectivized agriculture or even to deny it altogether , it was , on occasions , frankly admitted .
' During the first few weeks of the Revolution , ' wrote Higinio Noja Ruiz , a prominent member of the CNT , ' the partisans of collectivization acted according to their own revolutionary opinions .
They respected neither property nor persons .
In some villages collectivization was only possible by imposing it on the minority . ' "
In * some * villages , collectivisation may have only been possible by taking the land of a minority of big land owners .
That is true , as is the claim that many people were forced to join ( against CNT policy , it should be noted ) by local CNT members .
But , it should be noted , according to testimony in _Blood of Spain_ , only around 20 collectives in Aragon were " total " ones ( out of 450 ) .
Hence the " some " villages were not as widespread as Caplan suggests .
Caplan contineus :
" Fraser amply confirms Bolloten 's allegations .
' There was no need to dragoon them at pistol point : the coercive climate , in which ' fascists ' were being shot , was sufficient .
' Spontaneous ' and ' forced ' collectives existed , as did willing and unwilling collectivists within them . ' "
Of course a civil war would produce a " coercive climate , " particularly at the front line and so the CNT can hardly be blamed for that ( although Caplan does try ) .
As far as " forced " collectives go , the figures given by Fraser states that only around 20 were " total " ( ie forced ) collectives ( out of 450 ) and 30 % of the population felt safe enough * not* to join .
In other words , in the vast majority of collectives those joining could see that those who did not were safe .
These figures should not be discounted , as they give an indication of the movement and why it found people to support it in the face of both communist and capitalist attacks .
Caplan again :
" Fraser goes on to explain that rural collectivization was very different from urban collectivization ; while the latter was indeed typically carried out by the workers , the former was not :
' The collectivization , carried out under the general cover , if not necessarily the direct agency , of CNT militia columns , represented a revolutionary minority 's attempt to control not only production but consumption for egalitarian purposes and the needs of the war .
In this , agrarian collectives differed radically from the industrial collectives which regulated production only . ' "
So who * did* carry out the rural collectivisation ?
Fraser states that it was * not* the CNT militia columns .
So the original initiative must have come from the CNT membership in Aragon .
How did they do it ?
Its clear that they took the opportunity that the destruction of the state by the CNT militia created to suggest the creation of collectives .
In many villages , the CNT militants who lived and worked there took the opportunity to set up what they had " always talked about , " namely voluntary collectives [ Fraser , p. 352 ] .
Even in villages without a pre-war CNT presence , the voluntary nature of the experiment was stressed - " no one was to be mistreated " by villagers ( in the words of CNT representatives who visited one village [ Fraser , p. 360 ] ) and the decision to join the collective or not was left entirely in the names of the villagers .
Therefore , to state as Caplan goes that rural collectives were " typically " carried out by the CNT militia is simply false .
The evidence suggests otherwise .
It is of course clear that given the number of anarchist troops , many people joined the collectives " just to be safe , " but 30 % of the Aragon population felt safe enough to * not* to join .
In addition , we have indicated that the rural labourers supported the collectives , as did many poor farmers , as well as the growth of influence in the CNT before the war , so indicating that collectivisation may not have been as unpopular as Caplan is arguing .
In addition , it should be noted that in the examples Frazer gives the CNT made no attempt to determine * how * the collectives would work .
The decisions on how the collectives were to be organised and who would join was left in the hands of the villagers themselves .
This indicates that the villagers themselves * was * carried out by those involved .
Of course , given Caplan 's claim that the rural collectives were created by the CNT militia we would expect the militia column leaders to have initiated the process .
However , nothing could be further from the truth .
As Faser notes , the advice by one militia leader not to collectivise " was not heeded " [ p. 349 ] and " the CNT column leaders . . . opposed " the creation of the Council of Aragon [ p. 350 ] .
Hardly suggesting a militia organised collectivisation process , now is it ?
Caplan then claims that " Bolloten makes a few statements about the voluntary character of the Anarchist collectives which can be taken out of context to make it appear that Bolloten accepts the apologists ' view that rural collectivization was ' voluntary . ' " :
" While rural collectivization in Aragon embraced more than 70 percent of the population in the area under left - wing control , and many of the 450 collectives of the region were largely voluntary , it must be emphasized that this singular development was in some measure due to the presence of militiamen from the neighboring region of Catalonia , the immense majority of whom were members of the CNT and FAI . "
In other words , Caplan is suggesting that if we point out these figures then we are " apologists " of " anarcho - statism . "
However , these figures are interesting , for if the collectives * were * created by anarchist terror , why did only 70 % join and not 100 % ?
Caplan does not even raise the question .
Little wonder , for if the collectives had been created by anarchist terror or force , we would expect a figure of 100 % membership in the collectives .
This was not the case , indicating the basically voluntary nature of the experiment .
In addition , if the C.N.T. militia * had * forced peasants into collectives we would expect the membership of the collectives to peak almost overnight , not grow slowly over time .
However , this is what happened :
" At the regional congress of collectives , held at Caspe in mid-February 1937 , nearly 80 000 collectivists were represented from ' almost all the villages of the region . '
This , however , was but a beginning .
By the end of April the number of collectivists had risen to 140 000 ; by the end of the first week of May to 180 000 ; and by the end of June to 300 000 . "
[ Graham Kelsey , " Anarchism in Aragon , " pp. 60 - 82 , _Spain in Conflict 1931 - 1939 _ , Martin Blinkhorn ( ed ) , p. 61 ]
If the collectives has been created by force , then their membership would have been 300 000 in February , 1937 , not increasing steadily to reach that number four months later .
Neither can it be claimed that the increase was due to new villages being collectivised , as almost all villages had sent delegates in February .
This indicates that many peasants joined the collectives because of the advantages associated with common labour , the increased resources it placed at their hands and the fact that the surplus wealth which had in the previous system been monopolised by the few was used instead to raise the standard of living of the entire community .
So , around 30 % of the Aragon population felt safe enough * not* to join and membership within collectives increased slowly over time .
In other words , in the vast majority of collectives those joining could see that those who did not were safe .
In addition , the steady growth in the membership of the collectives indicates that they were not imposed by the C.N.T. militia , for if they had been imposed then we would expect a 100 % membership overnight .
Instead we see a steady growth over a period of months , hardly evidence which can support Caplan 's claims .
These figures should not be discounted , as they give an indication of the basically popular , spontaneous and voluntary nature of the movement .
Another of Bolloten 's statements is as follows :
" But in spite of the cleavages between doctrine and practice that plagued the Spanish Anarchists whenever they collided with the realities of power , it cannot be overemphasized that notwithstanding the many instances of coercion and violence , the revolution of July 1936 distinguished itself from all others by the generally spontaneous and far - reaching character of its collectivist movement and by its promise of moral and spiritual renewal .
Nothing like this spontaneous movement had ever occurred before " [ Op. Cit. , p. 78 ]
Bolloten also quotes a report on the district of Valderrobes :
" Collectivisation was nevertheless opposed by opponents on the right and adversaries on the left .
If the eternally idle who have been expropriated had been asked what they thought of collectivisation , some would have replied that it was robbery and others a dictatorship .
But , for the eldery , the day workers , the tenent farmers and small proprietors who had always been under the thumb of the big landowners and heartless usurers , it appeared as salvation " [ Op. Cit. , p. 71 ]
Notice the " generally spontaneous " character .
Imposed collectives are * not* spontaneous .
This indicates that Bolloten 's " few statements " are in fact more significant than Caplan likes to suggest .
As for the report Bolloten quotes , this reflects the diverse nature of the rural population and indicates that Caplan 's picture of it is distinctly false .
As these groups who supported the collectives were the ones treated " like animals " before the revolution , it is hardly surprising that Caplan ignores them .
They obviously do not count in his eyes ( as indicated by his statements above ) .
Caplan argues that " it is important to realize that Bolloten rightly regards the ' voluntary ' collectives as nearly as coercive as the ' forced ' collectives : "
" However , although neither the UGT nor the CNT permitted the small Republican farmer to hold more land than he could cultivate without the aid of hired labor , and in many instances he was unable to dispose freely of his surplus crops because he was compelled to deliver them to the local committee on the latter 's terms , he was often driven under various forms of pressure , as will be shown latter in this chapter , to attach himself to the collective system .
This was true particularly in villages where the Anarchosyndicalists were in the ascendant . "
Caplan states that " while the illegality of hiring wage labor seemed perfectly fair to the Anarchist militants , this fact plainly demonstrates that the mere existence of collectives hardly ensures that no one will voluntarily contract to work for a capitalist . "
However , as Bolloten notes , " the collective system of agriculture threaten to drain the rural labour market of wage workers " [ p. 62 ] , which it did seem to do ( as Bolloten notes , the wage labourers viewed the collectives in a vastly different light than the wealthier farmers ) .
And as the evidence Caplan presents of is of " brothers and neighbours " helping individualists this hardly counts as wage labour ( i.e. * non* economic reasons would have been the determining reason for aiding them ) .
Caplan states that " Fraser provides evidence that the prohibition against hiring wage labor was often even stricter than it seems .
. .
Plainly it is possible to preserve a nominal right to be an ' individualist , ' while in practice imposing so many unreasonable restrictions on them that the independent farmers break down and join the collective . "
Is this any more unreasonable than denying free access to land by wealthy land owners before the revolution ?
Is it the case that the wealthy should determine the rules and not the majority ?
And is " free riding " during a bitter civil war a " reasonable " activity ?
Could not the " restrictions " Caplan bemoans can be the result of the war ?
As for * some * of the restrictions Bolloten and others note is that " individualists " could not get the benefits of the collectives .

Mark Teixeira Hits A Broken Bat Home Run Against The Phillies
Total Pro Sports – Broken bat hits can often be good for a bloop single .
Sometimes they even get the fielders confused , creating just enough time for the batter to squeak out an infield hit .
But a broken bat home run ?
That ’s just unheard of , unless of course your name is Mark Teixiera , and you are playing in the new Yankee Stadium .
In a game with the Philadelphia Phillies yesterday afternoon , the Yankee slugger made his way to the plate in the 6th inning with no runners on , his team down by two .
One swing later and Texiera would hit his 13th home run of the season , with only half of the bat remaining in his hands .
The dinger would bring the Yanks within one , and they would eventually tie things up before losing in extra innings .
Some will say that Teixiera , whose numbers have been quickly improving with Alex Rodriguez back , used raw power to get that ball over the fence .
Others will blame the new stadium , which has surrendered 81 homers through its first 21 games .
It is likely that both played factors in the Teixiera bomb , but with the way the ball is flying out of the new Yankee Stadium these days , steroids may not be the only issue producing asterisks in the record books .
Here is footage recorded by a spectator behind home plate .
Look at Texiera ’s bat shatter after making contact .
Does n’t seem to prevent the ball from leaving the park though .

In this interview taped at QCon London 2009 Rich Hickey talks about Clojure , shortly before the 1.0 release .
The interview covers many of the interesting aspects of Clojure , particularly its support for concurrency .
Rich explains Clojure 's model of Software Transactional Memory ( STM ) , which uses the concept of Multiversion concurrency control ( MVCC ) .
But STM is only one way to use concurrency ; Clojure also supports many other concurrency primitives , such as Agents ( not to be confused with Actors - the difference is explained in the interview ) .
Next to the existing concurrency primitives , Rich also explains his ideas for a new one , which will make it easier to use Locks , maybe allowing to define acquisition order or other properties .
Developers familiar with mainstream OOP languages and interested in Clojure will be particularly interested in Clojure 's programming model .
Clojure supports Java's OOP model and can interact seamlessly with Java libraries and OOP concepts .
Idiomatic Clojure code , however , does n't rely on the OOP concepts of languages like Java or C#.
Runtime polymorphism is achieved through multimethods which is integrated with the Java class system , but can be made much more flexible with custom dispatch methods .
The interview discusses the reasons behind and advantages of this approach in detail .
Finally , the discussion also touches the topic of performance .
Clojure compiles to Java bytecodes and also has advantages over other dynamic languages , in that it allows to avoid polymorphism when it 's not needed .
It also allows arithmetic to be as fast as normal Java code ( ie. written in the Java language ) , as long as certain rules are obeyed .
InfoQ has covered Clojure previously , a good overview of many aspects of the system is Rich 's talk at the JVM Summit 2008 .
Watch " Rich Hickey on Clojure " .
Rocker Ozzy Osbourne is going off the rails against one of his Black Sabbath bandmates .
The “ Godfather of Heavy Metal ” claims guitarist Tony Iommi illegally claimed sole ownership of the band ’s name , in a filing with the US Patent and Trademark Office .
Osbourne is suing Iommi for a 50 percent interest in the “ Black Sabbath ” trademark , along with a portion of Iommi ’s profits from use of the name .
The Manhattan federal court suit also charges that Osbourne ’s “ signature lead vocals ” are largely responsible for the band ’s “ extraordinary success , ” noting that its popularity plummeted during his absence from 1980 through 1996 .
Flanked by a coterie of lawyers and lobbyists , Kenneth D. Lewis , Bank of America ’s embattled chief executive , walked into yet another Congressional hearing room on Thursday as the sole witness in a merger drama that has shadowed his banking empire for months .
But this time , lawmakers turned the spotlight on personalities who were not seated in the chamber : the federal officials who had pushed him to complete a troubled merger with Merrill Lynch late last year , despite knowing that huge losses riddled the once - mighty Wall Street firm .
Those officials , most prominently Ben S. Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , and Henry M. Paulson Jr. , the former secretary of the Treasury , will be called to testify before lawmakers soon .
But the twists and turns of their conversations with Mr. Lewis came into full view on Thursday , through scores of e-mail messages and other documents from the Federal Reserve and Bank of America obtained by The New York Times .
Bank of America announced its deal with Merrill in September , as financial markets were seizing up and Lehman Brothers fell to its knees .
But Mr. Lewis grew less certain once the bank discovered that Merrill ’s finances were worse than imagined , and considered pulling out of the deal .
Science journalism is under threat .
What can scientists do to help ?
What should any researcher expect from a journalist beyond the keen intelligence needed to see the newsworthiness of the researcher 's work , and the ability to spell his or her name correctly ?
For some scientists , the answer is probably ' Not much ' .
Many tend to think of science journalism as a kind of public - relations service , existing purely to explain new scientific findings to the masses .
They may well enjoy reading the results , and give points for a writer 's ability to convey the excitement of a discovery , but they will mainly judge an article on its scientific accuracy .
On top of this , some will see science journalism as an ally , useful for shaping the public 's understanding of science - related issues such as nuclear proliferation , stem cells or genetically modified crops — and , not incidentally , for making the case for a thriving research enterprise to public and politicians alike .
And a minority , moving beyond perceived self - interest , will point to the deeper value of journalism , which is to cast a fair but sceptical eye over everything in the public sphere — science included .
This kind of scrutiny is easy for researchers to applaud when a news report questions dodgy statistics , say , or dubious claims about uncertainties in evolution .
It is not so easy when the story takes a critical look at sloppy animal - research practices , overblown claims about climate change or scientists ' conflicts of interest .
But such examinations are to the benefit of the enterprise as a whole : society needs to see science scrutinized as well as regurgitated if it is to give science its trust , and journalists are an essential part of that process .
At the moment , unfortunately , journalism 's future is far from clear .
At the 6th World Conference of Science Journalists , which will be held next week in London , and of which Nature is a sponsor , there will probably be many attendees wondering if this is journalism 's swan song .
Readers — and small ads , once a reliable earner — are migrating to the Internet .
New business models in which papers are given away have caused damaging dislocations in some markets , as in Denmark .
This contraction is perhaps particularly bad news for journalists with specialist beats such as science — the kind of journalists who need an informed understanding of what they are writing about , and know which experts can provide context , and where appropriate criticism , of new results .
But publishers tend to see that kind of expertise as a luxury when money is tight , especially when the same space can be easily filled with material from press releases and wire services .
Scientists can do little to stem this bloodletting .
But whatever they can do to engage with those caught up in it , and ensure that questioning and informed science journalism persists , will be worthwhile .
If there is to be a transition to new — perhaps philanthropic — business models for in - depth reporting or new types of analytical media , science journalism will integrate into them all the better if scientists are taking an active interest in its health .
And if the future of the media truly is a dire landscape of top -100 lists , shouting heads and minimal attention span , then such efforts might at least defer the grim end .
Even amid the turmoil , however , scientists can help ensure that reporting about science continues to be both informed and accurate .
They can start by recognizing that they will increasingly be talking to reporters who have no experience in science at all .
A good start would be to have a look at the advice for academics speaking to journalists provided by Brad DeLong and Susan Rasky at the University of California , Berkeley ( http://tinyurl.com/nljleo).
Scientific societies , meanwhile , should redouble their efforts to help journalists working under a tight deadline find the experts they need to understand a subject .
Looking farther down the road , the scientific community should work with journalism schools and professional societies to ensure that journalism programmes include some grounding in what science is , and how the process of experiment , review and publication actually works .
Science and journalism are not alien cultures , for all that they can sometimes seem that way .
They are built on the same foundation — the belief that conclusions require evidence ; that the evidence should be open to everyone ; and that everything is subject to question .
Both groups are comprised of professional sceptics .
And whether it 's directed towards an experiment or a breaking news story , each can appreciate the other 's critical eye .

All the evidence suggests there is a supermassive black hole lurking in the centre of our galaxy .
We ’ve known as much for quite some time , but it was n’t until recently that we ’ve been able to confirm it .
As it turns out , most galactic nuclei are predicted to contain supermassive black holes in their cores .
The Milky Way ’s supermassive black hole is called Sagittarius A* , a well - known compact radio source used by radio astronomers as an instrumental calibration target .
The black hole driving this emission has been calculated to weigh in at a whopping 4×106 solar masses .
So , we ’re certain Sgr A * is a supermassive black hole , how can we use it ?
Using our Sun as an example , stellar physicists use the Sun as an up - close laboratory so they can better understand stars located many light years away .
It is an up - close star that we can study in great detail , gleaning all kinds of information , helping us learn more about how stars work in general .
What if Sgr A * could be used in a similar way , not in the study of stellar physics , but in the pursuit to understand the dynamics of black holes throughout the Universe ?
This is exactly the question Vincent Fish and Sheperd Doeleman from the MIT Haystack Observatory ponder in a recent publication .
The researchers make an important point early in their paper :
Due to its proximity at ~ 8 kpc [ 26,000 ly ] , Sgr A * has the largest apparent event horizon of any known black hole candidate .
In other words , the supermassive black hole in the centre of the galaxy is the largest observable black hole in the sky .
As Sgr A * is so massive , its event horizon is therefore bigger , providing a sizeable target for Earth - based observatories to resolve .
Although the black hole is quite a distance from us , the size of its event horizon more than makes up for its location , it even trumps closer , less massive stellar black holes .
Sgr A* could therefore be our own personal black hole laboratory that we can study from Earth .
But there ’s a catch :
How do you directly observe a black hole that ’s 26,000 light years away ?
Firstly , you need an array of telescopes , and the array of telescopes need to have very large baselines ( i.e. the ‘ scopes need to be spread apart as wide as possible ) .
This means you would need an international array of collaborating observatories to make this happen .
The authors model some possible results using many observatories as part of a long baseline interferometry ( VLBI ) campaign .
As Sgr A * ’s emissions peak in the millimetre wavelengths , a VLBI system observing in millimetre wavelengths could spot a resolved black hole shadow in the heart of Sg. A* .
They also say that existing millimetre observations of Sgr A * show emission emanating from a compact region offset from the centre of the black hole , indicating there is some kind of structure surrounding the black hole .
The results of their models are striking .
As can be seen in the three images at the top of this post , a definite black hole shadow could be observed with just 7 observatories working together .
With 13 observatories , the resolution improves vastly .
Could we be on the verge of tracking real - time flaring events occurring near the black hole ?
Perhaps we ’ll soon be able to observe the rotation of the supermassive black hole as well as accretion disk dynamics .
If this is the case , we may be able to also witness the extreme relativistic effects predicted to be acting on the volume of space surrounding Sgr A* .
The best news is that technological advancements are already in progress , possibly heralding the start of the construction of the world ’s first “ Event Horizon Telescope . ”

PITTSBURGH --
On a night the Pittsburgh Penguins felt satisfied to limit Alex Ovechkin to one goal , they needed 3 1/2 periods and a huge disparity in shots and power plays before figuring out how to beat the Washington Capitals and whiz kid goalie Simeon Varlamov .
They did it by turning Sidney Crosby , the goal scorer , back into Crosby , the exceptional setup man , and shaking NHL scoring champion Evgeni Malkin out of a slump that was threatening to put them out of the playoffs .
Kris Letang scored his first career playoff goal on a shot from the point at 11:23 of overtime after Crosby 's faceoff win and the Penguins avoided going down three games to the Capitals by winning 3 - 2 in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Wednesday night .
Letang 's shot deflected off Capitals defenseman Shaone Morrisonn and past the 21 - year - old Varlamov , who had stopped nearly everything the Penguins threw at him while making 39 saves .
Washington scored first -- on a goal by , who else , Ovechkin -- then let Pittsburgh control the play for most of the game .
The Penguins led 42 - 23 in shots and 7 - 2 in power plays .
" We knew we had Tanger set up for a one - timer if we won it clean , " Crosby said .
" I just got it back to [ Mark ] Eaton and we got a good bounce there .
We 've been working on those plays , so it 's nice to see when it works . "
Just in time , too , as the victory prevented a near - certain series loss for Pittsburgh .
No NHL team has rallied from a 3 - 0 playoff deficit in 34 years .
" The guys could have got frustrated , we kept with it and stuck with it and we eventually got rewarded , " Crosby said .
" Any time you go down 2 - 0 on the road , you know when you come home you 've got to respond . "
Crosby did n't score in Game 3 but set up goals by Malkin and Letang for his first assists in six games .
Letang , a defenseman , was uncertain he would play until earlier Wednesday because of a shoulder injury , then helped the Penguins win their sixth consecutive overtime playoff game , five by 3 - 2 scores .
" You obviously like to take the first one on the road , it 's probably the easiest , you come in and they 're all excited , but it was a great game and now we need to refocus and try to get a win on Friday [ in Game 4 ] , " said David Steckel , who lost the faceoff to Crosby .
Malkin , quiet in the first two games as Crosby and Ovechkin dominated with four goals each , snapped off a wrist shot from the high slot on a power play with 4:59 remaining in the third period to give Pittsburgh a 2 - 1 edge .
" He [ Malkin ] was at another level , " Penguins coach Dan Bylsma said .
" He was dominant with the puck and he had the goal , which was fantastic . "
Despite getting his eighth goal of the postseason and fifth in three games , Ovechkin was largely controlled , although he had five shots .
" We did n't play our game , " Ovechkin said .
" I do n't want to talk about Varlamov .
I do n't want to talk about the referees , too .
They only had two penalties , it 's kind of a joke . "
Capitals coach Bruce Boudreau said Varlamov nearly stole the game , and added he disliked the officiating nearly as much as Ovechkin .
" When you get a goaltending effort like that , you have to win because they do n't come around every day , " Boudreau said .
" I think we might have deserved the penalties , but they sure as hell deserved a few more than they got . "
Pittsburgh pressed constantly for the go - ahead goal after Ruslan Fedotenko tied it near the midpoint of the second period , throwing flurry after flurry at Varlamov -- the cool - as - it - gets rookie who played only six games during the season .
Malkin finally got a shot through with Bill Guerin screening in front .
But it was n't enough to win it .
The Capitals , scoreless and badly outshot since Ovechkin scored off a seemingly harmless dump-in by Mike Green 83 seconds into the game , got the tying goal with 1:50 to play on a bad - angle shot by Nicklas Backstrom from behind the goal line .
With Washington on its first power play since before the halfway point of the first period , Ovechkin got the puck down low to Backstrom and he banked it in off goalie Marc - Andre Fleury 's back .
As in each of the previous two games of a tightly played , physical and fast - paced series , the visiting team got the first goal and controlled the early tempo only to have the home team regain momentum .
The Penguins , badly outplayed in the opening 10 minutes , tied it at 9:29 of the second when Fedotenko wristed a shot past Varlamov for the first goal of the series by a Penguins forward other than Crosby .

They filled it with leopard - skin chairs , pinball machines , antique Coca - Cola signs and six sports cars .

Solang is an open source photo manager for the Gnome Desktop that looks very similar to the Gnome in - built F - Spot .
This similarity is simply due to the use of F - Spot icons in Solang .
Many have also tagged the new - born Solang as a Mono - Free version and alternative to F - Spot .
Well , that its Mono - Free is true , Solang is written in C++ anf GTK + , that it ’s a ported version of F - Spot has still to be confirmed .
Solang still does n’t have a stable .deb for your Ubuntu , you ’ll have to compile the git version of Solang .
But you ’ll also have to deal with its numerous dependencies .
To get started , first install Solang dependencies the fast way .
$ : sudo apt - get install libcairomm - 1.0 - dev libexiv2 - dev libgdamm3.0 - dev libgda3 - sqlite \
libgdl - 1 - dev libglade2 - dev libgphoto2 - dev libgtkimageview - dev \
libgtkmm -2.4- dev libmagick++- dev
Compile and install with
$ : git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/solang.git
$ : mv solang solang - 0.1+ git
$ : cd solang - 0.1+ git
$ : ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr / --sysconfdir=/etc/
$ : make
$ : sudo make install
If you get smoothly to the end , then run from your command - line or Alt +F2 with the command solang
Permit me to say compiled Solang “ partially ” works .
You can import photos , increase thumbnails size , enlarge photos .
Issues arise with tagging and tag - searching .
It has no Right - Click Menu – strange enough and no image - rotation .
The UI is what you see in the screenshot above .
The compilation on my Ubuntu 9.04 took more than ten minutes but went thru .
The success of this projects depends not on its being Mono - free , but if it will get major improvements in the near future and much need extensions , why not .

« Why the Labor government will not fix the ayslum system | Main | Can we separate ? » Who is Sarah Palin to complain about tastelessness ?
( Note : in this entry , I seem to be suggesting that Sarah Palin had no right to reply to David Letterman ’s disgusting comment .
That was wrong , as I discuss ( Note : in this entry , I seem to be suggesting that Sarah Palin had no right to reply to David Letterman ’s disgusting comment .
That was wrong , as I discuss here . )
Paul Mulshine ’s June 21 column has some hilarious and also devastating commentary on Sarah Palin , especially this :
The joke [ that David Letterman told about Palin ’s daughter ] may have been tasteless .
But taste is not Palin ’s strength .
She first came to prominence parading her pregnant daughter and the daughter ’s soon - to - be - ex - fiance around the national Republican convention .
When I read this my head exploded at the rightness of Mulshine ’s point .

When I read this my head exploded at the rightness of Mulshine ’s point .
And I wondered how I could have failed to make the connection myself , given my fierce condemnation last September of Sarah Palin and John McCain for displaying the pregnant Bristol and her boyfriend together at the GOP convention , thus legitimizing out of wedlock pregnancy at the highest level of our national life and essentially destroying social conservatism .
Compared to the cultural and moral damage that Palin wreaked then , Letterman ’s joke was nothing .
How dare Palin and her “ conservative ” champions complain about Letterman ’s joke , when what they did and approved was infinitely worse — and , in fact , set the stage for Letterman ’s joke ?
Letterman joked about a girl getting knocked up ; but Palin put her knocked - up daughter on stage before the eyes of the world .
And here ’s another thing .
When Letterman apologized , he specifically apologized for not having realized that the daughter accompanying Palin at Yankee stadium that day was her second daughter , the 14 year old Willow .
He had been under the impression that it was Bristol who was with Palin that day .
So he apologized for joking inadvertently about a 14 year old girl getting knocked up .
But what happened next was that the “ conservatives ” redoubled their attack on Letterman , because he had ONLY apologized for the inadvertent joke about Willow , NOT for the knocked - up - daughter joke in itself .
Meaning that the “ conservatives ” thought that the joke would have been equally offensive even if Bristol had been the daughter in question .
Meaning that they regarded a joke about Bristol getting knocked up — after Palin herself put the unmarried pregnant Bristol and boyfriend stage center at the GOP convention , an act that the “ conservatives ” ecstatically greeted and celebrated — as a grave insult , an intolerable outrage , etc .
All of which shows even further how the “ conservatives ” are hopelessly out to lunch .
Here is Mulshine ’s column .
It has long been my contention that the most regrettable development in American politics has been the takeover of the Republican Party by those denizens of the heartland who tended to infest the Democratic Party until quite recently .
And I f3ind further confirmation of this in the events involving Sarah Palin and that joke told by David Letterman .
The joke involved may have been tasteless .
But taste is not Palin ’s strength .
She first came to prominence parading her pregnant daughter and the daughter ’s soon - to - be - ex - fiance around the national Republican convention .
Recently the lad has been making the rounds of talk shows informing the country that Palin let him share a room with the poor girl when she was a mere 17 years old .
Perhaps I ’m revealing my age , but when I was a young lad in the tutelage of the nuns , that sort of lapse would have been considered more scandalous than a mere joke on late - night television .
Yet the more Palin ’s supporters hear of this kind of thing , the greater their ardor for her potential presidential candidacy in 2012 .
Most of these people seem to perceive Palin as some sort of a conservative political leader .
Nonsense .
She has never given any indication that she has an identifiable political philosophy , conservative or liberal .
She is not so much a political figure as a sort of national fertility symbol , the Venus of Willendorf reborn as the Venus of Wasilla .
Palin ’s supporters argue that there is some sort of liberal media conspiracy against her .
Again , nonsense .
The liberals in the media love to promote Palin as the face of conservatism , for the obvious reason that this makes conservatives look stupid .
But to call her a conservative is to deprive the word of all meaning .
She simply flails about , denouncing such key conservative concepts as school vouchers or tort reform when they conflict with her urges .
There is not the slightest evidence she is even aware of the great issues of the moment , such as the debate between traditional conservatives and the so - called “ neo ” conservatives on the proper uses of the U.S. military .
The same goes for monetary policy , legal theory , education reform and so on .
[ LA replies : I do n’t think that the debate between neocons and paleocons is exactly at the top of the national agenda at the moment , in fact paleocons are completely marginalized , so I do n’t think it ’s realistic for Mulshine to think that Palin ought to know about that .
Politicians much more in the know that Palin do n’t know about it . ]
Comparisons are often made between Palin and Ronald Reagan , but this is absurd .
Reagan had ideas and was capable of putting them down on paper , which he did for decades .
If he were alive and in his prime today , Reagan would no doubt be taking part in the conservative critique of the Beltway Republicans .
He would almost certainly be in the same camp as Ron Paul , the Texas congressman who so presciently predicted the current crisis during his run for president in 2008 .
But imagine Palin writing something on either finance or foreign affairs that could be taken seriously .
This is unthinkable .
Her appeal is entirely emotional , not intellectual .
I was discussing this with a conservative friend of mine who does not share my views on the Alaska governor .
He conceded that she probably could not author a coherent piece on any issue .
Though he himself is an excellent writer , he did not hold this against her .
He argued in her defense that only perhaps 1 percent of the people in America have the intelligence to write coherently on politics .
I ’d put the number a bit higher , but even at 1 percent that leaves us with a good 3 million people smarter than Palin .
Imagine the British electing such a person to fill the job once held by Winston Churchill .
This is unthinkable .
A better parallel would be found in Venezuela , where a former Miss Universe narrowly lost the presidency to Hugo Chavez in 1998 .
It is a measure of how far the Republican Party has fallen that Palin still enjoys broad support in the party despite her manifest inabilities .
I trace the problem back to the 1980s when the so - called “ New Right ” emerged to oppose the Old Right that stretched back through Barry Goldwater to Robert Taft .
The Old Right was partial to small government , balanced budgets and tight money , three concepts that became anathema to the GOP once the party united behind red-state favorite George W. Bush in the 2000 election .
That led directly to the debacle of 2008 .
As for the future of the party , I ’m pessimistic .
When we Baby Boomers reach retirement , we will start demanding all sorts of social services the country cannot afford .
Meanwhile , young people are only slowly waking up to the disaster that awaits them .
The only bright spot I see is that many of the young are getting interested in the Old Right policies .
When I go on the internet and out to political events , I find there ’s a lot of intellectual energy in conservative circles these days .
It would be wonderful if the media would start paying attention to it and stop paying attention to Palin . [ end of Mulshine column ] - end of initial entry - Laura W. writes :
That ’s a great column by Mulshine .
He raises all the obvious points .
The issue of whether Palin actually let her daughter spend time alone in her bedroom with her boyfriend is an important one that deserves attention and verification .
If it ’s true , Palin is not a friend to family values , but an enemy .
Yes , her personal life matters .
I am mystified by the widespread claim that Palin has charisma .
I think she is popular for three reasons .
One , she is perceived by eternally self - flagellating Republicans as a way around the supposed stodginess of conservatism : the feminist energy , the vitality , the cool husband and kids !
Two , she opposes abortion .
Three , she is physically attractive .
These hardly make presidential qualifications .
Interestingly , Bristol Palin , in her recent interviews , has to her credit refused to participate in the glamorization of single motherhood .
She has said , in so many words , “ This is a colossal drag . ” Bristol and Levi are now permanent fixtures of the tabloids .
On this fact alone , Palin must be electable — She has name recognition !
LA replies : LA replies : Laura wonders why Palin has charisma .
But she gives two reasons herself : ( 1 ) “ the feminist energy , the vitality , the cool husband and kids , ” and ( 2 ) “ she is physically attractive . ”
The question of Palin ’s charisma or popularity is a distinct question from her presidential qualifications .
Laura replies : Laura replies : I guess I think of charisma in a politician as connected with their message .
They have something to say and they say it with style .
LL writes : LL writes : Like Laura W. , I am immune to Palin ’s alleged charms .
From that sloppy mop of an up - do , to what you yourself referred to as that “ ditzy expression , ” to the way she embarrassed herself and the debate forum by winking at the camera like the cut -rate beauty queen she is , to demonstrating a complete inability to go off script and answer questions cogently and persuasively — she ’s a distaff Bush .
I suspect that may be what really resonates with her supporters .
LA replies : LA replies : Winking at the camera like a cut -rate beauty queen !
LOL .
Actually I personally was not offended by the wink .
And I like her distinctive hairstyle , as I ’ve said before .
It was other things that I ’ve objected to .
However , even the things I liked about her , along with the things I did n’t , started to add up to an overall impression of silliness .
Once I began to see her this way ( I think this was after the election , though of course I had disapproved of her nomination from the start , even before the announcement of the Bristol situation ) , I could n’t take her seriously any more .
She has to overcome that impression of silliness and lightness if she is to be a plausible presidential contender .
And that ’s leaving aside the little problem that she ’s not a conservative .
LL replies :
You did n’t think it was inappropriate in the context of a national political debate ?
I guess I like to see more of what the pundits are wont to call “ gravitas ” in a vice - presidential candidate .
To me that gesture exemplified the silliness to which you refer , which combined with her non-conservative positions renders her completely unviable as a political contender .
Could you see this woman dealing with the mullahs ?
( Not , to be fair , that any female could ; one of the reasons I think the American presidency is still a man ’s job . )
LA replies : LL replies : LA replies :
But if you go back to VFR discussions in Aug / Sept ( link is on sidebar of main page ) , you ’ll see that I found her personality , including the ditsy aspect , intriguing and different , and not necessarily disqualifying .
She struck me as an American original .
Paul Mulshine writes : Paul Mulshine writes :
On a lighter note , I was in Trenton yesterday chatting with my fellow journalists about Palin .
One reporter , a healthy young male , told me that lwhen she was in Philadelphia last year he was curious if she was really as hot as some news accounts made her out to be .
So he was giving her a thorough up - and - down checking - out when she caught his eye .
At that point , he said , “ She winked at me . ” I had a good laugh at that .
And I suspect that a good part of her appeal is that she comes across as someone with that sort of down - to - earth appeal .
I suspect that if I knew her on the level of local politics I would probably find her extremely likable and altogether adequate to the task at hand .
The problem , of course , is that Alaska has no more people than the New Jersey county in which I live and I suspect that her acumen is at roughly the level of a county leader in this state .
The idea of her sorting out the Mideast is frightening .
And of course we ’ve just had the experience of having a not - so - bright red - state pol who was at the mercy of his advisers .
It ’s as if this crowd learned nothing from the Bush years .
LA replies : LA replies : Going off topic for a moment , but I think it ’s a myth that Bush was at the mercy of his advisors .
I think he was completely the one in charge , And that was the problem .
It makes no sense to complain about his lack of intelligence , and then say that what was wrong with his administration was that people with better understanding then himself were running things .
No , the problem is that he is a man of very limited understanding , who gloms onto simple phrases and formulae that he feels comfortable with , and then just keeps repeating them .
Of course , the neocons , the best and brightest ( ho ho , hah hah ) , did exactly the same thing , repeating brainless formulae year after year and thinking that this was a policy .
Carol Iannone writes : Carol Iannone writes : I ’m no fan of hers but I do think she is very pretty and well turned out too , hairdo , style of dress , etc. Lydia McGrew writes : I disagree with you in comparing Sarah Palin ’s treatment of her daughter in the campaign to Letterman ’s joke (s ) .
You say , “ Letterman joked about a girl getting knocked up ; but Palin put her knocked - up daughter on stage before the eyes of the world . ”
First of all , you say “ how dare ” Palin and her supporters be outraged at Letterman .
For starters , consider that at first they assumed , reasonably enough , that he had a clue as to which daughter he was talking about .
Yes , I know , they still condemned him after he explained his careless mistake , but let ’s start with the situation the day after he made the joke .
( Two jokes , actually , I gather , on successive nights . )
In that case , the jokes would have been about a girl against whose chastity nothing is known , who has never been “ knocked up , ” and who is only 14 years old .
That ’s pretty major outrageous stuff .
It even sounds worse when you think about it that way .
Moving on to what he was actually trying to do :
He was actually trying to make light of a teenage girl ’s getting “ knocked up ” and was implying , by the way that he did it , that she is absolutely promiscuous and would have sex with total strangers much older than herself .
We do n’t have reason to think anything this bad about Bristol .
Moreover , if we ’re going to talk about tastelessness , it is tasteless , very tasteless , to make such jokes .
You can say that such jokes are what late - night television is about .
That may be true .
But that just means that late - night TV is very tasteless .
No news there .
But the title of your post is “ Who is Sarah Palin to Complain About Tastelessness ? ”
And Mulshine ’s column , which you endorse , says that Letterman ’s joke “ may have been tasteless ” but “ taste is not Palin ’s strength . ”
All this implies that Palin is at least as tasteless as Letterman if not more so .
This seems to me just completely wrong .
Are we really going to say that Palin ’s bringing her pregnant daughter and boyfriend with the rest of her family on - stage with her was more tasteless than dirty jokes on late - night TV about that same girl having sex with any man she runs into in New York ?
Such a claim boggles the mind .
It seems to me that if you wanted to say something to the effect that it was “ worse for America ” or “ worse for conservatism ” for Palin to do what she did than for Letterman to make his joke , we ’d be in interesting territory .
I myself am not inclined to think as ill of Palin on the matter of Bristol as you are .
In fact , I think we differ quite a lot there .
But I can see why you say what you say , and it seems to me a case where reasonable people can disagree .
And even someone like me who does not agree with your extremely negative assessment of Palin ’s decisions there might agree that , because her decisions affected the way conservatives think , they might have a bad effect on conservatives , whereas Letterman ’s making dirty jokes is n’t likely to affect conservatives one way or another and hence cannot harm them .
But once you put it on the level of comparing tastelessness , there really is no comparison at all .
In the one case we ’re talking about whole life decisions , decisions about handling one ’s family and politics , made by people whom we ( and I hope even you ) can think of as trying to act honorably and to do the right thing , even though you consider the final decisions themselves ( to take the nomination , to put the boyfriend on - stage , etc. ) to have been disastrously incorrect .
In the other case , we ’re just talking about a comedian who wanted to make a dirty joke on national television about a young woman , a woman so young that by his own admission he had to check with his staff before the show to make sure that she ’d had her birthday since the campaign and is now 18 !
On the tasteless - o - meter , the two do n’t even come close .
LA replies : LA replies :
This is an interesting comment and the issue seems to revolve around whether the presentation of the unwed with - child couple at the convention was tasteless or something else .
Clearly it was extremely tasteless , but , as I indicated in the original entry , that was not the worst of it , not by a long shot .
The worst of it was the undercutting of traditional morality at the highest and most symbolic level of our national life , and by the America ’s “ conservative ” party no less .
It ’s late now and I ’ll have to think about what you ’ve said and will have a full response to you tomorrow .
Paul Mulshine replies to earlier LA comment : Paul Mulshine replies to earlier LA comment : I would agree with the proviso that he entrusted foreign policy to Cheney and that prior to 9/11 Cheney was the very height of sobriety and seriousness in that regard .
But I think the real question is why Cheney panicked and bought into the entire nutty neocon vision .
I do n’t think Cheney will tell us .
But I suspect he simply was not up to the moment .
He was just a small - town kid from Wyoming and he may have been in way over his head .
Meanwhile Bush II seems to have had issues with the more cautious approach of Bush I ’s advisors .
Also , Bush II had gone out of his way to avoid picking up the sort of knowledge of the world that would have come with some international travel .
I ca n’t for the life of me comprehend how a person with all of those opportunities for world travel decided to stay at home .
I myself blew an entire college loan hitching around Europe and had to spend the next semester living in the college newspaper office , but it was a great experience that gave me some small idea of the complexity of life in foreign countries .
In his case I suspect the lack of curiosity was as bad as the lack of intelligence .
Mark P. writes : Mark P. writes : I ’ve read your article on Sarah Palin but I do not think that you are correct in your assessment of her .
I also believe that you misunderstand exactly why she is so popular among conservatives .
While I agree that out - of - wedlock births and some of her associations are extremely negative , in the end , these are really just nominal issues .
Most conservatives seem to be ignoring that because they are looking at her actions in total over a lifetime , not matters that happened very recently .
To understand why Sarah Palin is so loved among conservatives , it is important to understand why she is so hated by the left .
Basically , Palin is hated because a ) she represents the classic conflict between Eastern and Western states of the United States , and b ) her example is a direct challenge to the current model of female empowerment .
The East / West conflict is due to a disagreement over the proper value - ratio of land vs. labor going back to the Founding of the United States itself .
Eastern states wanted to maintain a ratio of expensive land and cheap labor .
They wanted government to provide subsidies and regulations to benefit industries and infrastructure that would increase the value of their land by providing products to sell in overseas markets .
Western states , on the other hand , wanted to maintain a ratio of cheap land and expensive labor .
They wanted the Indian tribes removed , the land essentially given away for “ free ” , and the full development of the various mining , lumber , oil and other interests plus the transportation infrastructure needed to move it .
Eastern states did not , of course , want any of these developments because it would reduce the value of Eastern land .
In other words , this is the classic conflict between Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams .
Like Palin , Jackson was equally vilified by Eastern moneyed interests .
The first plank of Sarah Palin ’s popularity is , therefore , the fact that she would support the defense , resource extraction , transportation and manufacturing industries that dominate the hometown she came from and that employ the vast majority of white , straight men .
The second plank of Sarah Palin ’s popularity is her choice of lifestyle .
Remember , the typical model of female empowerment is to move to a big city ; attend a fancy university ; position oneself in the media / PR / entertainment / law / I- banking / consulting / political professions ; spend your 20 ’s having affairs with men of high status and power ; marry an alpha male who ’s a partner in some big firm ; and have a designer yuppie - baby at 35 or 40 .
Sarah Palin rejected all of that .
Instead of moving to a big city , she stayed in a small town .
Instead of playing around , she settled down .
Instead of marrying some high - flying lawyer , she married a blue - collar guy ; Instead of a baby at 35 , she had her first at 25 .
More importantly , Sarah Palin has proven the viability of the early - onset nuclear - family w/ extended - family - support model in helping a woman have - it - all : First raise your family and help your husband ; then start your career with your husband ’s and relatives ’ help .
Modern women absolute loathe this .
They do not want to be housewives , living in small towns , married to average guys .
They want to be Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City .
Meanwhile , men love this because Sarah Palin chose a lifestyle most men can actually provide .
Does this make up for an out - of wedlock birth ?
I do n’t knowâ ¦but it is something to consider .
Btw , this is not my idea .
I ’ve adapted this argument from the following sites : here and here .
I would highly recommend you read them .
LA replies : LA replies :
An assumption underlying Mark ’s argument is that is if the left loathes and fears a person , then that person is a real conservative and the right should support that person .
This is part of the larger mainstream conservative mistake of moving in mental orbit around the leftist view of the world .
The left with lunatic intensity loathed and feared G.W. Bush , seeing him as a fascist , racist , extreme right winger , the embodiment of evil .
The mainstream conservatives , seeing Bush being demonized by the left , rushed with all their energy to his defense , becoming his loyal knights and retainers .
And Bush , who was , of course , no conservative , led the right , and America , into disaster .
So here ’s a blunt question for Mark and the legions of conservatives who would repeat with Palin the same ruinous mistake they made with Bush : have n’t you people learned anything ?
My advice to conservatives is : Stop reacting to the left .
Stop seeing the world through leftist eyes .
Stop making the insane left — the left which , the more liberal a Republican like Bush is , they more it attacks him as an extreme right - winger — your guide to what constitutes conservatism .
Have your own view of things , your own standards , independent of the left .
That ’s where real conservatism begins , a conservatism capable of taking charge , rather than a conservatism that consists of following the left , a conservatism that consists of situating itself just to the right of the ever - leftward moving left and calling that position conservatism .

I have no idea why Mark says Palin has proven the viability of this model .
Bristol Palin , the recent rise of divorce , the decline of manners and civility , the increase in stupidity and immorality among children , and the widely - trumpeted unhappiness of women as measured in recent surveys — these are all explicit proof this sort of model does not work no matter how you tweak it .
Palin is popular among those who just want it all to go away and among parents who want confirmation of private choices that are not workable for society at large .
Let me give a few reasons why it is an unrealistic model : 1 . If you start having your kids when you are 25 and have four , spacing them a practical two years apart , your youngest child will be ten years old when you are 41 .
Even then , children require at least three meals a day and clean clothes .
Does Mark mean 41 is a good time to start a professional career ?
Most professions are best begun in the decade right after school , and for obvious reasons .
Women have n’t rejected this pattern of delayed career after four kids because they ’re into “ Sex and the City . ”
They ’ve rejected it because it does n’t make sense .
2 . How realistic is it for many people to have family to help them ?
Will Palin be babysitting full - time for her daughters in a few years ?
3 . Bristol Palin ’s story is confirmation that teenaged girls need a mother ’s attention .
Fathers do n’t possess the same talent .
4 . Most people do n’t want to live as an extended - family commune .
They want privacy for themselves and their children .
5 . Most married couples cannot sustain a bond without private time together .
Women are n’t in the mood for sex after ten hours at the office , three hours doing housework and four hours with the kids .
Sarah Palin has been lucky .
Most women cannot put together the sort of help she has received nor can this possibly be sustained over generations .
In Russia , this has all been tried .
The birth rate is a disaster .
Today , everyone has one kid because when it comes time for the grandmothers to babysit , they can only handle one .
The fact that some families make it all work here does n’t change the sad reality that it does n’t work for society at large .
June 30 Mark P replies : I thought I gave very good reasons for explaining why Sarah Palin is supported by conservatives beyond the usual marker of being hated by the Left.
LA replies : LA replies : First , I was responding to your statement , “ To understand why Sarah Palin is so loved among conservatives , it is important to understand why she is so hated by the left . ”
That was your set - up .
You were saying that she ’s loved by conservatives for the same reasons she ’s hated by the left .
Second , your idea that she ’s HATED by the left because she believes in the development of land and resources is an example of theorizing running amok and cannot be taken seriously .
She might be opposed and disliked for issues like that , not hated .
Third , regarding your main reason why she ’s hated by liberals and loved by conservatives , that she represents a successful model of the alternative conservative lifestyle in which the woman by having her children first and her career later can have it all , as Laura W. has shown above , Palin does not actually represent such a successful model .
She had to neglect her children in order to pursue her career , which makes her more like the type of women who hate her .
Her absence from home was most likely a factor in Bristol ’s becoming pregnant , as was powerfully argued by Laura last Sepember when she pointed out that teenage girls who have a lot of maternal involvement in their lives rarely become pregnant , and by an article in the National Inquirer which backed up Laura ’s insight with this : Sarah has had a stormy relationship with Bristol , said the family source .
“ Sarah had a hard time controlling her , ” said the source .
“ She is so busy with her political career that it seems she often does n’t have time for Bristol .
“ While Todd is often around the house , there are issues their teenage daughter does n’t want to share with her father . ”
Also , Palin evidently had no problem with presenting the unmarried - with - child couple to the world at the National Republican Convention , which indicates anything other than some afflatus of traditional values .
So it comes down to liberals hating Sarah Palin for symbolic reasons ( seeing her as traditional ) , and conservatives defending her for those same symbolic reasons .
But since the symbolic reasons are , at least in certain key respects , not true ( she ’s not traditional , but a woman who has chosen career over caring for her children ) , the conservatives who have been supporting her as a conservative have been off - base , as I ’ve been arguing since last September .

I realized a little late that I should not have used this device .

I will deal with Laura ’s commentary later .

What matters here is not the relationship between Sarah and her daughter .
That is not what makes this family conservative .
What makes it conservative is the fact that an average , blue collar guy ( Todd Palin ) married an attractive woman of his physical equivalence who agreed from the outset to have a large family with him , and that he managed to hang on to that family for the next 20 years ( so far ) .
Moreover , Todd Palin built this family without the financial benefits of , say , the Pelosi clan or the external structural support of the Romney clan .
In other words , he built this family without anything more to count on than Sarah ’s willingness and acceptance of him as he is and the lifestyle he could provide .
The fact that Sarah Palin did not enter the blue - state sexual tournament like so many women at her level of attractiveness speaks well of her character .
Women would be a much better sex if they were more like Sarah Palin .
As for the out - of - wedlock birth , every conservative family is an island in an ocean of liberalism .
Sometimes , the ocean floods the beach .
Bristol ’s pregnancy seems less to do with her relationship with her mother and more to do with the fact that Bristol is very attractive , is bound to get a lot of attention from boys , and will , like most women , succumb to the charms of any good - looking , lantern - jawed , smooth - talking badboy that crosses her path .
Bristol is the tragic outcome of a society that grants women sexual freedom … and there is probably little Sarah Palin could do about that short of an abortion or a convent .
[ LA replies :
Yes , there are prevalent forces pushing people in that direction , but your rather materialist - determinist position adds up to surrendering to them .
If conservatism means ANYTHING , it means resisting those forces . ]
This brings me to Laura W. ’s points .
What Laura does not understand is that the heart of traditionalist conservatism is a patriarchal society that privileges the average man in all relevant areas of his life , like his work and his family .
The social breakdown she speaks of — the high divorce … the decline of manners and civility , the increase in stupidity and immorality among children , the widely - trumpeted unhappiness of women as measured in recent surveys — is not because of the failure of the Sarah Palin model .
It ’s because women have been granted sexual freedom .
They spend the years of their peak physical attractiveness exchanging sex with high - value men in the hope of securing a love and commitment that never comes .
They keep doing this until age deteriorates their attractiveness and their forced to settle for men greatly inferior to those they used to sleep with .
Hence , the unhappy , “ sexless ” marriages and high divorce rate .
Decline of manners and civility ?
Women reward bad boys with sex … hence , they get men who emulate the aggressiveness and dominance of the men women sleep with .
Stupidity and immorality of children ?
Women neglecting their parental duties due to being stuck in unhappy marriages .
That ’s right , Laura .
It is the choices women make that has led them to their own personal unhappiness and the destruction of this society , not the unworkablity of the Palin family model .
July 4 Mark P. writes
[ In reply to a private e-mail ] :
What exactly do n’t you understand ?
My basic point is that the primary driver of liberalism and much of the problems that we have is women ’s ’ emancipation and the resulting weakness in patriarchy .
Edward L. writes : Edward L. writes : Mark P. is notably vague in his discussion of female sexual liberation .
In practical terms , it means the availability of contraception and abortion , which enable women to mitigate or erase the main downside risk of sexual activity .
Yet neither of those apply to Bristol .
She did n’t abort the pregnancy , and as for contraception , the only memorable point from the interview she had with Greta van Susteren in February was that she refused to answer the question of whether she ( or the boy ) had used birth control .
So in what specific respect is Mark claiming that Bristol was sexually liberated ?
Laura writes : Laura writes : Mark P. says : “ Bristol is the tragic outcome of a society that grants women sexual freedom … and there is probably little Sarah Palin could do about that short of an abortion or a convent . ”
How about old - fashioned supervision ?
The Palins could have provided that .
How about not letting her spend time alone with a boy ?
How about not letting her spend time alone with a boy in her own bedroom , as Levi has said they did ?
The irony is that Bristol herself is campaigning for this sort of thing now that she ’s had a child !
“ What Laura does not understand is that the heart of traditionalist conservatism is a patriarchal society that privileges the average man in all relevant areas of his life , like his work and his family . ”
I ’ve argued for women to withdraw from high - paying jobs and the most competitive fields and for society to return to customary discrimination in favor of men in practically all fields .
Why does Mark say I do not understand what patriarchy means ?
I clearly do not support sexual freedom for women .
“ The social breakdown she speaks of — the high divorce … the decline of manners and civility , the increase in stupidity and immorality among children , the widely - trumpeted unhappiness of women as measured in recent surveys — is not because of the failure of the Sarah Palin model .
It ’s because women have been granted sexual freedom . ”
The two things are not mutually exclusive .
Sexual freedom is part of the Sarah Palin model .
It ’s a package deal .
It simply is not possible for society simultaneously to elevate pre-marital chastity and worldly success for women .
The two do n’t go together as a model .
That ’s because children require care .
Pre-marital chastity is only exalted in a society that welcomes children .
“ That ’s right , Laura .
It is the choices women make that has led them to their own personal unhappiness and the destruction of this society , not the unworkablity of the Palin family model . ”
My point was that it ’s about the choices women make .
A popular choice is the Sarah Palin model , which for most women comes with years of pre-marital promiscuity .
Mark hails Sarah Palin for marrying a blue - collar guy and creating a happy family .
Then he says all women who marry blue - collar guys are unhappy because they married “ inferior ” men .
He exaggerates this phenomenon and takes the deterministic view that women ’s married lives are dependent on their material expectations and the status of their spouses .
That ’s not true .
Most women still do not “ marry down . ”
Most live comfortable lives by the standards of previous eras whether they marry up , down or sideways .
Still , they divorce often ; pursue careers with all the romantic fervor with which women once pursued domestic life ; and raise children who are physically , mentally and spiritually deprived .
They do this because it ’s widely approved of by the world around them , most especially by those who have benefited economically by the swelling of the ranks of career women .
July 6 Mark P. writes : Edward L. writes : “ Mark P. is notably vague in his discussion of female sexual liberation .
In practical terms , it means the availability of contraception and abortion , which enable women to mitigate or erase the main downside risk of sexual activity . ”
In practical terms , the point of mitigating the downside risks of sexual activity is to make expansive sexual activity possible .
Edward L. writes :
So in what specific respect is Mark claiming that Bristol was sexually liberated ?
The fact that she decided not to use birth control is the quintessential example of female sexual liberation .
Laura writes : “ How about old - fashioned supervision ?
The Palins could have provided that .
How about not letting her spend time alone with a boy ?
How about not letting her spend time alone with a boy in her own bedroom , as Levi has said they did ?

“ Old fashioned supervision ” is a return to the chaperoned events of the past .
That requires a social context to operate .
It can not be created by a single family .
They would have to effectively keep Bristol under lock and key .
Keep in mind that any contact with boys will start with group events like “ hey , mom , I ’m meeting some friends at the mall . ”
Outside of actually chaperoning kids at the mall ( a social killer ) , there is no way to police how the kids in these groups will pair off .
I am all for the chaperoned mixed events of , say , Greeley , Colorado in the early 1950 ’s , but the Palins could not resurrect that on their own .
Laura writes : “ I ’ve argued for women to withdraw from high - paying jobs and the most competitive fields and for society to return to customary discrimination in favor of men in practically all fields .
Why does Mark say I do not understand what patriarchy means ?
I clearly do not support sexual freedom for women . ”
Here lies the problem , Laura .
You speak of women withdrawing from high - paying jobs , explicitly volunteering to do so , and you want a return to voluntary discrimination in favor of men , presuming women will voluntarily agree to this .
You ’re argument is couched in terms of women collectively making good decisions .
The problem , however , is not women making the proper choices .
The problem is that women have choices to begin with .
In a truly patriarchal society , women do not magnanimously withdraw from competition with men .
Instead , women are not allowed to compete in the first place .
Within the Western tradition , for example , women would be limited to housewife , school teacher , librarian , nun , spinster or prostitute .
The fact that we are even having this conversation , Laura , indicates how much is lost .
Laura writes : “ The two things are not mutually exclusive .
Sexual freedom is part of the Sarah Palin model .
It ’s a package deal .
It simply is not possible for society to simultaneously elevate pre-marital chastity and worldly success for women .
The two do n’t go together as a model .
That ’s because children require care .
Pre-marital chastity is only exalted in a society that welcomes children . ”
This betrays a misunderstanding of what patriarchy is and the problems of female liberation .
Patriarchy is not about establishing institutions welcoming children or “ taking care ” of them .
Really , this child - centric meme should stop being used .
Does anyone honestly believe that the West has advanced as far as it did simply because it wanted to have children ?
The act of producing children and making sure they do n’t starve to death or die of exposure to the elements is a simple biological fact .
Any animal can do that .
Even single mothers generally manage to keep their children from winning Darwin awards .
No , the real purpose of patriarchy , and the family and civilization that results is to produce children of which men can be proud .
Children are a man ’s connection to immortality .
Children ( especially male children ) are there to carry his name into the future with honor and glory .
They are his legacy .
Men build civilization as monuments to themselves .
Men endow their offspring with their knowledge , tools and names as a way of extending their personal glory into the future and even enhance it if their offspring is sufficiently talented .
To do this effectively , men must own their families .
They must have guaranteed paternity to make sure their offspring is their own ( the real value of chastity . )
They must make sure that other men cannot encroach on their women .
They must make sure they cannot be attacked from within their own families .
With this base established , men can begin establishing or continuing proper patrilineal dynasties .
Please note that none of this has to do with biology .
Civilization is not about securing the natural replacement of dying generations or about ensuring the natural increase in the human population .
Animals do that naturally and human beings can guarantee these results by making sure every available womb is used multiple times .
No , this is beyond biology and goes to the core of what a patriarchy is .
Women are singularly incapable of maintaining civilization .
Almost every social problem we have today is due to the imprimatur of the liberated woman : Gaia - worship replacing Christianity ; modern family law destroying the roles of men ; socialist economic policies ; military weakness ; cooperative learning in the schools ; the raising of appearance over substance ; the dismal failure of single mothers to raise worthy children ; the flattening of morality ; the barbarity of the underclass ; and general civilization decline that will result in the West disappearing .
Women destroy what they had no hand in building .
Unless women are brought under control , we are all going to end up back in the trees .
Laura writes :
My point was that it ’s about the choices women make .
A popular choice is the Sarah Palin model , which for most women comes with years of pre-marital promiscuity .
Sarah Palin did not have years and years of premarital sex .
Her life looks like the reverse of what the average woman does .
Laura writes : Mark hails Sarah Palin for marrying a blue - collar guy and creating a happy family .
Then he says all women who marry blue - collar guys are unhappy because they married “ inferior ” men .
No .
This is a caricature of my position .
On average , the men that women sleep with in their 20’s are generally more attractive than the men they eventually marry in their 30’s .
This is because , in general , a woman ’s physical attractiveness begins a rapid decline after 30 .
The men she is used to no longer find her attractive so she settles for a pale imitation .
Much of the instability of marriage is due to this conflict between good memories and current reality .
Sarah Palin ’s strength of character is avoiding this rat race .
Todd Palin ’s character is choosing a woman of proper station .
Laura writes :
He exaggerates this phenomenon and takes the deterministic view that women ’s married lives are dependent on their material expectations and the status of their spouses .
The women today who are marrying in their 30’s are settling .
The reality of their physical depreciation over time ; their dwindling opportunities to exchange sex for high - status men ; and the memories of their “ roaring 20 ’s ” , are the groundwork for the cognitive dissonance modern women feel about their marriages .
Laura writes : “ That ’s not true .
Most women still do not “ marry down . ”

LOS ANGELES — A planned camera controller for Xbox 360 promises 3 - D motion recognition that will turn your entire body into a game controller .
Code - named Project Natal , the camera controller will sit beneath your television set and be capable of translating every movement of your body into a game control , Microsoft said Monday as it unveiled the system during its press briefing at the Electronic Entertainment Expo .
Natal will let gamers browse the Xbox 360 menus and watch movies , and could help make interactive entertainment as " approachable " as other forms of entertainment , according to Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg , who took the stage during Microsoft 's presentation to praise Project Natal .
" It 's not about reinventing the wheel , " Spielberg said .
" It 's about no wheel at all . "
It 's an interesting and unexpected move by Microsoft , which already has captured hard - core gamers with its consoles and is now looking to attract a wider audience by cranking out casual games and turning the Xbox 360 and the Xbox Live digital media deliver service into an entertainment hub .
While rumors of a motion controller similar to the Wii's have been making the rounds , Microsoft said it is simply moving beyond the need for any handheld controller .
The company also says Project Natal can pull off facial recognition , making the controller capable of determining who is playing a given game .
Top designers like Fable II 's Peter Molyneux are currently working on software to use with the hardware , although Microsoft did not say when the controller will be released .
Other announcements made at the show include :
New game from Gears of War maker Epic
Metal Gear Solid Rising for Xbox 360
Sequels to Left 4 Dead and Crackdown
Relaunching Microsoft 's video service as Zune Video with " instant - on 1080 p HD "
Upgrading the Netflix browser on Xbox Live
Music on Xbox Live through Last.fm
Social networking on Xbox Live through Facebook and Twitter
Our full live blog coverage follows .
Originally scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m.
Pacific time , the media briefing started five minutes early for what Spike TV host Geoff Keighley called a " last - minute surprise " that is " musical in nature . "
Hm , a musical surprise ?
Sure , maybe it 's GlaDOS making a live personal appearance to sing " Still Alive , " but somehow I wonder if it 's the Beatles introducing their new videogame .
Whether that 's it or not , we 'll find out soon enough .
Our live blog coverage of all of Microsoft 's big Xbox announcements will be right here when the show begins in a few hours .
10:25 : Show 's about to begin .
Right on time , amazingly enough .
10:26 : Lights are dimming .
Announcer is announcing .
People are applauding .
E3 has officially begun .
Well , technically it does n't start until Tuesday , but give me a break .
A video begins playing .
It 's The Beatles Rock Band .
Here we go .
10:27 : Beatles Rock Band looks really good – they 're showing all of the animated Beatles cartoons that apparently will be in the game .
Looks just as promised – a visual trip through the Beatles ' long career .
They 're putting instruments onstage right now – the drum kit looks pretty awesome , it 's got a Beatles logo where the " bass drum " would be .
Three microphones .
Vocal harmonies confirmed .
10:30 : People are onstage , people who as near as I can tell are not the Beatles .
One of them is Alex Rigopulos of Harmonix .
MTV's Van Toeffler is talking up the game , and Alex and five other people – two guitarists , three singers , Alex on drums – are playing " Day Tripper . "
The game looks exactly like Rock Band , except with many different vocal lines on the top .
If you nail all the vocal parts , you get a " Double Fab ! " or " Triple Fab ! " rating .
Clever !
10:33 : I 'm just thinking right now about how hard it 's going to be to do three - part vocal harmonies with the sort of people I usually hang out with .
10:34 : Hey , Giles Martin is onstage .
That 's kind of like a Beatle .
He 's revealing the game 's first trailer , plus the first 10 songs on the track list .
" I Saw Her Standing There , " " I Want To Hold Your Hand , " " I Feel Fine , " " Day Tripper , " " Taxman , " " I Am the Walrus , " " Back in the USSR , " " Octopus ' Garden , " " Here Comes the Sun , " " Get Back . "
10:37 : Downloadable content .

John Schappert , Xbox VP , is now onstage being all excited about getting to follow Paul and Ringo .
Cue the corporatespeak .
I 'll let you know when he says something amazing .
10:42 : Today 's show will feature 10 world premieres of games that have never before been seen .
Nice .
I 'm still personally excited about singing the entire B - side of Abbey Road all in one go .
10:43 : Tony Hawk onstage talking up his new skateboard game , Tony Hawk Ride , which comes with a skateboard - shaped controller .
" The whole thing responds like a real skateboard , " he says .
I would hope so .
10:45 : Hawk does n't announce a release date for the game , just introduces the trailer .
On the video , skaters are talking about how you can play this game and experience skateboarding without getting injured .
I like it already .
You can " push " with your foot on the floor , and a sensor on the board will read that and send your virtual on - screen skater forward .
This does seem pretty interesting – we 'll have feet - on impressions later this week .
10:48 : Trailer for Modern Warfare 2 is playing .
10:49 : Please welcome Jason West and Vince Zampella from Infinity Ward , who are going to do a live demo of Modern Warfare 2 .
It is in the Arctic .
A guy is sidling along an ice shelf , climbing up an iceberg .
You , in first person , follow behind , seinging your ice picks to climb up .
Really really nice animation on these guys – this is a great - looking game .
Now we 're shooting in a blizzard !
10:53 : Modern Warfare continues .
War is hell , kids , a different kind of hell than a 90 - minute press conference .
Guy playing onstage is so totally into it .
Face screwed up in grim determination , shaking his shoulders left and right , grimacing when he gets shot .
This is how you do a live game demo .
He 's got his game face on .

Today , they are premiering the world 's first look at FFXIII running on Xbox 360 .
It 's the Frocobo scene from the demo .
With English voices and text .
11:00 : Apparently in this version , Lightning has four active - time battle slots instead of the three that we saw in the earlier demo .
Lightning summons Odin , which was not in the demo .
Apparently summoned monsters remain at your side during battle after they 're summoned , and fight next to you .
But what 's interesting is that FFXIII is already running on 360 , in English .
They 're " targeting " a spring 2010 release .
Exeunt .

These last games were multiplatform .
The rest of the conference will focus on exclusives , he says .

Mustard name - checks Metroid and Castlevania as inspirations .
Damn , that 's setting a high , high bar .
It 's a 2.5 - D side - scrolling game in which you can run around a wide - open world , finding items that let you continue to explore and combat enemies .
120 hidden items , 10 - hour campaign .

It uses Avatars – it's a wild , cartoony racing game .
Winter . Xbox Live Arcade .
11:07 : Next game is a " new chapter in a favorite franchise , " he says .
What could it be ?
Oh. My. Goodness .
It is Crackdown 2 .
Awesome trailer shows the guy jumping all around the city , blowing people 's heads off .
Now you are fighting infected creatures .
11:09 : Left 4 Dead 2 , coming Nov. 17 .
I know I should be excited , but I 'm still thinking about Crackdown 2 .
11:11 : Splinter Cell Conviction trailer .
Ubisoft is coming out now to demo Splinter Cell Conviction .
11:13 : Sam Fisher is no longer a secret stealth agent .
Now he beats up bikers in bathrooms by smashing their heads into mirrors and sinks .
" Driven by his emotions , Sam is now the ultimate predator , " says producer .
" Each environment is built like a small sandbox , " he says , letting you choose how you want to infiltrate and prepare for attacks .
Sam is climbing along a pipe hanging from the ceiling , deftly avoiding the guards .
11:16 : Jiminy cricket is this demo loud .
Turn it down !
I am an old man !
11:17 : Schappert says that they 're shipping the " definitive racing game for this generation , " Forza Motorsport 3 , in October .
That 's a bold statement , considering that the competition is Gran Turismo .
Hey , there 's a car onstage !
It 's an Audi RAB 10 , and I 'm sure I transcribed that wrong , somehow .
11:20 : As the " definitive racing game of this generation , " says producer , " we deliver more . "
I wonder what that means ?
Please explain .
" The thrills that our competition can't . "
Graphics engine runs at 60 frames per second , 400 cars from 50 makers , " one- button driving , " gameplay rewind features for beginning players .

11:24 : Time for Halo 3 : ODST .
I see they 're keeping the name .
They 're jumping right into a live demo .
SO LOUD .
Do I have to start actually wearing earplugs to E3 ?
11:27 : The main character has a low - light visor to see in the semidark .
He 's roaming around a wide - open area – you have to look for clues to where to go next .
Your heads - up display will show you when you 're near something important , and you can flip the visor on to see what 's up .
You 'll flash back to other ODST characters , getting little snippets of the plot as you play , learning the secrets of the world .
11:29 : ODST 's cooperative game mode " Firefight " will be shown at E3 .
The game 's out in September ... and now they 're showing off a new Bungie project .
Called " Halo Reach , " coming in 2010 .
A multiplayer beta of Reach , or the invitation to it anyway , will be included with ODST .
11:33 : Finally , Alan Wake .
Microsoft 's is - it - vaporware game is finally being shown in real time .
They seem to be doing a Siren - style faux - episodic presentation – we see a title card reading " Previously on Alan Wake ... " before it jumps into the game .
All kinds of haunted stuff is happening in the broken - down town that Alan is exploring at night .
Looks a lot like a Silent Hill - style game , but very presentationally rich – lots of cool graphical effects , scary moments .
11:38 : Apparently this game 's enemies really , really do n't like light ; they run from flares and seem to be damaged by your flashlight .
Convenient !

11:50 : The next game , says Kojima , will be called Metal Gear Solid : Rising and will be released on the Xbox 360 .

Zoo settles with brothers in tiger attack TIGER ATTACK LAWSUIT
* FILE **
This undated file photo provided by the San Francisco Zoo shows Tatiana , a female Siberian tiger .
Tatiana , the tiger that mauled a zookeeper last year escaped from its pen at the San Francisco Zoo on Tuesday Dec. 25 , 2007 , killing one man and injuring two others before police shot it dead , authorities said .

The San Francisco Zoo agreed Thursday to pay $ 900,000 to two brothers who survived the fatal attack by an escaped tiger on Christmas Day 2007 , sources familiar with the case told The Chronicle .
The agreement with Kulbir , 25 , and Amritpal " Paul " Dhaliwal , 20 , resolves claims the brothers brought in U.S. District Court against the city , zoo and Sam Singer , a crisis public relations consultant the zoo hired after the attack , one source said .
Thursday 's settlement comes less than two weeks after attorneys for the brothers filed court documents alleging that police officials had ordered officers to issue arrest warrants for the Dhaliwals , accusing them of manslaughter in the death of their friend , 17 - year - old Carlos Sousa Jr. of San Jose , who was killed by the tiger .
Police command staff ordered the arrest warrants to deflect attention from the city 's negligence and to intimidate the brothers , " even though they were informed that the investigation could not substantiate involuntary manslaughter charges , or any charges being brought against ( the Dhaliwals ) , " attorneys Mark Geragos and Shelley Kaufman wrote in seeking to update the lawsuit to pursue more damages against the city .
At the time , zoo and city representatives suggested the three must have taunted the tiger before it jumped out of its enclosure .
The brothers were never arrested nor charged with wrongdoing in connection with the tiger 's escape .
City officials referred questions on the case to the zoo , where officials did not return calls seeking comment .
The Zoological Society earlier this year settled a lawsuit with the Sousa family for an undisclosed amount .
The Dhaliwal brothers ' lawsuit alleged the zoo was negligent on multiple fronts , including keeping the 243 - pound Siberian tiger named Tatiana in an enclosure that had walls 4 feet lower that what is recommended by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums .
They also say the zoo ignored workers ' warnings about the wall height .
They also contended that Kulbir Dhaliwal was n't attacked until after an employee refused to allow him into the safety of a zoo cafe .
That incident occurred about 20 minutes after the tiger leapt from its grotto and attacked Paul Dhaliwal before turning on Sousa , the lawsuit said .
Kulbir Dhaliwal also argued his federal civil rights were violated because he was deprived the use of his BMW M3 , the car the three took to the zoo .
Police impounded the car during their investigation but did n't seek a court order to search it until they had had the car for about two weeks , according to the lawsuit .
City Attorney Dennis Herrera 's office has said the city is not liable and that its lease with the San Francisco Zoological Society , the nonprofit that operates the zoo , protects it in the lawsuit .
The lawsuit also accused Singer of libel and slander for allegedly engaging in a smear campaign to suggest the young men were disreputable and had taunted the tiger .
Singer also denied wrongdoing .
At the time of the attack , both brothers were facing charges of public intoxication and resisting arrest after a Sept. 7 , 2007 , scuffle with San Jose police .
They were later convicted .
Paul Dhaliwal also has a series of other criminal convictions , including one for leading police on a 140 - mph chase through San Jose in April 2007 .
Geragos said the settlement included " an implicit recognition that what Sam Singer did was despicable , " saying such recognition is " when somebody writes you a check . "
Singer 's voice mail message indicated he was out of the country .
He could not be reached for comment .
Today , sadly , someone went into the Holocaust Museum in Washington D.C. and started firing .
My condolences to everyone that was affected .
Glenn Beck and other individuals are making sure to point out the fact that he was an alleged member of the 9/11 Truth Movement , although I 've never heard of the guy so Glenn is lying when he says that he was a hero .
There are SO MANY people that question the official account of 9/11 .
Not because one day we decided , " hey , this would be fun , " but because there are simply LEGITIMATE reasons to do so .
Because there are so many people , there are bound to be a few psychopaths like the individual that shot up the Holocaust Museum today , and the individual in Colorado who killed his father .
It does NOT mean we are ALL murderers .
Look at the opposite side of the coin .
Troy Sexton is a psychopath .
No ifs , ands , or buts about it .
You do n't call a 9/11 Family Member , and tell them to put a bullet in their head .
Screwloosechange PROMOTES their psychopath as a good thing .
We do not .
In fact , we denounce the psychopaths allegedly connected to what we do .
Again , my condolences to those affected by what happened today .
The 9/11 Truth Movement is a peaceful movement and always has been .

Whatever you do , do n’t give elephants LSD
Animals take to drugs just as readily as we do .
Sometimes they avail themselves of natural highs , and sometimes lab animals get very fond of substances they are fed for research .
So , sit back with your stimulant of choice and enjoy New Scientist ‘s round - up of animals on drugs .
1. Wallabies on opium
The marsupials of Tasmania have found a means of passing the time on Australia ’s island state that could also explain mysterious local crop circles .
Wallabies have been munching the poppies grown for opium by the pharmaceutical industry .
Advertisement
“ We have a problem with wallabies entering poppy fields , getting as high as a kite and going around in circles , ” the attorney general was quoted in The Mercury newspaper .
Sheep and deer have also been reported as being raving opium fiends .
2. Elephants on acid
In 1962 , the director of a zoo in Oklahoma had the bright idea of firing a syringe dart containing almost 300 milligrams of LSD – about 3000 times the normal dose a hippie would take – into one of his elephants .
Sadly , the animal went crazy , then died .
Elephants are regularly reported going on booze - fuelled rampages in India , but zoologists calculating the amount the animals would have to drink to get rowdy have cleared them of being under the influence .
The aggressive elephants are simply defending their territories , apparently .
3. Shrews on booze
Pen -tailed tree shrews in Malaysia gorge themselves on the flowers of the bertam palm , which contain fermented nectar of up to 3.8 per cent alcohol .
Unlike their distant human relatives , however , tree shrews quickly metabolise most of the alcohol they consume into a by - product called ethyl glucuronide ( EtG ) .
The stuff ends up safely stashed in the shrews ’ fur , at levels normally found only in severely alcoholic humans .
4. Pets on Prozac
In 2007 , the US Food and Drug Administration licensed a drug containing the same serotonin - reuptake inhibitor as Prozac for use in dogs .
Psychiatric drugs are also used in birds , though animal welfare groups worried that the use of such drugs to treat behavioural problems in animals would create a population of “ pill - popping pets ” .
5. Merry Macaques
Type “ drunk ” and the name of pretty much any animal into YouTube and you ’ll be rewarded with hilarious footage of inebriated beasts .
Bears , for example made the news in this clip .
In this study , however , alcoholic female macaques self - administered so much booze that they stopped ovulating .
The study was conducted in order to uncover why some alcoholic women stop having periods .
6 . Mice on speed
Mice given huge doses of methamphetamine have shown that drug cravings persist for months after withdrawal from the drug .
The rodents were spiked with doses of speed equivalent to those taken by addicts on a binge .
Researchers found long - lasting changes in key communication pathways in the brain .
Brain changes in the mice lasted for more than four months , equivalent to years in humans .
7. Monkeys on marijuana
One study suggested that monkeys “ seek out ” injections of THC – the active ingredient in cannabis – although this was criticised as “ pseudoscience ” , admittedly by pro-marijuana groups .
8. Uninhibited fruit flies
Drosophila flies allowed entry to an alcohol - strewn “ fly pub ” not only got drunk – they developed homosexual tendencies .
Repeated doses of booze led male flies to start courting other males .
The researchers claimed that the finding may reveal how alcohol loosens human sexual inhibitions .
9. Caterpillars on coke
Drug cartels in Columbia have a more than the CIA to worry about .
Unlike most insects , the caterpillar Eloria noyesi feeds on the leaves of coca plants .
A comparison of the dopamine receptors in the coke caterpillar with those of the silkworm , which does n’t feed on cocaine plants , revealed that E. noyesi has evolved resistance to the effects of the drug .
10 . Chimps smoking
A female chimp in a Zhengzhou zoo in Henan province , China , reportedly took up smoking as a result of sexual frustration .
Chimps in South Africa have also been filmed sucking on cancer sticks .
11 . Spiders on… pretty much everything
Depending on your point of view , arachnids are either the luckiest of lab animals , or the sorriest .
At NASA ’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama scientists dosed spiders with marijuana , the “ downer ” chloral hydrate , the “ upper ” Benzedrine and on caffeine .
The more toxic the chemical , the more deformed the web , says NASA , who hope to use spiders in place of other lab animals .
A quarter of a century ago today , Sikhs all over the world watched in horror as news came in that the Indian government had invaded the Golden Temple , or Harmandir Sahib as it 's traditionally known , in Amritsar , Punjab .
The three - day siege of the holiest of Sikh temples , known as Operation Blue Star , was launched on a major festival .
It provoked such fury that the prime minister , Indira Gandhi , was later assassinated by her own Sikh bodyguards .
It 's difficult to overstate the impact that 1984 had on Sikhs and their politics , even in Britain .
Gandhi's assassination was followed by systematic revenge attacks on Sikhs across India and then a brutal counter - insurgency operation that targeted Sikhs who wanted an independent homeland ( Khalistan ) .
The Indian government suspended constitutional rights in Punjab and committed gross human rights abuses against tens of thousands of people .
Partly in response , an Air India flight to Canada was blown up in 1985 by Sikh militants .
Almost every year groups gather in London to commemorate these events and raise awareness of people still missing or locked up .
Sometimes , the Indian flag is torched .
In one report ( pdf ) produced for the anniversary , the whole episode it is described as the " Sikhs ' Kristallnacht " .
But while these facts are well documented and constantly discussed , there is less acknowledgement of how the episode has affected Sikhs since .
Firstly there is the issue of the Sikh homeland itself .
The siege was an attempt to flush out separatist militants holed up in the Golden Temple .
It partly resulted from pressure on Indira Gandhi to take a stronger stance against the growing separatist movement in India .
Spearheaded by the charismatic and hardline Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale , the Sikh separatist movement was accused of anti-Hindu rhetoric and importing heavy weaponry into the state .
He was a controversial figure , calling for stricter codes of conduct amongst Sikhs , including calling for Sikh women to wear the looser salwar - kameez dress rather than the traditional Indian sari .
But the village preacher was popular because he was seen as the man who would almost re-create the glory days of the kingdom of Maharaja Ranjit Singh .
Bhindranwale offered an easy moral alternative to other corrupt Sikh institutions and stood for Sikh self - determination .
His death not only elevated the call for a Sikh homeland , but also made him an untouchable martyr figure despite his hardline stances .
Gurdwaras across the diaspora , especially in Britain and Canada , were encouraged to support separatist groups .
Although much of that separatist fervour has since dissolved , it still remains strong in parts of Birmingham and Vancouver .
What is n't said enough about these institutions is that they focus much more on Indian politics than they do in supporting and looking after local communities .
The second problem is that the struggle for justice for innocent Sikhs is still far too often linked to agitation for an independent Sikh homeland .
It should n't be .
The two are separate issues and one of the big struggles in contemporary Sikh politics in Britain and Canada is that the Khalistanis ( who want political power ) use the human rights bandwagon to advance their own agendas .
This makes it easier for the Indian government to ignore the issue .
A third problem is this :
Sikhs have always felt under siege as a community since their inception – from the Mughals , the Hindu kingdoms , the Afghans , the British Raj , the carve - up of Punjab at independence , the Congress party and more recently the Hindu nationalists in India .
This sense of victimhood makes it easier for hardliners to silence dissent within the community because unity is emphasised above all .
Even openly acknowledging social ills such as depression , racism ( against lower caste Sikhs ) , domestic violence and rape is difficult .
In December 2005 the Sikh writer Gurpreet Bhatti came under sustained criticism from hardline Sikhs for writing a play about rape in the Gurdwara .
There were even attempts by some Sikh groups to sue her for racism against Sikhs !
A generation on , the spectre of 1984 is fading as Sikhs look towards the future rather than the past .
But the continuation of human rights abuses and the lack of justice makes it difficult .
However , what Sikhs need now is a vision for the future not , one from the past .
They need to revive an intellectual tradition that has stagnated for the past 25 years and think about how Sikhism can survive and fashion itself to be at home in liberal western societies .

Following are excerpts from a symposium on the economic crisis presented by The New York Review of Books and PEN World Voices at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on April 30 .
The participants were former senator Bill Bradley , Niall Ferguson , Paul Krugman , Nouriel Roubini , George Soros , and Robin Wells , with Jeff Madrick as moderator .
— The Editors
Jeff Madrick :
It was six months ago now that the Lehman debacle occurred , that AIG was rescued , that Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch ; it was about six months ago that the TARP funds started being distributed .
The economy was doing fairly poorly in much of 2008 , and then fell off a cliff in the last quarter of 2008 and into 2009 , shrinking at a 6 percent annual rate — an extraordinary drop in our national income .
It is now by some very important measures the worst economic recession in the post–World War II era .
Employment has dropped faster than ever before in this space of time .
We have a three - front problem : a housing market that went crazy as the housing bubble burst ; a credit crisis , the most severe we ’ve known since the early 1930s ; and now a sharp drop in demand for goods and services and capital investment , leading to a severe recession .
What gives us the jitters is that all of these are related .
We have seen some deceleration in the rate of economic decline , and many people are saying that “ green shoots ” are showing .
What is the actual state of the economy , and do we need a serious mid-course correction on the part of the Obama administration ?
Bill Bradley : How far are we along in a recovery ?
When the market price of Citicorp drops from 60 to 1 , and then comes back to 3 , I do n’t think that ’s a recovery .
Warren Buffett buys Goldman Sachs , and after he buys , the price drops 45 to 50 percent , and if he ’s going to break even on the investment he ’s got to earn 9 percent for the next twelve years , I do n’t think that ’s a recovery .
The administration has put in place measures that , if they were to work , could offer some hope .
What I ’d like to suggest is that if they do n’t work , there ’s an alternative .
The national government has now made about $ 12.7 trillion in guarantees and commitments to the US financial sector , and we ’ve already spent a little over $ 4 trillion in this crisis .
Some institutions such as Citicorp , for example , received about $ 60 billion in direct assistance , and $ 340 billion in guarantees .
So US taxpayers are into Citicorp for around $ 400 billion .
If we look out to June , July , and if we see that the PPIP [ Public - Private Investment Program , created by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ] is not succeeding , that the bank assets …
Lebron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers got the firepower they were looking for when they traded for Shaquille O’Neal – but will he alone be enough ?
The Orlando Magic traded for hot headed scorer Vince Carter – something they lacked ( not the hot headed part ) when they lost in the NBA Finals .
But will he gel with the ever - needy Dwight Howard .
Both trades – along with the NBA Draft – will steal all the headlines over the next week , but the move made by the San Antonio Spurs ( trading three role players for Richard Jefferson ) will trump them all .
Like Tim Duncan , the Spurs trade was quiet and dominating .
Watch out NBA , the Spurs have retooled .
Shaq to Cavs wo n’t make it past the honeymoon period
Shaq has guided two guards to a championship .
Now , he will try to guide a forward there – albeit a forward who holds onto the ball more than most point guards do .
This offseason must feel familiar to Shaq .
He just went through all of this in 2004 .
He had worn out his welcome in Los Angeles and with Kobe Bryant after the Lakers failed to win a championship with four future Hall of Famers .
The Lakers , with no other choice , sent him to the Miami Heat .
In Miami , Shaq paired up with young superstar Dwayne Wade .
In two years , they won a championship together .
Fast forward to 2009 .
Shaq has worn out his welcome with the Phoenix Suns because he could not help them get over the hump .
The Suns , wanting to retool , trade him to Cleveland where he pairs up with a young superstar ( I think we all know who he is ) .
The big question everyone is asking , though , is , “ Will Shaq propel the Cavs to a championship ? ”
If you are a Cavs fan , skip the rest of this section to hold onto your hopes and dreams .
Shaq is not over the hill yet .
He ’s still one of the best centers in the league .
He will provide the Cavs with a big man who can defend the Magic ’s Howard .
He will help the Cavs guards get more open looks because unlike the rest of the Cavs big men , he can play offense .
And , he will not bother the Cavs offense like he did to the Suns .
He ’s played with a slasher - like superstar before , and the Cavs generally play a half court offense with the ball in James hands .
He will make the Cavs a better team .
But , with all that said , he will not help the Cavs win a championship .
It ’s not his fault or James fault .
The Cavs played above their talent level in 2009 .
They played defense .
They shot the ball well .
Their role players made all the right plays .
They hustled .
They did everything right but still could not make it to the Finals .
Shaq is not the player to get them there .
Maybe if they picked up a better and taller shooting guard or another talented big man they would matchup better against the Los Angeles Lakers , Boston Celtics , or Spurs .
But , truthfully , their only hope of getting over the hump is injuries to star players on other teams .
They just do n’t matchup well against the top tier teams in the league .
Vincanity is overrated
The Magic finally have that go - to scoring threat they missed in the 2009 NBA playoffs .
The only problem is they most likely traded one clutch but overrated forward ( Hedo Turkoglu ) for an over the hill superstar .
The trade for Carter pretty much assures the Magic will let Turkoglu walk this summer .
The swapping of star players will change the dynamics of the Magic .
Carter is past his prime and can no longer lead a team – not that he ever embraced the word “ team ” anyways .
He ’s not a team player like Turkoglu and will try to do too much at times – something that is detrimental to emotional , three point shooting teams .
If Carter is able to become a team player and share the ball , the Magic have a chance of repeating their success from last year ( but nothing more ) .
If he cannot , the Magic will find themselves in a difficult spot .
They will have their scorer they always wanted , but it will have come at the expense of their team ’s camaraderie .
The Spurs are a team to fear again
While the Cavaliers and Magic have received plenty of headlines for their trades , the Spurs trade for Jefferson received minimal coverage .
Why would it garner attention from media outlets that are looking for talkative and flashy players ?
The Spurs and Jefferson are the exact opposite of that .
Whether on or off the court , they seldom make Paris Hilton - like scenes .
They hustle .
They work as a team .
And they play the game by the book .
Jefferson now gives the Spurs four players who can score over 20 points a game .
The trade will also allow the Spurs to rest their stars even more – something they have n’t been able to the past couple of years because of injuries .
Not to mention the Spurs will probably resign Bruce Bowen ( one of the players they traded to get Jefferson ) once the Milwaukee Bucks waive him .
Bowen was a team leader for the Spurs and integral to their defense first strategy .
However , he hampered the Spurs offense and is more useful as a coach .
The trade not only makes the Spurs younger and gives them much needed scoring , but it makes them a legitimate title contender again .
Even though the Spurs have consistently won over 50 games since they drafted Duncan , they have n’t changed the core of their team over the past few years .
Injuries and age finally caught up to them , and Jefferson will help them rid both of those worries .
The Spurs may not receive the headlines they deserve , but their trade is by far the biggest move of this young offseason .

Low - power processors are n't just for netbooks :
These computers - on - a- chip are going to be powering our smartphones and other diminutive gadgets in the forseeable future .
So what 's the difference between the Atoms , Snapdragons and Tegras of the world ?
Advertisement
Intel Atom
The current reigning king of low - cost , low - power processors , Intel 's Atom flat - out dominates the netbook market .
Its single - and dual - core processors are also some of the most powerful on our list , despite having abilities roughly equal to , in Intel 's own terms , a 2003 - 2004 vintage Celeron .
Based on the x86 architecture , the Atom is capable of running full versions of Windows XP , Vista ( though not all that well ) , and 7 , as well as modern Linux distros and even Hackintosh .
While it requires far less power than a full - power chip , it 's still more power - hungry than the ARM - based processors on our list , requiring about 2 watts on average .
That 's why netbook battery life is n't all that much longer than that of a normal laptop .
Advertisement
You can find the Atom in just about every netbook , including those from HP , Dell , Asus , Acer , Sony , Toshiba , MSI , and , well , everyone else .
The 1.6GHz chip is the most popular at the moment , but Intel is definitely going to keep improving and upgrading the Atom line .
However , you 're unlikely to catch an Atom in a handset ; it 's low - power , yes , but low - power for a notebook .
Battery life on an Atom handset would be pretty atrocious , which is why Intel 's sticking to netbooks for now .
Qualcomm Snapdragon
Based on ARM , which is a 32 - bit processor architecture that powers just about every mobile phone ( and various other peripherals , though never desktop computers ) out there , Snapdragon is n't competing directly with the Intel Atom — it 's not capable of running full versions of Windows ( only Windows Mobile and Windows CE ) , it 's incredibly energy - efficient ( requiring less than half a watt ) , and is designed for always - on use .
In other words , this is the evolution of the mobile computing processor .
It 's got great potential : Qualcomm is trumpeting battery life stretching past 10 hours , smooth 1080 p video , support for GPS , 3G , and Bluetooth , and such efficiency that a Linux - based netbook can use Snapdragon without a fan or even a heat sink .
Available in single core ( 1GHz ) or dual - core ( 1.5GHz ) , it can be used in conjunction with Android , Linux , and various mobile OSes .
Unfortunately , Qualcomm is still holding onto the notion that people want MIDs , and is championing " smartbooks , " which are essentially smartphones with netbook bodies , like Asus 's announced - then - retracted Eee with Android .
Snapdragon 's got promise , but we think that promise lies in super - powered handheld devices , not even more underpowered versions of already - underpowered netbooks .
Advertisement
We 're frankly not sure when we 'll see Snapdragon - based devices sold in the US .
We 're sure Snapdragon will end up in smartphones at some point , as at least one Toshiba handset has been tentatively announced , but the only concrete demonstrations we 've seen have been in MIDs , and Snapdragon themselves spend all their energy touting these " smartbooks . "
Snapdragon 's Windows Mobile compatibility suggests we may see it roll out with Windows Mobile 7 , if Tegra has n't snapped up all the good handsets .
Nvidia Tegra
Nvidia 's Tegra processor is very similar to Snapdragon — both are based on ARM architecture , so both are designed for even less intense applications than the Atom .
Like Snapdragon , Tegra is n't capable of running desktop versions of Windows , so it 's primarily targeted at Android and handheld OSes , especially forthcoming versions of Windows Mobile .
What sets Tegra apart from Snapdragon is the Nvidia graphics pedigree :
The company claims smooth 1080 p video , like Snapdragon , but also hardware - accelerated Flash video and even respectable gaming ( though no , you wo n't be able to run Crysis ) .
They also go even further than Qualcomm in their battery life claim , suggesting an absolutely insane 30 hours of HD video .
Advertisement
While Snapdragon tends to be loosely associated with Android , Tegra is an integral part of Microsoft 's plan for next - generation Windows Mobile devices .
Instead of focusing on " smartbooks " and MIDs , which we think are part of a dead - end category , Tegra 's commitment to pocketable handhelds could spell success .
We 've seen proof - of - concept demonstrations of Tegra already , but its real commercial debut will come with Windows Mobile 7 — and if WM7 does n't suck , Tegra could take off .
Others
We have n't included certain other processors , especially VIA 's Nano , due to intent :
The Nano requires lower power than full - scale processors , but at 25 watts , it 's not even really in the same league as Atom , let alone Snapdragon or Tegra .
The VIA Nano is really targeted at non-portable green technology , and looks like it 'll do a good job — it outperformed Atom in Ars Technica 's excellent test , and stands up to moderate use with ease .
AMD's Puma ( Turion X2 ) is in a similar boat :
It 's certainly markedly more energy - efficient than AMD 's other offerings , but as it's targeted at laptops ( not netbooks ) with a screen size greater than 12 - inches , it 's not quite right for our list here .
Advertisement
These low - power processors are n't just , as we so often think , crappier versions of " real " processors .
They 've got uses far beyond netbooks , especially in the near future as the gap between netbooks and smartphones narrows .

A trio of undergraduate students at the University of Richmond have developed a custom search engine that will be used to help feed those in the developing world .
The three students have created Hoongle.org , a custom Google search engine that promises to donate 20 grains of rice per search to schools located in impoverished countries .
The search engine has already generated more than 8.5 million grains of rice ( about 4,000 meals ) since it was introduced this past September .
( Source : nytimes.com )
Of course , online clicks alone cannot put food in the mouths of people overseas .
The Hoongle group are able to establish and finance their international fund by donating just a fraction of a penny in revenue generated from every search ; roughly the amount it costs for 20 grains of rice .
Hoongle works alongside " Fill the Cup " , a campaign facilitated through the United National World Food Program , which delivers the food to schools worldwide .
No Games , Just Searches & Sustenance
Hoongle is not the first concept aimed at interweaving online behavior with food donations .
FreeRice.com , a non-profit online destination launched in October 2007 , entices visitors to participate in simple vocabulary , math and science games .
For each correct answer , 10 grains of rice are donated to developing countries through the United Nation World Food Program .
It is estimated that almost 63 billion grains of rice have been generated by people playing the basic and intermediate games found at FreeRice.com .
Analysts predict that Hoongle.org will succeed far longer than FreeRice.com , since the search engine does not require its visitors to do anything above and beyond their normal search routine .
Success Depends on Word - of - Mouth
Still , if many people hear about the campaign and adjust their default homepages accordingly , the chances for its success will increase ten - fold .
As it stands , Hoongle has about 90,000 users in 130 countries .
Traffic to the site has been doubling at a consistent rate of 2 to 3 weeks , meaning that word is spreading and people are willing to offer a helping hand .

If Hoongle continues to generate positive results , expect the search engine to offer other languages , and even a version designed especially for the iPhone .

Friends and family of Neda Agha - Soltan spoke to The Times ’ Borzou Daragahi about the 26 - year - old Iranian woman seen bleeding on the streets of Tehran in shaky video footage that has turned her into an international symbol of the protest movement :
The first word came from abroad .
An aunt in the United States called her Saturday in a panic .
" Do n't go out into the streets , Golshad , " she told her .
" They 're killing people . "
The relative proceeded to describe a video , airing on exile television channels that are jammed in Iran , in which a young woman is shown bleeding to death as her companion calls out , " Neda ! Neda ! "
A dark premonition swept over Golshad , who asked that her real name not be published .
She began calling the cellphone and home number of her friend Neda Agha - Soltan , who had gone to the chaotic demonstration with a group of friends , but Neda did n't answer .
At midnight , as the city continued to smolder , Golshad drove to the Agha - Soltan residence in the eastern Tehran Pars section of the capital .
As she heard the cries and wails and praising of God reverberating from the house , she crumpled , knowing that her worst fears were true .
" Neda ! Neda ! " the 25 - year - old cried out .
" What will I do ? "

Credit card companies will be forced to give customers a three - week grace period for interest on credit card purchases , one of several new industry regulations announced by Finance Minister Jim Flaherty on Thursday .
" Federally regulated credit card issuers will have to provide consumers with a minimum 21 - day , interest - free grace period on all new purchases when the consumers pay their balance in full by the due date , " he said at a Toronto news conference .
Flaherty said that most credit cards currently offer 15 - to - 24 day grace periods , with the majority offering the three - week grace period required under the new regulations .
But many of these companies also charge consumers on the interest that accrues during the grace period , he said , even if their balances are paid in full that month .
This can also be true if a consumer carries a balance from one month to another .
" If a consumer carries a balance from one month to another , some cards give that consumer essentially no grace period on new purchases , " Flaherty said .
" They charge interest on the full balance immediately on both the previous balance and the new purchases . "
Later in an interview on CTV 's political affairs program Power Play , Flaherty hinted the new measures were a tough sell to the credit card companies .
He said the profits they made from accrued interest were " very substantial . "
" It has been profitable for some of the financial institutions the way the calculations were being done .
And we wanted to ensure a clear 21 day grace period uniform for all the financial institutions , which is a cost for them , " Flaherty told CTV's Tom Clark .
Flaherty also hinted that the government is keeping an eye on other cards .
" We also have issues coming down the road with respect to debit cards as well , " he said .
The grace period is one of several regulations the government announced .
Another major change is that credit card companies will have to print " all salient information " in a summary box on monthly statements , clearly showing the annual interest rates for purchases and cash advances .
" This will improve clarity and move this information out of the fine print , " Flaherty said .
The new information box must also contain the credit card 's annual fee , information that is often missing on current credit statements .
Flaherty said the same summary box must also give consumers an indication of how long it will take them to pay off their balances if they stick to paying only the minimum monthly payments required by the credit card companies .
" This will help consumers get a truer picture of their debt - load as they pay it off and manage their affairs , " he said .
Credit card companies will also be expected to follow several other new regulations , including :
Credit card companies will require the " express consent " of consumers in order to raise their credit limits
Consumers will not have to pay over - the - limit fees due to merchant holds / pre-authorization holds
Credit card companies will be required to give consumers advance notice of interest rate increases on monthly statements , if such increases will occur during the next statement period
Consumers will also get advance notice when low , introductory interest rates are about to expire , or when a penalty rate will be imposed due to late balance payments
Credit card companies will be restricted in the time periods in which they can hound contact consumers for debt collection
All payment allocations to credit card companies should be applied in favour of the consumer
The new regulations , however , will not cap the interest rates that credit card companies impose on consumers .
" We have choice in credit card interest rates in Canada , " Flaherty said , explaining the government 's position on the matter .
" There are some low interest rates on some of the credit cards .
There are dozens and dozens of options for consumers . "
Instead , Flaherty said the government 's concern is to ensure that consumers have " easily available , clear information so that they can make informed choices about what credit card suits them and the cost of that credit card for them . "
Flaherty said the changes were part of the Conservative government 's plan to improve the financial literacy of Canadians .
" With better information , Canadian consumers will be able to make better decisions , but only if they are equipped properly to do so , " he said .
Our friends from Sponge Architects sent us their design of a temporary art pavillion for which they received an Honourable Mention recognition by the Art Alliance Austin .
The project was designed for a competition called TOGS ( Temporary Outdoor Gallery Space ) in March of this year , where 200 entries from all over the world were received by the organizers .
The temporary architecture installation is an outdoor exhibit which provides prestigious gallery space .
More images and architect ’s description after the break .
The flexible pavilion design of SPONGE is designed as a tunnel of wooden frames which can be pulled apart .
In this way , the pavilion can change in size according to the need .
When the pavilion is closed , it functions as a closed capsule which is protecting the art pieces .
By pulling the frames apart , a harmonica shaped transparent PVC foil is unfolding in between ; it serves as a light resource and preserves the artwork from outside conditions .
In the maximal possible position , there is even enough space for presentations , a small cinema or a vernissage .
The ‘ outdoor stage ’ serves as the entrance of the pavilion , but at the same time as stage , as catwalk or as public furniture .
The design literally stretches the boundaries of work shown indoors and will enhance the outdoor art fair experience by showcasing the synergy between art , architecture and the outdoor surrounding .
A recently introduced cyberbullying bill could land us all in jail — that is , if you have ever used an electronic medium to troll someone .
HR 1966 , the Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act , is named after the high - profile " MySpace suicide " victim Megan Meier .
It 's meant to prevent people from using the Internet to " coerce , intimidate , harass , or cause substantial emotional distress to a person . "
However , as with many bills of this nature , the murky language and vague standards leave much open to interpretation , which has caused critics to call it the Censorship Act instead .
HR 1966 was introduced in April by US Representative Linda Sanchez ( D - CA ) and it 's supported by 14 other members of Congress .
According to the text , individuals who bully others via any electronic means could face fines , two years in prison , or both .
This , of course , could include those nasty text messages you sent to your ex on Saturday night , the questionable e-mail you sent to your brother , or those forum posts you made in which you called for someone who liked the new Star Trek movie to jump off a building .
The bill largely flew under the radar until fairly recently ( thanks to NetworkWorld for the heads - up ) but criticism has been building .
The language in the bill is so vague , it could be interpreted to apply to practically any situation , including blog posts critical of public officials . �
UCLA Law Professor Eugene Volokh went into detail on his blog , suggesting �that numerous everyday situations could render regular citizens felons if their behavior is considered " severe " enough .
" I try to coerce a politician into voting a particular way , by repeatedly blogging ( using a hostile tone ) about what a hypocrite / campaign promise breaker / fool / etc .
he would be if he voted the other way .
I am transmitting in interstate commerce a communication with the intent to coerce using electronic means ( a blog ) ' to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior '— unless , of course , my statements are n't seen as ' severe , ' a term that is entirely undefined and unclear , " Volokh wrote .
Still , Sanchez insists that the bill is n't meant to dampen free speech online .
" Congress has no interest in censoring speech and it will not do so if it passes this bill , " Sanchez wrote on the Huffington Post .
" Put simply , this legislation would be used as a tool for a judge and jury to determine whether there is significant evidence to prove that a person ' cyberbullied ' another .
That is : did they have the required intent , did they use electronic means of communication , and was the communication severe , hostile , and repeated .
So — bloggers , emailers , texters , spiteful exes , and those who have blogged against this bill have no fear — your words are still protected under the same American values . "
Although Sanchez seems to think there 's no possibility for abuse with this bill , we all know what the road to hell is paved with .
Despite her reassurance that it wo n't be used to censor Internet communications , there 's no way to predict how judges would interpret such a law .
One thing we do know is that cyberbullying cases have picked up�since Missouri passed its own law following Megan Meier 's death — if HR 1966 makes it past the House Committee on the Judiciary and into the books , we could see a serious uptick in those types of cases .
Iran has executed its Tiananmen Square .
Baharestan Square has become synonymous with barbarity , cruelty , massacre and inhumanity .
An Iranian blogger ( whose URL I will not publish ) live blogging from Baharestan Square in central Tehran today captures but brief glimpses of the unimaginable horror that took place today .
Bus loads of protesters were stopped and unloaded from their buses by " black - clad police " and literally herded .
When the massing was sufficient , as the barely controllably distraught Tehran caller to CNN described first hand , hundreds of the regime 's Basij thugs poured out of an adjoining mosque and commenced a massacre with axes , clubs , guns and gas .
From the live blogger 's eyewitness account :
> More than 10.000 Bassij Milittias get position in Central Tehran , including Baharestan Sq .
> Army Helycopters flying over Baharestan and Vali Asr Sq .
> The streets , squares and around BAHARESTAN ( Approx . South - eastern of Tehran ) is swarming with military forces , civilian forces , the security motorists
> The croud have moved to the south of baharestan , the situation is bad , the shooting has started
> In Baharestan Sq. in the Police shooting , A girl is shot and the police is not allowing to let them help
> In Baharestan we saw militia with axe choping people like meat - blood everywhere - like butcher
This is the Iranian regime , wading into its own unarmed people and axing them to death , bludgeoning women ( seen as the greatest threat to the regime ) and throwing them to their deaths from pedestrian bridges .
The same Iranian regime whose embassy officials are invited to American embassies around the world to celebrate on July 4th , of all things , a successful revolution .
This frantic phone call from a Tehran woman will break your heart as you consider our standard response has been " that there are sets of international norms and principles about violence " and that " the international community is watching . "
Part of yesterday 's response by President Obama in a press conference included " that there is a peaceful path that will lead to stability and legitimacy ( of the Iranian regime ) and prosperity for the Iranian people .
We hope they take it . "
The Iranian theocratic regime clearly is not interested .
There should not be - nor should have ever been - invitations to the ruthless Iranian regime 's international ambassadors to celebrate anything with us , anywhere , unless it is an invitation to a tribunal on charges of crimes against humanity .
To my intelligent friends who have been arguing the logic of our president 's near silence on the issue of Iran - and not without merit on certain points - you can disengage from me now .
I will entertain none of it any longer .
This is an axe wound , just one , doled out by the regime 's thug basiji animals on Saturday , June 20 , 2009 .
This was a brutal murder of an assuredly unarmed protester of the up - close - and - personal variety .
An act , and one not isolated , which requires the presence of inhumane malice and aggression and the absence of humanity .
The traits required for massacres upon the unarmed .
There is no nuance , no logical approach , no deft explanation that covers near silence and inadequate , tepid condemnation of the meekest sort .
To decline any mention of possible repercussions on the regime for these acts " because we do n't know how this is going to turn out " is moral cowardice of the highest order .
Look at the picture above and listen to the frantic woman calling in to CNN again .
They seem to " know how this is going to turn out . "
There is a way to condemn a regime axing its citizens in the streets of Tehran and other cities across Iran without " making this about the US . "
You , and our president , are intelligent men and women and lacking no gifts of speech and prose .
Find what 's missing .
Each of you frustrate and sadden me .
Argue your eloquent points elsewhere .
My ears are deaf as of now .
A fireball that recently streaked through the sky north of Toronto may have released some small meteorites and researchers at the Royal Ontario Museum and the University of Western Ontario are seeking the aid of local residents in retrieving the space debris .
What can science learn from the fragments ?
Five cameras set up in southern Ontario by the physics and astronomy departments at Western recorded the fiery descent of a meteorite ( slow fireball ) that recently appeared over Newmarket , Ontario ( between Newmarket and Lake Simcoe , to be exact ) .
Researchers estimate that the fragments may total a few hundred grams and are requesting help from the public in retrieving them .
It is indeed an uncommon occurrence for pieces of meteorites to be found because most meteoroids disintegrate when entering the earth ’s atmosphere .
This is not to say that some of them do n’t reach the Earth ’s surface each year because a few of them do , but in reality only a handful are ever recovered and made available to scientists to study .
According to Dr. Kim
Tait , who is in charge of meteorite collection at the museum :
“ Fireball fragments will give clues to the material in our solar system .
We ’re very excited about this fireball occurrence .
Although this is not the first time a meteorite has fallen in Ontario , we are very interested in recovering fragments . ”
The museum ’s mineralogy department has requested that residents who discover fragments on their property contact the museum directly .
Almost always magnetic in nature , meteor fragments are in no way dangerous to the human touch .
They are usually black in color due to a fusion crust , which can be shiny or dull because its outer surface has been burned during ingress to the atmosphere .
A bit confusing , terms referring to meteors need some clarification .
A meteorite refers to an object originating in outer space that survives an impact with the surface of the Earth .
It is called a meteorite while still floating in space and becomes a fireball known as a meteor after it enters the atmosphere .
The pressure of impact causes the object to ignite , so to speak , forming a fireball or shooting star ( or meteor , if you ca n’t make up your mind ) .
If you are still in need of more clarification , consider the term , bollide , which can be either a body that collides with the Earth or a fireball - like meteor whether or not it impacts with the surface of the Earth .
Having almost as many aliases as a bank robber on the lam , a meteorite that has been recovered and observed as it impacts the Earth is called a Fall .
All others are known as Finds .
If this is still about as clear as mud , add the fact that meteorites are always named for the place they were found .
If there are a few of them found in a specific location , a number or letter to differentiate it might follow the name from the others .
Some meteorites have informal nicknames , such as the Sylacauga meteorite , which is also known as the “ Hodges meteorite ” after Ann Hodges , the woman who was struck by it .
Meteorites generally fall into three broad categories : stony meteorites , which are rocks mainly composed of silicate minerals ; iron meteorites formed from metallic iron - nickel ; and , stony - iron meteorites , which contain large amounts of both metallic and rocky material .
About 86 % of the meteorites that fall on Earth are in the first category and are known as chondrites , so named for the small , round particles of silicate minerals they contain .
Chondrites are believed to be about 4.5 billion years old and are often considered to be “ the building blocks of the planets ” .
The heating of meteorites during their passage through the atmosphere melts their surfaces and they can then be “ sculpted ” into various shapes .
If the meteoroid maintains a fixed orientation for some time , without tumbling , it may develop a conical “ nose cone ” or “ heat shield ” shape .
Those that experience disruption in the atmosphere may fall as meteorite showers , which can range from only a few up to thousands of separate fragments .
The area over which a meteorite shower falls is known as its strewn field .
Large impact craters are rare as few meteorites are big enough to create them .
Usually , they arrive at the surface at their terminal velocity and , at most , create a small pit .
Even so , falling meteorites have reportedly caused damage to property , livestock and people .
What secrets will the research team in southern Ontario discover ?
Only time and the integrity of its local residents may tell .
CNN gets some video , finally .
But then you hear a simple statement from the anchor that Mousavi lost the election and telling us to wait for the official results in ten days ' time .
CNN no longer qualifies as a news channel .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

the controversy that texas forgot
Since the Texas School Board is really into injecting controversies into education , here 's one they should consider .
Illustration by Amorphia Apparel
While Barbara Cargill and the rest of the Texas Board of Education are busy dismantling science in the state ’s public schools in favor of debate , I was wondering if they had any plans to include the ancient astronaut theory in their discussions about human evolution .
Why ?
Because lots of people out there are really busy debating whether humans arose as a result of alien intervention and if you ’re going to debate observable and documented facts like mutations , genetic drift , the age of the universe and CMBR , and put them on equal footing with magic and ancient tomes of metaphor heavy religious punditry , you may as well include other popular ideas .
After all , is n’t that Cargill ’s stated mission ?
To question all dogmas and expand the students ’ minds in science classes ?
The idea of ancient astronauts does n’t violate any law of physics or biology .
In fact , there ’s nothing we know of that prevents an alien species from evolving intelligence and building a civilization .
There are restrictions on how fast they could get to Earth of course , and they ’d have to be somewhere in our stellar neighborhood to get here in less than a few thousand years .
But if they were able to find our planet and decided to invest the time , the resources and the energy to travel here in a generational ship or by some advanced warp drive they built or discovered by serendipity , there ’s nothing in nature that would stop them .
Then , if they decided to play with the genomes of early hominids and make the crucial break in our MYH16 gene that gave us our modern brains , there was also nothing to stop them from doing so provided they had the right technology .
This is why so many people believe the ancient astronaut mythology .
It does n’t violate any laws of nature and while the odds of something like this happening are one in whatever astronomical number you ’d like to use , it ’s actually scientifically plausible .
Funny enough , in Discovery Institute ’s / Ben Stein ’s sham of a documentary Expelled , Richard Dawkins is presented as believing in this legend after replying that it was the only way he ’d imagine a plausible version of intelligent design and was swiftly ridiculed for it by creationists .
Whose theory needs a magical , eternal , hyper - intellect able to magically manipulate space , time and genes and who ’s existence can only be perceived philosophically rather than empirically …
Ironic , is n’t it ?
So why are n’t scientists scouring the Earth for fossilized flying saucers ?
Because we do n’t have any physical evidence that we ’ve been visited by extraterrestrial intelligence .
All the pretty pictures of what we think must ’ve been ancient astronauts are n’t anywhere as convincing as an alien computer impregnated with isotopes we would expect an extraterrestrial artifact to carry .
While this hypothesis ( to call it what it really is from a scientific method ) is conceivable , it ’s so highly unlikely and there ’s so little physical proof for it , we do n’t teach it as an alternative to evolution in science class .
And creationists agree for the same reasons !
Then , they turn around to insert magic into some grossly misunderstood version of science to which they ’ve latched on and say that we have to teach it in order to promote debate and “ teach the controversy ” while 99 % of experts in the subject matter say the there ’s nothing to debate .
So I say that if we ’re going to insist on giving a view based on philosophical leanings equal time with serious , evidence - backed science because a lot of people believe it , we should teach the ancient astronaut theory and let students make up their minds .
I mean we do want to challenge conventional dogmas , do n’t we ?

The true extent of organised crime in the UK is becoming clearer as a result of an extensive intelligence - gathering drive , according to the policing organisation responsible for bringing gangsters under control .
The Serious Organised Crime Agency ( Soca ) says it has identified 5,000 leading criminals – about 3,000 more than they knew about 12 months ago – and have a clearer picture of the impact that their crimes have upon society .
But Soca warned that the country needed to find innovative ways of dealing with organised crime , such as seizing assets , obtaining injunctions through the civil courts and enhancing protection for individuals and businesses at risk of being targeted by gangsters .
On the third anniversary of its launch , Soca said it had denied £ 175 m to criminals in the UK over the last year through cash seizures and confiscation orders , and that a further £ 88 m had been denied to criminals overseas .
It said it had been involved in the seizure of more than 85 tonnes of cocaine , and issued 71 alerts intended to protect businesses from crime .
The agency is attempting to make more use of what it terms " lifetime management " techniques , including the imposition of serious crime prevention orders , which can limit criminals ' travel , banking facilities or access to mobile telephones .
Soca has faced persistent criticism in recent months over the effectiveness of intelligence - gathering as opposed to more traditional policing methods .
Yesterday , the prime minster , Gordon Brown , used his first major speech about crime to reassure the agency that the government had no plans to close it down .
Sir Stephen Lander , the former head of MI5 who is chairman of Soca , said the agency would need up to two more years to prove its worth .
He and the agency 's director general , Bill Hughes , a police officer , said their " compendium of tools " would be needed in addition to prosecutions if organised crime were to be effectively tackled .
" We now have a list of about 5,000 people where we have the intelligence and information that we require , " said Hughes .
" We have identified people who were n't on the radar before and we have also identified people who were on the radar but we did n't know exactly what it was they were doing .
Now we have a better understanding of how they are operating and how best we can tackle them . "

Arcandor owns 53 % of travel company Thomas Cook Germany 's Arcandor , which owns 53 % of Thomas Cook , has filed for bankruptcy protection after the German government rejected a request for loan guarantees .
Arcandor , which employs about 70,000 people , had sought 650 m euros ( $ 930 m ; £ 561 m ) of guarantees because about 600 m euros of its loans need refinancing .
Arcandor said its bankruptcy filing covered German retailer Karstadt and its mail - order businesses .
However , it added that Thomas Cook would " remain unaffected " .
Thomas Cook ' ring - fenced '
Thomas
Cook is the only profitable part of Arcandor , and the German firm 's 52.8 % stake in the travel firm is worth about 1bn euros .
This will have no impact on holidays - customers should not be concerned whatsoever

Cook moved quickly to reassure its customers that they would not be affected by the problems at Arcandor .
The holiday operator said it was " completely ring - fenced " from Arcandor and that the two companies were operationally and financially distinct .
" We 've been around for 167 years and will be for many more , " a spokesperson for Thomas Cook told the BBC .
" This will have no impact on holidays - customers should not be concerned whatsoever . "
Shares in Thomas Cook in London closed up 10 % at 235.75 p , and earlier on Tuesday had jumped as much as 14 % on reports that German firm Rewe could buy Arcandor 's stake in the travel firm .
In a statement , Thomas Cook said it had not received any approach for the stake or the company as a whole .
Crisis fund Chancellor Angela Merkel had insisted that no state aid would be available for Arcandor unless the company put together a viable plan and its owners and banks put in more money .
WHO IS ARCANDOR ?
Owned the majority of Thomas Cook since 2007 Owns 120 Karstadt department stores , a mainstay on Germany 's High Streets Also owns the Primondo mail - order and Quelle catalogue businesses Arcandor also sells financial products and athletic equipment 50,000 of its employees are based in Germany " This was an unavoidable step , but one which can be used to create new opportunities , " Mrs Merkel said .
The German government has been reluctant to help Arcandor , because the company was in trouble before the economic crisis .
The government has a 100 bn - euro fund to provide temporary loans for firms hit by last year 's financial crisis and its aftermath , but this does not apply to companies that first got into difficulties before 1 July 2008 .
Arcandor has been in talks with rival Metro on a merger of their department stores , as well as appealing to the government for help .
Reports suggest that Metro was looking into buying 60 of Arcandor 's Karstadt stores , and German firm Otto , world 's biggest mail order group , might be interested in parts of Primondo .
Shares in Arcandor , formerly known as KarstadtQuelle , fell 33 % to 71 euro-cents .
They were suspended earlier in the day .
Shares in the company have dropped 76 % this year , and fell 81 % last year .

( CNN ) --
The French Navy said they seized 11 pirates Sunday after they apparently mistook a French military vessel for a commercial ship and made a run at it .
A French navy sailor speaks to one of 11 pirates on board the French warship the Nivose after their capture .
Two pirate assault boats approached the Nivose " at great speed , " Capt .
Christophe Prazuck said , but a French helicopter intervened before the attackers had time to fire at the French navy ship .
The helicopter fired warning shots , he said .
The pirates , who had a mother ship as well as the two assault boats , are being held for questioning on the Nivose , Prazuck said .
The vessels were carrying AK - 47 rifles and rocket - propelled grenades , but the pirates did not fire , he said .
The incident took place about 1,000 km ( 620 miles ) east of Mombasa , Kenya , at 8:30 a.m. local time ( 0430 GMT ) he added .
In the past three weeks , the Nivose has intercepted 24 suspected pirates as part of a European Union anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia , which has become a piracy hotspot .
Over the past year , more than 100 suspected pirates have been picked up , Prazuck said .
Of that total , 27 have been released , and more than 70 taken to jail in France , handed to authorities in Somalia or taken to Kenya under an EU agreement with the government in Nairobi .
The Nivose seized three other suspected pirates Thursday morning , the French military spokesman said , but released them the next day for lack of evidence .
But a day later , the Seychelles coast guard picked up the same three men .
They claimed they were fishermen , but had no license to fish in the Seychelles exclusive economic zone , Prazuck said .
Pirates seized a ship that was carrying wheat and used vehicles to Mogadishu , Somalia , on Saturday , according to NATO , which also patrols the area .
The ship , the Almezaan , now appears to be heading for a Somali village called Harradera , known as a pirate base , Cmdr. Chris Davies told CNN .
The ship did not send a distress signal until 4 a.m.
Sunday , 18 hours after it was hijacked in the Indian Ocean , he said .
No NATO ships were in the area at the time , he added .
The Panamanian - flagged ship had a crew of 18 Indians as of April 2008 , the last listing for it on the Web site of the International Transport Workers ' Federation .
Pirates also hijacked a British - owned bulk carrier in the Indian Ocean .
The MV Ariana was carrying 35,000 tons of soya about 250 nautical miles ( 287 miles ) northwest of the Seychelles when it was seized around dawn .
The crew members are Ukrainians and they are not believed to be harmed , NATO said .
It is unclear how many crew members were aboard the vessel and how it came to be attacked .
NATO said it was unaware of ransom demands or any threats against those aboard .
NATO said a European Union Protection Aircraft has been deployed to monitor and track the MV Ariana , which is making its way toward Somalia -- the epicenter of the pirate industry .
Piracy has been soaring off the coast of eastern Africa -- particularly Somalia , which has not had an effective government since 1991 .
Somali pirates have defied foreign navies patrolling the waters and have collected large ransoms from shipping companies .
Ransoms started out in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions .
Journalist Ashleigh Nghiem contributed to this report .
All About Somalia • Pirates
Few days ago I introduced EvServer .
In this post I ’ll present a simple EvServer example .
EvServer is a normal WSGI server , but with one additional feature .
Instead of blocking in your WSGI application you yield a file descriptor to the server .
On descriptor activity the server will continue your WSGI app till it yields again .
I ’ll show how to wait for AMQP messages inside the WSGI application and how to push them up to the browser .
If you ca n’t wait till the end of the post , please feel free to view the online demo ( outdated ) of the code described below .
Consuming ( from ) the Rabbit
To consume AMQP messages we need a python amqp library ( version 0.6 ) .
Barry Pederson rewrote it lately and I must admit I really like the code now .
Great work Barry !
Usually , the code that consumes messages ( a subscriber ) looks like this :
import amqplib .
client_0_8 as amqp
def callback ( msg ) : print msg .
body
def main ( ) : conn = amqp .
Connection ( ' localhost ' , userid = ' guest ' , password = ' guest ' ) ch = conn .
channel ( ) ch . access_request ( ' / data ' , active = True , read =
True ) ch .
exchange_declare ( ' myfan ' , ' fanout ' , auto_delete = True ) qname , _ , _ = ch .
queue_declare ( ) ch . queue_bind ( qname , ' myfan ' ) ch .
basic_consume ( qname , callback = callback ) while ch .
callbacks : ch . wait ( ) # blocking here !
ch . close ( ) conn . close ( )
The problem is that we need to use it in an Asynchronous WSGI application which is non blocking .
The conversion is not very difficult .
First , we need to identify the socket descriptor on which the wait ( ) blocks , then we need to make it non-blocking .
This solution is quite hackish , but it ’s all we can do .
Maybe this hack should be put in the Hall of Fame of Dirty Hacks …
sd = conn .
transport .
sock
sd .
setblocking ( False )
At this point , a bad thing happens when ch.wait ( ) tries to block on a non-blocking descriptor .
We ’d expect the socket to raise socket.error : ( 11 , ‘ Resource temporarily unavailable ’ ) .
Actually , it fails with quite a strange exception , but fortunately it does n’t break anything inside py - amqplib :
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : [ . . . ]
File " /home/majek/amqplib-0.6/amqplib/client_0_8/connection.py " , line 201 , in _wait_method
self .
method_reader .
read_method ( ) TypeError : ' NoneType ' object is not iterable
We use this exception to identify when the library wants to block .
Having this knowledge , the main loop of a non-blocking consumer is now easy to write :
conn .
transport .
sock .
setblocking ( False ) while True : try : while True : # until the exception ch . wait ( ) except TypeError : pass < block till activity on conn .
transport .
sock >
At this point modifying the code to became a valid AWSGI application is straightforward .
Full code can be found in the EvServer examples directory .
Here ’s the simplified version :
def wsgi_subscribe ( environ , start_response ) : start_response ( " 200 OK " , [ ( ' Content - type ' , ' text / plain ' ) ] ) msgs = [ ] def callback ( msg ) : msgs .
append ( msg . body ) msg .
channel .
basic_ack ( msg . delivery_tag ) < setup connection , channel , queue > conn .
transport .
sock .
setblocking ( False ) try : while ch .
callbacks : try : while True : # until exception ch . wait ( ) except ( TypeError , ) , e : pass yield ' got messages : %rn ' % ( msgs , ) while msgs : msgs . pop ( ) # empty the queue # block !
yield environ [ ' x - wsgiorg.fdevent.readable ' ] ( conn .
transport .
sock ) except GeneratorExit : pass
Introducing the Comet library
Michael Carter has figured out how to make Comet – long lasting HTTP push connection – work on all major browsers .
As a part of EvServer I distribute a simple javascript Comet library based on his work .
The basic API consists of one method that creates a comet channel : comet_connection ( url , callback ) .
< script src= "./static/comet.js " type = " text / javascript " > </ script > < script > function user_callback ( data ) { alert ( ' got message : ' + data ) ; } close_comet_function = comet_connection ( url , user_callback ) ; </ script >
There are many different encapsulation types for Comet messages and the format of the messages emitted from the server depends sensitively on the browser type .
Fortunately the WSGI application can remain quite simple by using the evserver .
transports wrapper :
import evserver .
transports as transports
def simplest_comet_application ( environ , start_response ) : t = transports .
get_transport ( < comet transport family > ) start_response ( ' 200 OK ' , t . get_headers ( ) ) yield t . start ( ) yield t . write ( ' fist message ! ' ) yield t . write ( ' second message ! ' )
Please , do n’t build a chat
I think we ’re all sick of yet - another - chat examples .
I propose to build something similar , but instead of broadcasting chat messages let ’s broadcast user - agent and referrer http fields of people who view the site .
The html site is going to be dead simple .
On the server side we will serve comet.js file and the main HTML file .
While serving the HTML , we ’ll send an AMQP message .
We also need to create a Comet channel URL .
Let ’s use Django – in total we need three Django views , one of which can be generic .
Deployment
We need : python2.5 , rabbitmq , evserver , py - amqplib - 0.6 , django and my django project code .
sudo apt - get install erlang - nox setuptools subversion
wget http://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-server/v1.5.1/rabbitmq-server_1.5.1-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg - i rabbitmq - server_1.5.1-1_all.deb
wget http://evserver.googlecode.com/files/<current-evserver-version>
sudo easy_install evserver-*.egg
wget http://barryp.org/static/software/download/py-amqplib/0.6/amqplib-0.6.tgz
tar xvzf amqplib-0.6.tgz
cd amqplib-0.6
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
wget http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.0.2/tarball/
tar xzvf Django-1.0.2-final.tar.gz
cd Django - 1.0.2-final
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
svn checkout http://evserver.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/evserver/examples/django_agentpush django_agentpush
After these steps , to run the code just type :
cd django_agentpush
./manage.py runevserver
or
PYTHONPATH= " .. "
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=django_agentpush.settings evserver --framework=django
Currently you should be able to view online the working code ( outdated ) ( source code is here ) .
Summary
I ’ve shown how to build a comet application that waits for messages from RabbitMQ .
Using these tools you should be able to build ambitious real - time collaboration web applications , like EtherPad .
I ’m starting to believe that the hardest part in real - time web apps is the javascript .
LShift is recruiting !

Kenyan PM ’s wife joins “ sex boycott ”
Ida Odinga , wife of Kenyan prime minister Raila Odinga , has joined a Lysistrata - like nationwide sex boycott aimed at forcing the countries leaders to overcome a political impasse .
Kenyan women ’s groups started the boycott in an effort to end the feud between the factions led by Mr. Odinga and President Mwai Kibaki that has paralyzed Kenya ’s government for weeks .
Kenya ’s Federation of Women Lawyers has urged the wives of both leaders to withold sex from their husbands until the feud is resolved .
The president of the group told the BBC :
“ Great decisions are made during pillow talk , so we are asking the two ladies at that intimate moment to ask their husbands : ‘ Darling can you do something for Kenya ? ' ”
The group has also said it ’s willing to pay prostitutes in order to make the ban more effective .
No word yet on whether Kibaki ’s notoriously short - tempered wife Lucy will join the movement .
Kenyans have many good reasons to want the feud resolved , but I suspect that no longer having to hear allusions to Mwai Kibaki ‘s sex life should be reason enough by itself .

Ron Paul ’s Audit the Fed bill is now up to 190 cosponsors !
A recovery is supposed to be in the works in the midst of increased savings , declining debt balances on credit cards , more bankruptcies , higher unemployment and new wave of foreclosures .
Consumer participation in GDP is down from 72 % to 70.4 % .
Bank and other financial firms ’ balance sheets are what they say they are and we have a stock market bear rally built on sand just as we had in 1931 .
And , lest we forget , bogus government statistics calculated to confuse professionals and investors alike .
What an upside down world .
How do you make money when you are losing money ?
Wait until late July and in August when the second quarter earnings are released by financial firms .
They wo n’t be pleasant reading .
The market rally and much of the earnings are simply fraud .
Wall Street and investors simply shrug their shoulders and look away .
They know but they do not want to know .
Ever present in the scams is the SEC , which has never seen a major firm they did not like .
Acting on violations only when forced too at large firms and perpetually pursuing the small and medium sized brokers and brokerage firms and newsletter writers .
Then there is the veracity of our government for which few have any respect , trust or confidence .
Our treasury department woefully short of revenues has the privately owned Federal Reserve monetizing sovereign debt because they cannot sell it all , some $ 300 billion in Treasuries and $ 750 billion in Agency debt as the Fed monetizes an additional $ 1.5 trillion in bank owned CDOs , collateralized debt obligations , so as to remove them from bank balance sheets so they can purchase Treasuries to compete the daisy chain of fraud .
Ten - year Treasury note yields as a result have traded up to 3.84 % from 2.35 % just five months ago .
Foreigners are sellers as an avalanche of Treasuries hit the street .
The demand for Treasury funds over the next few years will be colossal .
If government raises taxes the economy will fall further .
As we forecast earlier the Fed could monetize $ 2.5 and $ 4 trillion in Treasuries and other toxic waste by the end of the calendar year .
Incidentally , there is not a remote chance that the Fed will ever be able to withdraw funds from the system and every professional has to know that .
The result is a collapsing dollar and higher gold and silver prices in anticipation of higher inflation .
This year the dollar could easily break 71.18 on the USDX , the dollar index , versus six major weighted currencies .
That would again cause , as it did from 11/07 to 6/08 , countries and foreign businesses to reject taking dollars in trade .
Such an event is in our crystal ball .
Propaganda and smoke and mirrors wo n’t work this time .
Earlier this week our Secretary of the Treasury was booed , jeered and laughed at during a speech to students at Beijing University .
That is what minds outside of the box think of our monetary policy .
He said trust me , they said no .
Needless to say , this was little reported in the mainstream media .
The people representing the money powers that control our nation are viewed as an international disgrace .
Foreigners recognize the financial Mafia that runs America , but most Americans are clueless to who the real power running America is .
We have heard much about the 40 to 60 times deposit ratios used by banks in the 2003 thru present period .
Normally that ratio is 8 to 10 to one dollar on deposit .
We painfully remember the subprime and ALT - A loans and the totally unqualified that received them .
Then the loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should have never approved and finally the asset backed securities and collateralized debt obligation bonds foisted on professionals at AAA when they were in fact BBB .
What has not been publicized was the SEC position under pressure from the elitists on Wall Street during the easy money period and the steep yield curve to exempt brokerage houses from the net capital rule .
That as well led to leverage of 40 to 60 to one .
If the banks could do it they wanted to be able to do it too to compete .
That decision ultimately led to five failures .
Even a mitigating gold standard could not have surmounted lack of regulation .
After almost 50 years in the markets and a former brokerage house owner we know financial institutions should never be allowed to self regulate .
If we have financial regulation we cannot have regulators who are friend s with the people they regulate .
No revolving door between Wall Street and the regulator .
The same goes for the revolving door between Wall Street and banking and Washington , particularly in the Treasury Department .
Real interest rates will always rise in a period of monetary and fiscal profligacy similar to what we are now experiencing as a result of unbridled leverage .
Keynesians will tell us such financial discipline is not possible in the real world , but of course it is .
They just want to perpetually break the rules .
There is no such thing as a self - regulating monetary policy .
Distortion reigns instead of a slightly expansive classical free - market model .
Markets can be far more rational then they are presently if the players are not allowed to run wild , as we have seen since 2002 .
In addition a privately owned Federal Reserve should never be allowed to exist never mind take on government responsibilities , such as financial regulation , which is currently contemplated .
The Fed has always subordinated monetary policy to the desires of Wall Street and banking and at times has bowed to political expediency .
The Fed is responsible for every recession and depression we have had since 1913 .
The great market distortions are all a product of Fed decisions .
The Fed is now using adversity to expand its empire , taking on the responsibilities of government when it should not be allowed too .
Its power to print money and credit has to be ended .
No more papering over their mistakes or willful arrangements with Wall Street and banking .
Who caused the dotcom boom and the housing bubble , they did .
As we predicted long end interest rates are already telling us that their policies are flawed as Treasuries fall in value and yields rise , a reflection of coming inflation , as the same time the dollar is falling and gold and silver are rising .
The Fed is in a box and they can not get out .
From a fiscal perspective we have had five administrations that have created tremendous fiscal debt .
The damage done by the last two administrations was horrendous .
Do n’t forget as interest rates rise on debt service the debt gets larger and larger .
These higher rates are already limiting any housing recovery and we see rates moving higher ; at least to 4 % on the 10 - year Treasury note .
That would translate into a 30 - year fixed rate mortgage of about 5 - 1/2 % .
That rate will disqualify many borrowers as unsold inventory increases via further foreclosures that will last into 2012 .
That means further price declines .
That will further destabilize the banking system .
The unsold housing inventory in lenders hands and the value of CDO and ABS bonds will fall as well .
The answer is elimination of the Fed .
Its powers would be returned to the Treasury , which would have to be transparent and the revolving door between Treasury and Wall Street and banking closed .
The Treasury would have to run a tight ship limiting money and credit creation to 5 % and by raising interest rates .
The crisis has to be addressed eventually and the longer it takes the worse it will be .
The power to run Washington by Wall Street and banking has to end .
The connection has to be broken .
Treasury and Congress have to start acting responsibility and the financial service sector will have to accept lower profits , lower bonuses and a smaller industry .
Credit default swaps have to be settled and banned and all derivatives regulated .
There has to be a permanent cap on leverage at banks and brokerage houses of 10 to one and their underlying financial bases have to be changed and closely monitored .
If we do not make these changes the financial system as we now see it is doomed .
Within 2 - 1/2 years
Treasury short - term debt will be $ 16.6 trillion , or 110 % of GDP .
This is close to 1`21 % of GDP attained after WWII , as Thomas Jefferson said , “ Loading up the nation with debt and leaving it for the following generations to pay is morally irresponsible . ”
This is the kind of society we have today .
This year foreigners will have to buy $ 862 billion treasuries , up from $ 724 billion .
We do n’t see that happening so the Fed will have to buy $ 1.5 trillion worth , perhaps more .
Legislation to give Congress greater oversight of the Federal Reserve has been severely watered down on the Senate floor in private negotiations between Sen.
Charles Grassley ( R - IO ) , the top ranking Republican on the Finance Committee , who wanted more oversight and Richard Shelby ( R - AL ) .
The Grassley Amendment intended to give the Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office power to audit any action taken by the Fed – the third undesignated paragraph of Section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act , which would be almost everything that the Fed has done on an emergency basis to address the financial crisis , encompassing its massive expansion of opaque buying and lending .
Handwritten into the margins , however , is the amendment that watered it down “ with respect to a single and specific partnership or corporation . ”
With that qualification , the Senate severely limited the scope of the oversight .
Richard Shelby was fully responsible for this course of action .
Actions will be limited to specific companies .
This modified version does not allow the GAO to look at all taxpayer risk .
It in no way threatens the Fed ’s monopoly on monetary policy and their secret independence .
The list of Fed actions that can be probed are listed but they still could be knocked out in committee .
They are :
1. Actions related to Bear Stearns and its acquisition by JP Morgan Chase , including :
a. Loan To Facilitate the Acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies , Inc. by JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( Maiden Lane I )
b. Bridge Loan to The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. Through JPMorgan Chase Bank , N.A .
2. Bank of America -- Authorization to Provide Residual Financing to Bank of America Corporation Relating to a Designated Asset Pool ( taken in conjunction with FDIC and Treasury )
3. Citigroup -- Authorization to Provide Residual Financing to Citigroup , Inc. , for a Designated Asset Pool ( taken in conjunction with FDIC and Treasury )
4. Various actions to stabilize American International Group ( AIG ) , including a revolving line of credit provided by the Federal Reserve as well as several credit facilities ( listed below ) .
AIG has also received equity from Treasury , through the TARP , which would also be captured in amendment # 1020 .
a. Secured Credit Facility Authorized for American International Group , Inc. , on September 16 , 2008
b. Restructuring of the Government 's Financial Support to American International Group , Inc. , on November 10 , 2008 ( Maiden Lane II and Maiden Lane III )
c. Restructuring of the Government 's Financial Support to American International Group , Inc. , on March 2 , 2009
5. TALF -- finally , amendment # 1020 would expand GAO 's authority to oversee the TARP , including the joint Federal Reserve - Treasury Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF )
* Neither * Amendment # 1021 nor # 1020 would include short - term liquidity facilities :
1. Asset - Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility 2 . ( AMLF ) 3 . Commercial Paper Funding Facility ( CPFF ) 4 . Money Market Investor Funding Facility ( MMIFF ) 5 . Primary Dealer Credit Facility and Other Credit for Broker - Dealers ( PDCF ) 6 . Term Securities Lending Facility ( TSLF )
Section 404 of the Sarbanes - Oxley legislation has been a bonanza for accounting firms .
It has caused a high proportion of major foreign companies to de-list themselves from the NYSE and it has erected an artificial barrier to the globalization of capital markets .
Thus , it is n’t all bad as depicted by corporate America .
The size of the commercial paper market , a vital source of short - term funding for daily operations of many companies , fell $ 3.6 billion to $ 1.245 trillion , from $ 1.248 trillion the previous week .
Asset - backed CP outstanding fell 8.3 billion to $ 557.4 billion after falling $ 8.7 billion the prior week .
The top was $ 2.2 trillion .
Mortgage rates surged 0.38 % .
The 30 - year fixed rate was 5.29 % up from 4.91 % .
Sales were weaker than expected at 63 % of the 30 retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters .
The S&P retailers index fell 2.5 % .
May same store sales fell 4.8 % .
The International Council of Shopping Centers forecast a 3 to 4 percent drop in June same store sales , down from 4.6 % in May .
Freight traffic on railroads continued down for the week of 5/23 yoy , off some 21.5 % , but up 4.9 % week - on - week .
Loadings were down 16.4 % in the West and 28 % in the East .
Farm products fell 4.8 % and metallic ores fell 59.7 % .
Trailers or containers fell 19.1 % yoy , and container volume fell 19.1 % yoy , as trailer traffic fell 37.2 % .
Year - to - date carloads are off 19.3 % ytd and trailers and containers 16.8 % .
Total volume was down 18.2 % .
Something that should be remembered is that in 1930 government bonds were used massively for capital safety .
In 1931 , investors had doubts and started switching to gold , which ran up in price forcing interest rates higher .
This is what is happening today .
In 1930 , there was no shortage of bank reserves and that carried into 1931 .
There were excess reserves and interest rates were very low .
The financial atmosphere in 1928 - 29 was the same as it was here in 2005 and 2006 .
It was a new era , nothing could possibly go wrong .
The Fed refused to reign in cheap money and credit .
Commercial paper rates were 1.25 % and excess reserves increased four - fold .
In the late summer of 1931 gold began its run .
History is about to repeat itself .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke deliberately lied to Congress this week .
The Fed and the NY fed pumped credit aggressively after the 1929 crash and for the remainder of the 1930s .
The exception was 1932 when gold took its big run .
Bernanke denied this and it is an historical fact .
He also duplicitously told Congress the Fed will not monetize debt , but that is exactly what he is doing .
Ben is part of the fascist propaganda machine .
Tell a lie long enough and big enough and everyone will believe it .
This can be called Fed speak .
Big Brother would have been very proud of Ben and his fellow Illuminists .
Dick Cheney attempted to win support for harsh interrogation of ' suspected terrorists ' by controlling the information Congress would receive on the matter , a report says .
In 2005 , the former US vice president directed ' at least four ' related briefings with Congressmen during which he would produce ' an impassioned defense ' of ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' -- the former administration 's euphemism for torture , The Washington Post reported on Wednesday .
" This is a really important issue for the security of the United States , " one official quoted Cheney as having told the lawmakers .
Officials , attending the meeting from the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , with whom the program is associated , would also try quelling the Congressmen 's concerns about the program saying the agency owed half of its information on alleged ' terrorists ' to the methods .
The former top gun has produced an ' overrated ' account of the security gains of the former administrations ' anti- terror ' campaign .
He has claimed that the Bush administration 's trademark ' war on terror ' was likely to have saved " violent death of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , of people " - an achievement which resembles that of World - War - II intelligence heroes .
The paper quoted Sen. Lindsey O. Graham ( R - S.C. ) as confirming Cheney 's leading role in selling the program .
" His office was ground zero .
It was his office you dealt with at the end of the day . "
Two more Iranian families accuse Blackwater , now known as Xe , of murdering their husbands and fathers in Baghdad and covering it up .
Azhar Abdullah Ali , 33 , a father of three , was a security guard for the Iraqi Media Network when Blackwater mercenaries killed him and two others on Feb. 7 , 2007 , according to the federal complaint .
The family of Rahim Khalaf Sa'adoon claims drunken Blackwater mercenary Andrew Moonen killed Sa'adoon on Christmas Eve , " for no reason , " as Sa'adoon guarded the vice president of Iraq .
The security guard family 's complaint states : " The Sabah Salman Hassoon , Azhar Abdullah Ali , and Nibrass Mohammed Dawood are but one of a staggering number of senseless deaths that directly resulted from Xe - Blackwater 's misconduct , " according to the complaint .
Sa'adoon left two young children and his wife .
Named as defendants are Erik Prince , Prince Group , EP Investments LLC , EP Investments LLC , Greystone , Total Intelligence , The Prince Group LLC , Xe , Blackwater Worldwide , Blackwater Lodge and Training Center , Blackwater Target Systems , Blackwater Security Consulting , and Raven Development Group .
Both families seek punitive damages for war crimes , wrongful death , assault and battery , spoliation of evidence , and negligence .
They are represented by Susan Burke with Burke O'Neil of Philadelphia .
Nonmanufacturing activity lost ground at a slightly slower pace in May , amid signs the sector may be preparing for recovery .
The Institute for Supply Management , a private research group , reported Wednesday that its NMI / PMI index stood at 44.0 from 43.7 in April and 40.8 in March .
That reading was below the 45.0 expected by economists .
The ISM also said that its May business activity / production index came in at 42.4 , from 45.2 in April .
The ISM report , which is comprised mainly of the service sector activities that make up the bulk of U.S. economic activity , arrives at a time when economic data are suggesting the recession may no longer be getting worse .
Factory orders rose in April less than expected , a barometer of capital spending by businesses plunged , and inventories fell an eighth straight month .
Orders for manufactured goods increased 0.7 % , following a downwardly revised 1.9 % decline in March , the Commerce Department said Wednesday .
Originally , factory orders were seen dropping by 0.9 % in March .
Economists had forecast overall April factory goods orders would rise by 1.0 % .
The report underscored the weakness of a sector that , while showing signs of improvement , is still limping .
Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft decreased 2.4 % in April after sliding 1.4 % in March .
Those bookings are seen as a yardstick for capital spending by businesses .
Demand for durable goods were revised down to an increase of 1.7 % in April .
Last week , Commerce , in an early estimate , said durables surged 1.9 % in April .
Durables are expensive goods made to last at least three years , such as cars .
Durables fell 2.2 % in March .
Non-durable goods factory orders decreased 0.1 % , after falling by 1.6 % in March .
A sign of future factory demand fell , down for seven straight months .
Unfilled orders decreased 1.2 % in April , after dropping 1.7 % in March .
Business spending was atrocious in the first quarter of this year .
Outlays fell by 36.9 % January through March , after dropping 21.7 % in the fourth quarter .
The economy in those six months was dreary , with gross domestic product down 6.3 % in the fourth quarter and 5.7 % during the first quarter .
Nearly half of that 5.7 % drop was caused by U.S. businesses liquidating inventories to adjust for receding demand .
The factory data Wednesday showed manufacturers ' inventories in April dropped 1.0 % , after falling 1.2 % in March .
More liquidation could be in the offing .
The latest Commerce Department report on business inventories showed the inventory - to - sales ratio was a relatively high 1.44 in March .
The gauge indicates how well firms are matching supply with demand .
It measures how long in months a firm could sell all current inventory .
A year earlier , the I/S ratio was 1.28 .
The government now has an equity stake in auto lender GMAC Financial Services after providing $ 12.5 billion in aid to keep loans flowing to buyers of GM and Chrysler cars , the Treasury Department said Tuesday .
The Treasury holds a 35.4 percent stake in GMAC , after exchanging an $ 884 million loan it made to General Motors Corp. for that equity under an earlier agreement .
GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday , a historic move designed to remake the automaker as a smaller and leaner company , that also made the federal government its principal owner with a 60 percent stake .
The government has a vested interest in seeing GMAC , Chrysler and GM succeed in order to recoup the billions in aid it has doled out to the companies .
Analysts have suggested the federal support for GMAC will help make it a lending powerhouse that will give GM and Chrysler a big advantage over their competitors — including U.S. rival Ford Motor Co. — which has n't taken government aid .
Mortgage rates rose sharply last week , and the volume of mortgage applications filed fell a seasonally adjusted 16.2 % compared with the previous week , the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday .
Applications were up an unadjusted 14.4 % for the week ended May 29 from the comparable week in 2008 , according to the Washington - based MBA 's survey , results for which were adjusted to account for the Memorial Day holiday .
The latest survey , which covers half of all U.S. retail residential mortgage applications , mirrored a similar pattern for mortgage filings seen in the week ended May 22 .

Why should dinosaurs have all the fun ?
Here are a few prehistoric critters that are every bit as bizarre as the strangest of the dinos : Opabinia Artist 's rendering of Opabinia .
Image : ArthurWeasley [ Wikipedia ]
Opabinia regalis fossil from the Burgess shale on display at the Smithsonian in Washington DC .
Image : Jstuby [ Wikipedia ]
It might be a distant cousin of shrimp salad or it might be unrelated to anything alive today .
Although it looked like something out of a science fiction movie , this weird four - inch - long animal lived in the sea that covered what is now Canada about 530 million years ago .
Instead of legs , it had 14 pairs of oarlike gills used for swimming .
But the real strangeness was saved for the head .
It had five eyes - two pairs on stalks and another sitting in the middle of the top of the head .
In front of all these eyes was a long flexible nozzle with a claw at the end .
Scientists think the claw captured food and carried it to the mouth .
Hallucigenia Hallucigenia fossil .

This appropriately named little beast bears no resemblance to any animal alive or dead .
Like Opabinia , it lived in Canada about 530 million years ago .
Hallucigenia is so bizarre that scientists are uncertain which end is the front and which side is up .
The most - accepted version shows a wormlike body supported by seven pairs of spines .
Along the top of the body were seven long tentacles with two - pronged tips .
One end had a bulbous feature that looked a bit like a head but with no sign of eyes or mouth .
At the other end was a long tube that curved up over the " back , " which may have been a mouth or an anus .
Carpoids Bundenbach Carpoid fossil .
Photo : Fossil Museum Virtually all animals have some kind of symmetry - either bilateral like humans where your right hand is the mirror image of your left hand , or radial like a starfish , which looks the same no matter which arm is pointing up .
But carpoids were completely asymmetrical .
This distant relation of the sand dollar lived in the oceans of the Northern Hemisphere from 500 to about 350 million years ago .
It looked something like a misshapen armored tadpole , with a bulging body covered with stony plates and a long , segmented tail that it used for swimming .
Some scientists think that carpoids may have been the ancestors of vertebrates .
Conodonts Various conodonts .
Image : USGS
For more than a century scientists kept finding microscopic , teethlike objects in marine rocks dating from 510 to 210 million years ago .
They looked like tiny , cone - shaped teeth or combs , but there was no sign of a jaw or any other bit of skeleton associated with them .
There were quite a few theories about what class of animal these conodonts belonged to , but it was n't until about 20 years ago that a fossil of the whole animal was found .
In appearance it was not spectacular .
It was long and thin like a worm , but it had eyes and a low dorsal fin , and the teeth were located in the mouth .
Many scientists now believe that the conodont may be one of the earliest - known vertebrates .
Ostracoderms
Some of the earliest vertebrates were armored , jawless fish that were most common between 430 and 370 million years ago .
These fish had skeletons made of cartilage , but their bodies were covered with plates of bone , so it could be said that they were wearing their skeletons on the outside .
Ostracoderms could be up to 3 feet ( 1 m ) long , but most were under a foot .
Their heads were usually covered by a semicircular shield with two small holes for eyes .
The rest of the body was surrounded by articulated plates that allowed the animal to swim slowly by moving its tail from side to side .
These animals preferred a quiet environment like a lagoon where they could drift along the bottom , straining edible particles out of the mud .
Diplocaulus Diplocaulus magnicornis .
Image : ArthurWeasley [ Wikipedia ]
This 3 - foot ( 1 m ) long amphibian lived in what is now Texas about 270 million years ago .
In most respects it looked like a large salamander , but its head made it unique .
The skull was shaped like a boomerang with two small eyes in the front corners and the wings on either side .
Scientists are not sure why Diplocaulus 's head is such an odd shape , but they think it was either to make the animal swim better near the bottom of the lakes and streams it lived in - or the wide head made it more difficult for predators to swallow .
Lystrosaurus Lystrosaurus georgi .
Image : Dmitry Bogdanov [ Wikipedia ]
Before the age of the dinosaurs , there were a lot of strange - looking reptiles , but few odder than Lystrosaurus .
This 3 - foot - long plant - eater had a squat body and splayed legs like a lizard , but its muzzle was shortened a bit like that of a bulldog .
As if this was n't attractive enough , from the corners of its mouth hung two long tusks .
The eyes and nostrils were set high up , making some scientists think that the animal had lived the way hippos do now , but recent findings show that Lystrosaurus could also have lived in arid environments that were common about 230 million years ago .
Ambulocetus [ YouTube Link ]
Halfway between the land - dwelling ancestors of whales and the modern marine mammals , Ambulocetus lived in what is now Pakistan about 50 million years ago .
This 12 - foot - long animal looked a bit like a cross between an otter and an alligator .
It had a large head with long jaws and pointed teeth designed for catching and holding fish like an alligator , but the body was more like that of an otter .
Scientists think it swam by moving its tail up and down like a modern whale rather than from side to side like a fish .
Phorusrhacos About 20 million years ago , South America was an island continent with its own unique forms of birds and mammals .
Because no large mammalian predators had evolved there , the top carnivore was a bird - Phorusrhacos .
These flightless birds stood up to 10 feet ( 3 m ) tall and had a head the size of that of a horse .
Although they could n't fly , they were very fast runners .
They could run down their prey , catch it with their powerful talons , and tear it apart with their long , hooked beaks .
These frightening birds survived until about 3 million years ago , when a land bridge formed between North and South America , allowing modern carnivores to invade South America and give Phorusrhacos a little carnivorish competition .
( Image : Drawing of Phorusrhacos by Charles R. Knight [ wikipedia ] ) Diprotodon Diprotodon optatum .
Image : Dmitry Bogdanov [ Wikipedia ] Diprotodon australis in the British Museum of Natural History .
Before humans arrived in Australia about 40,000 years ago , marsupials were larger and more varied than they are today .
The largest of all was the Diprotodon , which was about the size of a hippopotamus .
It looked like a gigantic wombat ( one of those furry , bearlike things ) , and it ate leaves and grass .
It was n't a fast runner , but it was too large for any of the native predators to tackle until humans came along .
( We 're not pointing fingers or anything , but the Diprotodon became extinct suspiciously soon after the first humans arrived .
Coincidence ? )
Glyptodon Glyptodon asper in Naturhistorisches Museum Wien .
Image : Arent [ Wikipedia ]
The most heavily armored mammal of all time has to have been the Glyptodon .
About the size of a VW Beetle , this distant relation of the armadillo roamed the plains of South American until 15,000 years ago .
The first humans in that part of the world encountered these strange beasts and incorporated them into their legends .
Glyptodon resembled a turtle with patches of fur except that the high , rounded shell was made of many small plates of bone .
It had a long tail with a ball at the end of it like the mace of a medieval knight .
Moropus Moropus elatus , on display at the National Museum of Natural History .
Image : Claire H. [ Wikipedia ]
When scientists first discovered the Moropus , they could n't believe that the horselike head and body belonged with the long claws and massive feet found nearby .
This 10 - foot - long distant relative of the horse looked like a mixed - up bag of spare parts .
The head and neck looked like a stunted giraffe , but the body was more like that of a bear .
The front legs were quite a bit longer than the back legs , and all four feet were armed with long claws .
Some scientists believe that Moropus fed by rearing up on its hind legs and pulling down branches so it could strip off the leaves with its long tongue .
This animal lived in tropical Asia until about 12,000 years ago .
Mammuthus Woolly Mammoth at the Royal BC Museum in Victoria , British Columbia .
Image : Tracy O [ Wikipedia ]
Everyone knows what a woolly mammoth looked like - a big hairy elephant with long , curling tusks .
Everyone also knows that they died out at the end of the last ice age , about 10,000 years ago .
Guess again .
For one thing , the last mammoths were n't very mammoth ; they were about the size of a buffalo .
They lived on Wrangel Island , off the northern coast of Siberia , and survived after other mammoths became extinct .
Scientists believe that the dwarf mammoths were still around about 4,000 years ago , after the pyramids were built !
Martin Whelan , the owner of a dozen pubs and restaurants in NYC , has partnered with the New York Blood Center to help drive donations during its time of need .
Intel and Nokia are joining forces in an effort to reshape the boundaries of mobile computing .
The two companies announced plans on Tuesday to collaborate on software and hardware through a new long - term strategic relationship .
Advancing the open source Linux operating system and encouraging industry - wide participation in mobile Linux development is one of the pillars of the deal .
The news was revealed during a press conference Tuesday that was conducted jointly by Intel ultra mobility group senior vice president Anand Chandrasekher and Nokia executive vice president of devices Kai Oistamo .
They discussed the growing trend towards convergence of conventional computing and mobile communications .
The aim of their relationship , they say , is to explore the opportunities presented by this trend and build new kinds of mobile devices that will give users a richer Internet experience .
Noting that Intel and Nokia are the leaders in computing and communications , Oistamo contends that it 's natural for the two companies to play a prominent role together in setting the direction of future innovation for their industries .
Although they talked a lot about innovation and creating new classes of mobile computing products , they were extremely light on specifics .
It 's totally unclear what form these new devices will take .
It 's not even possible to guess whether the device will look like a netbook , a MID , or a smartphone .
As a result of the ambiguity , the question - and - answer session that followed the announcement was almost comical .
When pushed to provide more details , both executives simply repeated , over and over again , that the current announcement is about technical collaboration and that there are no product plans that they can announce at this time .
They contend that they are laying the foundation for building a groundbreaking mobile Internet experience , but they could n't really say what that experience will be like .
The strategic relationship consists of plans to develop new Intel chips that will power the devices and collaboration to boost Linux - based mobile software solutions .
Intel has also licensed Nokia 's 3G modem patents so that chip maker can expand its connectivity offerings .
" This Intel and Nokia collaboration unites and focuses many of the brightest computing and communications minds in the world , and will ultimately deliver open and standards - based technologies , which history shows drive rapid innovation , adoption and consumer choice , " said Chandrasekher in a statement .
" With the convergence of the Internet and mobility as the team 's only barrier , I can only imagine the innovation that will come out of our unique relationship with Nokia .
The possibilities are endless . "
The actual product possibilities are vague , but the impact of their collaboration on mobile Linux will be widely felt .
Intel 's Linux - based Moblin platform is positioned to become one of the most prominent on Atom - based netbook devices and it has attracted strong support from a large number of popular Linux distributors .
Nokia 's Linux - based Maemo platform , which powers the company 's Internet Tablet devices , is a mature and highly - polished solution for handheld ARM devices .
These platforms have much in common and share many underlying components , such as Xorg , D - Bus , and GStreamer .
Nokia and Intel plan to more closely align their platforms and boost interoperability with the hope of fostering the emergence of a larger ecosystem of compatible third - party applications .
The Linux Foundation , which was recently invited by Intel to help coordinate broader community and industry involvement in Moblin , could possibly play a role in helping to standardize the technology stack that is jointly selected by Intel and Nokia .
Intel and Nokia revealed in May that they are working together to develop a new open source telephony framework for Linux called oFono that will be used on Moblin and Maemo .
This project will be one of the centerpieces of their new strategic relationship .
It will provide shared software components for facilitating telecommunication and will also give developers a uniform high - level API for building phone software that is compatible with both platforms .
The new strategic relationship reflects Nokia 's growing emphasis on Linux - based technology and the declining relevance of the company 's Symbian - based S60 platform .
Symbian's x86 support is still highly experimental , which makes Linux a more compelling choice for Nokia to use in products that contain Intel chips .
Oistamo's only response to questions about the implications for S60 was to say that Linux is a stronger candidate for building the new kinds of devices envisioned by Nokia and Intel — products that will meet the demand for a more desktop - like Internet experience in mobile form factors .
Leaked details about Nokia 's Maemo roadmap indicate that the company has been planning to use the platform as the basis for building a next - generation smartphone .
Maemo 5 , which was announced last year and is under active development , will have 3G data connectivity .
Harmattan , the next major version after the upcoming Maemo 5 , is said to be destined for release at the end of 2010 and will have voice calling capabilities .
Maemo 5 will run on devices with TI 's ARM - based OMAP3 chips , but it 's possible that we will see Harmattan on the first of Nokia 's Intel - powered mobile products .
The strong commitment to Linux by Intel and Nokia is a sign of growing consensus in the mobile industry that the open source operating system will play a central role in delivering the underlying foundation of the software experience on portable computing products .
The results of this poll will be printed in the July 8 issue of the Guardian .
Thanks to everyone who voted .
While anti-piracy company MediaDefender only got involved in hindering downloaders , BayTSP is the outfit that tracks file - sharers and sends infringement notices to ISPs .
Using cumulative data from its entertainment industry clients , the company reveals which nation 's sharers get caught infringing the most .
Anti-piracy company BayTSP works with the entertainment industry to track down illicit file - sharers , monitor them and gather evidence in order to issue infringement notices to their ISP , i.e stop downloading – or else .
In addition , the company gathers intelligence for clients who want to see where their content is appearing , to understand the scope of it all .
BayTSP has used the data it collected on behalf of its clients to produce its just released Online Trends & Insights 2008 report and there are some quite interesting findings .
The report notes that BitTorrent has further strengthened its dominant position as the protocol used to infringe the most copyrights , with eDonkey ( eD2k ) in second place .
It has to be noted that BitTorrent may be more actively and easily monitored than Usenet and other file - sharing platforms , and that this resulted in more recorded infringements .
“ BitTorrent and eDonkey are optimized for large file distribution and despite the growing popularity of streaming video , are still where the majority of copyright infringement takes place , ” said BayTSP CEO Mark Ishikawa in a comment on the report .
Recorded infringements per source
In terms of P2P infringement location , BayTSP also claims that despite topping the list of most - infringing countries in 2007 , the United States has seen the number of infringements fall ever since , pushing it down into 4th position .
Recorded infringements per country
Copyright infringement on file - sharing networks has surged in Europe , helping France move up to 3rd place in the piracy league .
A single ISP , France Telecom , clocked up more than 2 million logged infringements .
Second place went to Italy and one of its ISPs , Telecom Italia , also reached over 2 million infringements .
The title of most - infringing country goes to Spain , with ISP Telefonica De Espana playing host to more than 2 million infringements .
The report also reveals that BayTSP sent more than a million infringement notices each to Comcast , AT&T and Road Runner in 2008 .
Comcast had the most copyright infringements of all ISPs in the US , 1,668,738 in total during 2008 .
Finally , the report discovered another interesting trend .
The median download time for a TV - show is much shorter on BitTorrent than on eDonkey .
With BitTorrent it takes roughly 10 hours while eDonkey users may have to wait a full 4 days before their download is complete .
The Obama administration is moving toward reviving the military commission system for prosecuting Guantánamo detainees , which was a target of critics during the Bush administration , including Mr. Obama himself .
Officials said the first public moves could come as soon as next week , perhaps in filings to military judges at the United States naval base at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , outlining an administration plan to amend the Bush administration ’s system to provide more legal protections for terrorism suspects .
Continuing the military commissions in any form would probably prompt sharp criticism from human rights groups as well as some of Mr. Obama ’s political allies because the troubled system became an emblem of the effort to use Guantánamo to avoid the American legal system .
Officials who work on the Guantánamo issue say administration lawyers have become concerned that they would face significant obstacles to trying some terrorism suspects in federal courts .
Judges might make it difficult to prosecute detainees who were subjected to brutal treatment or for prosecutors to use hearsay evidence gathered by intelligence agencies .

Sandia successfully completes hydrogen storage system for GM
By Mike Janes
Sandia researchers have designed and demonstrated key features of a hydrogen storage system that uses a complex metal hydride material known as sodium alanate .
The system , developed through a multiyear project funded by General Motors , stores three kilograms of hydrogen , making it large enough to evaluate control strategies suitable for use in vehicle applications .
The design tools developed by Sandia researchers now provide GM with a workable template for future designs , which is expected to significantly save the company costs and time when developing hydrogen storage systems for onboard vehicular applications .
“ For GM , the enduring value of this project can be found in the design concepts , computational tools , and control strategies that Sandia developed , ” says Jim Spearot , GM lead executive for hydrogen storage .
“ With this new body of knowledge and information , we will be able to quickly design viable systems as new storage materials emerge . ”
Methods have been validated
Sandia researchers are quick to point out that the system was not meant to fit on board a vehicle , and that sodium alanate will not be the material of choice for onboard storage of hydrogen .
But , although it is indeed larger and heavier than a viable automotive storage system requires , the system ’s engineered elements address many of the thermal management issues necessary for successful vehicular storage of hydrogen .
“ We ’ve shown that we can engineer vehicle - scale energy storage systems to meet a variety of operating requirements and driving cycles , and our design methods have been validated for relevant materials , ” says Terry Johnson ( 8365 ) .
Terry says Sandia is well - equipped to do similar work on behalf of other companies , including those that manufacture rolling stock , specialty , or heavy - duty vehicles .
Companies that focus on other niche applications , including underwater , military , or unmanned aerial vehicles , would likely benefit from Sandia ’s expertise , too , he says .
Modular heat exchange system
In addition to its storage capacity , the unique features of the Sandia system include an advanced heating system whereby a fraction of the stored hydrogen is used to provide heat to release the remaining hydrogen .
This method — the catalytic combustion of hydrogen — is not new , Terry says , but is unique to this particular application and the first to be successfully demonstrated .
“ We chose not to use resistive [ electrically driven ] heating , because it would have necessarily resulted in a larger and heavier system , ” he says .
After considering a number of thermal management options , Sandia selected a “ shell - and - tube ” heat exchanger , a heating technique common in many industrial processes .
The “ SmartBed ” — a term coined by Sandia that refers to the method for controlling a modular storage system — consists of four identical modules , each of which contains a shell - and - tube heat exchanger .
The material used to store the hydrogen — sodium alanate — resides within the tubes , which essentially serve as a high - pressure storage vessel .
Inside the shell , a heating fluid circulates to transfer heat to and from the sodium alanate .
The modular design of the system means that only a minimum amount of the storage material needs to be heated at any one time .
The design also aids in packaging the system to fit on board a vehicle .
Sandia ’s work with GM on a hydrogen storage system reflects the Labs ’ long history of exploring basic and applied science for energy and transportation .
From developing renewable means of producing hydrogen , to discovering the science behind hydrogen safety , to creating the building blocks of hydrogen and fuel cell systems , Sandia scientists and engineers are actively working to help hydrogen and fuel cells take their place in a sustainable energy future .

Red Sky at night , Sandias new computing might
By Stephanie Holinka
There ’s a new supercomputer being born at Sandia , and it will stand on the shoulders of giants .
But it will also be a more democratic supercomputer : of Sandia , by Sandia , and for all Sandians .
Red Sky , now being assembled in the space where legendary system ASCI Red once stood , will replace Thunderbird , which currently serves as Sandia ’s “ everyday ” computer .
Red Sky will deliver more than 160 tera - flops peak performance and will provide roughly three times the computing capacity of Thunderbird .
Red
Sky is designed to be expanded economically to several times this initial capacity to meet future growth in demand .
That ’s important because in - house requests for institutional computing cycles currently outpace supply by a factor of four .
“ One thing that ’s really exciting to me about this project , ” says Rob Leland , director of Computing and Network Services Center 9300 , “ is that we ’re taking the architectural philosophy and design principles that we pioneered in systems for the weapons program such as ASCI Red and Red Storm and building a machine that will be broadly available to the entire Laboratory . ”
Rob says Red Sky is intended to be a capacity machine ( intended to support a large number of small and medium - sized jobs ) but to be much more scalable , ( allowing larger , more complex jobs to be run ) than typical commercially provided capacity systems .
The trick , Rob says , is to leverage the economics of commodity parts and yet incorporate the design principles learned from previous generations of specialized high - performance computing systems .
The use of “ red ” in the name is meant to evoke the successful supercomputing systems and programs of Sandia ’s past .
The designers and builders of Red Sky built on the design principles and successes of earlier machines such as ASCI Red from the mid-1990s and Red Storm from early 2000 .
“ We use ‘ red ’ in the name to convey that we intend to deliver a very high - caliber system to the user community at Sandia , ” Rob says .
“ It ’s also intended to convey to the broader computing community that this is a machine consistent in its approach and its philosophy with those previous machines that were so highly regarded .
We ’re trying to create that continuity and that sense of legacy . ”
Red Sky will be more than just a capacity machine .
“ It ’s a scalable design , ” Rob says , “ which means that application codes can run very efficiently using lots of processors on the system .
But it ’s also an extensible machine , meaning we can physically build it out .
We can add more computing power to it in an efficient way that does n’t require us to rework the machine . ”
Rob says that in a more typical machine designers have to add a whole bunch of infrastructure to it in a nonlinear way to improve performance .
“ Normally , ” Rob says , “ if you doubled the size of the machine , for example , you ’d need four times as much cabling .
That ’s not true here because the machine is very replicable and very extensible . ”
One key feature that enables physically extending the machine is the simple “ topology ” used , Rob says , meaning that things are connected in a three - dimensional mesh - type grid .
“ It turns out , ” Rob says “ that structure is a good choice for mapping physical codes onto the machine because physics is typically expressed mathematically in a three - dimensional grid that matches well to the machine . ”
A project of this complexity and ambition requires a close partnership with leading - edge vendors .
In this case , Sandia worked with Sun Microsystems and Intel .
“ Sun was willing to take substantial risks and create and invest in technology for the partnership , ” Rob says , “ so it was a very good fit for our needs and goals . ”
Sun was also willing to work with Sandia to innovate in several key dimensions , he says .
“ Intel gave us early access to their latest processing technology and very competitive pricing for that new technology , ” Rob says .
Intel was a natural choice because it has been very actively reestablishing itself in the scientific high - performance computing market in recent years .
Rob says
Intel ’s processor technology is moving intentionally toward incorporating certain key technologies and design features that support Sandia ’s goals for the machine .
The Red Sky project , Rob notes , required both a commitment to strong technical innovation and strong value because the machine must provide the highest - quality service for the lowest prices possible .
The Labs also wanted the project to continue Sandia ’s legacy of innovation and excellence in high - performance computing and leadership in the field .
Red Sky is expected to be online in full production service later this year .

Sandia , Purdue investigate new methods for monitoring and operating wind turbines
By Chris Burroughs
Sensors placed on Sandia research turbines in Bushland , Texas , are providing researchers from the Labs and Purdue University enhanced capabilities to monitor and control wind turbines .
A team from both institutions presented research on the topic in a paper at the Windpower 2009 Conference and Exhibition in Chicago in early May .
“ Excessive loads on wind turbines can cause damage to components , which can then lead to costly repairs or even catastrophic failure in some circumstances , ” says Josh Paquette ( 6333 ) , one of the Sandia engineers who worked on the project .
“ We are investigating how an accelerometer system can help determine blade motions and structural health , and allow for operational modifications to avoid damage . ”
The accelerometer systems consist of sensors and software that constantly monitor forces exerted on wind turbine blades .
They measure two types of acceleration : those due to varying winds and those caused by gravity and rotation .
It is essential to accurately measure and separate both sources of acceleration to estimate forces exerted on the blades .
Purdue is under contract with Sandia to help develop the technology .
In this particular research relationship , the two institutions are collaborating on an experiment using these sensors to monitor turbines in real time .
The goal is to determine how the blades were actually being loaded and then eventually feed that information into a turbine ’s control system .
The sensor research , says Jose Zayas , manager of Wind Energy Technology Dept. 6333 , has been conducted on subscale experimental - size blades .
The results will then be extrapolated to full - size machines .
“ This work is important because as more wind power is deployed , it is essential to continue to develop innovations that improve the technology and protect the capital investments , ” Jose says .
“ Each utility - scale machine costs in the range of $ 2 million to $ 4 million and damaged components could lead to the loss of entire machines . ”
Wind power is becoming a more prevalent part of the US energy portfolio , Jose notes .
At the end of 2008 some 25 gigawatts of wind energy had been installed nationwide .
Also , in 2008 — for the second year in a row — wind energy accounted for approximately 40 percent of all new energy installed in the US .
A wind turbine ’s major components include rotor blades , a gearbox , and generator .
The wind turbine blades are made primarily of fiberglass and balsa wood or foam , and occasionally are strengthened with carbon fiber .
“ The aim is to operate the generator and the turbine in the most efficient way , but this is difficult because wind speeds fluctuate , ” says Doug Adams , a professor of mechanical engineering and director of Purdue ’s Center for Systems Integrity .
“ You want to be able to control the generator or the pitch of the blades to optimize energy capture by reducing forces on the components in the wind turbine during low winds .
In addition to improving efficiency , this should help improve reliability . ”
Jose calls the joint research between Sandia and Purdue “ a perfect partnership between a national laboratory and an academic institution .
“ It shows how the two can work together and collaborate to improve industry , ” he says .-- Chris Burroughs

Buckeye Piez is area 's latest pizza craze
Buckeye Piez is a new business opened by Chad and Johanne Lynn .
It 's located at the entrance of Dillon State Park .
Analysis The Royal Navy 's new billion - pound Type 45 destroyers are back in the news again for unfortunate reasons , with the head of an influential parliamentary committee saying it's " disgraceful " that they will enter service without their French - supplied primary weapons ever having been fired from the ships .
The Royal Navy 's first billion - pound gunboat .
The Type 45s are fleet air - defence ships , designed primarily to carry the Principal Anti Air Missile System ( PAAMS ) , which the Royal Navy nowadays likes to refer to as Sea Viper .
PAAMS / Sea Viper will use radars - especially the Sampson masthead firecontrol radar on the ship - and two different kinds of French " Aster " missiles to shoot down airborne targets .
At the moment , though Type 45s have been launched and the first one , HMS Daring , is now steaming around with a naval captain and crew , PAAMS / Sea Viper is n't ready to go .
As the Commons Public Accounts Committee points out in its latest report , the ships wo n't really be completed for at least two years .
There have been a number of problems on the project , meaning it will enter service over two years late and £ 1.5 billion over its original budget ...
Although the Type 45 will enter service in 2009 , it is a disgrace that it will do so without a PAAMS missile having been fired from the ship , and will not achieve full operational capability until 2011 .
Other equipments and capabilities which will enhance the ship 's ability to conduct anti-air warfare operations will not be fitted until after the ship enters service in some cases .
The six destroyers for the navy are now projected to cost £ 6.46 bn , up by £ 350 m just in the last 18 months .
In addition to PAAMS / Sea Viper , they are intended to carry basic 4.5 - inch " Kryten " gun turrets and a pair of single - barrelled , manually aimed 30 mm cannon for such tasks as shooting up pirate dhows , small boats etc .
Space has also been included in the design to fit much more powerful Phalanx gatling robocannon , useful for last - ditch air or missile defence , and / or Tomahawk cruise missiles .
However , no money is planned in for these latter refinements .
While the navy will probably manage to cannibalise a few Phalanxes from retiring ships in coming years - meaning that it can perhaps put some on at least those Type 45s it sends to dangerous regions - Tomahawk is only a dream .
Right now , rather sadly , HMS Daring is sailing around with nothing but her 4.5 and a brace of 30 mms - a rather pathetic capability for a £ 1.1 bn ship with a crew of 200 .
Her captain 's brave boast that she is " the most capable Air Defence Destroyer in the World " will ring more than a little hollow until at least a couple of years have passed .
He 'll most probably have moved on by then , as he 's already been in command for over a year .
