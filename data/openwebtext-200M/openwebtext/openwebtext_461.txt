Judiciary Committee chairman requests special counsel to investigate CIA rendition RAW STORY

House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , Jr. ( D - MI ) , Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties Subcommittee Chairman Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) , and Foreign Affairs Chairman of the International Organizations , Human Rights and Oversight Subcommittee , Bill Delahunt ( D - MA ) , today called on Attorney General Michael Mukasey to appoint a special counsel to investigate the rendition of a Canadian citizen , Maher Arar , to Syria .
Returning home to Canada in September 2002 , Mr. Arar was detained at JFK airport in New York based on false intelligence suggesting ties to terrorist activity .
Despite finding that he would likely be subject to torture , Mr. Arar was then removed to Syria at the direction of the Commissioner of the INS and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General .
Mr. Arar was subsequently imprisoned for nearly a year and tortured .
In June , the former Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Clark Ervin testified before a joint Judiciary and Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing that he believed that U.S. officials intended to render Mr. Arar to Syria , rather than allowing him to continue on to Canada , because of the likelihood that he would be tortured in Syria .
Upon Mr. Arar 's return to Canada in 2003 , the Canadian government conducted an exhaustive investigation concluding that no evidence linked Mr. Arar to terrorist groups or suggested a security threat and awarded him nearly $ 10 million in damages .
The DHS Office of the Inspector General conducted its own four - year investigation into the matter , yet its investigators lacked subpoena authority and were frequently stymied by numerous privilege claims .
" Mr. Arar 's rendition to Syria , with the knowledge he would be subject to torture , demands a thorough investigation into the conduct of the Department of Justice and U.S. immigration officials , " said Conyers .
" Given the involvement of high - ranking administration officials in this matter , and the stonewalling encountered in the DHS Inspector General 's investigation , the appointment of a special counsel is clearly necessary . "
" The Inspector Generals public report reveals that Administration officials sent Mr. Arar to Syria knowing that he likely would be tortured , " said Rep. Nadler .
" This is at odds with everything we stand for as a free and just nation , and the Administrations unwillingness to expose how and why this happened has fueled public concern and criticism .
We urge Attorney General Mukasey to appoint an outside special counsel to investigate Mr. Arars case to ensure a fair investigation is conducted to examine these serious allegations of wrongdoing . "
" The startling revelation that attorneys within the Office of the Deputy Attorney General were intimately involved in this case is sufficient cause for an outside review , " said Delahunt .
" This is the only way to make sure that those who had a hand in Mr. Arars rendition to torture will be held accountable . "

In a front page story in today ’s Washington Post , the paper comes as close as they can to saying that John McCain is outright lying about Barack Obama in an attempt to smear him as unpatriotic .
The Post story does n’t mention that NBC ’s Andrea Mitchell was there in Afghanistan with Obama , and she is a personal witness to the fact that McCain ’s message about Obama is an outright lie .
But still , in journalism circles , reporters are loathe to accuse someone of lying ( it ’s not clear why ) , so this article is stunning in how close it comes to doing just that about McCain .
The bigger question is why McCain has adopted this strategy of outright lying about Obama , but even more , trying to label Obama as basically un-American .
I think there is one main reason .
McCain fears that he is losing , badly :
He ’s desperate .
It ’s no coincidence that a few months ago , Karl Rove started advising the McCain campaign .
Rove specializes in these kind of “ patriotism ” attacks .
But why McCain , who has always claimed to be a different breed of politician , who has always promised to never go negative , to never question his opponent ’s patriotism , has now adopted every dirty trick he ’s in the past disowned .
And worse for McCain , the media has caught on and they ’re reporting the story .
What comes next is the process story – not that McCain is lying and going super negative when he said he would n’t , but worse , a media analysis as to why McCain is doing all of this .
And that analysis ca n’t be good .
McCain ’s strong suit is his “ maverick ” status .
Now he ’s become just another dirty , lying ( Republican ) politician , and the media , his “ base ” as he calls them , has suddenly abandoned him ( for the first time that I can recall ) .
These kind of attacks can work , but only when the media agrees to play along ( see : the media ’s quiescence to the Swift Boat attacks against Kerry ) .
In this case , the media , starting with NBC ’s Andrea Mitchell , refused to play along , and insisted , instead , on reporting the facts .
That ’s when this kind of negative campaigning can go horribly wrong for a candidate , essentially blowing up in their face .
And in McCain ’s case , it just has .
Rails 2.1 has been out for a little over a month now , and I ’ve had several people ask me to recommend resources for getting up to speed on its new moves .
So , in no particular order , here goes …
And if you ’re upgrading an existing app , here ’s a bonus resource for you .
Be sure to check it out …
There you have it .
Get crackin’ .
There will be a quiz .

And if you want to show these guys some appreciation for all the work they ’ve put into these resources - come on , you do , right ?
- be sure to recommend them on workingwithrails .
They surely deserve it !
PITTSBURGH , Pennsylvania ( CNN ) --
They 're spiritual misfits .
Rabble - rousers .
They packed the shell of the old Baptist church on Negley Avenue in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , to hear author , Christian activist and fellow misfit Shane Claiborne stump on the campaign for a third party candidate , Jesus .
People pack churches to hear Shane Claiborne talk about " Jesus for President , " the book he co-authored .
The dreadlocked Christian activist from Philadelphia and his team parked a black school bus around the back .
The hand - painted gold letters on the side read " Jesus for President . "
The bus runs on vegetable oil and , yes , it 's a political statement .
" It 'll be a long time before we fight a war over used veggie oil , " says Claiborne with a sly smile .
Claiborne is touring the country , packing churches and community centers , in support of the book he and Chris Haw co-authored , " Jesus for President . "
" This whole project is about the political imagination of what it means to follow after Jesus , " Claiborne said .
" The language of Jesus as Lord and savior is just as radical as it would be to say ' Jesus as our commander in chief ' today . "
Watch a report on young evangelicals by CNN's Kate Bolduan »
Young evangelicals represent an important swing - voting bloc .
They 're not a lock for Republicans as their parents were .
Their feet are firmly planted on issues dear to both parties .
Traditional family values are , as they have been in the past , an important issue .
But these voters say views on abortion and homosexuality wo n't define them in November .
The environment and social justice are moving to the forefront of their discussions .
About 26 percent of the United States identifies itself as evangelical Christians in the Protestant tradition , according to the latest U.S. Religious Landscape study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life .
In 2004 , more than 75 percent of evangelicals cast their vote for George W. Bush .
" They delivered for him in some key states , like Ohio , without which he could not have won , " said CNN 's Bill Schneider , senior political analyst .
" It was the rallying of the evangelical base that Karl Rove developed as a strategy , maximizing turnout among your base voters , not worrying about independents or swing voters . "
But polls have shown that evangelicals as a whole , following national trends , are disaffected with Republican leadership and increasingly up for grabs .
Thursday was the fifth night of the tour and it has already seen hundreds show up in Grand Rapids , Michigan , and Indianapolis , Indiana .
It was a hot , muggy June day in Pittsburgh .
About 250 people came through the doors to find there was no air conditioning in the old church - turned - community center .
They ran out of chairs so people took to the floors and leaned against the walls .
There were voters from across the board : Republicans , Democrats and independents .
Most were young , Christian by background , evangelical in theology , and they say they 're hungry for something more than partisan politics .
Steph Walker and Amanda Widing had to settle for seats in the back .
" I would say that social justice and issues like that have definitely arisen as an important part of my faith and , because of that , it affects how I vote and think of those things definitely , " said 21 - year - old Walker .
She grew up in a Republican household but has switched parties and will vote for Sen. Barack Obama in November .
Widing , 20 , is a registered Republican but unsure who she 'll vote for .
" There are certain issues where I identify more with Republicans and other issues where I identify more with Democrats , so I really am completely undecided at this point , " she said .
Eric Sapp is a founding member of the Eleison group focused on getting people of faith out to the polls for Democrats .
He sees younger evangelicals as prime targets to swing .
" These voters are starting to become independent swing voters instead of a lock for either party , " Sapp said .
" For Democrats , also , it 's a successful place because when a group had been voting four out of five Republican and they start becoming a swing constituency that also has significant electoral implications . "
Back on stage Claiborne takes the crowd through a multimedia presentation .
" With the respectability and the power of the church comes the temptation to prostitute our identity for every political agenda . "
Controversially , he quotes Harry S. Truman and Adolph Hitler , saying each used Christianity to support their ideologies .
The speech is fiery at times , pensive at others .
It emphasizes caring for the poor and the downtrodden .
He talks about war and the environment .
He also talks about how Jesus stood up to the Roman Empire , a message he believes is relevant to the United States now .
" For many of us , Caesar has colonized our imagination , our landscape and our ideology , " he says while a picture of Mount Rushmore flashes behind him .
On the screen " Vandalism " pops up in black letters .
Trading lines back and forth from a script with Haw , they save the most wrath for Christians who they say have missed the point of the cross .
" We 've profaned the blood at the foot of the cross and turned it into Kool - Aid and marketed it all over the world .
We 'll make an art and a business out of taking the Lord 's name in vain , " Claiborne says as images of Christ on the cross and the American flag flash behind him .
They endorse no candidate and make no effort to sway the voters for one party or another .
After the speech in an interview with CNN , Claiborne said , " This is not about going left or right , this is about going deeper and trying to understand together .
Rather than endorse candidates , we ask them to endorse what is at the heart of Jesus and that is the poor or the peacemakers and when we see that then we 'll get behind them . "
Claiborne says the movement of younger evangelicals is growing and looking at the Bible in more holistic terms .
He is quick to say the call of Christ has more to do with how people live their lives on November 3 and 5 than how they vote on November 4 .
" It 's certainly easy to walk into a voting booth every four years and feel like you 're going to change the world but that 's not going to do it . "
After the interview , Claiborne , Haw and the band pack up and head to a local restaurant in search of more grease to power the bus .
They find it at a Chinese restaurant a few miles away .
At 11 p.m. they 're on the road again .
They drive through the night to Washington , sleeping in the retrofitted bunks in the back of the school bus .
The next night in the nation 's capital they hit the stump again , calling for young evangelicals to vote " Jesus for President . "

I shared a house my senior year of college with a double degree cello & German major , a half - Chinese welfare state economist , the official “ big man( whore ) on campus , ” and a preacher ’s daughter whose two great loves were electoral politics and feces .
We did n’t all hang out that much .
But one thing that brought us together each week was the new Strong Bad email .
Too many miles and too many Mondays later , too out of touch with them to talk and too out of touch with myself to care , I sometimes go back and check on the stockpiled Sbemails I ’ve since missed .
He ’s almost reached another hundredth anniversary , but it ’s just not the same .
What does remain as it did in my memory is our boxing gloved hero ’s NES namesake , Tag Team Wrestling .
From the same inspirational developer that brought us Karnov and Burgertime , Tag Team employed an innovative new combat concept Wikipedia describes as a “ real - time , menu - based action - reaction fighting module . ”
Translated for an English speaking , non-pompous - fuckwad audience , this meant that , after walking up to your opponent and punching them in the face , the action froze , giving you three seconds to scroll through and select from an unintelligibly abbreviated and Japanese ’d list of wrestling moves by frantically mashing the B button .
Keep in mind that this was nearly a decade before the advent of HTML - based dropdown menus !
Inevitably the prospect of winning a successively taller trophy was n’t enough to stave off the “ menu - based ” tedium of fighting the same two guys for the twentieth time , and you ’d take things outside the ring in an attempt to speed things along with a more “ fluid ” and “ informal ” style of combat .
This was where things got really memorable .
Anyone whose ever watched real wrestling knows that the opening salvo of any ringside battle is a race to grab the nearest available folding chair with which to brain the other guy .
On this classical front Tag Team never disappoints .
After the chair has been poofed out of existence over someone ’s head , the struggling titans dance back and forth for the next 18.4 seconds , trading more punches to the face .
These are all for show though , because the only blow that matters is the last one landed .
The trick , you see , is to leave your opponent stunned for the 20 - second “ ring - out ” disqualification while you quietly slip back inside the ropes and taste the sweet tang of new trophy piece .
My housemates probably would n’t get it , but I think Strong Bad would approve .

The word spreads by mouth that someone at some obscure place has gasoline or diesel to sell at prices not seen for years .
A tempting offer , when these fuels are sold for 1.5 €/ litre and 1.4 €/ litre respectively at filling stations .
But these fuels have simply been stolen from the same people buying them : the end consumer .
The first news started to come from the north , in the city of Braga , with regular thefts from parked lorries during the night .
But now reports are coming from almost everywhere , from the big city centres to the isolated interior of Portugal .
The preferred targets are lorries with tanks large enough to hold 500 to 1000 litres of fuel .
During the night thieves approach and force the tank open , then run in a small tube connected to a manual pump that moves the fuel to a hand held jerrycan or similar container .
When the opening offers resistance the tank is simply pierced with a pickaxe or other sharp metal tool .
In this case , after the jerrycans have been filled the fuel is simple left flowing on the ground .
Beyond lorries , even regular cars and heavy machinery are being targeted by this kind of theft .
Construction sites are a tempting place , where heavy cranes and diggers are usually left unguarded during the night .
Many businesses are installing surveillance and alarm systems , but without major results , thieves study the place carefully to avoid cameras and using a pickaxe a tank can be emptied swiftly .
Here 's a digest of what a haulier business holder told to the Diário de Notícias newspaper :
On the 24th of June when the workmen arrived for a new day they found 3 lorries that have been filled up the last night with their tanks completely empty , having been pierced with a pickaxe .
They did n't even take half of the diesel , with the remainder spilled on the ground .
The company lost more than 4000 € that day from fuel theft in addition to the cost of repairing 3 fuel tanks .
One month later the smell of spilt diesel still engulfs the facility .
Now the lorries are guarded during the night by a man with a licence to carry and use fire arms .
On the fence a sign warns : be wary of pitbull dogs .
Many thoughts come to mind reading these news pieces .
Like addicts , when the fix dwindles consumers are turning on each other .
Before adjusting their lifestyles or finding new arrangements to their daily lives , some consumers seem to opt for the black market , buying fuel that might have been stolen from his neighbour yesterday or from himself the next day .
Life on the slippery slope of oil depletion will likely become much more violent than what we 've been used to .

If you ’ve ever shopped for milk , you ’ve no doubt noticed what our questioner has :
While regular milk expires within about a week or sooner , organic milk lasts much longer — as long as a month .
So what is it about organic milk that makes it stay fresh so long ?
Actually , it turns out that it has nothing to do with the milk being organic .
All " organic " means is that the farm the milk comes from does not use antibiotics to fight infections in cows or hormones to stimulate more milk production .
Organic milk lasts longer because producers use a different process to preserve it .
According to the Northeast Organic Dairy Producers
Alliance , the milk needs to stay fresh longer because organic products often have to travel farther to reach store shelves since it is not produced throughout the country .
The process that gives the milk a longer shelf life is called ultrahigh temperature ( UHT ) processing or treatment , in which milk is heated to 280 degrees Fahrenheit ( 138 degrees Celsius ) for two to four seconds , killing any bacteria in it .
Compare that to pasteurization , the standard preservation process .
There are two types of pasteurization : " low temperature , long time , " in which milk is heated to 145 degrees F ( 63 degrees C ) for at least 30 minutes * , or the more common " high temperature , short time , " in which milk is heated to roughly 160 degrees F ( 71 degrees C ) for at least 15 seconds .
The different temperatures hint at why UHT - treated milk lasts longer : Pasteurization does n’t kill all bacteria in the milk , just enough so that you do n't get a disease with your milk mustache .
UHT , on the other hand , kills everything .
Retailers typically give pasteurized milk an expiration date of four to six days .
Ahead of that , however , was up to six days of processing and shipping , so total shelf life after pasteurization is probably up to two weeks .
Milk that undergoes UHT does n’t need to be refrigerated and can sit on the shelf for up to six months .
Regular milk can undergo UHT , too .
The process is used for the room - temperature Parmalat milk found outside the refrigerator case and for most milk sold in Europe .
So why is n’t all milk produced using UHT ?
One reason is that UHT - treated milk tastes different .
UHT sweetens the flavor of milk by burning some of its sugars ( caramelization ) .
A lot of Americans find this offensive — just as they are leery of buying nonrefrigerated milk .
Europeans , however , do n’t seem to mind .
UHT also destroys some of the milk ’s vitamin content — not a significant amount — and affects some proteins , making it unusable for cheese .
There are , of course , lots of reasons people buy organic milk .
But if it 's the long shelf life you 're after , I would recommend you buy nonorganic UHT milk and avoid being charged double .
* Correction ( 6/6/08 ) :
This sentence originally said " milk is heated to 145 degrees F ( 63 degrees C ) for at least 30 seconds . "

While Tom over at SEOmoz posted a must - read piece on negative reputation , its types and ways to deal with it ( like SERPs monitoring , social media monitoring , etc ) , I decided to add my two cents here discussing a few online services that encourage spreading negative reputation over the Internet .
The websites discussed offer anyone anonymously to post a rant on other people or companies – be it a former boyfriend or a place of work .
For some reason these services keep popping up quickly and that ’s a complex question if that ’s for good or worse .
It seems so complex because :
these services allow you to take revenge on anyone who offended or hurt you if you have no other way to struggle ( if revenge is a good or a bad thing – that ’s for you to decide ) ;
) ; these services allow a dissatisfied customer / employee to warn others of the poor service – also accounting for the new era of reputation management and customer care ( but who will protect merchants and companies from the ungrounded / false / deceptive accusations ?
After all , like always , only minor ( probably innocent ) players will be affected – huge companies will find the way to counteract ) .
Disclaimer : before listing some of these services , let me disclose that I do not encourage or discourage anyone to use them .
Besides , I am not linking to any of them , as , like I said , I am not sure if they should exist .
DontDateHimGirl.com is an online community of women offended by their boyfriends .
The website ( among other services ) allow women to post the name and the story of the “ cheater ” .
It is worth to mention ( and I do like the feature ) that the service invites anyone to post a rebuttal – though I was n’t able to find any and not sure how it can influence the initial rant ; my guess is , it will still appear both on site and search engine results .
Anyway , to be completely honest , the site is not too good for rankings :
it seldom appears on the first page for the [ Cheater Name ] search ;
it does n’t use the man ’s name in the page title ( and hence the title of the search result ) .
Axelist.com invites to share negative experience with any kind of possible contacts : bosses , cheaters , racists , business partners , liars , co-workers , tenants , employees , dates , debtors , politicians , teachers , stock promoters , stockbrokers , realtors , bullies , doctors , neighbors , etc .
Apart from the detailed complaint , the website provides some of offenders ’ details : their age and location .
The site explains its benefits the following way :
“ File your complaint and watch Axelist expose and put your villain on the spot .
We will post and promote your story and even go beyond the Internet to help you make your case . ”
While the site could have done a better SEO job , it does have some ranking ability :
JobVent.com invites people to post negative ( and positive ) experience on their job allowing thus for affective discharge and also warning people who are going to start a new job .
They do have very interesting posting guidelines that attempt to encourage offended people to be as fair as they can .
Among others , the rules state that :
no company deserves the lowest ratings in every category ;
company deserves the lowest ratings in category ; negative ratings should be adequately grounded ;
grounded ; profanity is not allowed ;
no names or initials , just company name ;
each company can be reviewed only once by one individual .
While I could n’t find any first - page rankings for the [ company name ] – obviously due to the fact that [ company name ] has much higher competition than [ personal name ] – but the site does rank fairly well for some combinations of [ company name ] + [ job ] :
To be perfectly fair :
none of the above services were designed for negative reputation management ( hence poor on - site SEO btw ) ;
each of the above services encourages fair ratings and true stories .
Closing : I may be sounding skeptical about the whole negative reputation thing and to tell you the truth , I am not sure myself what my attitude to it is .
As a customer , I would really want to be timely warned of a bad service or product .
As an active Internet user , I do realize that Internet is the place of unfair judgments , misunderstandings and manipulation ; the place where people are often unfairly treated ( let along if they are invited to rant ) , the place where online argument looks like this :

Teacher Orders Teen to Write Apology in Blood
Teacher Orders Teen to Write Apology in Blood
TOKYO – A Japanese teenager was forced by his teacher to write an apology in blood after dozing in the classroom , the school ’s principal said on Monday .
The teacher later went to high school principal Hiroaki Dan and confessed what he had done , Dan told Reuters .
The teacher had apologized to the 17 - year - old boy and his parents , Dan said , confirming a local media report of the incident , which happened last Thursday .
He said the boy was taken to the staff room of the school in Fukuoka City , southern Japan , after being caught asleep during a lesson .
The 40 - year - old male teacher handed the boy a box - cutter and paper and told him to write an apology in blood .
The teacher left the student , who then cut his finger and began to write an apology using his own blood .
Other teachers in the staff room did not notice what was happening , Dan said .
“ To ask a student to write in their own blood is something I just ca n’t imagine , ” he said .
He said the boy was back in school , and neither he nor his parents had asked to switch teachers .
The teacher involved is expected to resume classes in a few days , Dan said .

A costly deadline looms for many growers in the Midwest , as every day of waiting for the weather to cooperate to plant corn and soybeans reduces potential yields .
Illinois growers who plant corn or soybeans near the end of June can expect a 50 percent reduction in crop yield , according to a University of Illinois agriculture expert .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
The US Department of Agriculture reports that corn and soybean growers in several Midwestern states are behind schedule on their planting .
A cooler and wetter - than - average spring has left Illinois and Indiana furthest behind on planted corn and soybeans .
Several other states are lagging behind their normal planting schedules , but by a lesser margin .
In Illinois , 95 percent of the corn is planted and 88 percent has emerged , but less than half of that is reported to be in good or excellent condition .
Fully 14 percent of the acres planted are in poor or very poor condition , with another 38 percent reported as " fair . "
Those acres in poor or very poor condition may have to be replanted .
In Illinois , the corn was only seven inches high as of June 9 , compared to an average 17 inches by this time in recent years .
" This has been a bad spring by most measures , " said Illinois crop sciences professor Emerson Nafziger .
" We keep seeing forecasts that look favorable and then that does n't happen .
The chance of having above - average yields has diminished greatly . "
Cool temperatures and the third wettest January - April since 1895 in Illinois have led to delays that are undercutting potential yields .
Nafziger 's analysis of previous years ' corn planting data in Illinois determined that " we can expect 50 percent of the maximum yield when planting is done around June 15 to 20 . "
Those growing soybeans in southern Illinois may get 50 percent of their maximum yield if they plant no later than June 25 to 30 , he said .
Some growers â€ “ in southern Illinois especially â€ “ will have to replant as wet conditions have caused some seed to rot .
Despite the poor conditions , Nafziger finds it encouraging that 95 percent of Illinois corn acres have already been planted .
While some acres will have to be replanted , high temperatures should help boost the growth rate of what has survived so far , he said .
Soybeans are further behind .
Only 66 percent of the soybean crop was in the ground as of June 9 in Illinois , compared to an average 92 percent planted by this time in recent years .
Most growers will not get the yields they expected , but high prices for their crops â€ “ and crop insurance â€ “ should see them through , Nafziger said .
" Even with high costs , the yield needed to cover costs is relatively low when corn is more than $ 6 a bushel , " he said .
" But we 're looking at some real disappointment at having so much income potential not realized this year due to weather - related crop problems . "

The day after a video emerged of a cop knocking a cyclist to the ground , a second video alleging police brutality surfaced today in which an NYPD officer is seen whaling away at a man ’s legs with a baton .
The footage – shot on July 4 on the Lower East Side – shows Officer Maurice Harrington repeatedly hitting Michael Cephus , 46 , on his legs with a collapsible metal baton as he struggles with officers trying to cuff him .
Harrington – a four - year veteran working out of the 52nd Precinct in The Bronx – had his badge and gun taken away and was placed on modified duty when the tape was turned over to the department ’s Internal Affairs Bureau .
The video does not show how the confrontation began .
According to the criminal complaint , Harrington and fellow Officer Joel Medina said they encountered Cephus – who they thought was drunk – around 8 p.m. on Delancey Street under the Williamsburg Bridge .
When they stopped him from entering a nearby park , they said he swung an umbrella at them and struck both officers “ with closed fists about the body . ”
Cephus says he was n’t drinking that day and denies having gotten physical with the officers .
“ I was with some friends at a cookout , ” he said .
“ I stepped out of the park to get some ice .
The officers told me I could n’t return because they said I had alcohol .
I told them it was only ice .
“ They thought I was drunk and they just came at me .
They started swinging and hitting me with the batons . ”
Cephus was charged with assault , criminal possession of a weapon , menacing and resisting arrest .
His attorney , Adam Orlow , said that even if his client did what he is accused of , Harrington used “ excessive force . ”
“ Let me be clear – he is maintaining that he absolutely did not do anything they say he did , ” Orlow said .
“ He never took a swing at them .
He never was aggressive to them . ”
Patrolmen ’s Benevolent Association president Patrick Lynch called the use of force “ necessary . ”
Cephus – a truck driver from Brooklyn – said that when he arrived at the police station following a trip to the emergency room , he saw the two men who shot the video .
They said they had been busted for disorderly conduct .
But earlier , they had managed to slip the tape to one of Cephus ’ friends ..

PERTH , Australia ( AP ) 
A man who auctioned his life — his house , his car , his job , even his friends — on eBay said Monday he is disappointed with the selling price : almost $ 384,000 .
Ian Usher , a British immigrant to Australia , put everything he owned as well as introductions to his friends on the online auction site after a painful breakup with his wife prompted him to want a fresh start .
Bidding closed Sunday and reached about $ 384,000 — an amount Usher said his house in the western city of Perth was worth on its own .
" I guess I 'm a little bit disappointed at the final price , I 'd hoped it to be a little higher than that , " Usher told Nine Network television on Monday .
" But I am committed to selling and moving on and making a fresh start . "
He declined to reveal the buyer 's identity , or what his next step would be .
Usher said he had hoped to get at least $ 480,000 for his life — his house and all its contents , car and a motorcycle , a jet ski , skydiving gear , an introduction to friends and a trial period in his sales job — but that the final result was enough for him to make a new start in life .

Male co-work­er : Check out this pho­to .
Fe­male co-work­er :
This is an old pho­to of you .
Male co-work­er : Yeah , it was tak­en around 1991 .
Fe­male co-work­er : Wow !
That was about 27 years ago !
6606 Tuss­ing Road
Reynolds­burg , Ohio
Over­heard by : Some­one that can add & sub­tract
Cop : “ But my superior told me to beat the crap out of that guy . ”
Linndy England : “ But everyone was doing it , and my superior officer said it was OK to take pictures of the naked guy in the dog collar . ”
Nazi : “ I was only following orders . ” ( Remember the ‘ Nuremberg Defense ? ’ )
RESULTS : Loss of badge , jail time , execution by hanging .
Now , let ’s take a look at what happened today in the U.S. House of Representatives .
AT&T : “ But the government TOLD us to violate the Constitution , break the law , and illegally spy on American citizens without a warrant . ”
Congress : “ Would you identify yourself please ? ”
AT&T : “ I ’m a multi- billion dollar telecom company . ”
Congress : Oh …. well then that ’s OK .
But we ’re going to have to ask you to not do that again .
Alright ?
Well then …off you go .
Today ’s FISA vote was hard to take on many levels .
I know there are plenty of people in the telecom industry and in the government high fiving each other over the desecration of the Constitution , and the saving of their own skins , and it ’s making me sick to my stomach .
Maybe it ’s because my Dad was a World War II vet , tortured in a POW camp , and found solace in the fact that criminals did n’t get off the hook by saying they were “ just following orders ” .
Now , apparently , they do .
WHY is our Democratic congress cowering in fear of a lame duck president with a subterranean approval rating and six months left in office ?
And WHY could n’t this wait until a new administration ?
WHY did we just have to give absolution and immunity to the telecom companies right this very minute ?
Were I a conspiracy theorist , I ’d wonder what the hell Majority Leader Steny Hoyer was saying when they bugged his phone .
I have no doubt that Democrats will pick up many more House and Senate seats in 2008 .
But if the anger and outrage of the American people ( who are squarely opposed to retroactive immunity for telecoms , and actually like their Constitution ) continues , we will start to see a day of reckoning in 2010 .
That ’s the election when we will have the luxury of running better Democrats against bad incumbent Democrats .
Votes like the one held today will be coming back in two years to haunt those who came down wrong …. just like those votes to support the invasion of Iraq are now .
But for the time being , we have 129 members of congress , all Democrats , who did the right thing .
293 of them ( including Don Young and every last Republican ) did the wrong thing , and violated their oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution .
No one took an oath to protect and defend the Executive Branch , yet that ’s exactly what they did right after throwing the Constitution under the bus .
So , now this heads to the Senate where we are forced to watch it happen all over again .
It ’s expected to pass , and as of yet there are no rumors of filibuster .
Much to my disappointment , even Barack Obama has said that he will support the compromise because it ’s a lot better than the original ‘ Protect America Act ’ .
Read his statement , if you can stand it , here .
For this , Atrios named him Wanker of the Day .

Account hijackers have targeted Apple iTunes for months , but now they 're hitting Apple developers as well .
Reg reader Andrew McAuley discovered that his iTunes account was hijacked after 150 unauthorised transactions , each valued at $ 42 , appeared on his debit card bill .
McAuley , a Brit who lives in the US , noticed the attack after he checked his bank account on 11 July .
" I tried to log in to my [ iTunes ] account and was unable .
Seems someone had changed the login to a different name completely , " he explained .
When he contacted iTunes support McAuley was told his account had been taken over by an " unknown fraudster " and that this was the subject of an ongoing investigation .
Apple has suspended the account .
McAuley did n't suffer financially because his debit card was protected by a $ 0 liability guarantee .
He does n't store any card details on his UK account , which is n't covered by an equivalent indemnity .
In the UK , credit card holders are only liable to the first £ 50 of any purchase .
But despite not losing out financially McAuley is concerned about the hijack .
Andrew Goodwill , director of credit card fraud protection specialist The 3rd Man , suggested that payment card details , obtained elsewhere , were used to make the purchases on our reader 's account .
" They will get card details in the normal way ( not from iTunes ) and use them to download music .
It 's just normal credit card fraud , " Goodwill said .
" iTunes need a better anti-fraud system , " he added .
McAuley disputed this finding , pointing to complaints from more victims of iTunes account hacking over several months on various support forums .
A common pattern emerges ( examples here and here ) .
Perpetrators typically change the email address associated with an account to one under their control , typically a webmail account that can easily be established without any identity checks .
They also change the password .
Sometimes , but not always , they change the billing address and telephone number associated with an account .
Once compromised , accounts are used to make multiple purchases of relatively high value , typically around $ 40 .
Apple has not replied to our request for clarification on what iTunes support staff are calling an ongoing investigation into account hijacking .
The company is also keeping schtum on what customers should do if they suspect their iTunes account has been misused to make fraudulent purchases .
McAuley warns against associating debit or credit card payment details with iTunes accounts , advice also frequently given on bulletin boards .
The inconvenience of having to enter payment details each time a purchase is made seems like a small price to pay for security .
Pass the password
Some Apple developers have also been stung by similar hijacking attacks in recent weeks .
Marko Karppinen was locked out of his Apple Developer Connection account earlier this month after his password and registered email address were both changed without his authorisation .
Karppinen said that Apple emailed a reset password to a Yahoo email address not under his control after someone sent a one - line email full of grammatical errors to support staffers via a web support form .
The hijacker entered Karppinen 's Apple ID in the email field , and as a result Karppinen received a copy of Apple 's response in his .
Mac mailbox .
" Luckily , my ' security question ' was still the same , so I was able to reset the password and email address back , " Karppinen said .
A representative of Apple Developer Connection 's European support organisation has since been in touch with Karppinen to apologise and assure him that passwords are not normally handed out so readily .
Alec Muffett , a network security expert , responded to Karppinen 's tale by posting links to accounts of his own experiences of suffering from credit card fraud days after his Apple ID was stolen in November 2006 .
Although he has no proof Muffett reckons this is more than just a coincidence .
He reckons that crooks either got the credit card number from Apple , or swiped info from his Apple account to fill gaps in information they had obtained somewhere else .
" My theory is that the crooks are milking Apple IDs - with their oh - so - friendly password recovery mechanism - for card meta- information , correlating it with stuff elsewhere , and then using it on the handful of traders who ’ll accept dubious data for anonymous services , " Muffett wrote .
Muffett 's blog contains tips on how to avoid getting hit .
" If Apple are going to [ run ]
MobileMe off the same system , it would make sense to beef this security up , " he adds . ®
Oscar - winning writer and director Paul Haggis owns four Toyota Priuses and is high on the waiting list to buy a $ 100,000 Tesla electric roadster .
But when he heard about the new Honda FCX Clarity , a hydrogen - powered car that gets 270 miles on a tank and emits nothing but water , he was desperate to drive it .
“ I want one .
I want one , ” he said of the Clarity , later dispatching his agent to hunt for the not - yet - available vehicle .
A step ahead of Haggis was Joely Fisher , star of Fox ’s “ ‘ Til Death ” TV show .
She arranged for BMW to lend her a sleek metallic blue Hydrogen 7 Series -- one of just 20 such experimental sedans in the country .
Never mind that it gets just 130 miles per tank and can be filled only by a trained professional , who takes it to Oxnard and refuels it with liquid hydrogen cooled to 423 degrees below zero , a round trip that can take three hours .
The sedan comes with a feature that ’s worth the hassle : “ Bragging rights , ” Fisher said , laughing .
Fancy cars have long been integral to the one - upmanship among L.A. 's glitterati .
But instead of Bentleys and Bugattis , Hollywood ’s must - have vehicles of the moment are green .
And nothing conveys extreme exclusivity and earth - friendliness like a hydrogen car .
The fad is a boon for carmakers , which are leveraging the enthusiasm of the stars and their attendant paparazzi to boost their image as environmentally friendly companies .
The cars are n’t for sale -- and wo n’t be for years -- but automakers are using celebrities to promote the technology and build support for the infrastructure needed to make hydrogen cars commercially viable .
In addition to arranging the car for Fisher , BMW has lent its tricked - out luxury sedans -- emblazoned with “ Clean Energy Powered by Hydrogen ” in huge block letters -- to actors Edward Norton and Cameron Diaz , opera star Placido Domingo and ultimate influencers Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie .
General Motors Corp. , meanwhile , has put Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Iger , “ Ugly Betty ” star America Ferrera and former Laker Magic Johnson behind the wheel of its $ 1 - million Chevy Equinox Fuel Cell .
Not to be outdone , Honda Motor Co. has lined up its own A - list to drive its FCX Clarity -- but it ’s keeping the names under wraps until later this month .
Driven by a cause
Beyond the cachet of holding the keys to such hard - to - get vehicles , environmentally attuned celebrities say driving the cars brings attention to a potentially important transportation technology in an age of $ 4 - a - gallon gasoline and global warming concerns .
“ I want to do everything I can to make sure that people know that the technology is available and we are not far off from having this on the road , ” Fisher said .
The green trend began several years ago with the Prius : Leonardo DiCaprio drove one of the hybrids to the 2004 Academy Awards , and Larry David practically made his Prius a costar on his show “ Curb Your Enthusiasm . ”
Now that those have become commonplace , Hollywood is moving on to more futuristic technology .
BMW ’s hydrogen program is run by Jim Ryan , who juggles the complicated schedules of the VIPs who request the car .
Ryan says the cars trigger an infectious exhibitionism .
He described a recent delivery to Laura Dern , an actress so attuned to conservation that she hired an environmental consultant to evaluate the eco-fitness of her house .
“ Once she got the car , she said , ‘ I ’ve got to show Steven Spielberg .
I ’ve got to show Meg Ryan , ’ ” he recalled .
Agents have been working overtime to get their clients driving hydrogen .
The BMW has been working its way through Hollywood , with the help of Creative Artists Agency , for about a year and has a two - month waiting list .
Honda said 50,000 people had signed up online to lease the Clarity , which rolls out in July .
GM uses William Morris Agency to arrange its pairings .
Among the most recent recipients were “ American Idol ” host Ryan Seacrest and producer Jerry Bruckheimer .
William Morris Chief Executive Jim
Wiatt says the vehicle causes a sensation wherever he goes .
When driving one off the Disney lot in Burbank recently , he was pulled over by a police officer .
“ I thought I ’d done something wrong , ” Wiatt said .
“ He said to me , ‘ What is this you ’re driving ? ’ ”
Hydrogen technology has been around for decades , helping to power the space shuttle , among other applications .
But serious study of its use in cars is relatively new .
BMW burns hydrogen in a conventional internal combustion engine .
GM and Honda , like most other carmakers developing the technology , mix hydrogen gas with oxygen from the air in a device called a fuel cell to create electricity that drives electric motors .
Proponents note that hydrogen vehicles emit no greenhouses gases , unlike gasoline - powered cars .
They have greater range than today ’s electric cars and can be refueled faster than a battery can be charged .
“ Petroleum is not a long - term solution for cars , and battery cars have real limitations , ” said Bill Reinert , national manager for advanced technologies at Toyota Motor Corp .
“ Hydrogen technology is getting much better . ”
Hydrogen ’s drawbacks
But critics say hydrogen fuel is difficult to store and , at least for now , energy inefficient .
It requires more energy to produce than it provides once it ’s in the car ’s tank .
Moreover , the process of making hydrogen can create greenhouse gases .
And fuel cells are very expensive because they contain precious metals such as platinum and palladium .
“ It ’s a least a couple hundred thousand dollars per vehicle , ” said Spencer Quong of the Union of Concerned Scientists , a nonprofit environmental group .
“ They have to reduce those costs . ”
Perhaps the largest obstacle is infrastructure .
There are just 61 hydrogen fueling stations in the country , compared with 180,000 gas stations , and only 25 hydrogen stations in California , making commutes difficult .
No matter how famous the driver , GM and Honda provide their cars only to people who live within a few miles of stations in Burbank , Torrance , Santa Monica and Irvine .
Luckily for actress Q’orianka Kilcher , the Santa Monica fueling station is close to home .
Kilcher , who costarred with Colin Farrell in the movie “ The New World , ” was one of three people allowed to lease Honda ’s first fuel - cell vehicle , the FCX .
She pays $ 600 a month for the privilege of driving a boxy two - door hatchback emblazoned with the phrase “ Honda Fuel Cell Power . ”
She took her driver ’s test in it and is on the Clarity waiting list .
“ I think Hollywood will definitely love it , ” said Kilcher , 18 .
Honda says that although some of its hydrogen cars will go to celebrities , it will allocate the bulk of them -- 200 over the next three years -- to people who ca n’t be found in the Internet Movie Database .
“ The last thing we ’d want is for the car to be cubbyholed as something just for the rich and famous , ” said Stephen Ellis , Honda ’s manager of fuel cell marketing .
Aside from generating buzz , the automakers expect to use the loaners to gather information about the cars to refine the technology .
GM ’s program puts most of its vehicles in the hands of regular drivers and does n’t charge for the loan .
There ’s a waiting list of about 8,000 people .
GM has a more aggressive timeline than other carmakers .
Desperate to make up the ground it lost to Japanese rivals on hybrids , the Detroit automaker said it hoped to commercialize hydrogen vehicles by 2012 , far ahead of competitors .
To accelerate that timeline , GM is lobbying Sacramento to mandate more fueling stations in California .
That ’s a big part of why GM asked William Morris to help find celebrity drivers :
It hopes VIPs will evangelize about the technology and build public demand for hydrogen infrastructure .
In the realm of celebrities and cars , no one is more visible than Jay Leno .
The “ Tonight Show ” host has driven GM ’s Equinox , Honda ’s Clarity and other hydrogen cars and wrote an article for Popular Mechanics based on 10 days in the BMW .
Leno is currently commuting in the Equinox .
“ The pickup is very , very good , very smooth .
It does n’t make any noise , ” he said .
Although enthusiastic about the technology , Leno believes another fuel might offer a better solution , at least for now .
“ Hydrogen is sort of sexy to people , ” he said .
“ But diesel is the most efficient fuel we have right now . ”

My Top Ten Worst Uses for Windows post earlier this week caused somewhat of a firestorm of reaction .
It is worth pointing out that for the most part I am not really criticizing Windows just the use of a bloated OS for simple or mission critical tasks .
From the many comments here and on Digg I have aggregated other stupid uses for Windows :
11 . Air traffic control radar .
Chris S. relates : I think I can top everyone 's story here ... The US Air Traffic Control system handles thousands of flights a day .
Much of the technology is still 1970 's radar scopes though the FAA has been upgrading them facility by facility within the past 10 years or so .
Even the radio communications ( while still RF ) are controlled through computer switches so that they can be routed to other facilities etc .
So what 's powering the radios of one of the busiest airspaces in the country ?
Windows ... The server crashed in 2004 preventing air traffic controllers from communicating with the 800 aircraft in the area for 3 hours .
Servers are typically rebooted every 50 days to prevent " data overload " but they had missed a cycle causing the downtime .
As a pilot and software engineer , this scares the crap out of me !
Full story here ....
http://www.techworld.com/opsys/news/index.cfm?NewsID=2275
12 . Fork lift trucks .
From Jorgen : I work in a storage facility , and we have 98 on our forklifts for order sheets .
It crashes all the time , and there is nothing funnier than seeing a truck stand still with a BSOD .
13 . In flight entertainment systems on Lufthansa and Air Canada .
Anon comments :
Oh , you have n't seen anything yet ... imagine an ENTIRE plane filled with windose ?
Air Canada flights I have been on recently , the entertainment systems did n't work at all .
On one flight , they shut down the movie halfway through the film , and it would n't restart !
On a flight from Japan to Vancouver , the systems did n't work at all , and from Vancouver to Toronto , a different AC flight , they were n't working either !
All Windoze based .
In fact , it happens so often , that they give out cards for discounts on your next flight to attempt to appease customers .
Why do I say that it happens often ?
Because the cards are PREPRINTED , stating that " We 're sorry our entertainment systems were n't working today ... etc . "
14 . British nuclear submarines .
Marvel comments : British subs started running the windows based SMCS - NG in 2004 after all the people that opposed the use of such an unstable operating on NUCLEAR subs where kicked off the deciding committee : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trafalgar_class_submarine
15 . PBX systems .
Comment from Jeff :
What is really scary is that now Microsoft is moving past just controlling legacy PBX's and positioning themselves as a complete Unified Communications solution with their OCS product .
Try taking down corporate dial tone every Patch Tuesday !
16 . Connecting flight monitors at Frankfurt and Heathrow 's airports .
Nageeb says : I snapped a picture at Terminal 1 Heathrow of a bank of flight info monitors ( bank of 3 in the old " temporary smoking section " before they banned it completely ) who had BSOD 'ed .
( Blue Screen of Death ) It was classic .
17 . Nurse stations in a hospital .
One reader comments : I also got the chance to ip scan pretty much the entire hospital which means that I could fiddle around enough to find that these carts were IP based ( I suppose that was a ' dur ' moment ) but what was even better was that the hospital registered pretty much everything in DNS .
So if I wanted a floor 7 ( my floor ) nurse cart , I had it .
And with a little testing before too long I found that they were running an SMS service .
18 . Sprint PCS 2G data center .
Anon writes : I used to be second level technical support for Sprint PCS , and they used Windows to run the 2G data application ( 3Com modem bank , to be simple ) .
I also managed 3G later , which ran on a Sun Netra server .
So I had a couple hundred Windows and a couple hundred Solaris 8 boxes .
Guess which ones I got constant calls about ?
It was so silly that if a switch tech decided to turn on the screen saver , it would almost instantly lock the server .
So when I got the call at 2 am that 2G data was down , my first question was , " Did someone turn on the screen saver ? "
19 . Narcotics safe .
One reader says : I work in a medical environment .
We recently updated our Pyxis ( an electronic safe for holding narcotics and other medicines ) .
Prior to the update , I needed to reboot it about weekly .
On boot , it was loading INI files .
Shudder ...
20 . Subway ticket dispensers .
Chris Snyder states :
This is right up there with ticket scanners and ATMS ... the Metrocard machines that dispense subway fares in NYC run Windows .
Interestingly , they are very well engineered , as you do n't see blue screens very often .
The only reason I know is that I saw one reboot once !
Ten more , that 's all I can handle today .
Keep 'em coming though .
I will continue to compile a list .
Can we ever form meaningful relationships with robots ?
Bill Thompson does n't think he is going to fall for a robot anytime soon .
Much as I adore my MacBook I have no desire to form a life - long union with it or attempt to interface in any way that does n't involve keys , trackpad and my fingers .
Others seem to feel differently about the matter , like David Levy , who reckons that by the middle of the century our relationships with the machines that currently service our social lives will have grown significantly , and that intelligent robots will be sexual partners too .
He even thinks that human / machine marriages will be taking place , as people find the companionship they are looking for in ultra-realistic robots who never tire of them , never get bored with their jokes and never leave the toilet seat up .
Mostly because they never go to the toilet , being robots .
Levy knows what he 's talking about , as an International Master who was closely involved in the development of chess - playing programs and a former winner of the Loebner Prize for programs that can have human - like conversations .
His recent book , ' Love + Sex with Robots ' , has attracted a lot of attention from computer scientists , psychologists and those just interested in the idea of having sex with a machine , so it was a real pleasure to have the chance to chair a discussion with him in front of a lively audience at London 's ICA .
In the end , however , I came away unconvinced .
Machine brains Could robots replicate the complexity of human relationships ?
The problem is n't the humans , it 's the robots .
Levy points out that artificial devices have been used for sex for many centuries , so there is nothing intrinsically implausible about the idea that humans may want to engage in sexual acts with robots .
He also argues that there is no fundamental reason why a human could n't fall in love with an artificial intelligence , and I think he 's probably right about this .
I do n't see why we should n't form deep bonds with other conscious beings if they are capable of communicating with us , empathising with us , and being physically intimate with us .
Unfortunately this argument is entirely useless in practice because I can't accept Levy 's sublimely optimistic view that we will be able to create such artificial intelligences within a 20 - 50 year time scale .
In fact , I 'm not sure we 'll ever manage it .
I do n't have any philosophical objection to the idea of ' machine brains ' , I just think that creating them will always be beyond our human capabilities .
The AI research community has spent fifty years and billions of dollars to give us fragile systems that can play chess but do not understand why someone might ever want to do so .
I believe that this will always be the case and that ' strong AI ' with human - level intelligence or above will simply not happen .
Shouting at the screen I want my computers to be perfectly predictable because they are tools , extensions of my will
Bill Thompson
And since Levy 's entire case depends on our ability to create these artificial consciousnesses and not merely superfast computers that can be programmed to simulate the full range of human emotions and interpret behaviour appropriately , the discussion about whether we will want to sleep with or marry these machines is entertaining but irrelevant .
It may be useful as a device with which to explore ethics , sexuality and human relationships , but we do n't need to worry about the practical implications for our legal system or religious leaders .
I am happy to project emotions onto my computer and see my laptop as trying hard to help me out when it struggles to render a video or run lots of programs at the same time .
I will shout at the anti-virus software on my desktop when it kicks off a full system scan and slows the rest of the machine down to a crawl .
And I 've been known to plead silently with my phone to pick up a signal when I need to make an urgent call from a Welsh beach .
But this is anthropomorphism , assigning human qualities to machines that have neither soul nor intelligence , and even as I am doing it I am aware of what is happening .
It keeps me happy , but I know it is not really going to change the outcome .
Real intelligence Just as we assign personalities to domestic pets despite their lack of consciousness , so we can attribute these qualities to the increasingly sophisticated robots that will soon be available in work and home settings .
And if it makes an elderly housebound person happier to imbue their house robot with human qualities , and if the programming can reflect apparent emotions in the robot 's behaviour that is fine .
It may even help them live independently for longer .
But it is a long step from this to genuine engagement or emotion , and that is what we need if we 're going to have relationships with robots .
It wo n't be enough to have programmable partners whose characteristics we can define in advance , setting the degree of argumentativeness or affection to their preferred levels , or choosing a robot that sometimes behaves ' unpredictably ' in order to add some excitement .
Chance and uncertainty are vital in any real human relationship .
The lack of predictability , the contingency of love and the fear of rejection .
The fundamental asymmetry of a relationship between a human and a machine must surely debase it to the point where it could never be called ' marriage ' and will just be another form of ownership .
If we want ' real ' emotion we need ' real ' intelligence .
I want my computers to be perfectly predictable because they are tools , extensions of my will .
A good computer is a slave to my desires , a servant that listens and obeys my every whim , whether it is to write this particular sentence or close that particular file .
And I want my partners , whether for marriage or a night of passion , to have real feelings , real emotions and real needs and desires , not ones that have been put there to make me more easily tricked into intimacy .
The world of computing is littered with the broken promises of AI researchers who assumed that vision , hearing , movement and even consciousness were all achievable with a bit of programming and a faster computer .
We would be well advised to treat the current collection of ' imminent ' breakthroughs with a degree of scepticism .

FCNBC is reporting Fed May Ease Rules on Private Equity Bank Stakes .
The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering steps to make it easier for private - equity firms and others to invest in banks , the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday , a move that could open the door to more capital for cash - starved banks .
Fed officials recently have met with big buyout firms , including J.C. Flowers , Carlyle Group , Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Warburg Pincus , and banking lawyers to discuss the obstacles , according to people familiar with the matter .
Under federal law , to own more than 24.9 percent of a bank , an entity must register as a bank holding company , which is subject to heavy regulation and can be forced to serve as a " source of strength " for the bank , the Journal said .
Ownership of more than 9.9 percent of a bank also subjects the entity to regulatory scrutiny to ensure that it is n't controlling — or even influencing — the bank 's operations .
The Fed can't change those laws , but it has room to maneuver in how it interprets them .
Uncertainty Principle Corollary Number Four :
The Fed simply does not care whether its actions are illegal or not .
The Fed is operating under the principle that it 's easier to get forgiveness than permission .
And forgiveness is just another means to the desired power grab it is seeking .
Citigroup Writeoff Hit Parade Continues
Citigroup Inc. , the bank that 's posted the biggest losses from the collapse of the U.S. mortgage market , may take an additional $ 8.9 billion in net writedowns in the second quarter , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said .
" We see multiple headwinds for Citigroup , " such as risks of further writedowns , higher consumer provisions , and the potential need for additional capital raisings , dividend cuts or asset sales , Goldman said .
Headwinds ?
Citigroup Inc ( C ) shares fell to their lowest level in nearly a decade after a Goldman Sachs &
Co analyst said investors should sell the largest U.S. bank 's stock short as losses mount from troubled debt .
William Tanona , the Goldman analyst , added Citigroup to Goldman 's " Americas conviction sell " list and cut his price target on the stock to $ 16 from $ 20 .

BRAD BLOG Asks Dean Logan and Leon County , FL's Ion Sancho About Experimental Election Night Program for Small Number of Precincts
Q&A's on That and a Few Other Points of Note , Documented on Video During Recent Appearance in Los Angeles by Both Election Officials ...
Brad Friedman Byon 7/30/2008 , 5:31 pm PT
-- Brad Friedman
I had the opportunity to ask an important question of both the legendary Leon County ( Tallahassee ) , FL , Supervisor of Elections , Ion Sancho , and Los Angeles County 's no-longer - interim Registrar of Voters , Dean Logan , last week here in Los Angeles .
Readers of The BRAD BLOG will remember Logan from his poor showing , as acting Registrar , in the handling of L.A. 's Super Tuesday " Double Bubble " ballot debacle , in which at least 12,000 mostly - perfectly - countable votes from the Democratic Primary went completely uncounted , as well as his handling of the failure I encountered myself , in the more recent state primary in June , when four of my own votes were printed incorrectly by the county 's ES&S electronic voting system .
Sancho was in town for press avails , in advance of the opening of Dorothy Fadiman 's new documentary Stealing America : Vote - by - Vote ( opening for week - long runs in NYC on Aug 1st , and in L.A. on Aug 15th - DISCLOSURE : I appear briefly in the film ) .
Logan , to his credit , was kind enough to show up , with his deputy Peter McNamara , for a screening of the film held by PDA last Thursday .
After the screening , Sancho , a compelling presence in Fadiman 's film , as he was in HBO 's landmark 2006 documentary , Hacking Democracy , answered questions , and the activists in the crowd managed to shoehorn Logan onto the stage to speak to a number of local concerns as well .
I took the opportunity to ask a few questions of both men , as captured by Alan Breslauer , with answers , on the video posted at the end of this article .
Of most important note , I wanted to know if either of them would commit to a hand - count of ballots in a handful of precincts this November , on an experimental basis , on Election Night .
The count , in such a " pilot program " as I described it , need n't be the official count , but could later be compared to the results as reported by both counties ' optical - scanners , since both L.A. and Leon County use paper ballots for their non-disabled voters .
As I 've advocated to a few other election officials in the past , hand - counting in this small , experimental way would help us all to begin to compile data about the effectiveness --- or even , lack thereof --- of transparent , polling - place based HCPB ( Hand - Counted Paper Ballots ) on Election Night , as many Election Integrity advocates have called for ...
While HCPB is still done in a few , often smaller jurisdictions around the country --- perhaps most notably , and successfully , in some 40 % of New Hampshire precincts --- the practice has been routinely dismissed by doubters who charge that hand - counting at the polling place is impractical in large jurisdictions ( e.g. , Los Angeles , the country 's largest ) or in places which have lengthy ballots with many candidates and ballot initiates ( eg. California ) .
The most virulent of critics --- let 's say , voting machine vendors , and many of their supporters --- argue that hand - counts are less accurate than machine counts .
The folks who make that argument have little data to back up their assertion and , usually opportunistically , point to Florida 2000 as their most well - known and frightening example of the dangers of hand - counting .
However , what happened in FL 2000 was most decidedly not the sort of HCPB that proponents are calling for .
Setting aside the duplicitous political wrangling that occurred in Florida in 2000 , where Republicans fought successfully to not have ballots counted at all , by hand and otherwise , the counting ( or lack thereof ) that Americans witnessed in 2000 took place at the state 's various county headquarters by a small group of counters from the local election boards .
HCPB , on the other hand , calls for fully transparent , polling place counting on the night of the Election , immediately after the close of polls , by citizen - volunteers of all parties , in full public view , with results posted immediately thereafter , before ballots are moved anywhere .
The disingenuous suggestion that somehow millions of ballots must be counted by a tiny group , as in FL 2000 , making the process untenable , unreliable and impossibly long is without substance .
The subset of ballots at any given precinct , HCPB - proponents argue , is small enough to allow for them to be counted manageably , quickly and accurately on Election Night , at each precinct , in full view of the citizen - stakeholders of our elections .
Hand - counting in a handful of precincts around the country this November , on an experimental test basis in such pilot programs , would allow us to begin to compile data as to the effectiveness and accuracy of HCPB .
Doing so in a number of counties and in a number of states is , as I see it , a rather reasonable and practical step to take , if the necessity of citizen ownership , oversight , and transparency in elections is ever to be fully realized .
I have no idea what the results , good or bad , might be .
That 's why such experiments are necessary and , as I see it , quite reasonable .
As a framer , and original signer of the Creekside Declaration , calling for " citizen ownership of transparent , participatory democracy , " I 'd heartily encourage such pilot programs all across the U.S. this year .
In response to my question for a commitment to such a project , Sancho noted that the state of Florida law disallows hand - counting of ballots , even in exceptionally close races , as the Orlando Sentinel shamefully detailed earlier this week .
California , however , has no such restrictions that I 'm aware of .
Furthermore , California has a provision in its Election Code ( EC 19211 ) that allows for the " experimental use at an election in one or more precincts " of even uncertified voting systems , for official use in actual elections .
" Its use at the election is as valid for all purposes as if it were lawfully adopted , " the code goes on to say about voting devices used under this provision .
Given that , and given that I 'm not even suggesting that hand - counts in this experiment be done for the official count , but rather , in parallel with the officially certified systems , so that we might compare and contrast results , I can see no reason not to carry out such an experiment and find out whatever we find out .
While Logan declined to commit to such a pilot program then and there , understandably , he responded that he 's " not closed to that idea " and further pointed out that he 's carried out such experiments in the past .
" I 'm not gonna stand here and make a commitment to a specific pilot project , tonight , " he said .
" But what I will say is I have a history , both here and in my previous work in Washington , of doing pilot projects .
So I 'm not closed to that idea . "
Glad to hear it .
Bowen Has Shown Interest in Hand - Counting
California 's Election Code , as noted above , allows for experimental programs , such as hand - counting in parallel to the machine count as I 'm suggesting , " provided provided that the use of the voting system or systems involved has been approved by the Secretary of State . "
( EC 19210 )
As CA Secretary of State , Debra Bowen was present in New Hampshire last January to observe hand - counting ( see Why Tuesday 's two - minute video above right ) during the state 's embarrassingly flawed Primary .
Flawed , at least , in the 60 % of precincts which chose to use known - hackable , error - prone Diebold optical - scan systems instead of hand - counts , without bothering to audit the accuracy of even a single ballot before publicly announcing the " results . "
( You can see the exact same Diebold op - scanners used by NH being hacked before your eyes in Sancho 's own office , in this clip from Hacking Democracy ) .
So it seems to me that Bowen would be open to allowing such pilot programs here , should any county election officials in the state request her permission .
For clarity , I 'm calling for ballots to be counted as usual , by optical - scan and / or or touch - screen as per each county 's practice , but I 'm suggesting that before any ballots or memory cards are sent back to county headquarters for final canvassing , that they be delayed at the precinct to allow citizen representatives from all parties to carry out a precinct - based hand - count , the results of which will then immediately be released to all , and posted at the precinct .
Afterwards , the county 's existing tabulation process will proceed as usual and will still serve as the official count .
Seems reasonable to me .
I hope to speak more with Logan , to follow up on this , and I hope other Election Integrity advocates ( read : good citizens ) will work with their local election officials as soon as possible this year to try and coordinate similar pilot projects around the country .
I can see absolutely no harm in doing so .
In California , the Election Code , Article 5 , " Manual Vote Count in the Precinct , " sections 15270 - 15281 , describes the official procedures for counting ballots in the state by hand at the precincts .
For other states , or even improvements on the current provisions in CA , the HCPB - advocates at the Election Defense Alliance have posted a downloadable Hand - count Handbook based on the very successful models as used in New Hampshire .
The handbook offers excellent , step - by - step instructions for the process of carrying out secure , accurate , and transparent hand - counted elections .
Sancho Ends " Sleepovers "
My questions to Logan and Sancho , along with their answers , follow in the video below .
It 's almost exactly 10 minutes .
In his answers to my questions , Sancho also speaks about how he 's changed Leon County 's procedures for deployment of voting machines following the security risk revealed in voting machine " sleepovers " at poll workers ' houses , prior to elections .
Such risks were revealed to be of grave national concern by The BRAD BLOG in great detail , in the wake of San Diego 's 2006 Busby / Bilbray Special Election aberration .
We have also been credited for coining the term " sleepovers , " by the way .
" Once we ascertained that the vulnerabilities of the equipment were such that , in fact , at any unprotected moment you could insert a virus or a patch or alter the device , " Sancho said , " we no longer allowed the devices to be out of an official chain of custody , at all . "
Sancho noted , to applause from the assembled , that his machines in Tallahassee are now deployed to the polling place , " in steel cages , " on the morning of Elections .
Unfortunately , despite CA SoS Bowen 's pre-election campaigning against the practice in 2006 --- she even released a campaign video highlighting the dangers , and later declared her belief that the practice was " illegal " --- she still allows the practice to continue in the state , albeit with new restrictions .
Critics have charged , however , that her restrictions are not rigorous enough , and are poorly enforced .
After Sancho's comments , Logan takes his crack at my questions .
Though he says , as seen in the video , that I asked " about ten , " I was so appreciative that he showed up for the event at all , and agreed to take questions , that I bit my tongue to avoid cracking - wise in response that it was actually only three questions , which I 'd have thought , as Registrar , he might have been able to count a bit more accurately .
So I decided to write the wisecrack here , instead of saying it there .
Who says I can't reasonably compromise ?

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A Russian court has banned a book about Adolf Hitler by late British historian Hugh Trevor - Roper , saying quotes attributed to the Nazi leader insult Russians and Jews , prosecutors said on Tuesday .
Under anti-extremism laws the court banned the 1953 book “ Hitler ’s Table Talk : 1941 - 1944 ” , which records Hitler ’s sometimes racist ramblings on a wide range of topics .
Trevor -Roper , Regis professor of history at Oxford University between 1957 and 1980 , wrote what is considered one of the classic accounts of the fall of Nazi Germany : “ The Last Days of Hitler ” .
Russia ’s Prosecutor - General said in a statement that texts published in “ Hitler ’s Table Talk ” are of “ an anti-Slavic and anti-Semitic character ” .
“ A host of statements by A . Hitler in the book insult the dignity of Russian and Jewish peoples who are presented in quotes as inferior and primitive people because of their nationality . ”
The Prosecutor - General said certain Hitler quotes in the book -- such as “ Russians are beasts , ” “ Slavs are a mass of inborn slaves ” -- had caused offence .
The book will now be put on a national list of extremist works that are banned and owning or distributing it would then be illegal .
Trevor -Roper , one of the leading scholars of his generation , became Lord Dacre after being made a life peer in 1987 .
He died in 2003 .
Initially an expert on the 16th and 17th centuries , he drew on information gained while serving as an intelligence officer in World War Two to write “ The Last Days of Hitler ” , considered a classic of Hitler scholarship .
His reputation took a knock in 1983 when he was briefly taken in by diaries purportedly written by Hitler that turned out to be forgeries .
When the media covers the rising rate of c-section , it ’s often ready to lay the blame at the feet of a woman we ’re come to know well over the last few years -- the busy career mom scheduling her delivery between important business deals .
But while some moms may be requesting surgical birth , research shows that has little to do with the overall increase in c-section rates nationwide .
Cesarean sections have been
hitting headlines a lot lately .
We ’ve been hearing about the rising c-section
rate , now above
30 % and rising , for months , and in early June we learned that women
have been denied
health insurance coverage because of previous cesareans .
A few days later ,
the March of
Dimes reported that 92 % of preterm births were delivered by c-section .
When the media covers the
rising rate of c-section , it ’s often ready to lay the blame at the feet of a
woman we ’re come to know well over the last few years — the busy career mom
scheduling her delivery between important business deals , penciling in labor
and delivery the way she pencils in a client meeting .
As criticism of surgical
birth mounts , the idea that mother - initiated c-sections are spurring an overall
increase in the practice has only become more popular .
In mid-April
( coincidentally also Cesarean Awareness
Month ) , Time Magazine claimed that Choosy
Mothers Choose Cesareans .
Euna Chung , a child psychiatrist in Los Angeles , told Alice Park that she planned her c-section before she was even pregnant .
Park wrote of Chung ,
" a combination of having watched traumatic vaginal
deliveries in medical school and hearing about her mother ’s difficult emergency
caesarean experience after trying to deliver vaginally helped make up her
mind . "
Chung told Time , " I had a fear of going through labor and ending up with
an emergency C-section anyway .
I know that ’s rare , but I did n’t want to deal
with it . "
A recent Today show
segment picked up on this supposed phenomenon , referring to the trend as
" babies on demand . "
Dr. Judith Reichman , the expert obstetrician on the show
reported National Institutes of Health Statistics that approximately 2 % of all
c-sections nationwide can be considered " cesarean deliveries on maternal
request . "
While the media likes to use these
stories of maternal demand as attention - grabbing hooks for their reporting on
the rise in c-section rates , other birth advocates and birthing rights
organizations take issue with the " mother ’s choice " frame .
Our Bodies Ourselves ’
recently released book " Pregnancy and Birth " explains that the studies which
produce data like what Dr. Reichman referenced is flawed and not at all
conclusive :
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

Although some
studies describe an increase in caesareans without any medical indication , the
authors of these studies are clear that these may not represent real ‘ maternal
request . ’
The studies , based on birth certificates or hospital billing records ,
have no way of documenting whether the caesarean was initially sought by the
mother , whether it was based on physician advice or pressure , or whether there
was simply poor record keeping .
These
advocates argue that while there invariably are some women who are choosing casareans without medical reasons , they do not represent a significant enough
percentage to account for huge increase in c-sections in the last decade .
In
other words , some moms may be requesting surgical birth , but that has little to
do with the overall increase in c-section rates .
Childbirth Connection ’s most
recent survey Listening
to Mothers survey reports that just one woman in 1600 actually reported
having a first c-section because she chose and planned it ahead of time without
any medical reason – a rate far lower than the 2 % suggested by Dr. Reichman on
the Today Show .
Does it do any harm when the media ,
doctors and others point to mother ’s choice as the reason behind higher c-section
rates ?
These advocates argue that it takes away attention from the how decisions
related to pregnancy and childbirth are really made : often , under intense
pressure from the woman ’s physician .
Childbirth Connection explains , " There is a change in practice standards
that reflects an increasing willingness on the part of professionals to follow
the cesarean path under all conditions .
In fact , one quarter of the Listening
to Mothers survey participants who had cesareans reported that they had
experienced pressure from a health professional to have a cesarean . "
Even if
women are reporting a choice for cesarean , Childbirth Connection and others
argue that women are n’t making decisions about their mode of delivery in a
vacuum ; rather , they are deeply impacted by the opinions and guidance of their
providers .
Lamaze
International explains , " What women hear from obstetricians
powerfully influences what they think .
Some obstetricians think so little of
the risks , pain , and recovery of cesarean surgery that they feel that ‘ convenience , ’
‘ certainty of delivering practitioner , ’ and ‘ [ labor ] pain ’ justify performing
this major operation on healthy women . "
When physicians talk up convenience and do n’t give air time to possible
complications resulting from c-section , it ’s no wonder women make decisions in
the same terms .
What makes these advocates the
angriest , though , is the implication that doctors who support a woman ’s right
to elect a c-section do so because they believe in supporting all of women’s
choices around how they want to give birth .
Quite the opposite , says Lamaze
International :
The answer , naturally , is 15 .
If you ’re talking about the Burnt Pancake problem , that is .
( And the sequence actually starts 1 , 4 , 6 , 8 … but I left off the initial 1 because otherwise you would have known right away that something was amiss . )
The Burnt Pancake problem involves pancakes of different sizes , each with one burnt side , piled up on top of one another .
Here ’s how famous math guy and Emmy winner David X. Cohen initially described the problem in this interview with Sarah Greenwald :
The question was how do you sort these disks to get the biggest pancake on the bottom and the smallest pancake on top [ with all the burnt sides down ] if they start in an arbitrary disordered state , and the only thing you ’re allowed to do is put a spatula somewhere in the middle , pick up the ones above it , flip them over , and put them down , as a group .
Doing that repeatedly , putting a spatula in different places , you want to sort this out .
So a very physical thing , that got me excited when I found out that no one knew the answer in general for how many flips it takes to sort this thing .
Here is help us visualize this problem is our friendly neighborhood Godzilla .
He ’s going to use oreos with tops removed to simulate the pancakes .
With only one “ pancake ” , if it starts like this
the “ burnt ” side is already at the bottom , so it needs 0 flips to get into the proper position .
If , instead , the pancake starts “ burnt ” side up , it needs one flip :
( Do n’t you think that Godzilla looks a little bit like that guy Craig from Hell ’s Kitchen ? )
As the Big G has just demonstrated , if you have just ONE burnt pancake then it could take as many as , well , 1 flip to orient it correctly .
That ’s where the 1 in the sequence 1 , 4 , 6 , 8 , … comes from .
Now let ’s look at what happens with two burnt pancakes .
We want to end up with the larger pancake on the bottom , and all the burnt sides down like this :
But what will happen if the pancakes start off in a different configuration ?
How many flips have to be done ?
It turns out that it could be as many as 4 flips :
Suppose your pancakes start off in this pile : , with the burnt parts on top .
The first thing Godzilla does is to put the spatula on the bottom and flip the pile over .
Now the pancakes have the burnt side down , but the smaller one is on the bottom .
The big top pancake will have to be flipped :
( Godzilla ’s being a little sloppy here : he should only be picking up the top pancake . )
After this maneuver the burnt parts are on the “ outside ” but big pancake is still on top .
The entire stack needs to be flipped to get the little pancake back on top :
Now the little pancake is on the top and the burnt parts are on the “ outside ” , so the top pancake must be flipped :
And now voilà , the pancakes are in the right order !
See how happy Godzilla is !
He knows he gets to eat these oreos when all is said and done .
With a different starting configuration ( there are 2!·22=8 ways they initially could be piled up , with the smaller pancake on the top or the bottom , and the various burnt sides up or down ) , it turns out that it will take at most 4 flips to get them in the correct order .
That ’s where the 4 comes from in 1 , 4 , 6 , 8 , ….
What happens if you start with three pancakes of different sizes ?
The desired ending configuration is this :
There are 3!·23=48 different ways the pancakes could start out .
Some of them could be turned into the proper configuration after just one flip :
but other configurations require more .
This one , for example :
The cookies are in the right order , but it just takes a lot of maneuvering to get the burnt parts on the bottom instead of the top : 6 flips .
That ’s the most it would take no matter how the pancakes started out .
So for one pancake it could take as many as 1 flip , for two pancakes it takes up to 4 flips , for three pancakes up to 6 flips , for four pancakes up to 8 flips , for five pancakes up to 10 flips , for six pancakes up to 12 flips , and for seven pancakes up to 14 flips .
Then for eight pancakes , it only takes up to 15 flips .
And for nine pancakes 17 flips , then for ten pancakes it goes up to 18 flips ( according to the Online Encylopedia of Integer Sequences ) .
But by 11 pancakes there are over 81 billion different initial configurations , so checking by hand to find the smallest number of flips for each configuration is tough .
Fortunately , as described in this earlier post , we have E. Coli to help us figure it out .
[ They give the E .
Coli a configuration , let them do a specific number of flips , and any E .
Coli that get the virtual pancakes in the right order become resistant to the antibiotic tetracycline in honor of their good effort .
Then the scientists add some tetracycline and if any of the E.
Coli survive , they know that the pancakes could be put in order after that particular number of flips .
The animation E . Hop gives the whole scoop . ]
Meanwhile , Godzilla is going to take a little break .
Bon appetit !

Press releases : everybody hates them .
Reporters hate them because they are trite , condescending , unreadable , superfluous , or some combination thereof .
The flacks who write press releases hate them because they know that their intended recipients have nothing but scorn for their hard work .
And the public hates press releases because the lazy media uses them anyways , producing tons of craptastic non-news .
Flacks recommend buzzwords to get a press release picked up : " green , " " environment , " " foreclosure , " " toxic , " and , in Idaho , " polygamy . "
Wrong !
Buzzwords are why people hate these things in the first place .
After the jump , five real live ways to put together a good press release :
Have news :
When you sit down to write a press release , ask yourself , " Is this really news ? "
If the answer is no , get up from the table without writing the press release .
: When you sit down to write a press release , ask yourself , " Is this really news ? "
If the answer is no , get up from the table without writing the press release .
5WPR : Ha , that 's a little play on words on our part .
It means that PR people should put the five W's into their press release right up top : " Who , what , when , where , and why . "
It also will help you remember not to act like the actual Ronn [ sic ]
Torossian - led agency called 5WPR , in which the five W's stand for " What ?
Whoa .
Wow .
Who would " ever hire this incompetent PR firm ?

Do nothing until we call you :
Here 's what most reporters ( who are n't total hacks ) do with a press release : skim it for the five W's ( SEE ABOVE ) , then look at the bottom to find the contact number for the flack .
You think we want to pull the robotic quotes that you wrote for your CEO right out of that wretched press release and put them in our stories as if he actually said them ?
Fuck you !
We want to call you and harass you and ask you a long series of questions until you cough up a quote suitable for being read by human beings .
And we want it now !
Night shift , day shift , wire reporters — everybody is on deadline for right now , meaning that you , the flack , must be available to talk about it right now .
Do not go pee .
Sit by the phone and await our call !
( Of course if you actually do have big news , all the reporters will patiently wait our turn like the bootlickers that we are ) .

Make sure all the shit in it is right :
If we pull something directly out of a press release and put it in a story , and it then turns out to be wrong , we will cry and cry .
Then blacklist you .
The belief that reporters double - check basic facts in press releases is a myth .

No free stuff :
This one is counterintuitive .
In fact , plenty of companies send freebies ranging from t- shirts to tickets to liquor with their press kits , and it works beautifully .
I guarantee it will increase your pickup .
I also guarantee that it will slowly , almost imperceptibly , contribute to the erosion of a strong and independent news media , able to stand apart from the corporations it covers and deliver a judgment with only the public interest in mind .
Of course , flacks do n't really want a media like that , so you will continue to send free swag , and reporters will continue to eat it up .
But think of THE PEOPLE , and refrain .
It 's the right thing to do .
I could use some Yankees tickets though .
I had received an email on this earlier today and thought it was a hoax .
It ’s apparently not .
Just a warning , it ’s kind of graphic .
Here ’s the AP story .
Four people reportedly dialed 911 within a minute of the accident .
But , the man did n’t die , so leaving him just lying in the road was gross .

Welcome to part five of our eight - part Guide to Guerrilla Marketing .
So far , the guerrilla marketing efforts we ’ve explored in parts one , two , three , and four have been all about the Benjamins .
Companies small to massive have used guerrilla techniques to grab the attention of unsuspecting consumers .
But believe it or not , these subversive and innovative ideas can be reapplied in creative ways – such as through subvertising , reverse shoplifting or other culture jamming – or can even used more directly for good causes – not just lining someone ’s pockets .
One of the most easily recognized social guerrilla campaigns is “ Obey . ”
If you live in or near a major city , you ’ve no doubt seen stickers like the one above .
The Obey campaign is the brainchild of artist Shepard Fairey , who describes his work as “ an experiment in phenomenology . ”
What started out as an inside joke in the skater community eventually grew to encompass the world .
Stickers and stenciled images featuring the iconic image of Andre the Giant and the cryptic big brother - esque word “ Obey ” can now be found from San Francisco to Tokyo and pretty much every city between .
Could this be guerrilla art and not guerrilla marketing ?
Let ’s call it guerrilla anti-marketing .
Fairey ’s manifesto describes it beautifully : “ The Obey campaign attempts to stimulate curiosity and bring people to question both the campaign and their relationship with their surroundings .
Because people are not used to seeing advertisements or propaganda for which the motive is not obvious , frequent and novel encounters with Obey propaganda provoke thought and possible frustration , nevertheless revitalizing the viewer ’s perception and attention to detail . ”
By looking like advertisements for something obscure and exclusive , Obey images serve to make us more aware of the constant barrage of commercial ads we are subjected to each day .
Somewhat ironically , the campaign has spawned a clothing line and a successful design career for Fairey .
Obey now produces many images besides the giant who started it all .
Guerrilla marketing has proven its versatility as a social medium and money - making advertising tool .
Now , even nonprofit organizations are getting into the game .
Lots of nonprofits have embraced guerrilla advertising as the perfect way to get the attention needed to further their causes .
In anticipation of Lights Out for Earth Hour 2008 , the WWF placed stickers resembling light switches in outdoor locations around Switzerland .
The stickers looked so realistic that many passers - by actually tried to switch them off .
When they were close enough , they could read the text all about the upcoming event .
These amazingly realistic images of children pushing automatic revolving doors in Amsterdam are meant to call attention to child labor practices .
They are actually vinyl stickers with copy above that states “ You Ca n’t Ignore Child Labor . ”
To create awareness of the plight of homeless people in America , these nutrition facts labels were placed on outdoor trash bins .
The familiar image in an unexpected place causes the mind to react differently than it would to an obvious advertisement .
The viewer is drawn in to examine the label and figure out what it ’s doing there .
The URL at the bottom gives a call to action , and the hope is that the image will stick in the viewer ’s mind long enough to encourage them to follow through on that action .
We are intrigued by juxtaposition , and that is one of the hallmarks of effective guerrilla advertisements .
Seeing something that is out of place , shocking , or just plain bizarre snaps the mind out of the state of forced indifference – a state that we ’ve developed in response to ever - present advertising .
Because the marketers behind guerrilla ads use this knowledge to capture our attention in new and unusual ways , does that mean they ’re manipulating us ?
In a word , yes .
The goal of any advertisement is to get you to do something .
Whether that something is buying a product , seeing a movie or , as in the picture above ( from a UK ashcan ) , stop smoking , marketers play on psychological principles to affect our behavior .
The advertising world has latched on to these principles because of their incredible effectiveness .
But what kind of lifespan does guerrilla marketing have ?
Will we eventually become desensitized to even the most shocking advertisements ?
According to some people , though , guerrilla marketing campaigns already go too far .
While they are by nature invasive and jarring , there have been several guerrilla marketing campaigns that were overflowing with shock value .
Besides some notable well - intended flops , many guerrilla marketing campaigns either fall short of the mark or overestimate our tolerance for shocking images or methods .
Coming up : more details on kinds of and approaches to guerrilla marketing and ways in which guerrilla marketing might even work for you !

Unknown hackers hijacked Comcast 's domain name for three hours overnight , sending subscribers who tried to access webmail and other services to a rogue site that bragged of the exploit .
Comcast lost control of the comcast .
net address after the attackers changed registration information stored by its domain registrar , Network Solutions , a Comcast spokesman said .
The unauthorized change redirected people attempting to visit the site to a page that read : " KRYOGENIKS Defiant and EBK RoXed COMCAST .
sHouTz To VIRUS Warlock elul21 coll1er seven . "
The page was displayed after the attackers altered the site 's IP resolution information , replacing Comcast 's IP address with the rogue address 209.62.20.186 .
Comcast spokesman Charlie Douglas said there was no immediate evidence that the attackers ' page tried to install malware or steal user credentials .
But some participants in this DSLReports forum reported their email clients were redirected to the impostor address , prompting concern their login sequence could have been intercepted .
Douglas said security people are still investigating .
Comcast engineers restored the correct domain name settings about three hours after they were altered .
By late Thursday morning , comcast .
net was accessible to most people .
But some users , including some with private DNS servers that had n't been updated , still got errors .
( Windows users who are getting errors may want to try flushing their DNS cache using using the command " ipconfig / flushdns " , sans the quotes . )
It 's still unclear how the attackers accessed the registration settings on store with Network Solutions .
A brute force password attack is one possibility , but you 'd think Network Solutions has safeguards in place to detect thousands of unsuccessful login attempts .
A Network Solutions spokeswoman said the company is working with Comcast to figure out how the hackers obtained the login credentials to the account .
The ability of unknown hackers to hijack the domain name of one of America 's biggest internet providers is yet another reminder of the fragility of the net 's domain name system .
While DNS attacks in recent years have focused on more esoteric methods such as cache poisoning and DNS rebinding , the attack shows that old - fashioned account compromises are also sufficient to alter substantial amounts of web traffic .
Douglas said Comcast is working with unnamed law enforcement agencies to track down the attackers .
Little is known about the interlopers , except for a few traces left behind that hint at some sophomoric sensibilities .
In addition to their cryptic defacement , they altered the address for Comcast 's administrative contact to " 69 dick tard lane , dildo room . " ®
Some archaeologists working in Ireland , at Corofin , County Galway , may ( or may not ) have found an early Christian site there , identified by 65 burials in what could , if generously interpreted , be a vallum , an earth rampart that is traditionally held to mark the limits of a monastic enclosure in Celtic areas .
Some might say that , given how difficult it is to actually identify Irish Christian sites in archaeological terms , or any religious site at all for definite really , this is a bit hopeful , but the burials are all supine , extended ( except for one ) and oriented east - west and so , while even that is not ambiguous , I do n’t see why it should n’t be a Christian cemetery .
That is n’t what I wanted to mention .
In fact this entry is dedicated to bloggers like Carl Pyrdum and Jennifer Lynn Jordan , the sort of people who can use the phrase “ monkey butt - trumpet ” and mean it .
You see , the owner of one of the skeletons was buried with a sheep , in what some might call a “ compromising position ” , as you can see :
The reporting page coyly says that this has led to some “ unlikely suppositions ” , and well , yes , it would would n’t it ?
But what then would a likely one be ?
Any suggestions ?
Clinton mailing 's gun gaffe
Sen. Hillary Clinton ’s mailing attacking Sen. Barack Obama ’s record on guns appears to include a striking visual gaffe :
The image of the gun pictured on the face of the mailing is reversed , making it a nonexistent left - handed model of the Mauser 66 rifle .
To make matters worse , a prominent gun dealer said , it ’s an expensive German gun with customized features that make it clearly European .
“ The gun in the photo does not exist , ” said Val Forgett III , president of Navy Arms in Martinsburg , W.Va .
Forgett 's company was Mauser ’s agent in the United States when the gun was released , and it sold Mauser guns here again in the 1990s .
“ The bolt is facing to the left side of the receiver , making it a left - handed bolt action rifle , indicating whoever constructed and approved the mailer did not recognize the image has been reversed . ”
Forgett said the error would be obvious to sportsmen .
“ I find it laughable on its face , ” he said .
“ It ’s like a picture of Babe Ruth hitting right - handed . ”
The gun 's image in Clinton 's mailing is above ; a correct image of the gun is below .
Other rifle enthusiasts e-mailed Politico after an image of Clinton ’s mailing was posted to this blog .
“ I bet the Clinton folks did a mirror flip on the stock image to make it look more ‘ aesthetic , ’ ” wrote one , David Phillips .
“ What a latte - sipping , Gucci - wearing thing to do . ”
The Mauser 66 , released in 1966 and no longer manufactured , is a high - end hunting rifle that found military use as a sniper rifle .
In Clinton ’s mailing , it ’s pictured with a double - set trigger , a customization that ’s popular in Europe but “ almost unheard of in the United States , ” Forgett said .
“ It ’s a $ 2,200 German import — it ’s hardly typical of what the average workingman in Indiana uses , ” he said .

Arc of anti-Barack rhetoric seems to have Noah end
by Jeremy Hooper
If you can't beat 'em , flood 'em .
This is the social conservatives ' apparent new strategy :
Pray for Rain [ Focus on the Family 's Citizenlink ]
** UPDATE , 8/12 : After catching negative attention from bloggers and mainstream media personalities alike , FOF quietly pulled Stuart 's video .
However , we have a backup copy :
Your thoughts
That is the stupidest thing I have ever seen .
I like how he qualified that if it rains it is a sign that they are right , but if it does n’t then God is just waiting to smite us down in his infinite wisdom !

This is another example of hypocritical right wing christian .
They all preach morality but when it comes down to it they let their own selfish desires consume them and use what personally to me is sacred religious expression to violate then Golden Rule these purported Christians are supposed to live by .

Too funny !
If this is their strategy this year , Obama is going to sail into the white house !

Posted by : gary | Jul 31 , 2008 2:11:05 PM
I love this !
I mean Stuart is practically admitting that they can't win debating the issues so he 's just praying for rain to literally flood out the noise of the speech .
I guess that 's all you can do when you know the speech will likely clinch the presidency in Obama 's favor .
Oh , and does he mean the kind of rain that God allowed to occur on inauguration day in 2001 with temperatures in the 30s that made the newly sworn in president look like a pathetic wet rag - doll ?
That kind of rain , Stu ?
Because I gotta tell you , I prayed for rain that day and God provided and called it good !
Silly God , he 's such a master at foreshadowing !
But I would like all those that read this site to pray as well .
I ask that they pray on the night John McCain gives his speech at the Republican convention that it come through loud and clear .
And that God will give us strength to stay fully awake through the entire monotonous dribble .
Because if McCain is truly heard by enough people that night , Obama 's the next president of the United States .
Posted by : Jon-Marc | Jul 31 , 2008 2:23:45 PM
Yeah , it would be kinda wrong to do that .
Because that kind of rain would surely cause at least one car accident .
And besides LOL LOL LOL

There are n't more important things to pray about than raining out a political convention .
Forget hunger , AIDS , or poverty .
This is priority number 1 !
Posted by : Patrick | Jul 31 , 2008 6:51:57 PM
Jon-Marc - although I 'm no religious person , I 'm going to pray that McCain has one of his Vietnam flashbacks during his convention speech .
It 's the only thing that 'll save the TV coverage from being one big visual sleeping pill " I'm for the Iraq war , I 'm against homosex and abortion " , over and over .
It 'll be like 2000 and 2004 Deja Vu , so an onstage freak - out would be a welcomed addition to the non-entertainment .
Posted by : Scott | Aug 1 , 2008 9:29:49 AM
What just absolutely kills me is that there is an actual drought in Colorado , not to mention California 's fires .
And those are things that are really harming real families .
And * this * is what is motivating them to ask for a mass prayer for rain .
Then we Witches get accused of cursing right and left !!!!!

Slugger Manny Ramirez 's stormy relationship with the Boston Red Sox is over .
Ramirez has been traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers .
The Red Sox will pay the remaining $ 7 million of Ramirez 's contract owed for this season , ESPN.com 's Peter Gammons reported .
" When a player like Manny becomes available , I do n't think there 's a manager in baseball who would n't say they 're interested , " said Dodgers manager Joe Torre , whose Yankees teams went toe - to - toe with Ramirez for years .
" It was something that happened very quickly , obviously . "
Outfielder Jason Bay is going to Boston and the Pittsburgh Pirates get four minor leaguers as part of the three - way deal .
Third baseman Andy LaRoche and right - handed pitcher Bryan Morris will go to the Pirates from the Dodgers .
Outfielder Brandon Moss and right - handed pitcher Craig Hansen will leave the Red Sox organization for Pittsburgh .
Wednesday 's remarks by Ramirez , who has been involved in trade rumors the past few years , might have been the final straw for the Red Sox .
" The Red Sox do n't deserve a player like me , " Ramirez told ESPNdeportes.com .
" During my years here , I 've seen how they [ the Red Sox ] have mistreated other great players when they did n't want them to try to turn the fans against them .
" The Red Sox did the same with guys like Nomar Garciaparra and Pedro Martinez , and now they do the same with me .
Their goal is to paint me as the bad guy .
I love Boston fans , but the Red Sox do n't deserve me .
I 'm not talking about money .
Mental peace has no price , and I do n't have peace here . "
Dodgers infielder Garciaparra , who played for the Red Sox from 1996 - 2004 , said he 's always had the utmost respect for Ramirez .
" It 's nice to see we 've done something like this , to make a push for the next two months , " Garciaparra said .
" I think he 'll be just fine .
Manny is really a simple person .
He works extremely hard .
He just wants to play baseball and go home and be with his family .
How can you not respect and love a guy like that ? "
Ramirez , the MVP of the 2004 World Series , remains one of baseball 's best hitters and has enjoyed plenty of big moments in October .
But his relationship with the Red Sox soured -- again -- in recent months , prompting the All - Star outfielder to agree to the deal .
The Dodgers began the day one game behind first - place Arizona in the NL West , and were seeking a big bat .
Boston , in the middle of the AL East race and chasing a second straight World Series title , wanted a productive hitter in return and got that in Bay .
At 29 , Bay is a two - time All - Star and was hitting .282 with 22 home runs and 64 RBIs .
Tampa Bay pursued
Bay before he wound up with the Red Sox , who trail the first - place Rays by three games in the AL East .
Even before landing the enigmatic Ramirez , Los Angeles had a crowded outfield .
Torre has been juggling Matt Kemp , Andre Ethier , Andruw Jones and Juan Pierre .

When you say the word " truth " , people know that " truth " is a good thing , and that they 're supposed to applaud .
So it might seem like there is a social norm in favor of " truth " .
But when it comes to some particular truth , like whether God exists , or how likely their startup is to thrive , people will say : " I just want to believe " or " you 've got to be optimistic to succeed " .
So Robin and I were talking about this , and Robin asked me how it is that people prevent themselves from noticing the conflict .
I replied that I do n't think active prevention is required .
First , as I quoted Michael Vassar :
" It seems to me that much of the frustration in my life prior to a few years ago has been due to thinking that all other human minds necessarily and consistently implement modus ponens . "
But more importantly , I do n't think there does exist any social norm in favor of truth .
There 's a social norm in favor of " truth " .
There 's a difference .
How would a norm in favor of truth actually be expressed , or acquired ?
If you were told many stories , as a kid , about specific people who accepted specific hard truths - like a story of a scientist accepting that their theory was wrong , say - then your brain would generalize over its experiences , and compress them , and form a concept of that - which - is - the - norm : the wordless act of accepting reality .
If you heard someone say " I do n't care about the evidence , I just want to believe in God " , and you saw everyone else in the room gasp and regard them in frozen shock , then your brain would generalize a social norm against self - deception .
( E.g. , the sort of thing that would happen if a scientist said " I do n't care about the evidence , I just want to believe in my - favorite - theory " in front of their fellow scientists . )
If , on the other hand , you see lots of people saying " Is n't the truth wonderful ? " or " I am in favor of truth " , then you learn that when someone says " truth " , you are supposed to applaud .
Now there are certain particular cases where someone will be castigated if they admit they refuse to see the truth : for example , " I 've seen the evidence on global warming but I do n't want to believe it . "
You could n't get away with that in modern society .
But this indignation does n't have to derive from violating a norm in favor of truth - it can derive from the widely held norm , " ' global warming ' is bad " .
But ( said Robin ) we see a lot of trees and hear the word " tree " , and somehow we learn that the word refers to the thing - why do n't people learn something similar about " truth " , which is supposed to be good ?
I suggested in reply that the brain is capable of distinguishing different uses of the same syllables - a child is quite capable of learning that a right turn and the right answer are not the same kind of " right " .
You wo n't necessarily assume that the right answer is always the one printed on the right side of the page .
Maybe the word " truth " is overloaded in the same way .
Or maybe it's not exactly the same , but analogous : the social norms of which words we are meant to praise , and which deeds , are stored as separately as left hands and leftovers .
There 's a social norm in favor of " diversity " , but not diversity .
There 's a social norm in favor of " free speech " , but not pornography .
There 's a social norm in favor of " democracy " , but it does n't spontaneously occur to most people to suggest voting on their arguments .
There 's a social norm in favor of " love " , but not for letting some damn idiot marry your daughter even if the two of them are stupid and besotted .
There 's a social norm in favor of " honesty " .
And there are in fact social norms for honesty about e.g. who cut down the cherry tree .
But not a social norm favoring saying what you think about someone else 's appearance .
I 'm not suggesting that you ignore all the words that people praise .
Sometimes the things people praise with their lips , really are the things that matter , and our deeds are what fail to live up .
Neither am I suggesting that you should ignore what people really do , because sometimes that also embodies wisdom .
I would just say to be aware of any differences , and judge deliberately , and choose knowingly .
Sounds good , does n't it ?
Everyone knows that being " aware " and " choosing knowingly " must surely be good things .
But is it a real norm or a fake norm ?
Can you think of any stories you were told that illustrate the point ?
( Not a rhetorical question , but a question one should learn to ask . )
It 's often not hard to find a norm in favor of " rationality " - but norms favoring rationality are rarer .
During OSCON last week , I met with Canonical 's Pete Goodall to discuss the company 's strategy for Ubuntu in the mobile market .
Although he could not tell me any specifics regarding plans for upcoming Ubuntu - based subnotebook products , the word is that good stuff is coming soon .
He seemed very enthusiastic about emerging opportunities for Ubuntu in the mobile space .
He says that touchscreens will become more prevalent in next - generation devices and he expressed interest in experimenting with new approaches to finger - friendly user interface design .
The innovative things that Canonical is doing now with the mobile launcher are just the beginning .
Canonical 's move to make Ubuntu a success on subnotebooks could have some intriguing incidental advantages .
Preinstallation opportunities will offer a very powerful way to increase the distribution 's visibility , which could encourage broader adoption on the desktop .
It 's also worth noting that some of the performance , memory , and boot optimizations that are being implemented to improve the mobile experience will help improve the desktop experience as well .
One of the most compelling advantages of the Linux subnotebook trend is that it gives major OEMs a reason to care about Linux hardware compatibility .
They can , in turn , apply pressure to the component makers to ensure that proper open - source drivers can be implemented .
The process of educating vendors will take a long time , but Goodall and others who are working in the mobile space say that some vendors are already starting to get the right idea .
Goodall demonstrated the Ubuntu Netbook Remix on an Atom - based subnotebook that he had brought with him to the event .
The device was an Acer Aspire One on which he had installed Ubuntu after erasing Acer 's own Fedora - based Linpus Linux distribution .
Canonical has no plans to ship Ubuntu on Aspire One laptops ; Goodall just bought it so that he could use it as a test environment .
Even though the software had n't been tailored to that specific device , it ran remarkably well .
This is a testament to Ubuntu 's excellent hardware compatibility and the consistent nature of Atom - based subnotebook components .
On the Aspire 's 8.9 inch 1024x600 LCD , the Ubuntu mobile launcher looked crisp and elegant .
He demonstrated several of the hardware features and showed me that the built - in webcam worked perfectly with Cheese , the GNOME webcam application .
Seeing Ubuntu in action on the Aspire has cranked up my enthusiasm for Linux - based subnotebooks .
I 've gotten a tremendous amount of use out of my Eee in the past year , and I 'm looking forward to replacing it when the next generation of Atom - based devices hits the market .
Alan Colmes took on Karl Rove over Gitmo and habeas corpus rights .
Wow , Rover certainly had a problem with the wingnut court he helped create .
They always play the fear card as far as they can go .
WWI comes up as usual along with the Nazis .
Rove starts screaming at Colmes .
You see , they set up the Gitmo card like Republicans do with all regulations --- so they could get around them .
Here 's the new White House scare line now :
The White House said Thursday that dangerous detainees at Guantanamo Bay could end up walking Main Street U.S.A. as a result of last month 's Supreme Court ruling about detainees ' legal rights .
Federal appeals courts , however , have indicated they have no intention of letting that happen .
Download Download ( very rough transcript .
It 's 1:28 am as I 'm writing this . )
Colmes :
This is a great decision that dates back to the Magna Carter and habeas corpus and refers back to .... The constitution applies to persons not just citizens .
That is in keeping with what the constitution says .
Rove :
This is a ridiculous decision .
This is not the criminal justice system , this is a WAR !
With all due respect Alan .
When was war declared ?
Did Congress declare war ?...
It was not a declaration of war ...
Colmes :
If you want to go by the US constitution , do n't they get to declare war ?
Rove :
If you feel that strongly , go get yourself an ACLU attorney .
File a declaration in the court ...
Colmes :
If you 're going by the Constitution ...
If you 're a strict constructionist , habeas corpus is key .. you have to go through the Constitution ...
Heather says :
Here 's the story that 's been making headlines in Europe over the last few days : the EU is getting ready to impose Internet traffic monitoring fit for a police state , might ban all peer - to - peer software , and is ready to implement a " three strikes and you 're off the ' Net " policy for users sharing copyrighted files .
Gross exaggerations , of course , but you would n't necessarily know that if you 'd read the news sections of online rights groups , or even the website of the venerable BBC .
The phrasing in these reports appear to have originated in press releases from two Internet privacy groups that have what can be charitably called an overheated take on some of the EU legislation 's provisions .
Ambiguities , not communism
The EU's Telecom Package is a catch - all piece of legislation that aims to harmonize network and wireless access principles across the member states .
Provisions under consideration would include the establishment of a small body that oversees regulations of its member states and a Market Authority that encourages the adoption of next - generation authorities .
Other provisions would formalize a users ' bill of rights in terms of privacy and universal access .
As the legislation is working its way through committees in the amendment phase , it appears that various special interest groups appear to be trying to get their views slipped into the legislation ; in some cases , these provisions are somewhat ambiguously worded .
That ambiguity has n't stopped a number of groups from drawing some very unambiguous conclusions about those provisions .
The BBC report echoes the contentions of the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure , which accused the European Parliament rushing towards a " Soviet Internet . "
That contention appears to be based on a provision on packet filtering .
Benjamin Henrion , an FFI representative , also charged that the legislation will create some sort of software licensing authority .
" Tomorrow , " he stated , " popular software applications like Skype or even Firefox might be declared illegal in Europe if they are not certified by an administrative authority . "
Those claims are reiterated and extended by the French group La Quadrature du Net , which issued an analysis ( PDF ) of several amendments last week .
In addition to accusations of spying and censorship , the group decries a provision that they term " blackmail by e-mail . "
This would codify the use of warning letters sent to copyright infringers by ISPs .
Oddly , these warning letters are conflated with the " three strikes " proposals , which would ban the infringers after repeated warnings .
( The European Parliament rejected the idea of a widespread " three strikes " rule only a couple of months ago . )
This approach — take the obvious text of the amendments and conflate them with the worst fears of ' Net users — pervades the analysis .
One amendment allows nations to establish regulatory bodies to set minimum quality of service standards and take measures to ensure that these are met , provided those measures do n't create barriers with the internal EU market .
Any measures must also " ensure that the ability of users to access or distribute lawful content or to run lawful applications and services of their choice is not unreasonably restricted . "
LQN has apparently decided that any quality of service measures must mean filtering ( termed " treacherous computing " ) , and that the ability to identify lawful applications will mean that any P2P applications , including Skype , might be deemed " unlawful . "
Another provision states that EU members cannot set requirements for equipment to include copyright infringement snooping technology , as that could impede the equipment 's use uniformly throughout the Union , although it notes an existing mechanism for dealing with these market issues .
Apparently , the mere act of noting that mechanism opens the door to packet snooping and the " Soviet Internet . "
A final amendment limits IP traffic processing to whatever is needed to ensure network security , which seems to be directed towards allowing network providers to control malware and botnets ; instead , this is deemed more " treacherous computing , " with a goal of blocking DRM circumvention .
Clearly , some of the phrasing of the amendments is designed to suggest to content owners that the European Parliament is taking their concerns seriously .
But the language is very ambiguous and needs to be read with a specific ( and unusual ) bias in order to be viewed as actually trying to implement policies to help them .
Which is precisely its point .
The type of phrasing used by this legislation typifies a technique used on both sides of the Atlantic : use code words that signal certain constituencies ( say , the content industry ) that you care about them .
The language is generally meaningless when actually implemented and enforced , however , meaning that legislators to use it as cover without fear of actual ramifications .
It would clearly be preferable if this tactical posturing did not take place , but it makes little sense to suggest that the sky is falling when it does .
It makes even less sense to accord these accusations uncritical coverage .
The two MEPs who authored most of the amendments in question are English ; in a statement given to constituents , the two men seemed frustrated with the current rhetoric and said that they " would like to highlight that their amendments reinforce the openness of the Internet and they have ensured that consumers ’ rights are respected , with copyright issues being restricted to public service information only . "
With the bill 's amendments now in place , the complete package will be voted on by MEPs in September .
There were several changes of the guard at CD as we entered our third decade and with them a decidedly more diverse content .
More than ever before our collective was drawn from activists in various popular movements .
But the new diversity arose from more than the changing composition of the collective .
It also arose from our awareness that political consciousness - how people become involved in political action - is very complex and stems from a variety of experiences .
People ’s consciousness of their racial oppression or their sexual oppression , of the exploitation and degradation of nature , or of military or economic domination of the weak by the powerful - any of these may be as key a politicizing factor as their class exploitation .
So without sacrificing any of our other themes .
clusters of articles with titles less likely to be found in earlier issues began appearing with regularity .
Titles like : “ Manufacturing Madness ” ( Don Weitz ) , “ Heterosexuality - a Challenge to the Left ” ( Marian Valverde ) , “ Rooting Out Male Violence ” ( editorial ) , The Trials of Harry Kopyto ” ( Marion Cohen ) , “ Surrogate Motherhood ” ( Marsha Hewitt ) ) , “ Is the Food Industry Killing Us ? ” ( Chernomas ) , “ The Left and Gay Liberation ” ( Tim McCaskell ) , “ REAL Women : Really Dangerous ” ( Karen Dubinsky ) , “ AIDS and the Crisis of Sexuality ” ( Jackie Larkin ) , “ Why Women Smoke ” ( Charlene Toews ) , “ Growing Old ” ( Ustun Reinart ) , “ With God on Our Side ” ( Editorial ) , “ Goon Masculinity ” ( Bruce Kidd ) , “ Battered Wife Syndrome ( Elizabeth Comack ) , “ No Good Cops At OKA ” ( Editorial ) , “ Contradictions of Sustainable Development ” ( Brewster Kneen ) , “ The Politics of Greenpeace ” ( Bruce Livesay ) , “ A Politics of Intimate Life ” ( Roberta Hamilton ) .
Many of these and other articles stemmed from a commitment of the CD collective back in 1983 to devote more space to the politics of the popular movements - women , aboriginal , environmental , peace , faith communities , etc .
In our editorial statement of September , 1983 , we outlined some principles that would govern the editorial direction of the magazine for several years .
The lives of many people , not all of them workers , are shaped by the disadvantages they experience on the basis of their origins , skin colour , sex , nationality , language , sexual orientation .
Focusing on the lives of people in their workplaces while ignoring other parts of their lives and the communities they relate to needs to be corrected .
The Left and the labour movement should be taking up the concerns of all who face oppression and building alliances with popular movements .
Our vision of socialism and our politics must incorporate the insights of feminism .
Feminism challenges the separation of the private from the political - for individuals but also for movement organizations .
It proves the possibility of collective action around private areas of life once considered personal and unchangeable - like childcare , sex education , abortion , violence and abuse .
It also poses a critique and offers alternative methods of organization and doing politics , insisting on living aspects of our future vision in our present .
Popular movements and coalitions , as important as they are , are not substitutes for a socialist party that alone can link up the struggles against exploitation and oppression , build new visions of a socialist future , and develop projects and strategies for mass mobilization .
While none of this was entirely new for CD , the change in accent was immediately obvious .
It was reflected in our choice of regular columns , a feature that stems from this time - columns like Living Our Politics , Half the Sky … and Then Some , Personal / Political , Green Web .
And it ’s interesting that many of the articles that proved to be the most controversial among our readers were ones that related to personal / political issues .
In the nineties we added community action to the CD menu .
Of course , CD never stopped discussing the more traditional issues of class , workplace , unions , Quebec sovereignty , economy and parties .
In fact , some of our most useful issues in the last 20 years were those focusing on moments of intense class confrontation : BC Solidarity ( March 1984 issue ) , The Anti-Free Trade Campaign ( 1989 , various issues ) , Ontario ’s Days of Action ( 1996 , 1997 , various issues ) , Queens Park Riot ( Sept / Oct 2000 ) and Quebec City ( May / June 2001 and July / August 2001 ) .
The Labour Beat
Geoff Bickerton ’s CD column is widely recognized as this country ’s most informed and insightful commentary on Canada ’s labour movement .
Begun in 1987 , it has appeared continuously for 16 years and is read with much anticipation by labour activists from every sector .
In many respects , Geoff ’s column continues in the tradition of Ed Finn who wrote often on labour matters in Dimension ’s earlier years .
Besides analyzing the internal life of the labour movement - its history , strategies and struggles , Dimension has been no less concerned with the plight of unorganized workers , with labour legislation and labour standards and most particularly with how capital organizes and re-organizes the workplace to extract more profit from its workers .
Besides Geoff Bickerton , there have been numerous other regular contributors on these subjects .
Assembly - line worker turned academic , Don Wells , union researchers Sam Gindin , Marvin Gandall , Gil Levine and John Calvert , Osgood Hall Law School ’s Judy Fudge and Harry Glasbeek , historians Bryan Palmer , David Frank , James Naylor and Craig Heron , labour studies professor Charlotte Yates , health and safety activist Stan Gray , rank - and - file worker Marion Pollock , academics Pauline Villaincourt , Leo Panitch and Donald Swartz - all have contributed frequently and insightfully on issues related to the workplace , working class history , government legislation and the dynamics of Canada ’s and Quebec ’s labour movement .
Covering Indian Country
In recent years , the Canadian media has recognized that Canada ’s colonized First Nations peoples are this country ’s most exploited and oppressed - something long known by Dimension readers .
Back in the 1980s , Chief Moses Okimaw contributed the award winning “ God ’s River and the Manitoba Government Great Expectation Meets the Prodigal Son ” .
Regina researcher Ron Boureault wrote about “ Canadian Indians - the South African Connection ” and “ The KIlling of Leo LaChance ” .
Journalist Ustun Reinart told the stories about the murder of Helen Betty Osborne , Winnipeg ’s Indigenous Women ’s Collective and about how Winnipeg ’s native peoples were taking over child care .
Prison reform advocate Ruth Morris wrote about “ Native People in the Canadian Justice System ” and Dimension ’s Fred Gudmunson revealed the exploitative relationship between “ Exxon and the Dene ” .
Our collective wrote an editorial -“ Native Education : Paid in Advance ; Paid in Full ” .
In the 1990s , the CD collective wrote editorials on “ Reflections on Oka ” and “ The Year Before Columbus ” ( 1991 being the 500th anniversary of Columbus ’s voyage to the ŒNew World ’. ) .
Lori Foster and Dave Broad wrote about “ Innu Rights , World Peace and the Environment ” .
Historian Tony
Hall contributed several articles including “ Who Killed Dudley George - Reflections on Ipperwash and Gustafson Lake ” and “ The Politics of Aboriginality ” .
I interviewed Milton Born With A Tooth and wrote “ Save the Oldman River ” .

Collective Work
Until 2000 , the CD collective was based entirely in Winnipeg .
We have met evenings every two weeks for over a quarter of a century .
Through most of that time the work of soliciting and editing articles was divided up among collective members according to section .
In the early 80s , for instance , John Loxley took responsibility for “ the world ” section , Jim Silver “ the nation ” .
I did “ labour ” .
Tanya Lester and later Brenda Austin Smith did poetry ; Don Sullivan did “ environment ” .
Copy deadline meetings seemed interminable as each of us fought for space for “ our ” section articles .
Then , once all the compromises and trades were apparently completed , the copyediting would proceed .
More often than not , however , at the post - copy deadline meeting someone , usually Jim Silver , the most zealous and tireless pursuer of articles in the history of Dimension , would come up with a new article that demanded consideration .
During his time as editor of “ the nation ” , Jim was likely responsible for at least half the articles that finally appeared in the magazine !
Editorials were a joint effort .
An evening was set aside to discuss possible editorial content .
Once a topic was agreed upon , we discussed various approaches and one member volunteered or was cajoled to write a first draft .
Discussion of that draft at a subsequent meeting could be quite brutal for weak egos .
In the final stage , the author or someone else , made the changes agreed upon and whatever further smoothing out was necessary .
There were years when the size of the collective was particularly large , numbering a dozen or more - far more than what a small magazine could effectively use .
As chair , JIm Silver , followed by Paul Graham , did their best to develop a healthy process , but meetings could be quite fractious , resulting in hard feelings that sometimes took years to overcome .
Paul Graham and Jim Silver both served fifteen years on the collective ( 1983 - 1998 ) .
While Jim often played the role of catalyst in discussions about the political direction of the magazine as well as relentlessly pursuing authors in every corner of the country , Paul served as the business brain behind Dimension .
During his tenure , the Canadian Magazine and Periodicals Association said we were the best - managed little magazine in the country .
Paul was a jack - of - all trades .
At one time or another he was managing editor , designer and Doctor Dimension , the author of the This Dimension column that appears on the inside front cover .
Henry Heller is the other long - time collective member .
Henry joined us in 1988 and , with his encyclopedic mind , historical perspective and steadying influence on the rest of us , he remains an invaluable collective member .
When the collective went electronic , using the Internet to gather editorial collective members from all over the country , the work of our Winnipeg collective was trimmed down some .
A lot of the editorial work , including the planning of issues and the writing of editorials could be done over the Internet .
Our meetings in the Emma Goldman Centre atop the Mondragon Cafe / Bookstore are shorter and less raucous now .
Neo -Liberal Era
Dimension was among the first publications to analyze the crumbling of “ the golden age of capitalism ” and the early efforts by the Trudeau - led Canadian state to contend with the coming crisis - wage controls , extreme monetarism , back to work legislation .
These were of course followed by Mulroney ’s full scale adoption of neo-liberalism including de-regulation , privatization and free trade along with extensive cost - cutting restructuring measures occurring in both the corporate and public sectors .
Dimension opened up several lines of discussion and debate on how best to resist these aggressive policies .
The most illuminating of these lay in how to respond to the coming of free trade .
( See sidebar page 27 ) .
In a fall 1993 editorial - “ Confront Capital or Kill the Dream ” , Dimension made an interesting prediction about the future of left - wing opposition :
We may be approaching the limits - not only of social democracy - but also of common forms of left - wing political protest .
Mass movements are being pushed , by necessity , to become more creative , more imaginative , more gutsy .
The results will almost certainly include increased civil disobedience and extra-legal forms of political dissent as unemployment and hopelessness continue to rise .
Whatever new politics might emerge , its guiding principle has to be this : capital must be confronted .
We must understand this reality or fold in our tents .
To back down in the face of capital ’s immense power , as did Bob Rae over public auto insurance and the deficit , is to kill the dream .
Dimension ’s Project
I suppose that for me , among many others goals , helping to build the socialist movement has always been Canadian Dimension ’s single largest project .
Not from the very beginning perhaps - CD was no red diaper baby - but almost from birth .
I personally was very much a product of the New Left , and fully agreed with the pre-eminence it gave to participatory democracy and to the extension of democratic processes throughout all levels of the state , the workplace and civil society .
I think that Dimension always displayed a liberatory quality .
For me again , the absence of participatory democracy was a key reason for rejecting both social democracy and Soviet - style socialism .
From the early 1970s some difficult personal experiences convinced many of us that the NDP could never be re-made into a socialist party , that its project was not an anti-capitalist one ( taking capital and power away from capital ) and never could be .
Various intellectuals , CD editors among them , began to use Dimension as a vehicle to explore what a socialist party might look like .
Looking back at several contributions over a nearly 25 year period - from our editorial statement in June 1979 ” A New Dimension ” to Leo Panitch ’s article in the September / October 2003 edition - what is interesting is the consistency of the core values and vision , a rich blend of the traditional and the contemporary .
It ’s difficult to gauge what resulted from this intellectual work in Dimension and elsewhere .
The essays , articles and editorial statements did not occur in a vacuum .
Each had its own history and context .
No doubt they exercised a cumulative effect and exerted some influence on the thinking of some individuals .
But despite our good work , in the minds of the vast majority of people , young and old , socialism means vanishing smokestack industries , the failed regime of the USSR , big bureaucratic government and state control over everything .
In any event , these were not welcoming times for socialist talk , even a new and liberatory socialism that was beginning to absorb the contributions of feminism and ecology .
I began an article I wrote in 1994 saying that “ at some point it will be necessary to address the fact that the socialist project which has been so vitally important to many of us , guiding how we viewed the people and the world around us and inspiring so much of what we have done in our lives - is today all but dead . ”
Unfortunately , that is largely still the case - at least in North America and Europe .
Yet , something big has been happening .
Socialism is still all but dead , but many within the new generation of anti-globalization and anti-war activists are beginning to identify themselves as anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist .
This is a huge change and a huge development .
It represents an understanding of the systemic source of exploitation and war on an entirely higher level than what occurred in the movements to oppose the war against Vietnam .
That ’s why , when Sam Gindin first proposed a new project of a structured movement against capitalism , something less than a party but more than a coalition , it struck a chord where previous proposals fell flat .
The proposal was strikingly similar to one CD published in 1984 by Leo Panitch ( “ Need for a New Socialist Movement ” ) .
But whereas Leo ’s excellent article generated no response , much the same argument posed fifteen years later stimulated a widespread discussion in CD and some attempts at forming new political groupings that are still ongoing .
And it was out of a discussion within the Structured Movement Against Capitalism ( SMAC ) group in Winnipeg that the concept of multi-national popular sovereignty first emerged .
Its exposure in CD generated a lively debate and has been taken up in circles beyond CD .
Over the past few years , thanks in large part to the prolific writings of CD collective members Jim Petras and Sam Gindin , Canadian Dimension has re-established its place as the pre-eminent source for discussion and debate about American imperialism and Canada ’s place within it .
As the pressure grows for deeper and deeper continental integration - despite the dismal performance of our economy since the free trade era began - Canada , along with all the other states in the U.S. Empire , will become an arena of struggle .
Dimension will be part of that struggle .

The latest surge in the spot price of crude oil ( to US $ 139 a barrel — 87.4 cents a litre ) dramatises the urgent need for society to wean itself off “ black gold ” .
The longer we remain hooked the greater the devastation both to our environment and to the living standards of billions , especially the poorest peoples of the planet .
The challenge is huge .
The response must combine defence against the threat to livelihoods from price rises with a plan to restructure economies and ways of living so that oil - intensive production and transport becomes a thing of the past .
Many pro-market commentators — and not a few environmentalists — welcome the latest oil price hike ( which means the real price of has risen 400 % in the last six years , greater than in 1970s oil crises ) as bringing us closer to that goal .
They bemoan the “ cheap populism ” of the Australian opposition parties ' proposed five cents a litre cut in petrol excise and the Australian federal Labor government 's FuelWatch scheme .
The Australian Financial Review 's economics editor Alan Mitchell says : “ What our leaders should be telling voters is that the price of petrol has nowhere to go but up , and that they should take that into account when they buy their next car and make their next decision about where to live . ”
And what about those billions of consumers of fossil fuels whose lives are n't focused on getting out of a gas - guzzling 4WD and into a Toyota Prius ?
Can the urban poor of Jakarta react to the Indonesian government 's planned 28.7 % increase in fuel prices by switching to solar panels ?
How should the Yorkshire fisherperson whose weekly fuel bill has gone from $ 4000 to more than $ 9000 in the space of a year respond to this “ price signal ” ?
What should be done about the $ 700 a year increase in the average Australian family budget that recent petrol price rises are reckoned to bring ?
Defending living standards
The most immediate challenge the oil price surge creates is how to stop the burden of the crisis being placed on the shoulders of working people and the poor .
But defence of people 's livelihoods is also critical to make sure that the shift out of fossil - fuel dependent energy wins the mass social support it will need if it is actually to happen .
Here those environmentalists who think that increases in oil prices are to be welcomed because they are producing a ( still minor ) shift into diesel and hybrid cars and public transport are dangerously deceived .
If the movement against global warming does n't propose its own treatment for the pain of oil price hikes , it abandons the field to the neoliberals and even worse anti-environmental political rogues .
Take , as a warning sign , the recent demise at the polls of London mayor Ken Livingston , who with the best intentions in the world introduced parking fees in the inner city , but without sufficient improvements in public transport to reduce people 's car and petrol dependence .
Here it 's important to grasp is that it's not true in the short term that the retail price of petrol “ has nowhere to go but up ” .
And that 's not just because the latest oil price hike contains a big speculative bubble that will burst sooner or later .
It 's because there 's a huge difference between the cost of extraction of crude oil and the final retail price of petrol .
In between come the profits of the oil corporations , the wholesalers ( often the same companies ) , the shippers and government taxes .
Start with the cost of oil extraction .
According to the Bank of Kuwait crude oil at US$ 100 a barrel yields the following astronomical rates of profit , which are based on the production cost of a litre ( given here in brackets ) : Kuwait 488 % ( 11 cents ) ; United Arab Emirates 300 % ( 16 cents ) ; Saudi Arabia and Qatar 233 % ( 19 cents ) ; Canadian oil sands 203 % ( 21 cents ) ; and Bahrain and Oman 150 % ( 25 cents ) .
Next along the chain comes refining .
According to the December 2007 Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) report Petrol Prices and Australian Consumers , “ the major refiners have established a comfortable oligopoly ” which conducts a “ policy of pricing locally refined petrol on the basis [ of ] an imported equivalent product rather than the actual cost of domestic refining or even the actual cost of imports . ”
The ACCC calculated that when unleaded petrol retailed for 121.6 Australian cents a litre in 2007 this suspect " import parity price " was 56.1 cents , the refiner margin 3.7 cents , the wholesale margin 8.1 cents , government taxes ( petroleum excise and wholesale and retail GST ) 49.2 cents and the retail margin 4.4 cents .
These figures make nonsense of Australian Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's claim that the federal government has done everything “ physically possible ” to contain oil price increases .
A government that was concerned to confront the impact of such surges could :
Set a maximum retail price and adjust fuel excise and consumption tax rates accordingly ( presently being considered by the Italian , Spanish and French governments ) .
Set limits to retail price movements and the various margins ( refiner , wholesale and retail ) .
In June 2007 , the refiner margin in Australia jumped to over 12 cents , provoking the ACCC inquiry .
Regulation along these lines has been introduced in Belgium and is presently being pushed in the Portuguese parliament by the Left Bloc .
According to Left Bloc spokesperson and economist Francisco Louça , simple anti-speculative rules like these could cut prices at the pump between 10 and 14 cents a litre .
Nationalise the oil corporations
Nonetheless , in today 's world of long - run rising oil extraction costs these sorts of measures will only bring temporary relief given the ever - present likelihood of a long - run shortfall in supply and as long as the industry remains profit - driven and in private hands .
Seriously tackling the impact of oil prices on living standards will require the nationalisation of big oil ( in Australia Shell , Mobil , Caltex and BP ) .
This is not just the only way to know the true accounts of the oil corporations ( which the ACCC was never sure it had in its hands ) .
Nationalisation of big oil is also critical to carrying out the program for energy sustainability that will have eliminating oil dependence at its core .
The movement against global warming needs to fight for the nationalisation of big oil for exactly the same reasons that it fights the privatisation of carbon - intensive electricity generation in New South Wales — without public ownership of the commanding heights of energy production the capacity to plan the rapid transition to renewable technologies disappears .
It is also the only framework in which a right price for oil - based products can be found — not so low as to provide no incentive to reduce consumption , and not so high as to undermine the livelihoods of workers , family farmers , the self - employed and people on welfare .
In November 2006 , the world price of crude was 38 US cents a litre and retail prices ranged from Venezuela 's three cents a litre ( i.e. , involving a subsidy of 35 cents a litre ) to Iceland 's 186 cents a litre ( with the highest fuel taxes in the world ) .
On January 21 , 2007 , Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez told the audience of his weekly TV program Aló Presidente that the price of petrol was far too low .
“ We have n’t touched the price of petrol for eight years .
It ’s really gross to sell petrol the way we ’ve been selling it , it would be better to give it away . ”
Our case in Australia is the complete opposite .
Confronted with a federal government determined to do practically nothing about soaring petrol and food prices the trade union movement must demand full compensation for the increases in the cost of living they produce .
Indeed , the oil price surge is a sharp reminder of the need for full indexation of wages and welfare payments , a position that the trade union movement should never have abandoned .
As the world economy again faces a 1970s prospect of " stagflation " ( rising unemployment and inflation ) and the central banks move to make working people -- especially those with mortgage debt -- pay the price of controlling the price level , the Australian trade union movement cannot defend working people if it maintains support for the Reserve Bank 's inflation - targetting regime .
There ’s only one solution to the oil price crisis : the union and environment movements must fight side by side against the devastation the Shells , BPs and Exxons are wreaking on our planet and the livelihoods of its peoples .

For the past century at least , global temperatures have tended to mirror the 20 - to 30 - year warmings and coolings of the north - central Pacific Ocean .
We do n’t know just why , but the pattern of the last century is clear : the earth warmed from about 1915 to1940 , while the PDO was also warming ( 1925 to 46 ) .
The earth cooled from 1940 to 1975 , while the PDO was cooling ( 1946 to 1977 ) .
The strong global warming from 1976 to 1998 was accompanied by a strong and almost - constant warming of the north - central Pacific .
Ancient tree rings in Baja California and Mexico show there have been 11 such PDO shifts since 1650 , averaging 23 years on length .
Researchers discovered the PDO only recently — in 1996 — while searching for the reason salmon numbers had declined sharply in the Columbia River after 1977 .
The salmon catch record for the past 100 years gave the answer — shifting Pacific Ocean currents .
The PDO favors the salmon from the Columbia for about 25 years at a time , and then the salmon from the Gulf of Alaska , but the two fisheries never thrive at the same time .
Something in the PDO favors the early development of the salmon smolts from one region or the other .
Other fish , such as halibut , sardines , and anchovies follow similar shifts in line with the PDO .
The PDO seems to be driven by the huge Aleutian Low in the Arctic — but we do n’t know what controls the Aleutian Low .
Nonetheless , 22.5 - year “ double sunspot cycles ” have been identified in South African rainfall , Indian monsoons , Australian droughts , and rains in the United States ’ far southwest as well .
These cycles argue that the sun , not CO2 , controls the earth ’s temperatures .
Dr. Henrik Svensmark ’s recent experiments at the Danish Space Research Institute seem to show that the earth ’s temperatures are importantly affected by the low , wet clouds that deflect more or less solar heat back into space .
The number of such clouds is affected , in turn , by more or fewer cosmic rays hitting the earth .
The number of earthbound cosmic rays depends on the extent of the giant magnetic wind thrown out by the sun .
All of this defies the “ consensus ” that human - emitted carbon dioxide has been responsible for our global warming .
But the evidence for man-made warming has never been as strong as its Green advocates maintained .
The earth ’s warming from 1915 to 1940 was just about as strong as the “ scary ” 1975 to 1998 warming in both scope and duration — and occurred too early to be blamed on human - emitted CO2 .
The cooling from 1940 to 1975 defied the Greenhouse Theory , occurring during the first big surge of man-made greenhouse emissions .
Most recently , the climate has stubbornly refused to warm since 1998 , even though human CO2 emissions have continued to rise strongly .
The Jason satellite is an updated and more - accurate version of the Poseidon satellite that has been monitoring the oceans since 1992 , picking up ocean wind speeds , wave heights , and sea level changes .
Jason is run by NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a French team .
How many years of declining world temperature would it take now — in the wake of the ten - year non-warming since 1998 — to break up Al Gore ’s “ climate change consensus ” ?

A voter initiative to reinstate a ban on same - sex marriage will remain on the November ballot , the California Supreme Court decided unanimously Wednesday .
The court issued a brief order rejecting arguments that the initiative , Proposition 8 , was an illegal constitutional revision and that voters had been misled when they signed petitions to put it on the ballot .
The decision , reached in closed session during the court ’s weekly conference , cleared the way for what some observers expect to be a close vote on the marriage measure .
The signatures for the initiative had already been gathered when the California Supreme Court decided 4 to 3 in May to strike down a state ban on same - sex marriage .
Same sex couples began marrying in California last month .
Gay rights groups issued a statement Wednesday expressing disappointment with the court ’s decision .

“ Californians do not want their Constitution to single out people to be treated differently , ” said the statement from Lambda Legal , the National Center for Lesbian Rights , Marriage Equality and the American Civil Liberties Union .
“ We are confident they will vote no in November to make sure everyone is treated equally under the law . ”
Mathew D. Staver , founder of Liberty Counsel and dean of Liberty University School of Law , said he was confident that the measure would pass .
“ If the people have an opportunity to participate in the democratic process , they will vote for marriage as one man and one woman , ” said Staver , whose group litigates on behalf of Christian causes .
“ Those who push for same - sex marriage are willing to destroy both marriage and democracy to achieve a selfish result , ” he said .

Another Christian group , the Alliance Defense Fund , called the court ’s decision “ appropriate . ”
Supporters of same - sex marriage “ were desperate to evade the democratic process , ” said Brian Raum , senior legal counsel for the fund .
“ We ’re pleased the court did not allow them to silence the people ’s voice this November . ”
If approved by voters , Proposition 8 , called the “ California Marriage Protection Act , ” would add a provision to the state Constitution that says , “ Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in California . ”
The Campaign for Children and Families , which opposes same - sex marriage , said it was celebrating the court ’s decision .

“ This is great news , and not unexpected in light of the homosexual activists ’ undemocratic , intolerant and extraordinary attack upon the voters ’ right to vote , ” said Randy Thomasson , the group ’s president .
“ Fortunately , activist judges are more used to inventing new ‘ laws ’ out of thin air than striking voter - qualified initiatives from the ballot . ”
After Wednesday ’s decision , Kevin Norte , a lawyer who helped inspire one of the legal arguments for removing the ballot initiative , sent friends a note asking that in lieu of a wedding gift they donate to a campaign to defeat the initiative .
Kevin and his longtime partner , Don Norte , went to Tiffany ’s for wedding rings on the day the court overturned the marriage ban .
They plan to exchange vows this week .
“ I am getting personal because I will do almost anything to save my marriage , ” wrote Norte , a Republican .
“ Would n’t you ?

At least six people are dead and more than 140 injured after a powerful earthquake struck northern Japan , triggering landslides .
The 7.2 - magnitude quake was centred on Iwate - a rural mountainous region on Japan 's main island , Honshu .
Military helicopters are taking in supplies and flying the injured to hospitals .
A landslide at a hot spring reportedly buried seven people .
And a small amount of radioactive water was leaked at a nuclear power station .
But officials said there was no danger to the public from the minor spillage at the facility in Fukushima .
Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said : " Our most important task is to save as many lives as possible , and we are doing the best we can . "
Advance warning
Rescuers are scrambling to reach seven people buried by a landslide that engulfed a hot spring resort in Komanoyu .
A construction worker died after being hit by falling rock at a dam and a man hit by a lorry after running out of a building during the tremors was also killed .
Landslides claimed the lives of two more construction workers in Kurihara and killed one more person in Iwaki .
Another body was reportedly found in a smashed vehicle in the mountains .
All high - speed bullet trains in the area were automatically shut down .
Seismologists had issued advance warning of the earthquake - which was followed by more than 150 aftershocks - moments before it struck around 0845 ( 2343 GMT on Friday ) .
Footage from NHK television showed surveillance cameras in the city of Sendai being shaken violently for about 30 seconds .
Japan is one of the world 's most earthquake - prone countries and experiences thousands of minor tremors each year .
An earthquake last year in central Japan caused a small radioactive leak from the Kashiwazaki - Kariwa nuclear plant .

A shopper wants to buy some cheese , but he must decide between the 197 varieties on offer .
Conventional wisdom says that such a huge choice makes it more likely he 'll make a purchase .
But that does n't take into account human unpredictability , according to the new discipline of behavioural economics .
Aditya Chakrabortty reports
The Sainsbury 's on London 's Cromwell Road is hardly a superstore , yet it stocks 197 varieties of cheese ( plus another 27 diet versions ) , 42 types and sizes of bottled water , and enough sub -species of tomato to perplex a pizzeria .
It is , in short , a slalom course of options and decisions , of a sort we face every day - from picking gas suppliers to taking out a mortgage .
The question is : do we always choose what is right for us ?
No , argues Dan Ariely , one of an increasingly influential group of behavioural economists , who analyse how people behave everywhere from supermarkets to stock markets - and they have found a chasm between what traditional economists and regulators presume we do , and what really happens .
One of the most exciting areas of research , behavioural economics could overturn many of the assumptions and assertions that shape modern policy - making .
Ariely presents his case , as is the behaviouralist way , based on evidence from real life , such as Sainsbury 's .
Instead of algebra , he uses shopping trolleys ; in place of textbooks , he refers to shelf prices .
And to attack the cliche that people always want more choice , he deploys ... jam .
" Economists know all about choosing jam , " he says , ambling down an aisle with 73 varieties .
He describes an experiment where academics set up a tasting booth in a store in California .
On some days they put out six kinds of jam , on others 24 .
When the booth had 24 types , it was mobbed - " there was more colour , more excitement " .
But it was the sales that were truly remarkable : with six jams on show , 30 % of customers bought a jar ; when 24 were out , only 3 % did .
" Jams are hardly complex things , but people saw 24 stacked together and thought : ' I have no idea how to deal with this . ' "
If that is how choosing between strawberry or plum makes us feel , imagine the toll looking at mortgage options takes on the nerves .
What Ariely 's jam study suggests is that , contrary to economic belief that more choice is better , confronted with too much complexity , we make bad decisions , or stick with what we have already got .
An example of that kind of inertia is right behind him .
Three Chinese - origin boys are motoring down the aisle , their trolley stacked high with cheese - and - tomato spaghetti ready meals .
They are engineering students .
" Did your parents teach you this was good to eat ? " asks Ariely .
" No , " they chorus .
" There must be other things you could have .
Of all the instant foods available in the UK , the only option you like is cheese - and - tomato spaghetti value meals ? "
There is no reply , only nervous giggling .
It 's evidently hard work being grilled by an intense academic in red trainers .
" They have habits ! " he beams .
Orthodox economists do n't recognise habits .
" They assume ordinary people do a constant cost - benefit analysis on everything they do .
But actually , after you reach a decision , you say , ' That 's the end of it !' - and just continue . "
Which is one reason why more competitors entering an industry does not immediately prompt customers to swap .
Jams , ready meals and a large dollop of human psychology : no wonder these behaviouralist upstarts have come in for some sniffiness from the academic old guard .
Most British students still graduate without ever coming across the field .
Which is a shame , because a lot of behaviouralism sounds like an extended freshers ' week : in the name of research , Ariely has served beer laced with vinegar , and persuaded Berkeley undergraduates to masturbate while filling in questionnaires on laptops ( wrapped in protective film , naturally ) .
Despite such antics , behavioural economics has already produced one Nobel prize winner ( Daniel Kahneman in 2002 ) , and is winning over politicians too .
While he was a professor at the University of Chicago , Barack Obama befriended two of that campus 's most eminent behaviouralists , Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler .
They are now informal advisers to the Democrat hopeful - and their fingerprints are all over his policies .
Britain is also starting to cotton on .
Just before Christmas , the UK's chief consumer watchdog , the Office of Fair Trading , launched a behavioural economics unit - and in March the National Audit Office called for more government agencies to apply the discipline 's findings .
If these are the field 's pioneers and politicos , Ariely is its populariser .
A professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , his book , Predictably Irrational , clearly sets out the behaviouralists ' argument that average people are all far more irrational and more human than economists allow .
His lectures are one of the wonders of modern academia ; coming on like Jackie Mason with a PowerPoint presentation , he machine - guns through a stream of jokes , optical illusions and a video of a child in a gorilla suit .
A few weeks ago , he did the routine at the London School of Economics , and prompted that rare thing in a lecture hall , a stage invasion .
Impartial observers swore that they had never seen such excitement among the normally mild - mannered students of portfolio theory .
Back in the supermarket , Ariely is explaining the complications in that most elementary of tasks : evaluating how much to pay for something .
" In standard economics , that should be your most immediate thought : how much pleasure is this giving me , and what would I pay for it ?
Setting that price should come automatically .
But in reality it 's very hard to do . "
As if on cue , a blonde woman sails by with a trolley - load of Actimel .
" How much would you pay for this ? " he asks .
" Well , I object to paying £ 4.50 .
It used to be £ 4 , " she says .
" In the States it costs $ 20 .
Would you pay that much there ? "
" I suppose so .
I 'm rather hooked . "
Another point scored against conventional economics .
" First the woman moaned about paying more than £ 4 , then she agreed to pay $ 20 - £ 10 ! "
Does n't that just prove she 's very fond of yoghurt ?
" We all do it ... A standard economist would say that , by definition , every shopper is making the best decision they can .
But consumers do n't set their own prices from scratch , they 're guided by the recommended retail price , or the manufacturer 's suggested price - even discounts are set by the shops . "
Take the word beloved by shoppers everywhere : free .
The very term would normally set an economist 's teeth on edge ; Milton Friedman , after all , always denied there was such a thing as a free lunch .
But like the marketing departments , behavioural economists acknowledge the power of the word .
" When you see something for free - for FREE ! - it 's like pressing a magic button .
You forget about any possible downside and just think :
Oh my God , it 's all good ! "
Ariely has been suckered himself .
Not so long ago , he went to buy a people carrier to ferry around his family .
Next to the dealership was an Audi showroom , offering free - sorry , FREE ! - oil changes for new customers .
You can guess the next bit : he came home with a sports car too small for anything but posing .
" I chose the wrong car because of an oil change worth $ 150 . "
The Audi cost $ 30,000 .
Do mainstream economists really approach shopping and life with such clear and cold eyes ?
Listen to the story of Oz Brownlee , late professor at the University of Minnesota .
One Friday , he and a colleague stopped to buy some steaks .
Finding a long queue , they offered cash to the person in front to swap places .
The shopper was dumbstruck - which the academics took as a bargaining ploy , so they raised the price .
As news spread down the line , other customers turned hostile .
The Minnesota department of economics alumni newsletter goes on : " Attempts to explain that they were ... trying to ascertain whether there was a mutually beneficial trade of time for money that might improve their welfare and that of the next person in line without disadvantaging others met with little success . "
The economists left without any steak .
Brownlee 's mistake was to put into practice something that worked only in theory .
That , Ariely and other critics say , is the point : conventional economics tries to make the man fit the model , rather than the other way around .
It was n't always like this : Adam Smith had his theory of moral sentiments , and Keynes discussed the " animal spirits " of share investors .
But as neoclassical economics gained ground , maths replaced psychology .
And the human quirks exhibited in everyday practices , from buying chocolate to taking out insurance , were lost .
Neoclassical economists even use their own ideal human in their modelling , called Homo economicus , or rational man .
Not so much a straw man as an Excel man , he is a basic creature , says Pete Lunn , a Dublin - based behaviouralist .
" Economists treat all people as selfish ; as independent ; as rational .
Those are the assumptions that underpin economics . "
Dons debate them at high table , but in Whitehall these beliefs might as well be carved in stone .
And the result is some daft policies .
Take the opening - up of the directory inquiries market in 2003 , when the 192 service was replaced with hundreds of 118 - numbers .
This was conventional economics in action : give the customer plenty of options and information , and let them make their own way .
The result was a jump in prices , a spike in complaints - and what regulators now admit was a shambles .
How might behavioural economics have helped ?
Well , the jams experiment would have proved to officials that too many options only bamboozle people .
And civil servants meeting the Actimel guzzler would have seen first - hand our wobbly grip on what constitutes a fair price .
Yet mainstream economics often works .
The British tax petrol far more than the Americans , for instance , which is an incentive not to consume as much petrol .
And indeed , the cars on our motorways are more fuel - efficient than the ones on their interstates .
Is n't Ariely a bit harsh on orthodox economists ?
They are after the bigger picture , the Olympian perspective , and from up there , individual quirks blend into one smoothly functioning economy .
" That would be true if we all made mistakes in lots of different ways , which would cancel each other out , " he says .
" But if we all make similar mistakes , there is something systematically wrong .
And that is often what really happens . "
Which accounts for the turmoil in stock markets ?
" We all get too afraid of what 's happening and we feed on each others ' fears .
The stock market is exaggerating this widespread fear . "
So our irrational behaviour is not confined to the chiller cabinets but spills over into the financial markets .
It 's time to leave the supermarket and meet Anna Sofat , a seasoned financial adviser .
The professor wants guidance on what to do if he had a windfall of £ 3.5 m and moved to London .
Hmmm .
There is obviously a lot riding on his new book .
Sofat asks about risk .
How does the economist feel about it ?
" Money : I do n't know - I 've never had much .
On holidays , I am very adventurous .
Sex : somewhere in the middle . "
There 's a pause .
Rather a long one .
" OK , how should I invest my lump sum ? " asks Ariely .
A plan is sketched out : put some in cash , the rest in bonds and property .
Expertly done , but it does not answer the economist 's implicit question : how can a neat investment plan suit anyone with the variety of attitudes and appetites displayed by Ariely - and , indeed , most of us ?
Later , the academic is sceptical : " Money and risk are abstract , complex things .
But think how quickly she made plans for me to spend my lifetime income .
I 'd spend the same amount of time planning for my retirement as I would have done on buying a new digital camera . "
So what is his solution ?
" We must be clear about what people can do and ca n't do .
We should trust them entirely on what they know , such as their priorities .
And we should completely discount what they 're saying on what they can't know - like how much they need for their retirement income . "
People cannot always figure out what is in their best interests , he thinks , and experts should accordingly give them the occasional nudge .
Our pensions system has already got there : in a few years ' time , nearly every worker will be automatically enrolled in a retirement - savings scheme , like it or not .
They can leave , but behavioural research suggests that they wo n't - out of the same inertia that prevented them taking a pension in the first place .
Push that argument a tiny bit further and you cross the thin line that separates economics from politics .
Britain has become a full - blown consumer society - one hellbent on giving people maximum choice , even when it harms them .
Industrial quantities of booze are sold as loss - leaders in supermarkets ; junk mail is full of offers for credit cards ( although they have slackened off since the advent of the financial crisis ) ; and it has never been so cheap to fly .
Choice is king , markets know best , and anyone who says different is economically illiterate .
That is the orthodoxy , anyway .
A few years ago , Ariely met senior executives at a venerable bank in Manhattan , and urged them to produce a " self - control " credit card , one that blocked excessive spending .
Guess what ?
" They never called me back , " he writes .
" It might have been that they were worried about losing the $ 17bn in interest charges . "
Evening arrives , and the professor is not going to sing for his supper so much as debate for his dinner .
He will argue about the first principles of economics at the aptly named Rules restuarant in central London .
David de Meza , head of managerial economics at the LSE , has gamely agreed to play a brutal rationalist .
Do they really see the world so differently ?
Let 's start with a nice easy one : what should the government do to stave off recession ?
Ariely thinks President Bush has already grasped one behavioural truth : " After 9/11 , Bush urged Americans to spend .
He made it a patriotic duty .
Avoiding recessions is partly about holding up confidence , so people still feel like spending . "
Confidence is hardly the issue , retorts De Meza .
" One of the features of the boom was overoptimism in spending and markets . "
So how would they have avoided the bubble that landed us in this mess in the first place ?
" Even for economists such as me , it 's incredibly difficult to compute how much borrowing is in your best interest , " says Ariely .
" So you could tell people how much they can borrow . "
" But what about entrepreneurs ? " asks De Meza .
" They borrow a lot .
Do you seriously want potential entrepreneurs to sit an exam before they get funding ? "
Academics evidently do not watch Dragons ' Den .
" What 's the big deal ?
Let 's limit people 's ability to hurt themselves in borrowing like we do with seatbelts in driving , " says Ariely .
Finally , the biggie : is tipping irrational ?
Yes , thinks Ariely - it 's just convention .
No , argues De Meza : " What you 're often paying for is nice treatment next time around . "
The manager , John , is called on to provide expert testimony .
Poor man , there is a lot at stake : his own profession 's interests , as well as serious academic inquiry .
Still , after a bit of squirming , he sides with the behaviouralists : " It is slightly irrational , I suppose , " he says .
But , of course , we leave a tip .
· This article was amended on Friday May 23 2008 .
We originally referred to the University of Chicago as Chicago University .
This has been corrected .
So today ’s article in the New York Post headlined “ Downed Satellite ” includes a one - line quote from me :
“ ‘ I do n’t think making people pay subscriber fees for content is sustainable , ’ said BlogTalkRadio CEO Alan Levy . ”
The quote elicited a somewhat harsh response from the newly - merged Sirius XM satellite radio network .
Chief Financial Officer David Frear tried to dismiss my comment by asking :
“ We generated $ 2.3 billion in revenue for the trailing 12 months , how much did BlogTalkRadio generate ?
Do they have a viable business plan ? ”
Before I respond to David ’s question regarding the viability of our business plan , let me elaborate on why I think Sirius XM is in for hard times .
Here ’s a list of obstacles I see hindering satellite radio’s growth :
• The cost of content is way too high .
Howard Stern , the $ 500 million man , is reported to have only 1.2 million listeners to his show a week .
And those are not unique listeners .
Howard has far and away the largest audience on Sirius .
( Take a look at the numbers reported just nine months ago in The Daily News . )
Notwithstanding the huge contracts awarded to Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity , I believe the days of big radio contracts are over .
• Cars are being equipped with devices that can accommodate Internet surfing .
Why subscribe to Sirius XM when passengers can access their Last. fm , Yahoo or Pandora playlists ?
There are endless choices for streaming music , all far more appealing than the choices offered by satellite radio .
• Cars are also being equipped with iPod jacks and other MP3 accessories .
• When cars can accommodate the Web , why should someone pay a subscription fee for CNN or Fox News when content can be streamed directly off those websites for free ?
• There ’s a limit to the number of channels – and , thus , content – that can be distributed on the Sirius XM network .
In July , more than 4,000 hosts produced tens of thousands of hours of programming on BlogTalkRadio .
How many hours of programming did Sirius and XM offer ?
• While I have n’t scoured Sirius and XM ’s annual reports to determine the cost of maintaining a satellite network , there ’s no doubt that a low - cost , Internet - based model for creating and distributing content is far more appealing to investors .
• We live in an on - demand TiVo world .
To date , BlogTalkRadio has produced more than 110,000 discrete shows , all of which are accessible via our network .
Audiences want to consume content when they want it and not when it ’s scheduled .
Does Sirius XM make all its content available in archives ?
Of course , what do I know ?
As Sirius XM ’s CFO asks , “ Do they have a viable business model ” ?
Let ’s see …
• Unlike satellite or traditional terrestrial radio , our costs to produce , distribute and store content is negligible .
• We have more than three million listeners per month to shows whose topics range from politics to entertainment to sports to parenting to paranormal .
Our hosts produce more than 500 live shows a day , and there is no limit on the number of shows or hosts the BlogTalkRadio radio network can accommodate .
• We aggregate programming by topic , thereby offering a far more targeted audience to our customers .
• Lastly , we license privately - branded radio networks to major companies and organizations , including the Department of Defense , Sun Microsystems , HarperCollins and Golf Magazine .
It ’s an interesting debate , and one I ’m looking forward to engaging in as it develops .

LAST time Australia 's airlines turned to other countries to recruit large numbers of pilots , the year was 1989 and they were trying to break an unprecedented strike by their own pilots .
But when Jetstar , a low - cost carrier , revealed recently that it was planning to hire more than 75 pilots from Britain , America and South Africa , it was seeking a solution to a problem facing many employers across the country : a severe shortage of skilled labour .
With an economy in its 17th year of uninterrupted growth , Australia 's skills shortage has never been worse .
People are crying out for plumbers , doctors and nurses .
In states that are booming thanks to a mining bonanza — Western Australia , Queensland and South Australia — engineers , surveyors and truck drivers are in short supply .
One state - owned water authority complains that it is losing truckers to mining companies offering A$ 100,000 ( $ 96,000 ) a year — more than double their previous salary .
In many rich countries where immigration is a politically sensitive matter — America , Britain and Ireland — the number of immigrants seems to be falling as the economy turns down .
Not in Australia .
The Labor government , under Kevin Rudd , is looking to increase the numbers of foreigners allowed to settle .
His predecessor , John Howard , the former conservative leader , had already begun to increase the number , but had to pretend otherwise , since his party claimed to put “ Australia first ” .
Mr Rudd is playing up the increases .
On May 13th his government said that Australia would take 190,300 immigrants next year , a rise of 25 % on this year .
The biggest jump comes in the proportion of those chosen for their skills in a booming economy : at 133,500 they now account for a record 70 % of the total intake .
These so - called “ permanent ” settlers tell only part of the story .
With another 100,000 arrivals expected under a short - term visa scheme that allows employers to fill urgent job vacancies from outside Australia , the total intake is likely to be closer to 300,000 .
Other changes will make still more foreigners available for work .
The government is abolishing a restriction enforced by the Howard government that meant illegal immigrants later found to be refugees could get only temporary permission to stay in Australia .
And it is thinking about letting in guest workers from Pacific Island nations — a measure used successfully in New Zealand and which Mr Howard sternly opposed .
The latest annual figures are the highest since Australia launched an immigration programme soon after the second world war .
They also signal something of a revolution in the way Australia tackles this politically charged issue .
Originally , immigration was a way to populate a big , empty country with “ ten- pound Poms ” , Britons who paid just £ 10 ( then $ 27 ) to start a new life down under .
That approach , says Chris Evans , the immigration minister , was designed for a world in which people did not move much .
Today , he argues , the country needs a policy fit for a world in which people move often for work .
He points out that 500,000 people with “ work rights ” entered Australia last year : students and holiday - makers , as well as those on work visas .
And the country still suffers skilled - labour bottlenecks .
Australia is in some respects paying a price for failing to invest in skills and infrastructure to meet the demands of what the Treasury calls a “ once - in - 50 - years boom ” .
Not long ago , the sight of a Labor government bowing to demands from bosses and opening the gates to foreign workers would have produced howls of anguish from unions .
Not now .
With unemployment at a 30 - year low , falling union membership and an ageing domestic workforce , the Rudd government can afford to be bold about using immigration as a tool of economic management .
Mr Evans says that from now on immigration will play a bigger role in the “ structure of Australia 's workforce ” .
He can probably count on Australians tolerating that — so long as the boom continues .
Police told to warn criminals before setting canines on them - in case they are FRIGHTENED or ALLERGIC to dog hair
Warning : Handlers have been told to avoid offending criminals with cynophobia - fear of dogs
Being chased by a police dog was never intended to be a pleasant experience .
But now handlers are being extra careful to avoid upsetting criminals ' sensibilities by giving them advance warning before dogs are set on them .
Forces across Britain are being instructed to ' avoid offending ' sufferers of cynophobia - the clinical name for a fear of canines - or those allergic to dog hair .
The move comes amid fears that suspects whose medical conditions are triggered by dogs may file costly compensation bills against the force which authorised their use during arrests or raids on homes .
But the proposals have met with fury by some serving officers - who branded them ' polite policing ' and ' namby pamby ' .
The plans were revealed Peter Vaughan , the Association of Chief Police Officers ' lead on dogs , who said : ' The draft guidelines outline a general principle that forces should consider what steps can be taken to avoid offending people during operations . '
Mr Vaughan , a deputy chief constable of South Wales Police , added : ' This might include different categories of people such as those with a fear of dogs , for example or asthma sufferers who may be sensitive to dog hair . '
And PC David Heaps , a dog handling trainer at Derbyshire Constabulary , added : ' We are very mindful not to cause offence . '
But a sergeant , commenting anonymously on the proposals in respected force magazine Police Review this week , insisted : ' This is more from the ' polite police '
' The whole point of police dogs is to frighten people rigid , at least those who have just committed a crime and would otherwise make a clean getaway .
' They should have considered the mental trauma and possible allergic reaction of 60 lbs of foaming Alsatian clamping its teeth to their extremities before embarking on their latest criminal escapade .
' The traditional shout of ' stand still or I will set the dog on you ' will presumably now have to become ' Excuse me , my police dog is quite hairy and might cause alarm as he sinks his fangs into your right thigh - is that all right with you ? ''
A serving dog handler , who asked not to be named , added : ' I have never heard anything so ridiculous .
' What 's next ?
Sparing people custody because they have a fear of enclosed spaces ?
' This is just another example of namby pamby policing laid down by people who have n't been on the beat in years . '
Makeshift devices appear to have been hidden in everyday items
At least 38 people have been killed and more than 100 wounded after a series of explosions struck the western Indian city of Ahmedabad , officials have said .
Seventeen blasts within an hour hit residential areas , crowded markets , a train station and a bus in Gujarat state 's commercial capital , they added .
It is thought the explosions were caused by crudely - made devices hidden in boxes and on bicycles .
On Friday a series of similar blasts hit the southern city of Bangalore .
The Ahmedabad explosions came in two waves - the first occurring over a 20 - minute period from about 1830 ( 1300 GMT ) .
There was another series of blasts shortly after .

Advertisement TV stations broadcast images of a bus with its side blown up , shattered windows and the roof half - destroyed .
Footage also showed the body of a man lying motionless on the ground next to the bus , covered in blood .
The BBC's Damian Grammaticas , in India , says the explosions appear to have been a planned and highly co-ordinated attack .
In pictures : Ahmedabad blasts
Some of the bombs in the second wave targeted the hospitals where the injured were being taken , he adds .
" We saw a blue bag near the trauma centre , and before we could react we saw it explode in a shine of blinding light , and some 40 people were hit by flying shrapnel , " doctor Vipul Patil , at the Dhanwantari Hospital , told AFP news agency .
Ahmedabad is an ethnically diverse city which has suffered from political instability in the past .
Riots broke out there in 2002 between Hindus and Muslims .
Reports suggested many of Saturday 's blasts were in the city 's crowded old quarter - a religiously - mixed area .
Analysts believe the attack may be linked to the Bangalore bombs and could be designed to whip up trouble between religious communities .
Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh has appealed for people to remain calm .
India has been hit by several waves of bombings in recent years .
Targets have ranged from mosques and Hindu temples to trains and courthouses .

Part of the enduring appeal of Batman is that he accessorizes .
He was toyetic before toyetic was even a word .
A horrible , horrible word .
In that sense , he 's much like those who fanatically follow his adventures :
He avoids the sun , dresses in a , shall we say , idiosyncratic manner , collects neat stuff and spends a lot of time on a computer looking for excuses to get into fights .
We 'll just gloss over the fact that he's in tip - top physical shape and probably does n't have the complete Buffy series on a hard drive somewhere .

This , then , is Part 2 of our look at Batman 's stuff .
We look at the Dark Knight 's various possessions , and subject them to the harsh , cold light of judgment .
Because when you do n't spend every night wiping crime from the streets like a vengeful Mr. Clean Magic Eraser , you have plenty of time to write stuff like this .
Batcave
The Batcave has aged well .
Underground bunkers never go out of style !
If anything , in this age of constant surveillance your secret base would have to be underground to avoid space lasers and Google Maps .
I am , however , disappointed whenever the Batcave is depicted without a life - size dinosaur statue .
I do n't care how gritty and morally ambiguous your story is , there 's always room for an anatomically inaccurate T. rex .
On the other hand , Wikipedia informs me that the Batcave originally just held a desk and filing cabinets .
Bat - cubicle !
Grade : A
Rebreather
This is usually depicted as a small device that Batman can hold in his mouth like a Binky .
A Bat -Binky .
However , rather than providing Batman with comfort while teething or tripping on ecstasy , the rebreather turns Batman 's superheroic exhalations back into life - giving oxygen , allowing him to survive unpleasant gases or even breathe underwater .
Carbon dioxide into oxygen ?
Batman could solve global warming on his own , but he wo n't .
Global warming did n't kill his parents .
Grade : C +
Batplane
I 'm not even going to consider how Batman deals with air - traffic control .
I assume he just tells them he's the god - damned Batman and they 'd better get all the other planes out of the sky because some villain is launching a series of awkwardly themed crimes and needs to be flied at .
I like to think that Batman also has another Batplane , a simple woodworking tool he uses for home improvement .
One shaped like a bat .
Grade : B
Explosives
Batman has explosives ?
Many sources agree .
It seems to me that if you have explosives you do n't need much else .
Really , Explosives Man is probably going to frighten more cowardly , superstitious criminals than a bat theme .
Criminals have one main superstition : " If someone explodes you , you die . "
Yeah , I know Batman does n't kill , but if he plays his cards right , nobody ever has to find that out .
Just convince them you 're completely crazy .
In that outfit , that 's not tough to do .
Grade : C-
Flashlight
In some incarnations , Batman has night - vision lenses , but I like it when he just has a plain old regular flashlight .
Why ?
Because I carry a flashlight .
That means I am , in some small way , like Batman , if Batman had a key chain .
Which I guess he does n't ?
At any rate , I 'm hoping in the future Batman will carry around a Leatherman , a BatPod MP3 player and a miniature bottle of Tabasco .
Then the parallels will be uncanny .
Grade : B-

Whenever I talk about Batman 's utility belt – and I do that far too often – someone always mentions the Shark - Repellent Bat Spray from the Adam West Batman movie .
Yeah , that was pretty awesome .

The Dark Knight : ' Where Does He Get Those Wonderful Toys ? '
Review : Joker Plays the Wild Card in Dazzling Dark Knight
Untitled Document According to South African intelligence sources , convicted GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff was a long - time intelligence asset for South Africa 's apartheid era security services .
The revelations from South Africa help to explain Abramoff 's connections to white supremacists who use Confederate heritage organizations to mask their true agendas .
Abramoff 's files from his days as a South African agent emerge : Details of his ties to anti-black , racist groups like World Church of the Creator ( insignia on far right -- where have we seen that logo before ? ) and South African propaganda operations -- Babushka and Longreach -- provided exclusively to WMR .
From left to right : Abramoff , Williamson , Leon , and Crystal .
In 1985 , Abramoff launched the International Freedom Foundation ( IFF ) in Washington .
In fact , IFF was a front for South African military intelligence , code named Pacman , and a major front for South Africa 's international propaganda efforts .
The IFF was a joint project of Russel Crystal , currently a Democratic Alliance official in South Africa , and a former apartheid South Africa top spy , Craig Williamson .
According to South African intelligence sources , Abramoff was first recruited by Crystal and Williamson during 1979 and 1980 .
Crystal and Williamson were both paid agents of the Apartheid Security Police ( SAP ( V ) ) .
Money paid to Abramoff initially came from SAP ( V ) accounts .
South African intelligence files also show : Abramoff ’s take - over of the College Republicans National Committee ( CRNC ) in Washington , DC was directed by both Crystal and Williamson and similarly funded .
In fact , Abramoff was mentored by them , being trained as a political operator , apartheid style -- the emphasis was on carrying out political dirty tricks with non-attribution through fronts , screens , and dupes .
Before Crystal worked for SAP( V ) as a right - wing student agitator at Wits University in Johannesburg , he was suspected of being an employee of the Bureau of State Security ( BOSS ) , the apartheid spy agency responsible for foreign operations , including hit squad work , disinformation , and bombings .
By the time of the establishment of National Students Federation ( Crystal was its leader at Wits , Williamson having been exposed as an SAP ( V ) spy after arrests of anti-apartheid students in the National Union of South African Students ( NUSAS ) ) .
A question arises as apartheid monies paid to Abramoff came from the specific account of the sections employing Crystal -- this indicates that Abramoff received foreign intelligence service money from BOSS .
This was certainly the case when Abramoff 's benefactors were in SAP ( V ) and later , when they left to join Military Intelligence ( MI ) , which became the pre-eminent apartheid intelligence service after the rise of former defence minister P.W. Botha to the Presidency .
It is clear that Abramoff received SAP ( V ) and MI monies for services rendered .
Abramoff visited South Africa in 1983 to forge links between Crystal 's National Students Federation ( NSF ) and Abramoff 's CRNC .
Abramoff projects with IFF included provision of U.S. armaments to Southern Africa , including Stinger missiles to UNITA in Angola and the apartheid military ; stopping the Congressional Comprehensive Anti Apartheid Act and lobbying for Reagan ’s veto ( this was the only Reagan veto overturned by Congress ) .
As par of South African intelligence 's Operation Babushka , Abramoff helped monitor anti-apartheid lobby in USA : Randall Robinson of TransAfrica was a major target as was Coretta Scott King and Jesse Jackson .
Abramoff also hooked IFF up with some representatives of the U.S. - based World Church of the Creator – a white supremacist , neo - Nazi group , which had a branch in South Africa .
The Democratic Alliance in South Africa is the official opposition to the African National Congress .
Its leader is Tony Leon , a colleague of Crystal and Williamson at Wits University who bankrolled him in his student election campaigns as they did Abramoff in CRNC .
They then financed Leon 's year - long visit to the U.S. to teach law .
Abramoff administered all of Leon ’s U.S. arrangements .
Abramoff worked on behalf of the DA and Leon in Washington , DC and New York City .
Abramoff , schooled in the SAP ( V ) front - tactics worked through an American named Duncan Sellars , who was also connected with Crystal on the Ninth floor , Noswell Hall , in Johannesburg , across the road from Wits University .
Abramoff visited Noswell Hall on a number of occasions .
Sellars was chairman of the IFF in 1993 .
The Abramoff - Crystal anti-communist camp in Angola was an MI project designed to frustrate Chester Crocker ’s diplomatic initiative under Secretary of State George Shultz to get the apartheid forces out of Namibia and the Cubans out of Angola .
Williamson applied and received amnesty for a number of his apartheid - era crimes ( killings [ including Ruth First , the wife of South African Communist Party leader Joe Slovo ] , bombings , maimings – including children ) , Crystal did not apply or appear before the Truth & Reconciliation Commission .
Crystal was more than “ politically tied ” to Williamson -- he was also “ operationally tied ” as was Abramoff , though Sellars and Crystal were often merely cut-outs .
The letter bombing fatalities of anti-apartheid activists in Angola and Mozambique are said to have been made by another Crystal - Abramoff confidant , John Adams .
Crystal - Abramoff - Williamson are reportedly responsible for compiling the hit - lists Abramoff introduced Williamson to Grover Norquist and they became friends .
This relationship assisted South African intelligence 's Operations Longreach and Babushka , essentially pro-apartheid influence operations in DC .
One propaganda operation was Abramoff 's movie Red Scorpion , based on UNITA guerrilla leader Jonas Savimbi , a movie for which South Africa provided military equipment , vehicles , and extras .

UNITED NATIONS | Everyone complains about climate change , and the United Nations is finally doing something about it - on Friday , the temperature inside U.N. headquarters in New York will rise by 5 degrees .
Ban Ki-moon , the United Nations ’ self - professed environmental secretary - general , ordered the “ In - House Climate Change Initiative ” to save energy , cut carbon emissions and try to mitigate climate change .
Officials said the monthlong experiment - dubbed “ Cool U.N. ” - also will allow engineers to test energy consumption and utility costs in the notoriously antiquated building .
It also will stretch the comfort and good will of about 4,500 staffers , who work in the glass - walled Secretariat , a veritable 39 - story terrarium planted in full sun on the East River .
“ It will be like Addis Ababa , ” said one crestfallen staff member , referring to the tropical capital of Ethiopia .
“ The air conditioning did n’t work too well there , either . ”
Anwarul Chowdhury , a former U.N. ambassador from Bangladesh , said Tuesday that the Cool U.N. initiative sounds like “ tokenism . ”
Nevertheless , he said , the extra 5 degrees of heat might give diplomats some compassion for the developing world .
“ Some of us grow up in a natural environment , ” said Mr. Chowdhury , whose home country is infamous for its heat and humidity .
“ We do not have the benefits of air conditioning .
It is important to understand the realities of living in various parts of the world . ”
To make the adjustment easier , Mr. Ban will encourage diplomats and bureaucrats inside headquarters to wear their national dress , which was once the norm .
Suit jackets and ties will be discretionary , said one of Mr. Ban ’s aides , noting that the secretary - general will lead by example .
“ Look for a cool , calm , casual S.G. , ” said an e-mail from Mr. Ban ’s office .
In the landmark Secretariat building , thermostat settings will rise from 72 degrees to 77 degrees for August workdays .
The air conditioning is to be switched off during weekends , which some fear could make for sweltering Monday mornings .
Government buildings in Japan and Mr. Ban ’s native South Korea have long been uncomfortable for employees in the hottest months .
However , the executive floor here thinks this will be the first time that an international organization has courted “ hot air ” jokes by voluntarily reducing its use of air conditioning .
“ The secretary - general is doing everything he can to mobilize unprecedented international action on climate change , ” said Robert Orr , an adviser to Mr. Ban .
“ Successful negotiations are necessary , but individual and institutional behavior must also change all over the world if we are to address the climate crisis , and the secretary - general felt that this was one way the U.N. could lead by example . ”
The effort “ is n’t about symbolic sweating , ” he added .
“ If adopted on a large scale , these types of policies could have a major global impact and will definitely help the participating institutions ’ bottom line . ”
The U.N. headquarters will soon be renovated for the first time in more than 50 years , in large part because the building is deteriorating .
Its crooked walls and glass windows that do n’t close properly make it an especially drafty place to work .

We all know where baseball was born :
The rules used to play the game today were evolved directly from the rules set down by Alexander Cartwright for a game played in 1846 at Elysian Fields in Hoboken .
But the rest of the world seems determined to rob Hoboken of its title .
First and most famously , Cooperstown , N.Y. , claimed to be the birthplace of baseball , but that has been thoroughly debunked .
Then we had Pittsfield , Mass. , which got some press after a municipal bylaw from 1791 was found banning " Wicket , Cricket , Baseball , Football , Cat , Fives or any other game or games with balls " from being played within 80 yards of the town meeting house .
But it 's not certain the game being banned in Pittsfield had anything in common with our National Pastime .
In fact , a children 's book printed in 1744 in England has a rhyme titled " Base - Ball " , but it appears under a picture of what appears to be boys playing stoolball .
A letter published in 1886 claimed there was a game played with three outs per inning in Ontario , Canada , on June 4 , 1838 , but again , it 's not clear if the game described was baseball as we would know it , or a derivation of rounders .
Cooperstown , Pittsfield , Ontario ... and now Rotterdam ?
A story in the International Herald Tribune about former Yankee Robert Eenhoorn , who is now 40 and coaching the Dutch national baseball team , reports that some Dutch baseball fans believe the game is as American as Dutch apple pie .
They 're not the only Europeans claiming to have invented the game .
The English have long said that baseball resembles rounders ( or stoolball ) ; in Romania , they play oina ; Russia has lapta ; the French played " poisoned ball " ; and the Germans played Schlagball .
( You can read a lot more about the history of baseball - and forerunner games like stoolball - in David Block 's Baseball Before We Knew It . )
It 's clear there were a variety of baseball - like games played under various rules ( and names ) before 1846 .
Cartwright did n't invent the game out of thin air , but rather codefied one set of rules for the game .
Those rules were the founding document for the rules of the game we play today .
And where were Cartwright 's rules used for the first time ?
Hoboken .
I 've long been an admirer of the cl - net - snmp project , which recently had a 3.0 release .
But the author , Chun Tian ( binghe ) , has n't slowed down .
He recently sent me this email :
Hi , Zach
Today I go another big step : portable SNMP server support ( tested on LW , Clozure CL , and Allegro CL ) .
Now I can run a SNMP server in i.e .
Allegro CL , and use snmp - get to query it :
CL - USER ( 2 ) : ( snmp:enable - snmp - service ) #< SNMP:SNMP-SERVER SNMP Server 0:8161 > CL - USER ( 3 ) : : proc P Bix Dis Sec dSec Pri State Process Name , Whostate , Arrest * 2 12 21 20.6 0 runnable Initial Lisp Listener * 4 8 0 0.0 0 waiting SNMP Server at 0:8161 , waiting for input binghe@binghe - mac : ~$ snmpget -v 2 c -c public localhost : 8161 sysDescr.0 SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING : International Allegro CL Free Express Edition 8.1 [ Mac OS X ( Intel ) ] ( Jul 17 , 2008 22:41 )
I also improve the ASN.1 compiler , now it can generate 30000 + lines of lisp code in # p" SNMP : MIB ; " directory and get almost all infomation about a ASN.1 object identifier from their original ASN.1 definitions .
This can be used to detect a SNMP query 's access ( readonly / readwrite ) and return value subtype ( octet string as mac address ) .
I 'll continue coding and make a 3.x patch - release next week .

IN DECEMBER 2007 the World Bank unveiled the results of the biggest exercise in window shopping in history .
Scouts in 146 countries scoured stalls , supermarkets and mail - order catalogues , recording the price of more than 1,000 items , from 500 - gram packets of durum spaghetti to low - heeled ladies ' shoes .
This vast enterprise enabled the bank to compare the purchasing power of many countries in 2005 .
It uncovered some statistical surprises .
Prices in China , for example , were much higher than earlier estimates had indicated , which meant the Chinese income in 2005 of 18.4 trillion yuan ( $ 2.2 trillion at then - market exchange rates ) could buy less than previously thought .
At a stroke , the Chinese economy shrank , in real terms , by 40 % .
Since then , many scholars have wondered what this economic demotion means for the bank 's global poverty counts .
It famously draws the poverty line at “ a dollar a day ” , or more precisely $ 1.08 at 1993 purchasing - power parity ( PPP ) .
In other words , a person is poor if they consume less than an American spending $ 1.08 per day in 1993 .
By this yardstick 969 m people suffered from absolute poverty in 2004 , a drop of over 270 m since 1990 .
The world owed this progress largely to China , where poverty fell by almost 250 m from 1990 to 2004 .
But if the Chinese economy was 40 % smaller than previously thought , surely its poverty count must be correspondingly higher .
Surjit Bhalla , of Oxus Investments , speculated that China 's toll would increase by more than 300m .
He mischievously accused the bank 's number - crunchers of conspiring to lift the poverty count so as to keep their employer in business beyond its natural life .
Give a quarter , take a quarter
The dollar - a- day definition of global destitution made its debut in the bank 's 1990 World Development Report .
It was largely the discovery of Martin Ravallion , a researcher at the bank , and two co-authors , who noticed that the national poverty lines of half - a- dozen developing countries clustered around that amount .
In two working papers * published this week , Mr Ravallion and two colleagues , Shaohua Chen and Prem Sangraula , revisit the dollar - a - day line in light of the bank 's new estimates of purchasing power .
They also provide a new count of China 's poor .
Thanks to American inflation , $ 1.08 in 1993 was worth about $ 1.45 in 2005 money .
In principle , the researchers could count the number of people living on less than this amount , converted into local money using the bank 's new PPP rates .
But $ 1.45 a day strikes the authors as a bit high .
Rather than update their poverty line , they propose to abandon it .
It is time , they say , to return to first principles , repeating the exercise Mr Ravallion performed almost two decades ago , using the better , more abundant data available now .
They gather 75 national poverty lines , ranging from Senegal 's severe $ 0.63 a day to Uruguay 's more generous measure of just over $ 9 .
From this collection , they pick the 15 lowest ( Nepal , Tajikistan and 13 sub - Saharan countries ) and split the difference between them .
The result is a new international poverty line of $ 1.25 a day .
Why those 15 ?
The answer is philosophical , as well as practical .
In setting their poverty lines , most developing countries aim to count people who are poor in an absolute sense .
The line is supposed to mark the minimum a person needs to feed , clothe and shelter himself .
In Zambia , say , a poor person is defined as someone who cannot afford to buy at least two to three plates of nshima ( a kind of porridge ) , a sweet potato , a few spoonfuls of oil , a handful of groundnuts and a couple of teaspoons of sugar each day , plus a banana and a chicken twice a week .
But even in quite poor countries , a different concept of poverty also seems to creep in , the authors argue .
It begins to matter whether a person is poor relative to his countrymen ; whether he can appear in public without shame , as Adam Smith put it .
This notion of relative deprivation seems to carry weight in countries once they grow past a consumption of $ 1.95 per person a day .
Beyond this threshold , a country that is $ 1 richer will tend to have a poverty line that is $ 0.33 higher ( see chart ) .
The authors thus base their absolute poverty line on the 15 countries in their sample below this threshold .
How many people in the world are poor by this new definition ?
The authors are not yet ready to say .
But they have taken another look at China .
By their new standard , they find that 204 m Chinese people were poor in 2005 , about 130 m more than previously thought .
That is the bad news .
The brighter news is that China 's progress against poverty is no less impressive than previously advertised .
By Mr Ravallion 's and Ms Chen 's new standard , the number of poor in China fell by almost 407 m from 1990 to 2004 , compared with the previous estimate of almost 250m .
China 's economic co-ordinates may be different than thought , but its trajectory is much the same .
And therein lies a lesson .
Give or take a dime or two , it matters little where a poverty line is drawn .
Like a line in the sand , an absolute poverty standard shows whether the economic tide is moving in or out .
It does not matter too much where on the beach it is drawn .
For practical purposes , policymakers will always care more about their own national poverty lines than the bank 's global standard .
The dollar - a - day line is more of a campaigning tool than a guide to policy .
And as a slogan , $ 1.25 just does n't have the same ring to it .
A better option might be to reset the poverty line at $ 1 in 2005 PPP , which would line up reasonably well with at least ten countries in the authors ' sample .
In adding a quarter to the dollar - a - day poverty line , the researchers may cut its popular appeal by half .

Subject : Lenny frozen
From : Marc ' HE ' Brockschmidt < he@debian.org >
Date : Sun , 27 Jul 2008 16:00:53 +0200
Message - id : < [ 🔎 ] 87tzebl94a.fsf@pindar.marcbrockschmidt.de >
Mail - followup - to : debian-devel@lists.debian.org
Hi ,
We just edited our hint files , so that all packages now need human review in order to go to testing .
Hmm , that sounds too cryptic .
Let 's try again : Lenny is now frozen !
Wheeeeeee !!!
Thanks are due to everyone who has helped get us to this point .
For those maintainers whose packages were unprepared for a freeze at this moment ( the process has , after all , been a long one ) , you still have one last opportunity to get things into shape if there are any remaining important problems .
Read on .
Now to explain what , exactly , we mean by " freeze " .
The freeze upload policy of uploading changes in through unstable if possible will be continued to apply until the release .
All package versions that are at this moment already in unstable get an automatic freeze exception ( except those that are frozen for reasons , of course ) .
This means that packages you 've uploaded in the past week will be able to go to testing ( if they are n't hit by other problems ) .
Now , so as not to have everyone contact us at once about packages we know we wo n't approve , here are the guidelines for changes that will be accepted into testing during the freeze : - fixes for release critical bugs ( i.e. , bugs of severity critical , grave , and serious ) in all packages ; - changes for release goals , if they are not invasive ; - fixes for severity : important bugs in packages of priority : optional or extra , only when this can be done via unstable ; - translation updates and - documentation fixes .
- pre-approved fixes .
If you have such a change and want to update your package in Lenny , the rules are as follows : - In all cases , when preparing an upload , please do not make changes to the package that are not related to fixing the bugs in question .
Doing so makes it more time consuming for the release team to review and approve such requests , delaying the release .
It also delays the fix for your package , because you will be asked to reupload .
Always document every change verbosely in the changelog .
-
If in doubt , first contact debian - release . -
When contacting the release team , please explain why you are requesting an update .
Bug numbers are a must .
Attach the proposed ( or uploaded patch .
The more we can figure out from your first email and your changelog ( if any ) , the more quickly we can get your update in .
-
If your package needs to be updated for Lenny , and the version in unstable does n't contain extraneous changes ( e.g , the version is the same between testing and unstable ) , please upload your fix to unstable and contact debian-release@lists.debian.org . -
If the version in unstable already includes significant changes not related to the bug to be fixed , contact debian - release about uploading to testing - proposed - updates .
Changed dependencies , new upstream versions , changed library names , and completely rewriting the packaging are " significant changes " .
So are lots of other things .
-
If the version in unstable wo n't reach testing because of new library dependencies , contact debian - release about uploading to testing - proposed - updates . -
If you have a package that needs a freeze exception , * please * do n't forget to contact us .
* Do n't expect us to find out about it on our own * .
Putting a comment in the changelog is not contacting the release team . :) -
If your package has been removed recently ( i.e. in the last 20 days ) due to an RC bug , and you have an bugfix - only update uploaded , you can contact the release team about letting your package back in .
Same as above :
Do not expect us to find it out ourself .
You need to push that .
As always , it is the release team 's goal to get as much good software into Lenny as possible .
However , a freeze does not mean that your package is ensured a spot in the release .
Please continue to stay on top of release - critical bugs in packages that you maintain ; RC bugs in optional or extra packages that remain unfixed after a week will still be grounds for removal from testing , just as they have been up to this point .
Please also note that since many updates ( hopefully , the vast majority ) will still be going in through unstable , major changes in unstable right now can disrupt efforts to get RC bugs fixed .
We do n't ask you not to make changes in unstable , but we do ask that you be aware of the effects your changes can have -- especially if you maintain a library .
Please continue to keep disruptive changes out of unstable , and continue making use of experimental where appropriate .
Note once again that you can stage NEW uploads in experimental to avoid disruption in unstable .
Also , in case you need release team 's help to fix RC bugs ( e.g. to remove an old package ) , please feel free to contact us .
For packages which missed the freeze only for reasons outside of the control of the maintainers , we might be generous , but you need to contact us on your own , and you need to contact us soon .
What needs to happen before release ===================================
There is a short list of things that need to happen , though .
Fixing of release critical bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the release , we need to get rid of all release critical bugs .
Please do n't hesitate , pick any bug from http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php?bydist=lenny and fix it .
Or send in a patch in case there is none yet .
And of course , follow our permanent BSP policy for your NMUs .
Uploading works as you are used to -- just remember to send an e-mail to debian-release@lists.debian.org to get your fix through .
Security support ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Final preparations for security support will be done during the general freeze , that is now .
We hope being able to announce start of security support soon , but obviously , it is a pre-condition for release .
Cheers , Marc
— A massive fight that involved hundreds of people and forced the evacuation of Triangle Town Center mall was gang related , Raleigh police said .
Four off - duty officers working at the mall reported a fight in progress and requested assistance around 8 p.m. Saturday .
Witnesses told WRAL
News that about 200 teenagers started yelling and fighting on the mall 's upper level .
The melee poured outside the mall as the crowd spread out , and an estimated 200 and 300 people were involved at the height of the fight , police said .
On -duty Raleigh police officers ,
Wake County sheriff 's deputies and state troopers responded to the fight and fully restored order around 9 p.m. , police said .
Witnesses said the fight lasted about 20 minutes , and police said no guns were pulled out during it .
Christopher James Gamble , 17 , is accused of stabbing a 15 - year - old boy in the buttocks during a fight outside the mall , Raleigh police spokesman Jim Sughrue said .
The victim was taken to WakeMed and and treated for non-life - threatening injuries .
A police sergeant suffered a significant laceration on his knee during a foot chase , Sughrue said .
The officer was transported to Duke Raleigh Hospital and was expected to recover .
Shoppers were asked to leave Triangle Town Center around 8 p.m. , an hour before closing time , and mall security personnel had the facility closed by 8:40 p.m. , said Jennifer Jones , the mall 's marketing director .
" The genesis of the incident was gang related , " Sughrue said in a release .
Some of the participants in the fight are known to be associated with gangs , he said .
Raleigh police use the term " gang related " to delineate " an incident ( that ) occurred to further the purposes of the gang , " according to an email from Sughrue .
Such purposes could include " establishing a gang ’s territory , gaining influence by suppressing another gang , or seeking revenge against another gang . "
Sughrue stressed that those were only examples , not necessarily what prompted the fight at Triangle Town Center .
He was not at liberty to discuss what prompted police to classify Saturday 's fight as gang related .
Police charged six people in the fight :
Darryl Anthony Bobbit , 18 , with felony inciting a riot ; resisting obstructing or delaying a public officer ; and second - degree trespassing .
He remains in jail under a $ 6,000 bond .
Tyrell Eugene Brantley , 18 , with felony inciting a riot and disorderly conduct .
He remains in jail under a $ 8,000 bond .
Gamble , with felony inciting a riot and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury .
Gamble remains in jail under a $ 35,000 bond .
Laquavis Oneal Jordan , 16 , with felony inciting a riot .
Jordan was released into the custody of his family on Sunday .
Javonnie Nicholson , 16 , with felony inciting a riot , assault on a law - enforcement officer and second - degree trespassing .
Arrest warrants say that Nicholson jumped on and pushed a police officer trying to arrest her .
She remains in jail under a $ 7,000 bond .
Ricky Ladd Williams , 16 , with felony inciting a riot and engaging in an affray .
He remains in jail under a $ 10,000 bond .
All six suspects are scheduled to make their first court appearance at 9 a.m. Monday .
Police also had a 15 - year - old boy in custody , who they said would be the subject of a juvenile petition .
That measure is similar to a criminal complaint against an adult and brings the minor under the purview of the juvenile court system .
Williams was placed on probation in June for a common - law robbery in Wake County , according to state Department of Correction records .
The investigation into the mall fight continues , Sughrue said .
Jones said the Triangle Town Center opened at noon Sunday as scheduled .
“ We will be in contact with the Raleigh Police Department to get more details and obviously , with the shopper in mind , making sure the safety is here , ” Jones said .

The rare ' albino ' foal that 's become a star of the New Forest
It 's one of the rarest sights in the equine world .
A pure white horse is hardly ever seen outside a pub sign .
And almost all of them have begun life as a darker colour before turning to light grey .
This white foal has been drawing crowds to a national park in Hampshire
So crowds have been flocking to catch a glimpse of this beautiful foal , born among a group of New Forest ponies near Lyndhurst , Hampshire .
The spindly - legged youngster - also pictured , inset , with his dun-coloured mother - has quickly become the star attraction in Britain 's newest national park .
The fact the foal has a brown mother proves that he is a cremello blue - eyed cream and not an albino
The rare cremello foal takes some tentative steps
The snowy star nuzzles up to its chesnut - coloured mum
The enthusiasts who first spotted him thought he could be an albino , but experts have now ruled that out .
They say the giveaway is his eyes , which are blue .
An albino 's would be pink .
The technical term for the colt is a cremello blue - eyed cream .
As well as their blue eyes , such animals have some pale golden pigment in their coats and skin .
Albinos have no non-white colouring at all .
Sue Westwood , clerk to the Verderers , the group which protects and conserves landscape and wildlife of the New Forest , said : ' It is virtually unheard of in horses to have an albino and cremellos are very unusual .
' Unfortunately , they are not very hardy at all .
' They find it hard to deal with sunburn in the summer and with the cold rain in the winter . '
The sensitivity to light may explain why the foal 's eyes are half - closed .
Or he could just be trying to look relaxed in the face of all the attention .
An Amazon promotion good through June 9 has over 100 Blu-ray movies in the $ 14 to $ 20 range ( with many around $ 14 - $ 15 ) .
I thought this would be a good time to revisit getting into Blu-ray .
The last time I checked out Blu-ray pricing on Amazon ( my quick and dirty benchmark ) , the Playstation 3 was still the best deal .
That ’s now a little debatable , but not really .
At the time , the $ 400 PS3 price tag was lower than other players that were n’t also a gaming system .
Now , Amazon has several Blu-ray players under $ 400 with the least expensive floating around $ 339 .
Still not even close to good enough , though .
I ’d take the PS3 for $ 60 more .
But even then , I do n’t necessarily want a PS3 .
And I ’m now used to the next generation of DVD players being priced in the $ 100 to $ 200 range thanks to HD DVD .
If Sony ’s plan is really to increase Blu-ray market share to 50 % by the end of the year ( that is , for Blu- ray to sell as well as regular DVDs ) , the company at least needs to half the price of its current best deal .
I ’m not sure which company looks worse at the moment .
Is it Sony by asserting such an aggressive goal while doing nothing to achieve it ?

For those who already have a Blu-ray player , here are some picks for movies that are pretty good and a good deal :
Bush demo police branded ' blood hungry ' by protesters
It began as a perfectly legal protest about the visit of the most hated president in American history .
But within hours - as George Bush dined with Prime Minister Gordon Brown several hundred yards away in Downing Street - the demonstration degenerated into a vicious melee in which numerous officers and protesters were injured , and 25 were arrested .
In the aftermath of yesterday 's shameful scenes it was claimed that ' blood hungry ' Metropolitan Police massively over - reacted to the protests to save face for Mr Brown , with a huge presence of officers all too ready to use their batons .
' Blood Hungry ' : Police and protesters clash in Parliament Square
The senior officer in charge of policing the event , meanwhile , controversially claimed that the protesters could have been ' used as cover for more sinister criminal activity ' .
The demonstrators wanted to express their opposition to President Bush opposite Downing Street - but in an unusual move were forbidden from doing so , and the whole of Whitehall was sealed off well before the demonstration late on Sunday .
The Stop the War Coalition , which organised the demonstration , blamed the 2,500 police involved in the operation in total over the weekend for the fighting that broke out with the 2,500 protesters .
As the Met began an investigation into the fracas , Stop the War spokesman Andrew Burgin said : ' This was the first time in the history of Britain that they 've sealed off the centre of London in the way they did .
' We were not allowed to make a protest opposite Downing Street to save the face of the Prime Minister , because he did n't want protest to be heard when he arrived for dinner .
' It was very much a political decision taken under the directions of the security service of America .
' People were understandably annoyed at being smashed over the head in their own country at the request of a foreign security service . '
' Heavy Handed ' : A protester is left bleeding after clashes with police
Veteran peace campaigner Walter Wolfgang , who was at the rally , said : ‘ Not only did some of the police behave brutally , it looked as if they enjoyed it . ’
Human rights activist Bianca Jagger , who was also among the demonstrators , said the police response was ‘ the most heavy handed I have seen since the Grovesnor Square 1968 protest ’ .
In advance of the demonstration , which began in Parliament Square at 5 pm with speeches from leading opponents of the war in terror including politicians Tony Benn and George Galloway , Deputy Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison had detailed the huge police operation planned .
Mr Allison said : ' We have not banned their march .
They asked for a particular route .
That route is just not open to them .
Part of Whitehall has to be closed , and is being closed , on security grounds . '
Despite Mr Allison 's confidence , the protest degenerated into violence - and waiting riot police were called in to help out when the two lines of police and two lines of police vans were deemed insufficient , although Mr Bush entered unhindered at the other end of Whitehall .
Protesters angry at the ongoing western military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan shouted that Mr Bush was a ' terrorist ' as blows were struck by both sides .
A police spokesman said : ' The majority of the demonstrators crossed Parliament Square into Parliament Street to challenge police cordons and break through security barriers .
' Demonstrators started to try and take apart security barriers and threw placards at police . '
Anti-war protesters clash with police officers while trying to march down Whitehall
Police said around ten officers sustained injuries , while Stop the War claimed 20 protestors had significant head injuries .
Of the 25 arrested , just three were charged by late yesterday .
Two men aged 21 and 26 were charged with obstructing police and a 60 - year - old woman was charged with indecent exposure .
Mr Allison claimed placard holders were thrown ' like javelins ' and said : ' We are seriously disappointed by the irresponsible and criminal actions of those who have challenged police , physically ripping apart security barriers with the sole aim of breaching security in Whitehall .
Riot police were called to the scene when protesters tried to breach police barriers blocking the entrance to Whitehall
' Attacks such as the ones we have seen are totally irresponsible as such behaviour can be used as cover for more sinister criminal activity .
' In this climate any activity to challenge the security of the President of the United States of America will be robustly responded to by police .
' The acts that we have witnessed are deplorable and cannot be described as lawful demonstration . '
A protester is detained by police in Whitehall
But Mr Burgin of the Stop the War Coalition argued that heavy - handed policing led to the fighting - saying that in 20 previous demonstrations , including the million - strong protest on the eve of the Gulf War in 2003 , there had been no such scenes .
Mr Burgin said : ' The police were very free with the use of their batons - some went berserk - and while I saw no police being injured , many demonstrators had serious head wounds .
' It was very similar to the extraordinary police violence at the Countryside Alliance demonstration outside parliament in 2004 . '
US President George Bush is welcomed to 10 Downing Street by Gordon Brown
Student protester David Jamieson , 21 , who travelled from Strathclyde University to be present , said police violence had been ' completely unjustified ' .
Mr Jamieson said : ' I was beaten repeatedly on my back and the back of my head .
My back was turned and I was hit three or four times .
" We did not think that the moment a few sticks came over the police would pull out solid aluminium rods .
' They are blood hungry - it was absolutely unprovoked . '

Every once in a while , I try to check out that hidden corner of the blogosphere where Hillary Clinton supporters still live .
Over the course of the Democratic nomination , most of the online energy went to Barack Obama , Ron Paul , John Edwards , Dennis Kucinich , and Mike Gravel .
The conservative opinionsphere jumped from Giuliani to Romney to , finally , reluctactly , McCain .
The liberal opionsphere seemed to weigh the pros and cons of Edwards and Obama for some time , finally coming down decisively with Obama after Iowa .
Hillary Clinton , in all of this , had few web proxies .
There were some – like MyDD and Taylor Marsh – but eventually , after the stalemate of February 5th and the string of twelve consecutive wins by Obama , a new mini-opinionsphere grew out of Hillary Clinton ’s campaign .
Mainly , they were women who had taken every slight against Hillary as a personal insult ; some just had a deep and abiding distrust of Barack Obama , for whatever reason .
What was most perplexing to me is that this movement finally bloomed the moment Obama had taken an insurmountable lead .
Despite the win in Ohio and half of the Texas two - step , and the win later in Pennsylvania , Obama never fell behind after his string of victories in February , and never even came close .
And any clear - eyed analyst could see from that point that the nomination was Obama ’s to lose .
But a certain segment of Hillary supporters found strength and popularity in denying the inevitable , in railing against reality .
Given the way this movement was born , it is unsurprising that small things – like Barack Obama ’s mathematical clinching of the nomination or Hillary Clinton ’s concession endorsement of Obama ( a commentor pointed out that Hillary has yet to use the word “ concede ” ) – would stop it .
These PUMAs ( Party Unity , My Ass ) – as the acronym - prone , former Hillary supporter , and now die - hard anti-Obama activists now call themselves – continue to this day .
Some of them , like Larry Johnson , play on fears , racial stereotypes and resentments and do their best Sean Hannity impressions .
Others seem to be working full - time creating new acronyms , groups , and catchphrases .
The newest and coolest catchphrase is “ NObama , NOvember . ”
Oddly , the arguments that are made tend to go like this :
Obama cannot win in November , which is why we need Hillary to be the nominee ;
Let ’s work hard to make sure Obama does n’t win in November .
I have yet to see any acknowledgment from the PUMAs that Obama has won the Democratic nomination – and Hillary conceded it – unless you count the continuous references to stolen elections and the end of democracy as we know it .
The closest I saw to an acknowledgment of Obama ’s historic victory was at HillBuzz where – after suggesting that “ we ” would have to vote for Newt Gingrich over Obama – she wrote :
So , in the fall , barring a surprise Clinton re-entry into the race , it ’s McCain over Obama for us .
In this world , there still is a chance for a surprise Hillary re-entry !
Befitting the surreal world in which these blogs exist , many are still convinced that Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee , if only she is given a chance .
A group called The Denver Group has been formed to take action regarding the Democratic Convention in Denver with two of it ’s primary goals listed as :
Speeches allowed by supporters of Senator Clinton on behalf of her candidacy .
.
A genuine roll call vote with Senator Clinton as a legitimate candidate .
[ Emphasis aded . ]
In her personal blog , Heidi Li , one of the founders of The Denver Group writes , speculates on recent news :
As Senator Obama looses support , he may well be more and more afraid that if Senator Clinton ’s name is put in nomination at the Democratic Party ’s convention , then Senator Clinton might actually win the nomination .
It is unclear what Ms. Li means by Obama ’s loss of support – as most recent polls show him leading John McCain by significant margins .
But items like these are n’t acknowledged in PUMA - land .
HillBuzz tries to explain how her fellow Hillary devotees are feeling , and what is motivating them to oppose Obama so strongly :
Our loyalty is to Hillary Clinton , personally , because we believe in her and her goals .
We are no longer to the Democratic Party , because we stopped believing in it on May 31st .
Whoever came up with the idea to steal 4 of Clinton ’s delegates in Michigan and give them to Obama is responsible for this – you can thank that person in November …
We ’re hard pressed to think of anyone Obama could run against that would force us to choose him over the opponent .
At this point , after the way Obama ’s campaign has treated us , and continues to treat us , we ’d vote for Gingrich over Obama .
And he divorced his wife while she was dying of cancer .
But , we trust Gingrich to protect this country and respect its values and traditions …
So , in the fall , barring a surprise Clinton re-entry into the race , it ’s McCain over Obama for us .
[ My emphasis added . ]
It ’s worth pointing out that the writer of this piece only refers to two non-self - referencing facts : Newt Gingrich ’s tawdry personal life and the May 31 compromise that split the Michigan vote .
There is no talk of policy ; there is no discussion of what an Obama or McCain administration would look like .
Instead , the writer is trying to make two points :
Obama did n’t treat “ us ” well – a highly dubious point on it ’s own ;
And “ we ” will vote for anyone except Obama to punish him .
An ancillary reason to trust Gingrich and to not trust Obama is that we need a president who will “ protect this country and respect its values and traditions . ”
I ’m sure elsewhere in the PUMA opinionsphere someone has listed the reasons why Obama does n’t want to protect his country and does n’t respect it ’s values and traditions .
Balancing out this vision of Hillary as messiah is a visceral hatred of Barack Obama , as demonstrated in this oft - repeated phrase :
Obama simply cannot be trusted .
Obama can not be trusted on any issue .
Obama can not be trusted by his friends .
Obama can not be trusted by his enemies .
Obama can not be trusted .
This Hillaryis44 post repeats this same phrase three times and Larry Johnson and many other PUMAs have taken it us as a slogan to go alongside NObama , NOvember .
PUMAs and Projections
The John Birch Society so feared the efficacy of Communist subversives , that they created a secret society that mimicked the imagined Communist subversive threat .
Republicans believed that CNN was a far left organization pushing the Democratic agenda under the guise of objectivity – so they created Fox News to take on the same role for the Republican party .
American history is replete with examples of groups who deliberately mimic their enemy ’s imagined tactics .
The movement that grew out of Hillary Clinton ’s losses proves to be yet another example of this trend in American history .
The PUMAs ( Party Unity , My Ass ) seem to have embraced the ( real and imagined ) aspects of the Obama campaign that led them to reject Obama ’s candidacy :
They explicitly see Hillary Clinton as a messianic figure , the only one who can save the Democratic party .
( See above . )
They deliberately disrespect and attack those demographic groups that did not support Hillary in the primaries .
( Remember when Hillary was introduced by a man attacking “ the latte - drinking , Prius - driving , Birkenstock - wearing , trust fund babies crowding in to hear [ Obama ] speak ! ” )
They have adopted the right wing talking points used to attack Obama .
( This might be unfair , as it could have been Hillary surrogates themselves who gave the right wingers like Sean Hannity these talking points – so while Obama supporters did adopt certain right - wing talking points about Hillary to use against her , Hillary supporters may have invented the talking points against Obama and given them to the right - wing . )
Although they started out defending the role of superdelegates as those people who have the best interests of the Democratic party at heart , they now attack them for being un -democratic ( and un- Democratic ) – which is something Obama surrogates never came close to doing , but Clinton supporters constantly accused them of doing .
Many – though not all PUMAs – have resorted to race - baiting and gender - card - playing , at least on occasion .
( The constant rumors of a Michelle Obama ‘ Whitey ’ video come from one of the founding PUMAs . )
They take umbrage at the smallest slight and impute near evil motives on every move that Barack Obama takes .
( Which to be fair , is something some of Obama ’s supporters did do – Andrew Sullivan for example . )
The key lesson I take away from this journey into the alternate reality that the PUMAs live in is this : they are a force to be reckoned with and a force that will remain in politics for some years – at least as long as Barack Obama is in the national political arena .
To paraphrase Michelle Goldberg ’s excellent piece in The New Republic exploring the crisis in the women ’s movement that Hillary ’s campaign created , the psychic wound irritated in this hard - fought primary is not Obama ’s fault , but it is his problem .
Obama has already taken steps to woo Hillary Clinton ’s supporters – and he will win most of the 18 million over to his side .
Within those big Democratic states that Hillary Clinton won in the primary , Obama now has a sizeable lead over McCain ( and in many , he also had a large lead over Hillary before the primaries ended ) .
But there are some – and they are organized , they are angry , and they are wealthy – who will continue to fight until past the end .
And there are many others who will be sympathetic – remembering how Hillary ’s campaign made them feel .
If Barack Obama is elected in 2008 , expect to see a PUMA or two sneak into Congress .
And expect a few Congresswomen and Senators to ally with them .
Hillary herself will keep her distance .
Unless Obama is able to somehow heal this particular psychic wound , the PUMAs will continue to cause him problems .
It ’s hard to say what impact these PUMAs will have .
But if it is true that all it takes to change the world is a small group of dedicated people , then the PUMAs will be able to have an impact – as they are small in number and large in dedication .

As U.S. television networks continue their silence about their use of retired military officers to " sell " progress in Iraq , members of the U.S. House of Representatives are calling on the Defense Department inspector general to investigate the Pentagon - sponsored public relations effort .
Rep. Rosa DeLauro , a Connecticut Democrat , and 40 others members of Congress want the inspector general ( IG ) to investigate how high - ranking officials within the Defense Department were allowed to operate a program " aimed at deceiving the American people . "
" When the Department of Defense [ DOD ] misleads the American people by having them believe that they are listening to the views of objective military analysts when in fact these individuals are simply replaying DOD talking points , the department is clearly betraying the public trust , " the lawmakers wrote in a joint letter to DOD Inspector General Claude M. Kicklighter .
" Not only must the inspector general now account for what it did and did not know about this state - sponsored propaganda effort , but they must also explain why , if they knew about the propaganda campaign , it was allowed to proceed , " DeLauro said .
" Additionally , we are calling for the inspector general to launch an investigation to ensure no detail surrounding this program remains hidden , " she added .
The House members also want to know if the inspector general considers the program to be illegal .
Retired officers who acted as military analysts for major news outlets were given VIP access to the Pentagon , with regular briefings by then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and a sponsored trip to the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba .
The operation was abruptly halted after it was reported by the New York Times .
The paper ’s massive probe revealed that some 75 retired military officers , prepped by the Pentagon , served as paid television commentators since the run-up to the Iraq war  and many also have conflicting ties to defense contractors .
These business links were seldom disclosed to viewers , and sometimes not even to the networks on which they appeared , the newspaper said .
The Times report said the officers got private briefings , trips and access to classified intelligence meant to influence their comments .
" Records and interviews show how the Bush administration has used its control over access and information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse  an instrument intended to shape terrorism coverage from inside the major TV and radio networks , " the newspaper wrote .
The Pentagon has since released 8,000 pages of documents related to the propaganda campaign , known as the Pentagon military analyst program .
Officials continue to defend the program , saying the analysts were given only accurate information .
Ken Allard , a retired Army colonel , pointed out in the Times article that it was " sometimes enough just for the Pentagon ’s cynical commissars to make retirees feel important , to give them a sense that they were still players . "
For other so - called " talking heads , " pleasing the Pentagon was strictly mercenary .
The Times ‘ revelations have sparked a serious backlash among many journalists and advocates of more transparency in government .
Among them is Steven Aftergood , who heads the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists .
Aftergood told IPS , " It is unrealistic to expect the Pentagon to do anything other than to advance its own institutional interests in the media and elsewhere .
Furthermore , it is not surprising when retired career military officers present a perspective that coincides with that of their former cohort . "
But he added , " Two things are disturbing , however .
One is the secret , unacknowledged coordination between the Pentagon and the purportedly independent spokespersons .
That stinks .
But what ’s worse is the failure of the media to come to terms with the way it was manipulated .
Media organizations are supposed to be skeptical of authority , and evenhanded in their approach to public policy issues .
This story illustrates how badly they failed to justify the public trust . "
Despite an avalanche of similar criticism throughout the blogosphere , and by a handful of journalism veterans and critics , the news chiefs and on - air hosts at CNN , FOX , ABC , NBC , and CBS have had little reaction to the revelations concerning the " Media Generals . "
Most declined to comment publicly , but have ceased using the officers on - air .
Some are reportedly tightening their guidelines for hiring military commentators .
This is not the first time the Pentagon has engaged in concealed efforts to influence public opinion .
In December 2005 , at the beginning of the insurgency in Iraq , media reports revealed that a contractor to the Defense Department was paying off Iraqi journalists to write " good news " stories about U.S. progress there .
The Pentagon carried out the effort as part of an organized and well - funded program , and did so in secret .
The Los Angeles Times broke the story .
Marjorie Cohn , president of the National Lawyers Guild , also pointed out to IPS , " During the run-up to the war on Iraq , the Pentagon gave its ‘ analysts ’ talking points : Iraq has chemical and biological weapons ; Iraq is developing nukes ; Iraq could give its WMD to al - Qaeda ; and an invasion would be quick and cheap .
This disinformation campaign was designed to condition Congress and the American people to accept Bush ’s illegal and unnecessary invasion of Iraq . "
Now , she warned , " we are seeing the same pattern as many in the Bush administration prepare for an attack on Iran .
Petraeus , Crocker , Gates , Bush , and Cheney are mouthing the mantra that Iran has nukes and is a danger to America .
Watch for other ‘ analysts ’ to parrot this line .
Since there appears to be a split in the administration about the wisdom of such an attack , public pressure could tilt the balance away from war . "
The Defense Department scheme to commission " good news " from Iraq was being carried out at the same time the State Department ’s exchange program was working to teach foreign journalists about the role and responsibility of a free press .
Some critics saw this as the worst aspect of this situation because it added to the perception of U.S. hypocrisy  at a time when the government is spending millions of dollars trying to " win hearts and minds " around the world .
Only one senior administration official commented on the " Iraq Payola " scheme .
Appearing on ABC’s This Week program , National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley joined Iraqi journalists in the view that , if the Defense Department investigation supported the allegations , the idea was bad policy and should be stopped .
It is unclear whether the program remains in operation .
Earlier , the media uncovered another DOD program known as " Total Information Awareness . "
TIA was an advanced form of " data mining " that would have effectively provided government officials immediate access to personal information such as phone calls , e-mails and Web searches , financial records , purchases , prescriptions , school and medical records , and travel history .
Disclosure of the program triggered a furor among the public and in Congress , and it was shut down .
But nobody was fired or reprimanded .
Each year humans move around 7 gigatons of earth .
Some projects result in vast improvements for human living ; others , not so much .
The Panama Canal
The idea of cutting a canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific through Panama was first proposed in 1524 , with plans drawn up by 1529 .
Various nations considered the idea , but for reasons of war , international politics , or the huge expense , the project was postponed for nearly four centuries .
A French company worked on the canal from 1881 to 188 , and the Americans finished it between 1904 and 1914 .
The French had excavated 30 million cubic yards of earth , and the Americans dug another 238 million .
The total amount of earth moved was four times the original estimate .
However , using the canal saved thousands of miles and months of travel time by ship for voyages between the east and west coasts of North America .
The Three Gorges Dam
The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River in China is slated to be the largest hydroelectric project on earth when it becomes fully operational in 2011 .
Plans were first offered in 1914 , but revolution , wars , and political instability delayed construction until 1994 .
The massive project has been criticized internationally for the displacement of 1.5 million people who lived where the new lake is , and for the environmental disruption which is believed to have already led to the extinction of at least one species , the Baiji or Yangtze River Dolphin .
The construction of the Three Gorges Dam moved about 13,400,000 cubicÂ yards of earth .
New York City Subway System
The first section of the New York City subway opened in 1904 .
Construction has continued ever since , with new lines , repairs , and replacement lines under constant construction .
On most lines , the street is torn up to dig the tunnel , then the road is replaced .
Tunnel - boring technology is necessary for the deeper lines , lines through rock , and those that cross under the East River .
The system is now 722 miles long .
It 's difficult to estimate the volume of the underground sections , but in 1904 when the very first lines were opened , 3.5 million cubic yards of earth and rock had been removed .
Mountaintop Removal
The latest innovation in coal mining in the Appalachians is mountaintop removal , a method that exposes coal seams faster and more cheaply than deep mining or strip mining .
Mountaintops are blasted away , and up to 250 million cubic yards of earth and rock are leveled into the surrounding valleys .
The effects on the local environment can be devastating .
Boston 's Big Dig
The Big Dig is officially named the Central Artery / Tunnel Project in Boston .
It 's a 3.5 mile tunnel to route vehicle traffic underneath the city .
Construction began in 1991 and sections of the tunnel were opened between 2003 and 2006 .
The initial cost of the project was estimated to be $ 2.8 billion , but the final cost was close to $ 15 billion .
Charges of corruption , inadequate materials , and a fatal collapse accompanied the project .
The completed tunnel saw the excavation of 16 million cubic yards of earth .
The Delta Works
The Dutch have been building dikes to hold back the ocean for over 2,000 years .
Today , 27 % of The Netherlands is below sea level .
When the sea encroaches , water is pumped back out , traditionally with windmill power , and in modern times with diesel and electric pumps .
The Delta project was launched as a reaction to the North Sea Flood of 1953 that killed 1,836 people .
It consisted of raising the height of 10,250 miles of dikes to levels that would protect the country from unexpectedly high sea floods .
Construction of the original plan was completed in 1997 .
Statistics are hard to pin down because the Delta Works are seen as a series of projects , but it 's been said that millions and millions of cubic feet of earth have been moved , with more added every year as land reclamation and improvement projects continue .
( CNN ) -- Cpl. Gunnar Zwilling suspected that his days were numbered last week , while he and his band of brothers in the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team prepared for a mission near Wanat , Afghanistan .
Cpl . Gunnar Zwilling had a bad feeling about his final mission in Afghanistan , said his father , Kurt .

" It 's gonna be a bloodbath , " he told his father , Kurt Zwilling , on the phone in what would be their last conversation .
Kurt Zwilling braced himself for the worst but held out hope that his son would make it home .
" They were in the most dangerous place on Earth .
They were in mortal danger , and there was nothing they could do about it , " he said .
" But they were soldiers , so they had to do their job . "
With just a few days left in their 15 - month tour , Gunnar Zwilling and eight of his comrades were killed July 13 in a clash with as many as 200 Taliban militants during a mission to set up an outpost near Wanat .
It was the deadliest attack on U.S. troops in Afghanistan in three years .
In the wake of their deaths , the paratroopers have become symbols of what many say is a forgotten war , prompting the U.S. military to draw up plans for putting more troops and resources into the war in Afghanistan .
Watch why troops may have to wait for help »
But before they were national heroes , the young soldiers were beloved sons , brothers , fathers and husbands who were drawn to the Army for different reasons .
Families remember the fallen in photos »
Cpl. Jason D. Hovater , 24 , of Clinton , Tennessee , joined the Army against his family 's wishes with the intention of jump - starting his college education .
U.S. soldiers killed The Defense Department on Wednesday identified the U.S. soldiers killed Sunday when their outpost was overrun in Afghanistan .

Before joining the service in 2006 , Hovater was a " man of God " who divided his time between his father - in - law 's landscaping company and playing songs of worship with his family .
" Everything that God deposited in that boy came out when he played the piano , " said his mother , Kathy Hovater , who home - schooled her son and his three siblings .
Shortly after Hovater joined his combat team in Italy , his sister said , he called home and said he had made a mistake but was committed to following through with his service .
" He was a dedicated soldier .
He did what he was supposed to do because he said if he were n't over there , all that horror and torment that was going on in the war , it would be over here , " said his sister , Jessica Davis .
Cpl. Pruitt A. Rainey , 22 , of Haw River , North Carolina , also joined the Army as a means to pay for his college education so he could become a teacher , according to Jeff Terrell , the leader of the youth group at the Glen Hope Baptist Church .
" He was n't going to be a career military guy , but he believed in what he was doing , " said Terrell , who knew Rainey since his teen years .
" He felt like this would help him .
He enjoyed it , but he had other plans .
" He really wanted to teach .
He had a good way with kids .
Kids flocked to him . "
Before joining the Army , Rainey spent his time doing martial arts , a pastime that came naturally to the high school wrestling star , and volunteering for his church 's youth ministry .
" The kids loved to jump on him like he was a big bear , " Terrell said .
" He was a big kid , but he was gentle . "
Cpl. Jonathan R. Ayers , 24 , of Snellville , Georgia , seemed destined for military service since childhood .
" Jon was just very military since he was 3 years old .
He looked at your shoes , and if they were n't perfect , they were no good , " said his father , Bill Ayers .
" He loved the regiment of the military ; he loved order and schedule . "
Despite his fastidious tendencies , Ayers ' father remembers him as a " cutup " who never failed to amuse with his Jeff Foxworthy impersonation .
" He loved to see people smile and laugh , " Ayers said .
" He was not a prankster , but he loved to tell jokes . "
For the free - spirited Cpl. Matthew B. Phillips , 27 , of Jasper , Georgia , the armed forces satisfied a need for adventure while providing a service to his country .
" Matt had a very individualistic personality .
He loved living life , " said his father , Michael Phillips .
" Even though he was afraid at times , in every photo from Afghanistan , he had a big smile on his face . "
Phillips , who left a wife behind , died on the same day his sister gave birth to her first son , whom she named after him .
Like other grieving relatives , Phillips ' father is attempting to reconcile his emotions with concerns over how the military handled the situation .
" We 're torn between incredible pride and anger .
We 're having a difficult time reconciling that after 14 months , someone who served his country well and paid his dues , why would he be placed in such a perilous situation ? "
Phillips said .
" There have to be some answers for the family . "
Dean Bogar , the grandfather of Cpl. Jason M. Bogar , 25 , of Seattle , Washington , said he was troubled by the fact that his grandson was fighting in a Taliban stronghold with little reinforcements .
" That 's a big question mark , " he said .
Watch how the Pentagon is investigating the attack »
Even so , he said , he is proud of his grandson for bringing " valor " to the Bogar name .
" He was a nifty boy .
He had a great sense of humor and was outgoing and very bright and upfront with everything , " he said .
" Kind of clever little imp . "
In the beginning , Kurt Zwilling said , his son enjoyed the camaraderie , discipline and excitement that Army life offered .
" Everything he did , he did with a passion , " Kurt Zwilling said of his son , who graduated from high school in Florissant , Missouri .
" That 's why he wanted to join the paratroopers :
He wanted to go into the toughest thing and be with the best . "
Even as the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan became apparent , Zwilling said , his son applied the same determination to his service that had carried him through high school theater , sports and music .
" He walked into the valley of death and did n't flinch .
He knew what was going to happen , and he went anyway .
That 's bravery , " he said .
For the parents of 1st Lt. Jonathan P. Brostrom , 24 , of Aiea , Hawaii , knowing that their son died doing what he felt was right brings some sense of closure .
" He was very happy doing what he was doing , and he would n't have had it any other way , " said his mother , Mary Jo Brostrom .
" That was what he wanted to do , defend our freedom and serve with his brothers . "
Brostrom 's parents said they are grateful they had the chance to spend time with their son in May , when he showed up unexpectedly at their door on Mother 's Day with a bouquet of flowers .
He spent the next few weeks surfing , fishing and spending every waking moment with his parents and his 6 - year - old son , Jase .
" When he came home , he would wrestle around and try and make us laugh , " Mary Jo Brostrom said .
" He had a beautiful smile and a beautiful heart , and that 's what we 'll miss . "

With her 100 - mile commute to and from work each day , she saw no end in sight .
Then she rediscovered the Geo Metro .
" I used to be a car snob , and I used to be too vain to drive anything that does n't shine , " said Solomon , an electrician .
" But now it 's about , do I want to eat , or do I want to make it to work ?
I want to do both . "
The Metro has been making a huge comeback , especially on eBay , where Solomon bought the car , because of its extremely high gas mileage .
The 1996 Metro's average of 40 miles per gallon nears that of the hybrid 2008 Toyota Prius -- priced at $ 21,000 for the cheapest model -- and bests most current cars by a long shot , according to government ratings .
Older models of the Geo Metro , specifically cars from 1991 and the XFi edition , have the same average as the hybrid .

Solomon toyed with the idea of purchasing a Prius but decided that for a price of $ 7,300 , the Metro was the more economical option .
For the most part , Solomon plans on using the car for commuting from her home in Rochester , Washington , to her job .
The vehicle she has now , a Honda Element , was getting 28 mpg , and she was filling up twice a week , costing her nearly $ 100 .
Stations were charging $ 3.97 a gallon in her area Tuesday , she said .

Tell us how high gas prices are affecting you
The Metro is an investment in the future , Solomon said , even if she did pay more than five times the Blue Book value of the car .
" It was all about saving money , " she said .
" I do n't think gas is ever going to go down , and these are going to be the types of solutions we have to turn to .
I wanted to beat the rush . "
The rush may have begun .
The 1996 2 - door 3 - cylinder Metro Solomon now owns opened on eBay May 7 with a bid of $ 200 .
A week later , Solomon won the car auction with a bid of $ 7,300 .
In 1995 , a new Metro hatchback sold for about $ 9,000 , according to Auto Mall USA .
In May alone , 43 Metros of various years and models were sold on eBay , ranging in price from $ 221.50 to Solomon 's bid of $ 7,300 .
The cars have been hot items , drawing upwards of 49 bids on certain vehicles , with many of the auctions coming down to last - second bidding wars .
On Tuesday morning , 34 Metros were still up for grabs .
Since her eBay purchase , Solomon has acquired another Metro , which she is considering flipping on eBay for profit .
She has her eye on a third at a local car lot .
" To be honest , I 'm thinking of scarfing up any Geo Metro I can find , " she said .
Solomon is n't alone in trying to profit off of a gas - saving craze .
Brenton Netz has been selling fixed - up Metros and Ford Festivas for two years now .
After buying a Metro on Craigslist in Montana and driving it back to his home in St. Cloud , Minnesota , Netz realized how rarely he was making trips to the pump .
" I thought the gas gauge was broken , " Netz said .
" I could n't believe the gas mileage I was getting . "
He realized that he had stumbled upon a possible side business and began buying one - way tickets to states in the West to purchase as many of the cars as he could .
Netz said he has sold about a dozen cars and has eight more sitting in his backyard .
His cars go up for sale only one at a time because he knows that putting up a couple at a time would drive down the value and cut into his profit .
Netz says consumers do n't seem to mind paying more than the retail value , and if they do , they generally stop feeling that way after they pick up the cars .
He 's gotten phone calls and e-mails from customers saying how thrilled they are with the mileage .
It seems , Netz said , people are beginning to realize that their car choices need to be focused more on practicality than status and appearance .
" Gas prices are definitely driving increased popularity in the Metro , which at times was n't cool , " he said .
" Now the coolness factor is stemming from the fact that you 're getting 50 miles per gallon and never having to fill up . "

Someone 's word order is wrong on the internet
A couple of weeks ago , xkcd explained the intellectual dynamics of networked discourse :
But according to a comment by Wulak at the Volokh Conspiracy :
It should say : SOMEONE ON THE INTERNET IS WRONG .
Ted F mock - agreed :
Wulak is correct .
The strip steps on its punchline .
I am going to write an angry email to the author expressing my dismay .
When the strip first came out , I noticed Randall Monroe 's word - order choice , but my reaction was the opposite .
I thought that he got it exactly right , though at first I could n't figure out exactly why .
It 's true that if you thought that " on the internet " was meant as a reduced relative clause , then you'd be reluctant to see it extraposed to the end of the sentence .
You might describe an inaccurate gas bill as ( a ) , but not as ( b ) :
( a) Someone from the gas company is mistaken .
( b) ? Someone is mistaken from the gas company .
On the other hand , if " on the internet " is a locative adverbial phrase , then it would be normal to put it at the end of the sentence , as in " It 's raining in Paris " .
So both word - orders are perfectly grammatical , and since the comment 's crucial point seems to be the wrongness , it would make sense to pick the order where wrong is final .
I did an informal poll of acquaintances -- without showing them the cartoon or explaining the context -- and most of them agreed with Wulak in picking " Someone on the internet is wrong " .
But that word order misses the poetic resonance with " Something is wrong " .
Consider the following table of Google hit counts :
here wrong something is __ 223,000 4,050,000 someone is __ 246,000 275,000
" Something is wrong " implies that in principle , everything ought to be right .
Or at least , right enough .
The sense of wrong involved is something like the OED 's sense 6 : " Not right or satisfactory in state or order ; in unsatisfactory or bad condition ; amiss " .
Consider these two lines from Ted Hughes ' poem Women :
3 A hushed animation , sombre and uneasy .
4 Something is wrong and everybody is aware of it .
Substituting " someone is wrong " into that line turns an ordinary example of social discomfort into a curious joke .
When people are wrong , it 's generally in OED sense 5.b
" Not in consonance with facts or truth ; incorrect , false , mistaken . "
A diversity of opinions , even about matters of fact , is normal , and so in that sense , someone is pretty much always wrong .
This is normally not something that has to be put right before you can rest easy .
And that 's why " Someone is wrong on the internet " is funnier than " Someone on the internet is wrong . "
[ Jonathan Weinberg writes :
I agree with you entirely , but I want to make more explicit a point I think is already implicit in your post :
What 's funny about the sentence is the delayed recognition .
That is , we read it as " Someone is wrong [ huh ?
so what ?
people are wrong all the time ] on the Internet [ oh , on the Internet !
well , yeah , I guess that is a different story .
If someone is wrong * on the Internet * , it needs to be put right immediately .
I can relate to that . ]

A law school professor and former criminal defense attorney tell you why you should never agree to be interviewed by the police .
Initially , Nvidia has presented the new GameWorks Flow tech around 12 months ago , in parallel with GameWorks SDK 3.1 .
When it was presented , it was regarded as an experimental feature that was still in the works .
However , it has been later released during the year as version 1.0 , with a direct integration in Unreal Engine 4 to be expected in the 2nd quarter of 2017 .
What Flow tech does
What this new technology seeks to achieve is to make the effects of smoke , fire and combustible fluids appear more realistic .
This is obviously targeted for game development and there has been a video demonstration of the GameWorks Flow tech used with DX12 .
Nvidia apparently seeks to implement Flow as soon as possible , especially with its integration with Unreal Engine 4 .
In the tech demo presented , you can see how Flow being implemented using DX12 .
It showcases a sort of industrial manufacturing line where blasts of fire , gas and smoke are rendered with the new tech .
Afterwards , a metallic object is suspended on this hellish production line and receives constant bursts of fire , not dissimilar to a flamethrower ’s effect , while it rotates above the point of exist for the flames .
Besides the flames and smoke , the metallic box also features various surface effects that reflect and react based on the fire .
This new technology by Nvidia is said to have implementations for both DX11 and DX12 , and will be capable of running on all modern DX11 and DX12 graphical processing units .
It will be interested to see which game will be implementing this technology first and to what extent .
This will also beg the question as to how much it will hog a gaming system .
A simple flame here and there might not do much to affect FPS .
This certainly is n't the first time anyone has mounted a video camera to an RC car and taken it for a spin , but the new system from Fat Shark to do so is certainly the most comprehensive yet .
A set of wireless VR goggles provide the display , and there 's a built - in accelerometer in the goggles to control the tilt and pan of the camera installed on the car .
You can buy the system with the car , or purchase the components separately to hook onto a plane or for some other nefarious purpose .
No word on price , but we would 've traded our NES and two good tubs of Legos for a shot at this growing up .
Somebody has to keep that up - to - no - good sister of ours and her dastardly playmates in check .

Excerpts from Bob Davis and Amy Chozick 's interview with Barack Obama on his campaign bus in Flint , Mich .
Some questions have been paraphrased .
WSJ : I wanted to talk about long - term economic growth , sort of following on your speech .
I noticed that in an interesting way you use Lincoln , FDR and JFK , heroes in many ways .
Maybe you can talk to me a little bit about your view of the government 's role in economic growth .
Sen . Obama :
This dates back even further , to Alexander Hamilton .
The strength of our economy has always been the dynamism of the private sector , but at critical junctures , particularly when we 're at a transformative time , say the shift from agricultural era to the industrial era , where you 've got some broad - based investment that needs to be made , they 're very expensive .
They 're difficult for any private investor to want to make on their own . …
I think Lincoln 's Homestead
Act or the land - grant college system was a great example of opening up the West .
It 's still the American people and business taking advantage of these opportunities , but you needed the government to help get them started .
Obviously , infrastructure is a classic example of these types of investments , whether it is the interstate highway system or the Internet .
I think education is another example , whether it's the creation of public schools or the GI Bill after World War II .
I think now we need to be thinking about similar investments in critical areas like the ones I listed today .
BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Hezbollah is set to achieve its long - held goal of winning the release of Lebanese prisoners held in Israel this week , emboldening the Iranian - backed group which has emerged even more powerful from recent conflicts .

Two years after standing its ground in a 34 - day war with Israel , Hezbollah has reinforced its military wing and routed its U.S. - backed adversaries in Lebanon -- defying the United States , which sees it as a terrorist group and proxy of Tehran .
Hezbollah is now seeking reconciliation with its Lebanese rivals , hoping to cool sectarian tensions inflamed by its May takeover of Beirut .
Those enmities could pose a threat to both the Shi’ite group and Lebanon if left unhealed .
“ Hezbollah , far from being weakened in the 2006 war or in the subsequent political battles in Beirut , is stronger than ever , ” said Andrew Exum , a researcher on the group based at Kings College , London .
For Iran , the stature of a group established with the help of its Revolutionary Guards in 1982 is a great asset in its own confrontation with the United States and other powers over its nuclear ambitions and influence in the Middle East .
Hezbollah has replenished and expanded its arsenal since the 2006 war .
Estimated to have received military and other aid worth several billion dollars from Iran , it is seen as one of the region ’s toughest fighting forces despite the February assassination of its commander , Imad Moughniyah .
Hezbollah brought some of its military power to bear on the streets of Beirut in May when it briefly took over Muslim areas of the city , effectively imposing its terms for an end to 18 months of political conflict with the governing coalition .
“ Hezbollah is now certain that its position is guaranteed by the ( Lebanese ) military and the government , ” said Suleiman Taqieddin , a columnist with as - Safir newspaper , which is sympathetic to the opposition alliance led by Hezbollah .
A Qatari- mediated agreement after the street fighting met the main demands of Hezbollah and its allies -- a domestic triumph for a group which commands the loyalty of a majority of Lebanese Shi’ites , the country ’s biggest single community .
But the Doha settlement sidestepped many issues at the heart of conflict in Lebanon , including the fate of Hezbollah ’s arms .
Having shaken off foreign and local pressure to disarm , nobody expects the group to give up its guns any time soon .
But with sectarian animosity at its worst since the 1975 - 90 civil war , Hezbollah ’s military clout is also a threat to the group ’s standing in the medium term , said Nabil Boumonsef , a columnist with the pro-governing coalition an - Nahar newspaper .
SEEKING RECONCILIATION
“ In the same measure as Hezbollah is strengthened by its weapons , it is weakened internally because it inspires the fear of all .
Weapons in Lebanon cause fear and will draw in more weapons , ” he said .
Seeking to ease tensions , Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has stressed the need for reconciliation with rivals , the most prominent of whom is Sunni politician Saad al - Hariri .
Nasrallah has tried to use the prisoner swap with Israel that is expected to take place on Wednesday as a platform for internal rapprochement , calling it “ a national accomplishment ” .
Hezbollah is to exchange two Israeli soldiers for five Lebanese said by Nasrallah to be the last held by Israel .
The soldiers -- believed dead although Hezbollah has not said so -- were seized in a cross - border raid which sparked the 2006 war .
“ This occasion is a unifying , national occasion , ” Nasrallah has declared .
But full reconciliation needs the support of Hariri and his foreign backers , including Saudi Arabia .
The Sunni-ruled kingdom , which has its own Shi’ite minority and is concerned about the spread of Iranian influence , may not see acquiescing in Lebanon ’s new power balance as in its interest .
Even though a national unity government was formed last week after weeks of wrangling , sectarian tensions still smolder .
“ Hezbollah ’s early May actions inflamed the Sunni ‘ street ’ in Lebanon and contributed to a dramatic increase in sectarian tensions , ” said U.S. Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Donald Kerr .
“ Lebanon has seen an upswing of rearmament among all factions during the last year or more and the events of early May will no doubt increase this trend , ” he said in a May 29 address to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
“ The way ahead in Lebanon is uncertain . ”
WASHINGTON  Hoping to stretch a safety net under the nation ’s tumbling housing market , the Senate on Saturday overwhelmingly approved a huge package of legislation that includes a program to save hundreds of thousands of families from losing their homes to foreclosure .
The legislation is the latest in a series of extraordinary interventions this year by the Bush administration , Congress and the Federal Reserve as they seek to limit shockwaves in the housing sector from rippling across the American economy and the world financial system .
In the process , the central bank and taxpayers have taken on what critics warn are incalculable liabilities and risk .
The bill grants the Treasury Department broad authority to safeguard the nation ’s two mortgage finance giants , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , potentially by spending tens of billions of dollars in federal money to prevent the collapse of the companies , which own or guarantee nearly half of the nation ’s $ 12 trillion in mortgages .
To accommodate the rescue plan for the mortgage companies , the bill raises the national debt ceiling to $ 10.6 trillion , an increase of $ 800 billion and the first time that the limit on the government ’s credit card has grown to 14 digits .

WASHIMIYA , Japan --
For many years , Washinomiya Shrine has been a quiet place of worship , attracting just a trickle of sightseers to this sleepy town outside Tokyo .
Then last summer , priests started noticing a new kind of visitor .
Young men , some clad in miniskirts , stockings and pastel - colored wigs , were lining up for photos at the shrine 's vermilion gate .
Over the big New Year 's holiday in January , nearly 300,000 such visitors -- almost 10 times the town 's population -- showed up , scores of them clad in outfits resembling ...
ALMOST a year after launching what he thinks is the phone to change all phones , Steve Jobs , the boss of Apple , took to the stage again this week to introduce its second version , the iPhone 3G .
In the past year Mr Jobs , who had surgery for pancreatic cancer in 2004 , has visibly aged .
Looking emaciated , he farmed out large parts of his speech , which is usually a big marketing and media event , to other presenters .
But he still held the crowd in thrall as ever .
The new iPhone mostly addresses the shortcomings of the old one .
It has GPS satellite - positioning technology that will allow a new and exciting category of services , such as location tracking , that depend upon the phone knowing where it is .
It works with fast third - generation ( 3G ) mobile networks , not just slower 2G ones .
And it panders to corporate customers with features such as better integration with their systems and “ remote wiping ” of data if a handset goes missing .
Perhaps above all , it is a lot cheaper , starting at $ 199 , just below what the industry sees as the pain threshold for the mass market .
What Mr Jobs did not say was that the reduction comes largely from a change in Apple 's relations with mobile operators , such as AT&T in America .
Operators will subsidise the new handsets to make this low price possible , but will also increase monthly usage fees — and will no longer pass a share of those fees to Apple .
This brings Apple in line with the business model used by other handset - makers , such as Nokia and Samsung .
Getting operators to agree to Apple 's novel revenue - sharing scheme seems to have hindered sales .
Evidently Mr Jobs hopes to gain more from faster handset sales than he will lose by giving up his share of usage fees .
By cutting the iPhone 's price and increasing the number of countries where it is legally available from six to 70 , Mr Jobs hopes to reach his goal of selling 10 m iPhones by the end of the year .
( So far , 6 m have been sold . )
Competitors quickly tried to douse another conflagration of iPhone hype .
“ I see this as a catch - up release for Apple , ” says Andrew Lees , head of mobile businesses at Microsoft , an arch-rival which provides software to many handset - makers .
“ We outsell them by two to one . ”
He points out , legitimately , that many phones using Microsoft Mobile software have long had both GPS and 3G , and have always tied into corporate computer systems .
Finland 's Nokia sells the most “ smartphones ” , capturing 45 % of the world market in the first three months of this year , and Canada 's Research In Motion ( RIM ) , the maker of the famous BlackBerry , is second , with 13 % .
Even in America , where Nokia is weak , RIM leads , with 42 % , followed by Apple with 20 % .
But Apple 's impact on the industry has been greater than its market share suggests .
The iPhone has set new standards in design and ease of use .
A telling statistic from Mr Jobs is that 98 % of users browse the web on their iPhones , 94 % use it for e-mail , and 80 % use ten or more features — including , of course , the built - in iPod music - player .
As Mr Jobs joked , many users of other smartphones , with their clunky menus , cannot even find ten features .
This points to the ultimate role of the iPhone for Mr Jobs , Apple and the industry .
There were personal computers before 1984 , but it took the Macintosh , which Apple launched that year , to popularise the icon- based graphical interface that others copied , kicking off the PC era .
There were digital music - players before 2001 , but Apple 's iPod made them both ubiquitous and user - friendly .
In the same way , says Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies , an analyst who has followed Apple throughout its history , the iPhone , with its elegant touch - screen interface , seems likely to be the gadget that sets the direction that others will follow in the era of mobility .
To bring that about , Apple is now turning the iPhone into a hand - held computer and allowing other firms to write software to run on it .
Other handset - makers are doing the same , but the iPhone 's operating system and programming tools , on display this week , are better than theirs .
There is no doubt that Mr Jobs is trying to lead a third revolution in consumer technology in his lifetime .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A congresswoman said Thursday that her " jaw dropped " when military doctors told her that four in 10 women at a veterans hospital reported being sexually assaulted while in the military .
Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach said she was raped by a fellow Marine .
A Marine has been charged in her death .
A government report indicates that the numbers could be even higher .
Rep. Jane Harman , D - California , spoke before a House panel investigating the way the military handles reports of sexual assault .
She said she recently visited a Veterans Affairs hospital in the Los Angeles area , where women told her horror stories of being raped in the military .
" My jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military , " said Harman , who has long sought better protection of women in the military .
" Twenty - nine percent say they were raped during their military service .
They spoke of their continued terror , feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since .
" We have an epidemic here , " she said .
" Women serving in the U.S. military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in Iraq . "
As of July 24 , 100 women had died in Iraq , according to the Pentagon .
In 2007 , Harman said , only 181 out of 2,212 reports of military sexual assaults , or 8 percent , were referred to courts martial .
By comparison , she said , 40 percent of those arrested in the civilian world on such charges are prosecuted .
Defense statistics show that military commanders took unspecified action , which can include anything from punishment to dismissal , in an additional 419 cases .
But when it came time for the military to defend itself , the panel was told that the Pentagon 's top official on sexual abuse , Dr. Kaye Whitley , was ordered not to show up despite a subpoena .
" I do n't know what you 're trying to cover up here , but we 're not going to allow it , " Rep.
Henry Waxman , D - California , said to the Defense official who relayed the news of Whitley 's no -show .
" This is unacceptable . "
Rep . John Tierney , the panel 's chairman and a Democrat from Massachusetts , angrily responded , " these actions by the Defense Department are inexplicable . "
" The Defense Department appears to be willfully and blatantly advising Dr. Whitley not to comply with a duly authorized congressional subpoena , " Tierney said .
An Army official who did testify said the Army takes allegations of sexual abuse extremely seriously .
" Even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier , and it's a betrayal of the Army 's core values , " Lt. Gen. Michael Rochelle said .
The committee also heard from Mary Lauterbach , the mother of Lance Cpl. Maria Lauterbach , a 20 - year - old pregnant Marine who was killed in December , allegedly by a fellow Marine .
Mary Lauterbach said her daughter filed a rape claim with the military against Marine Cpl. Cesar Laurean seven months before he was accused of killing her .
Watch dead Marine 's mom demand change »
" I believe that Maria would be alive today if the Marines had provided a more effective system to protect the victims of sexual assault , " she said .
In the months after her daughter filed the rape claim , she said , the military did n't seem to take her seriously , and the onus was on " Maria to connect the dots . "
" The victim should not have the burden to generate evidence for the command , " Lauterbach told the Subcommittee on National Security and Foreign Affairs .
" Maria is dead , but there will be many more victims in the future , I promise you .
I 'm here to ask you to do what you can to help change how the military treats victims of crime and to ensure the victims receive the support and protection they need and they deserve . "
Another woman , Ingrid Torres , described being raped on a U.S. base in Korea when she worked with the American Red Cross .
" I was raped while I slept , " she said .
The man who assaulted her , she said , was a flight director who was found guilty and dismissed from the Air Force .
Fighting back tears , Torres added , " he still comes after me in my dreams . "
The Government Accountability Office released preliminary results from an investigation into sexual assaults in the military and the Coast Guard .
The GAO found that the " occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported . "
" At the 14 installations where GAO administered its survey , 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months .
Of these , 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault , " the GAO said .
The office found that the military and Coast Guard have established policies to address sexual assault but that the implementation of the programs is hampered by an array of factors , including that " most , but not all , commanders support the programs . "
" Left unchecked , these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed , " the GAO said .
Tierney said , " what 's at stake here goes to the very core of the values of the military and the nation itself .
" When our sons and daughters put their lives on the line to defend the rest of us , the last thing they should fear is being attacked by one of our own . "

Bjork 's cry came after a performance of song Declare Independence
Entertainers from outside China who have attended events that " threaten national sovereignty " will be banned from the country , its government says .
Any artists who " whip up ethnic hatred " during performances would also be banned , the ministry of culture said ,
The announcement comes after Bjork shouted " Tibet , Tibet " at a Shanghai concert in March .
Talk of Tibetan independence is considered taboo in China , which has ruled the territory since 1951 .
" Any artistic group or individual who have ever engaged in activities which threaten our national sovereignty will not be allowed in , " the ministry said in a statement on its website .
The ban was extended to entertainers who " threaten national unity " , " advocate obscenity or feudalism and superstition " or who " violate religious policy or cultural norms " , the statement added .
Encore approval
Bjork 's cry came after a powerful performance of her song Declare Independence at the concert .
China 's culture ministry said after the outburst that it " broke Chinese law and hurt Chinese people 's feelings " .
And it pledged to " further tighten controls " .
The latest announcement follows the banning of pop festivals and the tightening of rules on outdoor events in the months leading up to the Olympics as the government fears embarrassing protests from crowds .
The ministry has said that even encores must be approved in advance .
Taiwanese pop star Chang Hui-Mei was banned from playing in China for a year after she sang Taiwan 's national anthem during an inauguration ceremony for the island 's president in 2000 .
China considers Taiwan , which has governed its own affairs for half a century , part of its territory .
Kodi is a great multimedia center .
It allows you to easily watch your favorite content .
Live TV , Sports , Movies ,
Shows , it gives you access to it all through a wide range of video addons .
I have been a Kodi user since the time that I can’t even remember .
What I like most about Kodi is that it can be customized in a number of ways and a Kodi skin is one of the most effective ways to do it .
The default Kodi skin called Estuary is fine .
But it ’s too commercial .
I mean , it ’s not exactly very interesting .
Fortunately , you can make it more interactive and happen with these best Kodi skins .
Kodi skins not only improve the aesthetic appeal of the interface , but they also make it more user - friendly .
If you ’ve used Kodi Builds , you know that builds also give Kodi a visual makeover with their own skins .
In fact , several versions of Kodi even use some of these skins .
But the problem with builds is that they install a lot of add - ons and repositories and make Kodi bulky .
If you already have your favorite add - ons , then all you need is a skin that quickly transforms the UI and improves your experience .
HOW TO INSTALL KODI SKINS
Before we start , let me give you the quick steps to install a Kodi skin .
It wo n’t take more than 6 steps .
Here we are providing steps Aeon Nox Kodi skin .
Refer kodiskins.com to get latest kodi skins updates and installation procedures .
1. Open Kodi Settings .
2. Click on Interface .
3. Click Skin on the left , then click Skin on the right .
4 . Choose your skin .
If the desired skin is not in the list , click on Have more …
5 . Click on the skin you want to apply and wait for it to download and install .
6. Click Yes when prompted .
BEST KODI SKINS
Here is the list of the best Kodi skins that work on both , Kodi Leia and Krypton .
There are several common skins between the two platforms , I chose the ones that count .
The others just were n’t good enough .
1. AEON NOX
Aeon Nox is probably the best Kodi skin out there today .
Following a minimal design idea , this skin makes Kodi incredibly simple for you .
It ’s a delicious departure from the estuary of ordinary Kodi skin .
This skin takes the minimalist approach and makes the Kodi interface visually appealing without being flashy .
The simplicity of the layout allows you to quickly familiarize yourself with it .
It ’s no wonder that many versions of Kodi use this skin .
Aeon Nox allows various customizations and configurations to adjust the skin to your preferences .
It ’s a lightweight skin and therefore does n’t cause noticeable performance changes even on low - spec devices like FireStick .
It is indeed a wonderful skin to have .
2. BELLO
Bello is another minimal Kodi skin that gives you a nice new way to experience your favorite media center .
Since Bello is minimal skin , you wo n’t find many bells and whistles .
However , if you are looking for a friendly and easy to use interface for your system resources , Bello is the Kodi skin to choose .
This skin is available as Bello 7 on Kodi 17.6 and Bello 6 on Leia .
Again , there is n’t much to choose from between the two versions except for some petty cosmetic variations .
Bello does not support the mouse and prompts you to disable it in the settings .
Although you can still interact with the mouse , the large unauthorized mouse pointer is not very convenient to use .
Therefore , this skin is more suitable for touch and remote control devices , such as FireStick .
Nonetheless , Bello is a good skin to have and deserves to be part of our list of the best Kodi skins .
3.BOX
This is another nice skin for Kodi 18 and Kodi 17.6 that I have been using for quite some time .
The box features a panel - based design with an organized layout .
The skin has a professional look and a futuristic appeal .
The design of the panel makes it user - friendly and intuitive skin .
The skin home screen organizes one category at a time on the display .
Movies , TV Shows , Music , and Live TV are the default categories .
However , you can add or remove categories in the skin settings .
Besides streaming categories , you can also access utility options like add - ons , settings , images , favorites , personalization , etc. from the main screen .
Even though this Kodi skin does n’t allow you to add picture backgrounds to the main screen , you can change the background color .
There is a large palette to choose the colors .
Besides the colors , you can customize this skin in many other ways .
Overall , Box is one of the best Kodi skins for a wonderful Kodi experience .
Try .
4. CONFLUENCE
Confluence has been around for a long time and it ’s easily one of the best Kodi skins you ’ll find .
It ’s no surprise that Confluence is used in multiple versions of Kodi such as Durex ( now defunct ) and Xanax ( Durex replacement ) .
Confluence is n’t exactly minimal , but it ’s not too flashy , either .
So if you are looking for skin that is halfway between too simple and too ostentatious , you must try Confluence .
The home menu is placed closer to the center than the bottom and crosses from left to right across the screen .
You will find important categories on the menu bar such as Videos , Music , Add-ons , systems to help you get started immediately .
Version 17.6 of this skin comes with a predefined background .
The Kodi 18 version has no background .
However , you can choose a new background image from local storage .
It allows you to add or remove default home menu categories .
You can add the Now Playing visualization to the background .
And very importantly , it allows you to add additional shortcuts to desired home menu categories .
This allows you to choose your favorite video modules directly from the home screen .
5. EMINENCE
It ’s not been long since I came across this Kodi skin .
I was absolutely sure that this will be part of this list of the best Kodi skins .
Let ’s talk about the home screen first .
The home menu features an elegant block design hanging at the bottom of the screen .
It looks like the interface of a TV operating system .
The tiled design is not only futuristic and visually appealing , but it also adds more functionality to the skin .
The overall skin design is so crisp , crisp , and simple that you can get started instantly .
The home menu includes videos , movies , TV shows , and music , among other categories .
You can add or remove categories in the skin settings .
In fact , you can even change the labels of menu items .
The skin also allows you to add a separate background image to each category .
Besides the background and home screen , you can also customize the library , header , colors , on - screen display ( OSD ) , and more .
So , here is our list of the best Kodi skins for Kodi .
I have personally tested these versions and wrote this article from my personal experience .
Hope you find it useful .

Newswise — Northeastern University scientists have discovered a new and unique DNA binding property of a protein in E. coli .
Penny J. Beuning , Assistant Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology , spent the last two years researching double and single - stranded DNA binding of E. coli DNA polymerase III alpha protein and notes that her findings have potential for developing a new antibacterial target .
Beuning 's results have recently been published in ACS Chemical Biology in an article titled " Distinct Double - and Single - Stranded DNA Binding of E. coli Replicative DNA Polymerase III Alpha Subunit " .
This work represents the collaborative effort of the Northeastern laboratories of Beuning and Mark C. Williams , Associate Professor of Physics , and involved researchers Micah J. McCauley , Leila Shokri , and Jana Sefcikova from both laboratories .
Additionally , ÄŒeslovas Venclovas , of the Institute of Biotechnology in Lithuania , provided computational modeling expertise to the project .
The project took advantage of the single - molecule expertise in the Williams laboratory and used a series of optical tweezers experiments to find that the DNA polymerase subunit of the 10 - subunit bacterial replicative DNA enzyme has affinity for both double and single - stranded DNA in distinct subdomains of the protein .
DNA polymerase III is responsible for copying the entire genome of E. coli every time a cell divides .
The alpha subunit is the enzyme that actually copies the DNA , and that activity is well - known .
However , there are additional parts of the protein that were not characterized and that the researches suspected had DNA binding activity .
The researchers first confirmed that the protein binds both double - and single - stranded DNA .
Using protein engineering methods to isolate protein domains , they were able to localize the two different DNA binding activities to two different domains of the protein .
" The single - stranded DNA binding component appears to be passive , because the protein does not assist in melting but instead binds to single - stranded regions which are already separated by force , " said Beuning .
" Detecting this kind of binding would be difficult or impossible using traditional methods of assaying DNA binding activity . "
The researchers ' results demonstrated that single - stranded DNA binding is localized to an OB - fold domain while a tandem , helix - hairpin - helix motif contributes significantly to double - stranded DNA binding .
Single - stranded DNA binding by the subunit occurs only after single - stranded DNA has been fully melted by force .
This unusual behavior , noted Beuning , may be functionally important as single - stranded DNA binding will likely occur only after other replication processes create single - stranded DNA .
" It is crucial to understand how these kinds of massive biological machines function in the cellular environment in order to fully exploit their potential as drug targets , " added Beuning .

Last week , the House was denied the opportunity to improve a bill that sought to bleed 70 million barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
Dems use rules to keep lid on oil drilling
Putting aside whether Missouri quarterback Chase Daniel was unfairly denied the Heisman Trophy last December , the resolution the House considered this week honoring Florida ’s Tim Tebow for being selected as college football ’s 2007 MVP did n’t engender much opposition .
Neither did the one congratulating the University of Tennessee ’s women ’s basketball program for winning its eighth national championship ; nor the one naming a post office in upstate New York .
That ’s why each of these bills was shuffled through the House under a policy known as “ suspension of the rules , ” an expedited process for handling noncontroversial legislation requiring the approval of two - thirds present to pass .
The only trade - off ?
Debate time is severely restricted , and not a single amendment may be offered or considered on the floor .
Advertisement
But whereas the suspension calendar used to be the near - exclusive province of athletic acknowledgements and postal taxonomy , the majority leadership has taken to employing the process for a new purpose these days : bringing up controversial energy legislation designed to deny their own members — and ours — any chance to add a single gallon of new American energy to the pipeline .
The strategy was on display last month , as Democrats suspended the rules to call up their discredited “ Use It or Lose It ” bill .
A week later , the House voted on — but barely even spoke about — a bill to “ unlock ” 24 million Alaskan acres where we have already been drilling wells for more than a generation .
Then , last week , the House was denied the opportunity to improve a bill that sought to bleed 70 million barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve — all because Democratic leaders were afraid to debate the merits of unlocking billions of barrels of American energy from other , more abundant sources .
Now , with only two legislative days remaining before Congress takes off for the summer , reports indicate we ’ll see the fourth iteration of this strategy this week — in the form of a bill to punish “ speculators ” for betting that Congress ’ 27 - year - old ban on accessing American energy for American consumers will remain in place .
But it ’s not nameless , faceless speculators who are denying billions of barrels of American oil from reaching the consumer markets — that dubious honor belongs to Congress alone .
And it ’s not that genuine , bipartisan solutions to our current energy crisis do n’t exist ; it ’s just that not a single one of them has been permitted to see the light of day .
Nor has the fear that has gripped the majority over the prospect of debating a legitimate energy policy been limited to hiding behind the suspension calendar .
The congressional appropriations process has also been indefinitely shelved — if and until the majority can figure out a way to silence the growing chorus of members demanding that Congress allow an up - or - down vote on pro-energy measures .
For his part , Appropriations Committee Chairman Dave Obey ( D - Wis. ) has argued the appropriations process is no place to hold a debate on the need to explore for more American energy .
But that rationale falls flat when one considers that it ’s in his legislation — the Interior spending bill — where the 27 - year - old ban on accessing America ’s abundant reserves of deep - ocean energy resides .
It ’s also where you ’ll find a provision preventing the Interior Department from spending one thin dime on the environmental assessment work needed to develop the potentially 800 billion barrels of oil shale that lay dormant out West .
But while Democrats continue to demonstrate that you can run from the energy debate , time will show — and the American people will ensure — that you can not hide from it .
Not when motorists are being forced to shell out $ 4 per gallon for gasoline ; not when truckers are spending more than a $ 1,000 a week on diesel fuel ; not when the American people open their electricity bills in October ; not when our dangerous dependence on foreign energy is transferring hundreds of billions of dollars a year to countries around the world with strategic interests diametrically opposed to ours .
Now is the time to debate the status of our current energy policy — not tomorrow , not when we return from recess , not after a new president is sworn into office .
And to ensure we have that debate , Republicans will fight this week to prevent Democratic leaders from shutting down the chamber for the whole month of August .
But whether we have that debate will depend on the degree to which Democrats genuinely want to find a solution .
The substance of what we expect to see on the floor this week suggests they are not .
Rep . Roy Blunt is the Republican whip of the House and is in his sixth term serving Missouri ’s 7th Congressional District .

Because of their minority status , most budding Austrian economists must endure graduate training in the mainstream orthodoxy before earning their Ph.D.s .
As a recent graduate of New York University , I thought it might be useful to highlight some of the major differences I perceived between Austrian economics and the neoclassical , New Keynesian paradigm .
The following list is by no means exhaustive , nor do I claim that it represents the essential tenets of Austrian theory .
However , I hope my discussion will encourage current graduate students to keep their spirits up and finish their dissertations .
I. Method
The most obvious difference between the Austrians and the mainstream is the choice of method .
The Austrians start from the fact that human beings act purposively to achieve their subjectively chosen ends .
From this " action axiom " the Austrians ( in the tradition of Ludwig von Mises ) derive as many implications as possible .
So long as the deductive chains of reasoning are free from error , the conclusions reached are a priori true , containing as much validity as a proof in Euclidean geometry .
The mainstream , in contrast , practices economics by the construction of simplified models of the world .
From the outset , unrealistic assumptions are made when establishing the " laws " governing behavior in the artificial world being studied .
Typical models contain either one or a continuum ( " uncountably infinite " number ) of agents , who usually live forever and have the selfish preferences mocked by critics of the homo economicus view of man .
Macro models will very often have only one or two goods in the entire economy .
The justification for such admittedly unrealistic assumptions is a pragmatic one ; because the mainstream economist is concerned primarily with the determination of equilibrium states in the model , the equations describing such states cannot be too difficult to solve .
Appeal is often made to the natural sciences , and above all else to physics , where simpler models are sought which best " approximate " the results of Nature .
On this point , all I will say is that the Austrians have certainly devoted more careful thought than the mainstream to the methodological problems involved .
The Austrians have argued that economics is an entirely new branch of science , whose problems are not at all suitable for the approach of physicists .
II . Individual Choice
If you study Austrian economics , you will learn that a central tenet of the school is methodological individualism .
This means that for an Austrian , an " explanation " of an economic phenomenon must ultimately start from the choices of individual actors .
This does n't mean that Austrians only focus on " micro " phenomena ; indeed , many of the most important Austrian insights involve macro problems such as unemployment and inflation .
Nonetheless , even here the Austrian always couches his analysis in terms of the incentives and behavior of the typical individual , in order to understand the aggregate effects that require explanation .
On a formal level , the neoclassical mainstream too involves the individual and his subjective preferences .
An equilibrium state ( in a market setting ) is defined as a set of prices and behaviors for each agent such that every agent maximizes his utility , given his budget and the ( exogenous ) prices .
However , notice that even at this stage there is a problem :
If everyone acts as a " price taker , " i.e. if everyone takes market prices as data to which behavior must be adjusted , then how do these prices get established in the first place ? ,
On this point , another difference between the Austrians and the mainstream is the latter 's focus on indifference .
In an equilibrium state , an agent in a neoclassical model is indifferent to any small change in his consumption decisions ; an extra penny spent on any available good ( so long as the agent has purchased at least some of the good in question ) will yield the same increment in utility .
The Austrians , in contrast , stress that human action involves the choice of a over b , where alternative a must be strictly preferred ( as demonstrated by the choice itself ) .
Beyond this , however , there is another sense in which the mainstream focuses on indifference .
This occurs when , because of the assumptions going into the model , the analyst wants to ensure that no trading takes place .
In these cases , the goal of the analyst is to find the prices necessary to ensure that the individual agent ( who does n't care about the economy - wide constraints ) does n't want to trade .
For example , I had a macro exam question in which there was only a single , perishable consumption good ; in this world , physical saving was impossible .
Moreover , all agents were identical , and so there was no room for intertemporal exchange at all .
The question asked , " What is the equilibrium interest rate in this economy ? "
The answer was to find the interest rate at which every ( identical ) agent would be happy to consume his endowments every period , rather than altering his consumption path through exchange ( which was impossible by stipulation ) .
In another exam question , I was told that a single agent owned a tree , which would periodically yield fruit ( the consumption good ) .
The question asked the equilibrium price of a share to the tree .
Inasmuch as there were no other agents who could buy the tree , this seemed an odd question .
But again , the point was to find the price of a share such that the agent would be indifferent between selling ownership of the tree ( to a nonexistent second party ) versus retaining ownership and consuming the flow of fruit dividends .
III .
Money
If I could pick just one area of economic theory in which the mainstream is weakest , it would be money .
Simply put , there is no role for money whatsoever in the typical mainstream model .
In a hyper - rich general equilibrium model , there are markets for every conceivable good , in every period of time , in every possible state of the world , and agents have either perfect foresight or rational expectations ( in which there is no systematic bias in predictions ) .
In this setting , there is no need for a unit of account or medium of exchange , because all future actions can be specified ( perhaps contingent on random events ) in the initial period .
On the other hand , grossly simplified macro models contain only one or two goods , and hence render a medium of exchange superfluous .
Naturally , the mainstream models ( especially macro ones ) do contain money ; there is simply no other way to deal with issues such as inflation and Federal Reserve policy .
But in order to get the agents of the model to hold money , all sorts of ad hoc assumptions are employed .
For example , the desire for liquidity might be built right into an agent 's utility function , so that cash itself gives satisfaction the same way owning a Picasso might .
Another approach is to assume " cash - in - advance constraints , " in which the agent needs a certain amount of money in order to complete transactions .
The problem with these remedies , of course , is that in the world of the neoclassical model , there is generally no reason for an agent to gain utility from money , or for firms to insist on cash - in - advance .
This problem casts doubt on the use of the models themselves ; how do we know that " optimal " Fed policy in the model will translate into the real world , when the true function of money is absent in the model ?
In contrast to the ad hoc approach of the mainstream , the Austrians have a solid grasp of the place of monetary theory in economics .
Indeed , even an unbiased historian of economic thought would acknowledge that Ludwig von Mises was one of the earliest and strongest proponents of a unified theory of exchange , in which marginal utility analysis explained not only the valuation of consumption goods , but of units of money as well .
IV .
Time
Another huge difference between the Austrians and the mainstream is the former 's emphasis on time .
Although the mainstream has improved considerably on this issue — most notably in the work of Sir John Hicks — nonetheless the Austrians have a superior grasp of the time structure of production .
Austrian theory does not avoid the heterogeneity of capital goods , and the tremendous problems this heterogeneity poses for long - term coordination of production and consumption plans .
The typical mainstream macro model , in contrast , still assumes that there is a single good , serving as both capital and consumption , and that the entire body of produced means of production in an economy can be summarized by a single number indicating the " capital stock . "
Moreover , it is typical to " solve " macro models not merely by calculating the equilibrium state , but the equilibrium steady state , i.e. a position in which all actions repeat themselves , every period , forever .
It is quite rare indeed for the mainstream economist to consider the convergence path to such steady states ( or to consider the adverse consequences of various government policies during the adjustment period ) .
V. Institutions
Because of the Austrians ' more modest view of the capabilities of human computation and foresight , there is a far greater role for institutional analysis in the Austrian paradigm .
Earlier I explained that the institution of money itself cannot be easily analyzed from a neoclassical point of view .
The issue , however , is not merely technical .
Failure to understand the role of money can have profound political implications .
The best example is Ludwig von Mises 's famous critique of socialism .
Mises argued that without market prices for the means of production , socialist planners — even if they were truly benevolent and wished only to help their subjects — could not rationally allocate resources .
Mainstream economists eventually conceded that some system of " prices " would be necessary in a socialist State , but felt that the government could still retain formal ownership of all capital goods .
Hayek and others argued that the proposals of " market socialism " would still fail , and with the demise of the Soviet Union many academics began to take the Austrians seriously .
In my own experience , I realized the mainstream 's failure to understand institutional differences during a lecture from a mathematical economist .
He was explaining a puzzle that had arisen with the use of a certain type of production function .
If I recall correctly , the problem was that the relationships between interest rates , capital per worker , and GDP were not consistent between the United States and the Soviet Union .
One possible explanation was that the U.S. had better technology , but this was n't satisfactory because Soviet plant managers could obviously attend American engineering schools .
What struck me was that it never even occurred to the professor , or to the students who offered suggestions , that the fact that one system was capitalist and the other communist might have some relevance .
Instead , they sought a purely technical solution to the apparent paradox .
VI .
Business cycle
Finally , the last area of comparative advantage for the Austrians I wish to highlight is the business cycle .
Relying on ( in my opinion ) their superior understanding of the complexity of the capital structure , and of the vital role money prices play in the coordination of intertemporal plans , only the Austrian economists can hope to offer a satisfactory explanation of the widespread errors that characterize a recession .
The Austrians argue that recessions are the inevitable outcome of prior booms , in which entrepreneurs — goaded by artificial government reductions in the interest rate — make overly optimistic guesses as to the profitability of their projects .
In consequence , the entrepreneurs hire labor and buy capital goods for which there are insufficient real savings .
When the entrepreneurs realize their errors , they attempt to scale back their plans , and the widespread occurrence of this adjustment is what we know as a recession .
The mainstream , in contrast , offers Keynesian models in which the economy becomes trapped in a state of insufficient demand , or real - business - cycle models in which " technology shocks " cause recessions .
Aside from the inherent problems with these models , there remains the empirical failure of the mainstream advisors to prevent recessions with their " scientific " management of the economy .
Conclusion
The above points focus on some of the major differences between Austrian and neoclassical economics .
I have been harsh with my treatment of the mainstream , but I believe my criticism has been fair .
It is true that there are many areas ( e.g. game theory ) in which the formal rigor of the mainstream allows for precision that the verbal approach of the Austrians cannot provide .
However , when it comes to the central and crucial areas of economic theory , I still believe that the Austrian school offers the best foundation for a young economist .

University of Georgia researchers have developed an effective technology for reducing contamination of dangerous bacteria on food .
The new antimicrobial wash rapidly kills Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 on foods ranging from fragile lettuce to tomatoes , fruits , poultry products and meats .
It is made from inexpensive and readily available ingredients that are recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
The new technology , which has commercial application for the produce , poultry , meat and egg processing industries , is available for licensing from the University of Georgia Research Foundation , Inc. , which has filed a patent application on the new technology .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that , in the U.S. alone , foodborne pathogens are responsible for 76 million illnesses every year .
Of the people affected by those illnesses , 300,000 are hospitalized and more than 5,000 die .
These widespread outbreaks of food - borne illnesses are attributed , in part , to the fast - paced distribution of foods across the nation .
Recently , raw tomatoes caused an outbreak of salmonellosis that sickened more than 300 people in at least 28 states and Canada .
Currently , a chlorine wash is frequently used in a variety of ways to reduce harmful bacteria levels on vegetables , fruits and poultry , but because of chlorine 's sensitivity to food components and extraneous materials released in chlorinated water treatments , many bacteria survive .
Chlorine is toxic at high concentrations , may produce off - flavors and undesirable appearance of certain food products , and it can only be used in conjunction with specialized equipment and trained personnel .
In addition , chlorine may be harmful to the environment .
" We can't rely on chlorine to eliminate pathogens on foods , " said Michael Doyle , one of the new technology 's inventors and director of UGA 's Center for Food Safety .
" This new technology is effective , safe for consumers and food processing plant workers , and does not affect the appearance or quality of the product .
It may actually extend the shelf - life of some types of produce . "
Doyle is an internationally recognized authority on food safety whose research focuses on developing methods to detect and control food - borne bacterial pathogens at all levels of the food continuum , from the farm to the table .
He has served as a scientific advisor to many groups , including the World Health Organization , the Food and Drug Administration , the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency .
The new antimicrobial technology , developed by Doyle and Center for Food Safety researcher Tong Zhao , uses a combination of ingredients that kills bacteria within one to five minutes from application .
It can be used as a spray and immersion solution , and its concentration can be adjusted for treatment of fragile foods such as leafy produce , more robust foods such as poultry , or food preparation equipment and food transportation vehicles .
" The effectiveness , easy storage and application , and low cost of this novel antibacterial make it applicable not only at food processing facilities , but also at points - of - sale and at home , restaurants and military bases .
The development of this technology is timely , given the recent , sequential outbreaks of foodborne pathogens , " said Gennaro Gama , UGARF technology manager in charge of licensing this technology .

Heinz has withdrawn its Deli Mayo TV ad that featured two men sharing a kiss and apologised to viewers after the advertising regulator received about 200 complaints that it was offensive and inappropriate .
The Heinz Deli Mayo ad has been pulled after less than a week on air after viewers complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that it was " offensive " and " inappropriate to see two men kissing " .
Other complaints include that the ad was " unsuitable to be seen by children " and that it raised the difficult problem of parents having to discuss the issue of same - sex relationships with younger viewers .
" It is our policy to listen to consumers .
We recognise that some consumers raised concerns over the content of the ad and this prompted our decision to withdraw it , " said Nigel Dickie , director of corporate affairs for Heinz UK .
Dickie added that the campaign for the new Heinz Deli Mayo product , which was due to run for five weeks , was meant to be humorous and that the company apologised to anyone who felt offended .
The TV ad is the first by Heinz 's new ad agency AMV BBDO since it won the £ 10 m - a - year UK business last year .
AMV BBDO said that the concept behind the campaign is that the product tastes so good , " It 's as if you have your own New York deli man in your kitchen . "
Heinz 's ad opens with a family on a normal morning routine with a young boy and girl getting ready for school and their father preparing for the office .
The young boy and girl go to the kitchen to get their sandwiches , which are being prepared by a man with a New York accent , dressed in a deli serving outfit , who they refer to as " mum " .
When their father goes to get his sandwich he says to mum in the kitchen : " See you tonight love . "
However , mum barks back " Hey , ai n't you forgetting something ? " , at which point the two men share a kiss .
Mum then sends the father off with the words : " Love you .
Straight home from work , sweet cheeks . "
The Heinz TV ad carried an " ex- kids " restriction , meaning it cannot be shown in or around children 's programming , because Heinz Deli Mayo falls foul of Ofcom 's TV ad restrictions relating to products that are high in fat , salt and sugar .
The ASA has not yet decided whether to investigate the complaints about the Heinz ad .
Heinz said it made the decision to stop airing the ad on Friday .

Twenty - five octopuses will today begin twiddling a Rubik 's Cube in the name of scientific research .
Marine biologists concede they have little hope of the eight - limbed sea molluscs solving the fiendish plastic puzzle .
Instead , the month - long project at 23 Sea Life Centres across Britain and Europe will examine octopus intelligence in an attempt to discover if they have a favourite tentacle for picking things up – much as humans are right or left - handed .
Octopuses belong to the same family as slugs and snails , but scientists believe they are far more intelligent than their relatives .
The researchers will give the 25 assorted creatures food and toys to play with , and record which limbs the animals use .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Claire Little , a marine expert at the Weymouth Sea Life Centre , explained : " Uniquely , octopuses have more than half their nerves in their arms and have been shown to partially think with their arms .
" Many animals have been shown to favour a certain arm so we will see if octopuses can be added to that list . "
If the experiment indicates a preference it could shed new light on the structure of octopus brains .
What 's more , octopuses are susceptible to stress , so finding if they have a favoured side on which to be fed could improve their well - being in captivity .
A diagram of an octopus will sit alongside the tanks with the tentacles on the right labelled R1 , R2 , R3 and R4 from front to back ; the left tentacles labelled L1 and so on .
If the octopus uses a combination of arms , up to three will be recorded in sequence .
A ball , a jam jar and Lego bricks will also be dropped in to the water for the octopuses ' inspection .
The giant Pacific octopus , the common octopus and the lesser octopus will all star in the research .
Previous work has shown them to have a capacity for learning and surprisingly complex memories .
In 2003 an octopus in a German zoo wasrevealed to have learnt how to open jars of shrimps by copying staff .
The five - month - old animal opened the jars by pressing its body on the lid and grasping the sides with its eight tentacles .
The results of the latest research will be analysed by Sea Life Centre biologists and the results announced in autumn .
" We hope it will help towards solving the mystery of handedness in the animal kingdom , " added Ms Little .

Editor 's note :
The original version of this story erroneously misattributed a statement to law professor Nate Persily .
RAW STORY regrets the error .
The radio program of conservative " shock jock " Michael Savage has been canceled by one Mississippi network following his controversial claim that autism is almost always the result of " a brat who has n't been told to cut the act out . "
" They do n't have a father around to tell them , ' Do n't act like a moron , " Savage went on during his July 16 broadcast .
" You 'll get nowhere in life .
Stop acting like a putz .
Straighten up .
Act like a man .
...
Do n't act like a girl .
Do n't cry . "
" It was just horrible what he said , " stated Steve Davenport , president of Telesouth Communications , in explaining the cancelation .
" When you talk about people in politics , business people , that 's one thing .
But when you talk about defenseless children , that 's another . "
Some parents of autistic children want Savage to be fired entirely .
Evelyn Ain , who organized a protest outside the studios of WOR - AM in New York on Monday , explained , " That is n't just freedom of speech , it is hateful speech . "
Wendy Fournier of the National Autism Association called Savage 's remarks " over the line and cruel . "
" It 's heartbreaking , " one protesting parent told CNN .
" The whole lives of families change in raising a child with autism . "
Martin Schwartzman 's 15 - year - old son Robbie is moderately autistic .
" It really hurt my feelings , " said Robbie 's twin sister Allyson .
However , law professor Nate Persily cautioned , " The Constitution protects your right to be a jerk sometimes .
... Jerky speech is protected . "
Savage was previously fired by MSNBC in 2003 over anti-gay comments .
At the time of writing , an online petition calling for his firing over the latest flap had already gained 1600 signatures .
However , a statement posted on Savage 's website Monday offered no apology but insisted that autism is being overdiagnosed by greedy doctors , a statement with which medical experts consulted by CNN disagree .

Eh , it looks alright .
It needs mounds more style and a good bit more noir added , though .
Mark Wahlberg looks to be doing a great job , as usual , but it 's the rest of the film I 'm concerned about .
More than anything , though , the trailer 's edited in such a way that makes it seem like Payne might be fighting some sort of demons ... but really there 's very little that 's made clear in the trailer - it basically shows that Max is shooting up stuff , diving , shooting some more , and facing some flying demons ; it wo n't be obvious to the audience that the demons may be hallucinations .
The entire underpinnings of the Internet are vulnerable to a major bug in how Internet addresses are managed , security researchers announced today .
The problem is so big that dozens of companies and government organizations have secretly synchronized an effort to fix it .
The companies — from Microsoft to Cisco to AT&T — are all releasing patches today or in the next few days to eliminate the major vulnerability , which was discovered early this year by security researcher Dan Kaminsky .
He kept it a secret until a conference call with the press today .
( His site has a tool to test for the vulnerability , but the site at doxpara.com has been overwhelmed with traffic ) .
“ The severity of this bug is shown by the number of those who are on board with the patches , ” Kaminsky said .
The researchers say they will fully describe the vulnerability in 30 days , after companies that operate web sites or Internet service providers can put the patches in place .
The risks were so big that Kaminsky and the companies involved brought in government agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Computer Emergency Response Team .
“ If a bad guy had found this before Dan did , it would have been very bad , ” said Rich Mogull , a former Gartner analyst and independent security research at Securosis .
Mogul has a description of the problem at his site .
He added , “ Computers use the equivalent of address books to figure out where they need to go on the web .
This attack could compromise that by attacking the servers that give out the addresses and tracking people to go to a web site where they do n’t want to go . ”
In an unprecedented effort , the agencies and companies began working on a coordinated fix .
In March , 16 engineers from major organizations converged at Microsoft ’s campus to work out how to fix the problem .
They determinted that a coordinated response on the fix was the only way to prevent the vulnerability from begin exploited by spammers , virus writers and others .
The companies plan on distributing the patch during the next month as widely as possible .
Most home users will receive automatic updates that protect them .
All businesses will have to update their networks .
“ This is the largest synchronized security update in the history of the Internet , and is the result of hard work and dedication across dozens of organizations , ” Kaminsky said in a statement .
The bug is in the Domain Name System , or DNS , which is the system for translating the locations of network computers into Internet addresses .
The flaw is in the design of the DNS protocol itself and is thus not limited to any single product that uses it .
If someone hijacks a DNS server , they can redirect an unsuspecting Internet surfer to a malicious web site .
A hacker targeting an Internet Service Provider , or ISP , could replace the entire Web ( as accessible through that ISP ) — search engines , social networks , banks — with their own malicious content .
DNS is used by every computer on the Internet to know where to find other computers .
Those attacking corporations could reroute network traffic and capture emails and other sensitive business data .
CERT issued a bulletin saying that deficiencies in the DNS protocol make it possible for hackers to create “ DNS cache poisoning attacks . ”
The precise name of the flaw has n’t been released yet , since the accuracy of the name would give too many clues to hackers .
CERT says such cache poisoning is not a new phenomenon in itself but the new information creates a much bigger risk of successful attacks .
So far , Kaminsky said there is no evidence that any hackers are exploiting the vulnerability .
He also said that the good news is that it ’s hard to figure out what the flaw is simply by analyzing the patches being distributed .
That ’s a common hacker technique .
But researchers say that the vulnerability is likely to become public within a few weeks , which means companies have to patch their networks as rapidly as possible .
Kaminsky is going to publish details of the flaw at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Aug .
6 . He said he found the flaw by a “ complete accident .
” Jeff Moss , organizer of Black Hat , said that the patching of the flaw will take away a “ fantastic tool ” for spammers and virus writers , who could have used it to steal the identities of Internet surfers .
Kaminsky was praised by officials on the call for delaying the disclosure of the flaw until everybody could get a response in place .
Asked what the worst - case scenario would have been if the bad guys found the flaw first , Kaminsky said , “ The Internet would n’t be the Internet you ’d expect . ”
“ Dan followed the responsible disclosure process , ” said Jerry Dixon , director of analysis at the security firm Cymru and former director of the cyber security division at the Department of Homeland Security .
“ If you disclose too early , the victim count goes up .
This could have been huge , if you think about adversaries out there like organized crime that would have exploited this . ”
Dixon said that he was surprised that no one leaked the information about the bug , given the large numbers of agencies and companies involved .

Luckily for the fragile US economy , both Sen. Obama and Sen. McCain have pledged to stay out of the Federal Reserve 's way and , for the most part , leave the economy to the economists .
In fact , the two politicians seem rather pleased with the Fed 's performance as of late .
They both :
praise and support Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke
back the Fed 's moves to rescue Bear Stearns from bankruptcy and to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
say the Fed 's approach to interest rates would change little with a new administration
will avoid meddling in interest - rate decisions
Still , whichever candidate is elected President will have a profound impact on the Fed 's direction .
The next President will appoint three of seven Fed governors immediately due to vacancies .
Obama or McCain will also decide whether or not to nominate Bernanke for a second 4 - year term , starting in 2010 .
Neither candidate , as of now , appears likely to fire the Fed chairman .

Watchdog : Bush turning intelligence agencies on Americans Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 31 , 2008
Print This Email This President Bush seems to be slowly turning the nation 's massive surveillance apparatus upon its citizens , and some worry that administration assurances to protect civil liberties are nothing but empty promises .
With his update to a decades - old executive order governing the Intelligence Community , Bush is giving the Director of National Intelligence and the 16 agencies of the US Intelligence Community more power to access and share sensitive information on Americans with little to no independent oversight .
The update to Executive Order 12333 , first issued by former President Ronald Reagan , introduces a more prominent role for the Attorney General in approving intelligence gathering methods , calls for collaboration with local law enforcement agencies , eases limits on how information can be shared and urges cooperation between the IC and private companies .
" This Intelligence Community that was built to deal with foreign threats is now being slowly and incrementally turned inward , " says Mike German , policy counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union , in an interview with RAW STORY .
Bush 's latest update of a decades old executive order governing intelligence activities is a " lit fuse " that could end with the Constitution 's immolation , another ACLU official says .
" This kind of concentrated power , exercised in secret , is a lit fuse with our Constitution likely in danger of being burned ,  said Caroline Fredrickson , director of the ACLU Washington legislative office .
The White House insists that the update to Executive Order 12333 maintains protections for Americans ' civil liberties , but senior administration officials who briefed reporters Thursday provided little reassurance that the new order would correct some of the Bush administration 's most egregious abuses .
Asked about Bush 's decision to authorize warrantless wiretaps of Americans -- despite existing privacy protections in the executive order -- the unidentified official offered a non-sequitur and refused to discuss the program in detail , according to a transcript of the call .
Q : All right .
On the matter of civil liberties , I think one of the concerns that you 're going to hear is , you know , the terrorist surveillance program or the warrantless wiretapping program went on despite the civil liberties protections .
So what do you have to say to folks that say , you know , essentially nice that you have this stuff in the executive order but it does n't necessarily mean anything when the president gets it into his mind that he needs or wants to do something that some people would find outside of those bounds ?
SR .
ADM .
OFFICIAL : I think what we would say to that is that the executive order reaffirms the nation 's long - standing commitment to protecting civil liberties .
It maintains all of the protections that are in place to do so , plus all procedures have to be approved by the attorney general .
With respect to the terrorist surveillance program , I 'm really not going to speak in any detail to that .
The administration has spoken to it previously .
I 'd observe that -- I 'm going to leave it at that on that question .
An administration official also assured reporters that the amended order " makes clear , as did the original order , that all statutes have to be complied with when the intelligence community is undertaking activities governed by specific statutes . "
Of course , that 's precisely what did not happen with regard to the warrantless wiretapping program , which was conducted outside the bounds of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
ACLU policy counsel German further noted the previous disclosure of a Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel opinion that presidents are not even bound by executive orders in the first place : " Rather than violate an executive order , the President has instead modified or waived it , " Sen .
Sheldon
Whitehouse revealed the office had argued .
" If that 's still the position of the Department of Justice , then this entire exercise is meaningless , " German told RAW STORY .
" This all could be voided by presidential fiat without even amending what 's written now . "
Bush authorized the extra-statutory warrantless surveillance in part based on an exceptionally broad reading of the extent of his executive power and by arguing that Congress 's pre-Iraq
War resolution expanded his power even further .
The updated order apparently does nothing to eliminate those views of expansive power .
Q : Hi .
I have a question about the provision saying all the undertaking would have to be governed by statute where there is a statute .
Is that a step back from previous assertions that , you know , the authorization of use of military force gave a more broad authority to the president ?
SR .
ADM .
OFFICIAL : No , I do n't think so .
The point that -- I do n't believe so at all -- I think the point that we 're trying to make there is when there is a specific statute that governs a particular activity , for example , you know , the collection of certain business records or financial records , or the conduct of electronic surveillance , the Congress , as many of you know , has put in place various statutes , some of them quite elaborate , to govern the conduct of those activities .
And the intelligence community , when engaged in such activity , has to fully comply with those statutes .
I do n't believe there 's any change at all on that front .
Executive Order 12333 , which lays out the responsibilities of each of the 16 agencies , maintains the decades - old prohibitions on assassination and using unwitting human subjects for scientific experiments .
The CIA notoriously tested LSD on human subjects in the 1950s , which was revealed by a Senate investigation in 1977 .
The new order gives the national intelligence director , a position created in 2005 , new authority over any intelligence information collected that pertains to more than one agency -- an attempt to force greater information exchange among agencies traditionally reluctant to share their most prized intelligence .
The order directs the attorney general to develop guidelines to allow agencies access to information held by other agencies .
That could potentially include the sharing of sensitive information about Americans .
The order has been under revision for more than a year , an attempt to update a nearly 30 - year - old presidential order to reflect organizational changes made in the intelligence agencies after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
German noted the update 's insertion of provisions related to Intelligence Community cooperation with " state , local and tribal governments , " which he says has troubling implications in light of the ACLU 's recent examination of government fusion centers , creating the potential for " no rules " intelligence sharing among various agencies .
The update , he says , also removes limits on the National Security Agency 's ability to share with other intelligence entities the information it collects before determining whether it is legally allowed to keep such information itself .
The update also carves out a larger role in intelligence gathering for the " private sector , " an addition that takes on new interest in light of Bush 's unflinching demand for legal immunity to the telecommunications companies that facilitated his warrantless wiretapping program .
Congress granted that immunity in its FISA update , which he signed into law earlier this month , essentially invalidating dozens of lawsuits against companies like AT&T and Verizon .
The senior administration official said the FISA update was one of the reasons Bush was updating the executive order .
" If the Intelligence Community is acting to further the interest of AT&T , " German said , " then maybe we better understand why AT&T cooperated in the warrantless wiretapping program . "

( CNN ) --
The Vatican said Tuesday it regrets the decision by the Church of England 's governing body to allow the ordination of women as bishops .
General view of the Synod Assembly Chamber during the General Synod Session .
The move by the Anglican Church 's General Synod " is a rift to the apostolic tradition " of ordaining only men as bishops , the Vatican said in a statement , and is another obstacle to reconciliation between Anglicans and Roman Catholics .
" This decision will have consequences on the dialogue which had brought good fruits , " the Vatican statement said .
The General Synod passed a resolution Monday night that allows women to become bishops , acting over the objections of traditionalists who argued that Jesus only wanted men in leadership positions .
Some traditionalists have threatened to abandon the Anglican Church for the Roman Catholic Church if women become bishops .
Several hundred Anglican priests made that move when women were first ordained 16 years ago .
The synod narrowly rejected a proposal for " super bishops , " which would have allowed parishes opposed to female bishops to opt out .
Opponents argued the plan would be insulting to female bishops .
The Church of England has about 114 bishops .
They supervise parishes in Britain .
The final hurdle for the consecration of female bishops is expected in February with a vote on a " code of practice " intended to protect people who as " a matter of theological conviction will not be able to receive the ministry of women as bishops or priests . "
The first consecration of a female bishop could happen in 2015 .
The theological debate over female bishops has centered on the question " What would Jesus do ? "
The traditionalists argued that bishops must be men , as were Jesus and his apostles .
Retired Canon Alan Duke , a longtime supporter of women in church leadership posts , said those arguments " simply do not stack up . "
Duke said that while Jesus named no female disciples , he used and valued woman in radical and different ways for his time .
" He was hardly going to choose women and send them into a situation where they might have been in grave risk , " Duke said .
Christina Rees , with the pro-women lobby Women and the Church , described what was at stake as " an acceptance by the Church of England of women on equal terms as men in the ordained ministries . "
David Holding , a traditionalist church member , said he does not object to female bishops , but " there must be a proper provision made for those who can't go along with it . "
The lack of a provision to allow traditionalists to choose to be under a " super bishop " instead of a woman raises concern that a schism could develop in the Church of England .
Duke described " an awful lot of bluster " but doubted there " will be a mass exodus . "
Niccol Machiavelli , who was a sort of Karl Rove of his day , though with more integrity , said of the Swiss that they were " the most free and most armed people " of Europe .
Get it ?
The connection between arms and freedom ?
That statement is still true of the Swiss .
Many people know that they practice neutrality , but not many know that they practice armed neutrality .
If the gun controllers ’ claim that the mere presence of arms leads to mayhem were true , the Swiss would have wiped themselves out years ago .
There are guns and gun ranges all over the place .
You would be hard - pressed to find a Swiss home without a firearm and ammunition .
Yet , the Swiss have a very low crime rate .

If you were a robber or a rapist , who would you rather have as a victim ?
Someone who is armed , or someone who is defenseless ?
Even a stupid criminal knows the answer to that question .
If the police can protect us — which is another claim the gun-control people make — then why are so many people murdered , raped and robbed ?
Even the television fictional stories tell you the answer to that .
The cops get there after the crime has been committed .
Otherwise , there would n’t be a crime scene .
Nearly all the cop shows open with the police looking at a dead , unarmed body .
Do you really believe that the men who had just fought a long and bloody war against the British and were writing what we call the Bill of Rights had this conversation :
" Well , let ’s see .
We ’ve guaranteed freedom of assembly , of religion , of speech and of the press .
Oh , my gosh , we ’ve forgotten the duck hunters .
They ’ll raise heck if we leave them out , so we ’d better write an amendment for them . "
The Second Amendment has nothing whatsoever to do with hunting .
It states : " A well - regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . "
The men who wrote these amendments were pretty darn fluent in English .
If they had intended the right to keep and bear arms to apply only to the militia , they would have said so .
They would have written " A well - regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the states to arm their respective militias shall not be infringed . "
Boston ’s Gun Bible Kenneth W. Royce Best Price : $ 18.51 Buy New $ 174.95 ( as of 09:10 EST - Details )
They did n’t say that .
The main sentence says " right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . "
" People " means everybody , not just the members of the militia .
The subordinate clause , " A well - regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state , " just gives one , but not the only , reason why all the people have a right to keep and bear arms .
The militia , after all , was drawn from the people .
It was not the Army .
The first meaning of " bear , " by the way , is to carry , bring or take .
Americans have the right to keep arms and to carry them .
The word " regulate " in those days meant trained , and do you notice again the connection between arms and freedom ?
The subordinate clause refers to a " free state . "
Obviously , an unfree state would not allow the people to be armed .
The Founding Fathers were not urban neurotics like so many of today ’s politicians .
They were almost all outdoor people .
Guns were to them just tools , like their axes or plows .
You could n’t survive in the wilderness without firearms , and at the time of our Revolution , there were only about 3 million people from Maine to Georgia .
Nor were there any police forces .
There was no Secret Service , FBI or any of the other alphabet law - enforcement agencies .
If you decided to travel , you traveled at your own risk , and you can bet people traveled armed .
When I was last at Williamsburg , Va. , they had a room in one of the historical houses arranged as if a traveler had just arrived and unpacked .
There on top of a dresser was a pistol .

July 28 ( Reuters ) - A number of countries in central , eastern and southeastern Europe plan to build new nuclear power reactors or extend the life of existing ones to meet growing domestic demand and replace ageing power capacity .
The plans mirror a worldwide nuclear boom as part of the solution to climate change .
Following are key facts on major projects :
ALBANIA
- The country , which suffers chronic power shortages , said in May it wanted to develop nuclear power generation and was ready to invite Italians to build a plant on its soil .
- Italian power utility Enel has said it is looking into nuclear opportunities in Albania .
BULGARIA
- The Balkan country , where nuclear energy supplies about 40 percent of all power , plans a new 2,000 megawatt ( MW ) nuclear power plant by 2013 - 14 .
- It has contracted Russia 's Atomstroyexport , along with France 's Areva and Germany 's Siemens , to build the plant in a 4.0 billion - euro deal .
- Sofia has yet to pick a strategic investor for 49 percent of the plant between Germany 's RWE and Belgium 's Electrabel , owned by French utility Suez .
CZECH REPUBLIC
- Power group CEZ has unveiled a preliminary plan to build two new units of 3,400 MW at its Temelin nuclear power plant .
The country already relies on nuclear for about 30 percent of its electricity .
- The centre - right government , in which the Green Party is a junior member , has pledged not to approve construction of new nuclear power stations before its term ends in 2010 .
HUNGARY
- The country has one nuclear generator with 1,860 MW of capacity , supplying about 37 percent of electricity .
- Their lifetime will begin to run out in 2012 .
All major political parties have approved a 20 - year lifetime extension .
- In 2006 and 2007 , press reports surfaced that big Western European power firms were considering building a new nuclear generator in Hungary but no specific plans had emerged .
LITHUANIA
- The Baltic country , which relies on nuclear for 70 percent of its electricity , is still in the planning stages of a new 3,200 - 3,400 MW plant estimated to cost $ 9 billion .
It is expected to be ready in 2015 - 18 .
- Poland and the other two Baltic states , Latvia and Estonia , are negotiating plans to build the new plant , which will replace the Soviet - era Ignalina plant that Lithuania is obliged to shut down by the end of next year .
- Lithuania 's parliament voted in July to hold a non-binding referendum on extending the life of Ignalina .
POLAND
- Poland , seeking to lessen its dependence on Russian energy , plans to back Lithuania 's nuclear plant project .
- Some officials , including Economy Minister Waldemar Pawlak , have said Poland should consider building a nuclear power plant in the future to help reduce its near - complete reliance on coal for energy .
ROMANIA
- The Balkan country , whose two nuclear reactors at the Cernavoda plant accounted for 13 percent of all power in 2007 , plans two more reactors , each 706 MW , at the same site by 2015 .
- Candidates to build the two new reactors include Electrabel , Enel , Spain 's Iberdrola , CEZ , a Romanian unit of Arcelor Mittal and RWE .
The investment is estimated at around 2.2 billion euros .
- Romania is also considering building another new plant with capacity of between 2,000 and 2,400 MW , whose first unit could come on line after 2020 .
SLOVAKIA
- Nuclear energy contributed for 57 percent of Slovakia 's electricity in 2007 .
- Dominant power company Slovenske Elektrarne ( SE ) SE , controlled by Enel , aims to complete two new blocks , each with a power capacity of 440 MW , at the Mochovce plant by 2013 .
- The state plans construction of a single 1,100 - 1,200 MW block or two new 600 MW blocks at the Bohunice site by 2025 , worth an estimated 3 billion euros .
- A new 1,200 MW nuclear plant , expected to cost 3.5 billion euros , is being considered in eastern Slovakia for after the shutdown of younger Bohunice blocks , expected in 2025 .
TURKEY
- Ankara passed a law last year to allow for the construction of Turkey 's first nuclear power reactors .
Turkey , which is facing an energy shortfall , has set a Sept. 24 deadline for bids to build the nuclear power plant .
- The country plans three nuclear plants with a total production capacity of 5,000 MW .

Remember that scene in the movie
Kids
where one of the protagonists talks about how he got turned on watching a girl eat a watermelon on a hot summer day ?
If you were thinking his arousal was the result of his being a teenage boy , you 're totally right .
However , according to recent studies from the good geeks at Texas A&M University , it looks like watermelon could also help increase libido and arousal .
Take that , Pfizer !
We 've included the full release below , but here 's what you need to know : Watermelons contain lycopene , beta carotene and citrulline .
Those first two are just all - around good for you , but the third , citrulline , is converted in the body to arginine , which boosts nitric oxide , which relaxes blood vessels , which leads to " Why , hello down there . "
Watermelon May Have Viagra - Effect
COLLEGE STATION --
A cold slice of watermelon has long been a Fourth of July holiday staple .
But according to recent studies , the juicy fruit may be better suited for Valentine ’s Day .
That ’s because scientists say watermelon has ingredients that deliver Viagra - like effects to the body ’s blood vessels and may even increase libido .
“ The more we study watermelons , the more we realize just how amazing a fruit it is in providing natural enhancers to the human body , ” said Dr. Bhimu Patil , director of Texas A& M ’s Fruit and Vegetable Improvement Center in College Station .
“ We ’ve always known that watermelon is good for you , but the list of its very important healthful benefits grows longer with each study . ”
Beneficial ingredients in watermelon and other fruits and vegetables are known as phyto - nutrients , naturally occurring compounds that are bioactive , or able to react with the human body to trigger healthy reactions , Patil said .
In watermelons , these include lycopene , beta carotene and the rising star among its phyto - nutrients – citrulline – whose beneficial functions are now being unraveled .
Among them is the ability to relax blood vessels , much like Viagra does .
Scientists know that when watermelon is consumed , citrulline is converted to arginine through certain enzymes .
Arginine is an amino acid that works wonders on the heart and circulation system and maintains a good immune system , Patil said .
“ The citrulline - arginine relationship helps heart health , the immune system and may prove to be very helpful for those who suffer from obesity and type 2 diabetes , ” said Patil .
“ Arginine boosts nitric oxide , which relaxes blood vessels , the same basic effect that Viagra has , to treat erectile dysfunction and maybe even prevent it . ”
While there are many psychological and physiological problems that can cause impotence , extra nitric oxide could help those who need increased blood flow , which would also help treat angina , high blood pressure and other cardiovascular problems .
“ Watermelon may not be as organ specific as Viagra , ” Patil said , “ but it ’s a great way to relax blood vessels without any drug side - effects . ”
The benefits of watermelon do n’t end there , he said .
Arginine also helps the urea cycle by removing ammonia and other toxic compounds from our bodies .
Citrulline , the precursor to arginine , is found in higher concentrations in the rind of watermelons than the flesh .
As the rind is not commonly eaten , two of Patil ’s fellow scientists , drs .
Steve King and Hae Jeen Bang , are working to breed new varieties with higher concentrations in the flesh .
In addition to the research by Texas A&M , watermelon ’s phyto- nutrients are being studied by the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s Agricultural Research Service in Lane , Oklahoma .
As an added bonus , these studies have also shown that deep red varieties of watermelon have displaced the tomato as the lycopene king , Patil said .
Almost 92 percent of watermelon is water , but the remaining 8 percent is loaded with lycopene , an anti-oxidant that protects the human heart , prostate and skin health .
“ Lycopene , which is also found in red grapefruit , was historically thought to exist only in tomatoes , ” he said .
“ But now we know that it ’s found in higher concentrations in red watermelon varieties . "
Lycopene , however , is fat - soluble , meaning that it needs certain fats in the blood for better absorption by the body , Patil said .
“ Previous tests have shown that lycopene is much better absorbed from tomatoes when mixed in a salad with oily vegetables like avocado or spinach , ” Patil said .
“ That would also apply to the lycopene from watermelon , but I realize mixing watermelon with spinach or avocadoes is a very hard sell . ”
No studies have been conducted to determine the timing of the consumption of oily vegetables to improve lycopene absorption , he said .
“ One final bit of advice for those Fourth of July watermelons you buy , ” Patil said .
“ They store much better uncut if you leave them at room temperature .
Lycopene levels can be maintained even as it sits on your kitchen floor .
But once you cut it , refrigerate .
And enjoy . ”
After messing up his back , Clay in Knoxville figured he ’d give a chiropractor a shot .
But when the doc he saw refused to show him the x-rays he ’d taken until after a “ seminar ” about payment plans — oh , and treatment options — Clay decided to take his aching back elsewhere .
A few days later , he got this caring follow - up letter in the mail .
UPDATE : Too good to be true , you say ?
Clay clarifies : “ The reason I did n’t block out the “ Woodacre ” is that it was wrong — it was wrong on my charts and I pointed it out to the receptionist .
One page even had a “ verified by ” signature on it and ALL my information was wrong .
I have no idea how they got the address right on the envelope and wrong on the letterhead ( the same as on the paperwork I pointed out to them ) , but they did . ”

ITM Power
Gas -guzzler
A FEW years ago , the race to replace the petrol - driven internal - combustion engine was dominated by hydrogen .
Fuel cells , which mix hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity and water , were the darlings of the technological world .
The crowd , however , is fickle , and the favoured technology now is the lithium - ion battery .
One battery - powered sports car , the Tesla , is already on the market , and others are expected to join it soon .
Mainstream battery cars should follow in a year or two .
Hydrogen , it seems , is fading fast .
Not if ITM
Power has anything to do with it .
This British firm , based in Sheffield , thinks that hydrogen is still the fuel of the future .
It differs from others who cleave to that view in that it also thinks that instead of being delivered by an expensive , new infrastructure of pipes and storage tanks , the gas will be brewed at home by car owners using water , electricity and ITM 's proprietary technology .
The brain behind this idea is Donald Highgate , a polymers expert , who made his name in the 1970s by developing soft contact lenses .
The polymer he has come up with this time is used to make what are known as proton - exchange membranes .
These , depending on how the device containing them is set up , can act as the guts of a fuel cell or as its opposite , turning water and electricity into hydrogen and oxygen .
That process is known as electrolysis , and normal commercial electrolysers are chunky units placed next to power stations to produce industrial quantities of hydrogen for the chemical industry .
They rely on platinum , a metal that costs twice as much as gold , to catalyse the reaction .
Existing fuel cells intended for cars are not quite so greedy .
They use some platinum , but also involve membranes made of a polymer called Nafion .
However , these membranes cost $ 500 a square metre .
ITM 's new material costs a hundredth of that , and no platinum is involved .
Moreover , its superior conductivity allows the use of a thicker , more robust membrane that will last longer than one made of Nafion .
The firm has also patented a simple , one - step manufacturing process : the liquid polymer is poured into a bag before being cured , a bit like an injection - moulded waffle .
Making hydrogen at home , using one of these membranes , gets around the problem of a lack of hydrogen filling stations .
In effect , hydrogen becomes a way of storing off - peak electricity .
The result can be pumped into your car and run through a fuel cell — or even burned in a conventional internal combustion engine .
And for demonstration purposes , that is the route ITM has taken .
It recently showed off a converted Ford Focus .
At the flick of a switch this vehicle went from petrol to hydrogen fuel with no perceptible change in its handling .
That is probably not the future , although no less a firm than BMW is experimenting with hydrogen - burning versions of the engines for its upmarket cars .
But ITM , with its own dual - use technology of electrolyser and fuel cell , will certainly not mind seeing the back of the internal - combustion engine altogether .
If hydrogen turns out not to be the future of motoring in any shape or form , the firm has back - up plans .
It has already signed a deal with the American navy to develop a fuel cell to power unmanned mini-submarines , and it is working with Boeing to design a refuelling station for fuel - cell - powered unmanned aircraft .
One way or another it believes that hydrogen , home - brewed or otherwise , will form part of somebody 's future somewhere .

Since the start of the year , the Bush administration has kickstarted a $ 30 billion effort to shore up cyber security , installed a new " czar " for online defense , and reserved the right to snoop on everyone 's net traffic , to ward off a digital attack .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama says the White House is still asleep at the switch , when it comes to network defense .
" We know that cyber - espionage and common crime is already on the rise .
And yet while countries like
China have been quick to recognize this change , for the last eight years we have been dragging our feet , " he said in a speech today at Purdue University , focusing on unconventional threats .
His recommendations on network security were vague , mostly .
But they did include some subtle digs at the current administration .
* As President , I 'll make cyber security the top priority that it should be in the 21st century .
I 'll declare our cyber - infrastructure a strategic asset , and appoint a National Cyber Advisor who will report directly to me . *
The current cyber chief serves under the Department of Homeland Security .
He also , it should be noted , had no experience in security , whatsoever .
And while Obama avoided some of the more bellicose rhetoric that 's been been skipping around the government – like the Air Force 's calls for network " dominance " – he did highlight his concerns about a potential online takeover of our country 's infrastructure .
To protect our national security , I 'll bring together government , industry , and academia to determine the best ways to guard the infrastructure that supports our power ....
We need to prevent terrorists or spies from hacking into our national security networks .
We need to build the capacity to identify , isolate , and respond to any cyberattack .
And we need to develop new standards for the cyber security that protects our most important infrastructure –-
from electrical grids to sewage systems ; from air traffic control to our markets .
Intelligence officers and security officials claim hackers have been able to shut down American power grids .
That 's an assertion our cohorts at Threat Level have vigorously contested .

Datenaustausch zwischen USA und Europa : Ver.di-Mitglied , Swinger , Adornit
Die USA und die EU bereiten ein Datenschutzabkommen vor .
Sexuelle Vorlieben oder Gewerkschaftsmitgliedschaften - für die innere Sicherheit ist alles relevant .
BERLIN taz
Es waren nur ein paar kurze Sätze , leicht zu überlesen .
Aber das , was die Teilnehmer des EU - USA - Gipfels am 10 .
Juni 2008 im letzten Drittel ihres Abschlussberichts andeuteten , dürfte Millionen von Bürgern diesseits und jenseits des Atlantiks brennend interessieren :
Es geht um den Austausch intimer Daten - von religiösen Überzeugungen über die Gewerkschaftszugehörigkeit bis hin zum Sexualleben .
Der Gipfel selbst ließ diese Brisanz gar nicht vermuten .
Sicherheitspolitiker von beiden Seiten des Atlantik sprachen einmal mehr vom " Austausch persönlicher Daten " , ohne den der Antiterrorkampf nicht vernünftig zu bewerkstelligen sei .
Natürlich müsse dieser " unter voller Einhaltung von fundamentalen Rechten und Freiheiten " geschehen .
Und das ginge am besten mit einem " bindenden internationalen Abkommen " .
Ein solches transatlantisches Datenschutzabkommen soll künftig die Rechtsgrundlagen für den Datenaustausch zwischen der EU und den USA festlegen .
Eine " hochrangige Kontaktgruppe " , dem Abgesandte des US - Justiz - und Heimatschutzministeriums sowie der EU - Kommission angehörten , hat nach 15 - monatigen Verhandlungen ihren Abschlussbericht vorgelegt .
Noch in diesem
Jahr solle damit begonnen werden , aus dem Papier ein Gesetz zu machen , kündigte der Generaldirektor für Justiz und Inneres der Europäischen Kommission , Jonathan Faull , in der vorigen Woche an .
In dem 15 - seitigen Papier , das der taz vorliegt , sind zwölf gemeinsame datenschutzrechtliche " Grundprinzipien " formuliert .
Sie sollen regeln , unter welchen Bedingungen Strafverfolgungsbehörden und Geheimdienste der USA und der EU künftig auf Datensätze des Partners zugreifen können - und zwar solche Daten , die die Behörden hüben wie drüben im Rahmen der Strafverfolgung erhoben haben .
Die Grundsätze haben es in sich .
So wird im Prinzip 5 ausdrücklich erlaubt , Angaben über " ethnische Herkunft , politische Überzeugungen oder religiöse und philosophische Vorstellungen sowie Gewerkschaftsmitgliedschaft und Informationen zu Gesundheit und Sexualleben " zu übermitteln .
Als Bedingung dafür muss lediglich " das einheimische Recht adäquaten Schutz " bieten .
Eine nähere Definition , was unter diesem Schutz zu verstehen ist , fehlt allerdings .
Dieser Gummiparagraf beunruhigt Datenschützer besonders .
" Bei der weichen Formulierung besteht die Gefahr , dass die Ausnahme zur Regel wird " , sagte der Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte Peter Schaar der taz .
Auch der FDP - Europaabgeordnete Alexander Alvaro fürchtet um den Kernbereich des Privaten : " Hier müssen die Hintertüren unbedingt geschlossen werden . "
Das dürfte schwierig werden .
Denn seit den Terroranschlägen vom 11 .
September 2001 hat die Europäische Union den Vereinigten Staaten bereits weitgehende Zugriffsrechte eingeräumt , die so leicht nicht mehr rückgängig zu machen sind .
Erst im August vergangenen Jahres bewilligte die EU die Weitergabe von Fluggastdaten .
Übermittelt werden seither 19 Datenfelder eines jeden Passagiers , der in die USA reist , darunter Angaben zur Zahlung , zum Reiseverlauf und Gepäck .
Die Angaben werden 15 Jahre in den USA gespeichert .
Um nach terroristischen Geldquellen zu fahnden , kontrollieren US - Ermittler zudem seit dem Jahr 2001 systematisch den internationalen Überweisungsverkehr über die sogenannte SWIFT - Datenbank in Belgien .
Bis zu 12 Millionen Finanztransaktionen mit einem Volumen von 5 Billionen Euro werden über SWIFT täglich abgewickelt .
Die sensibelsten Informationen europäischer Kreditkartennutzer wandern dabei in die USA : Adressen , Kontonummern und die Höhe der Überweisung .
Die Regeln zum Schutz privater Daten sind in jedem dieser Verträge anders formuliert , sofern sie überhaupt Erwähnung finden .
" Längst überfällig " findet der FDP - Politiker Alvaro daher gemeinsame Grundsätze von USA und EU , wie mit sensiblen Angaben im Kampf gegen den Terror umgegangen werden darf .
Auch der oberste deutsche Datenschützer Schaar sieht den angestrebten Vertrag aus diesen Gründen prinzipiell als Fortschritt : " Die Bemühungen um gemeinsame Datenschutzprinzipien für die gesamte EU sind grundsätzlich zu begrüßen . "
Er wertet es etwa als positiv , dass das Papier der Kontaktgruppe eine unabhängige Kontrollinstanz über die Verwendung von Daten vorsieht .
Ein solches Gremium existiert in den USA bislang nicht .
Das ändert allerdings nichts daran , dass das Dokument den Austausch von Daten über das Sexualleben de facto legitimiert .
Und das zu äußert schwammigen Bedingungen .
Das hat auch einen Grund : Bereits abgeschlossene Verträge sollen nicht mit dem neuen Datenschutzvertrag kollidieren .
Entsprechend dehnbar ist das Papier formuliert .
Ein weiteres Beispiel dafür ist auch der Punkt , welcher die Zweckbindung beim Austausch von Daten regeln soll .
Diese dürften ausschließlich für " spezifische Zwecke der Strafverfolgung im Einklang mit dem Gesetz " weitergegeben werden , heißt es dort .
Wie das konkret aussehen soll , ist unklar .
Punkt 3 des Dokuments regelt wiederum die Verhältnismäßigkeit .
Persönliche Angaben dürften nur dann übermittelt werden , " wenn sie relevant , nötig und angebracht sind , um eine Strafverfolgung durchzuführen " .
Eine klare Regelung sieht anders aus .
Zudem fehlen Vorschriften zur Speicherdauer und darüber , wann die Daten zu löschen sind .
Völlig unklar ist noch , welche Rechtsansprüche Bürger haben , wenn mit ihren Daten Schindluder getrieben wurde .
Die USA wollen ein Klagerecht von EU - Bürgern vor ihren Gerichten verhindern .
Ein solches
Recht ist bisher nämlich nur den eigenen Staatsbürgern vorbehalten .
Und so soll es auch bleiben .
Doch während die Streitpunkte zwischen den USA und der EU noch überschaubar sind , haben die größten Schwierigkeiten des Vertrages mit der Europäischen Union selbst zu tun .
Die große Frage , um die sich europäische Innenpolitiker bisher kaum Gedanken gemacht haben , lautet : Würden die neuen Regeln auch für den Umgang mit nationalen Datenbanken der EU - Länder gelten - etwa der Antiterrordatei beim Bundeskriminalamt ?
Oder bezöge sich das neue Datenschutzabkommen nur auf die Informationssammlungen , welche die EU direkt kontrolliert ?
Deutschland und die USA etwa haben bereits einen bilateralen Terrorfahndungsvertrag zum Datenaustausch unterzeichnet .
Innenminister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) und Justizministerin Brigitte Zypries ( SPD ) stimmten das Werk im März mit ihren US - Kollegen ab .
Inzwischen haben auch die kritischen Stimmen innerhalb der SPD klein beigegeben , wie der Innenexperte Dieter Wiefelspütz am Dienstag bestätigte .
Jetzt müssen nur noch Bundespräsident und Parlament einwilligen .
Künftig können dann Genprofile und Fingerabdrücke abgeglichen werden .
Auch Angaben zu " Rasse " oder Mitgliedschaft in Gewerkschaften könnten übermittelt werden .
Fällt dieses weitreichende Gesetz künftig unter die neuen EU - Prinzipien ?
Der FDP - Europapolitiker Alvaro meint : ja .
" Nach meinem Rechtsverständnis würden für die EU - Mitgliedstaaten die neuen EU - Prinzipien gelten " , meint er. Sein CSU - Pendant Manfred Weber sieht das völlig anders : " Die EU - Kommission kann nur über Daten verhandeln , auf die sie Zugriff hat .
Und die Datenbanken der Nationalstaaten gehören definitiv nicht dazu . "

One of the key engineering challenges to building a clean , efficient , hydrogen - powered car is how to design the fuel tank .
Storing enough raw hydrogen for a reasonable driving range would require either impractically high pressures for gaseous hydrogen or extremely low temperatures for liquid hydrogen .
In a new paper researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ’s Center for Neutron Research have demonstrated that a novel class of materials could enable a practical hydrogen fuel tank .
A research team from NIST , the University of Maryland and the California Institute of Technology studied metal - organic frameworks ( MOFs ) .
One of several classes of materials that can bind and release hydrogen under the right conditions , they have some distinct advantages over competitors .
In principle they could be engineered so that refueling is as easy as pumping gas at a service station is today , and MOFs do n’t require the high temperatures ( 110 to 500 C ) some other materials need to release hydrogen .
In particular , the team examined MOF - 74 , a porous crystalline powder developed at the University of California at Los Angeles .
MOF - 74 resembles a series of tightly packed straws comprised of mostly carbon atoms with columns of zinc ions running down the inside walls .
A gram of the stuff has about the same surface area as two basketball courts .
The researchers used neutron scattering and gas adsorption techniques to determine that at 77 K ( - 196 C ) , MOF - 74 can adsorb more hydrogen than any unpressurized framework structure studied to date — packing the molecules in more densely than they would be if frozen in a block .
NCNR scientist Craig Brown says that , though his team does n’t understand exactly what allows the hydrogen to bond in this fashion , they think the zinc center has some interesting properties .
“ When we started doing experiments , we realized the metal interaction does n’t just increase the temperature at which hydrogen can be stored , but it also increases the density above that in solid hydrogen , ” Brown says .
“ This is absolutely the first time this has been encountered without having to use pressure . ”
Although the liquid - nitrogen temperature of MOF - 74 is not exactly temperate , it ’s easier to reach than the temperature of solid hydrogen ( - 269 C ) , and one of the goals of this research is to achieve energy densities great enough to be as economical as gasoline at ambient , and thus less costly , temperatures .
MOF - 74 is a step forward in terms of understanding energy density , but there are other factors left to be dealt with that , once addressed , could further increase the temperature at which the fuel can be stored .
Fully understanding the physics of the interaction might allow scientists to develop means for removing refrigeration or insulation , both of which are costly in terms of fuel economy , fuel production , or both .

NEW YORK / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Gold rallied more than 2 percent to a four - month high on Friday as the dollar slumped against the euro , oil soared to a record high and equity markets floundered on credit crisis fears .
Spot gold surged to $ 964.75/966.75 an ounce by 4:11 a.m. EDT from $ 944.10/445.30 an ounce late Thursday .
It touched a session high of $ 967.60 , its strongest since March 19 .
New York August gold futures jumped $ 18.60 , or 1.97 percent , to finish at $ 960.60 an ounce on the COMEX division of New York Mercantile Exchange .
The session high of $ 969.10 an ounce also was last seen on March 19 .
“ It was a combination of things like the weakness in the dollar , crude making new all - time highs sparked some buying .
Some concerns about the Fannie and Freddie situation weighing on equities and lead to safe - haven buying in gold , ” said David Meger , metals analyst Alaron Trading , Chicago .
Oil prices jumped $ 5 to a record high above $ 147 a barrel , fueling early gains in gold .
Geopolitical tensions involving Iran fueled an early crude rally .
Fears of unrest in Nigeria and a looming strike of Brazilian oil workers also buoyed oil prices .
Gold also rose , as the precious metal often is bought as a hedge against oil - led inflation .
UBS analyst John Reade said “ oil , weakness in the dollar and issues with the agencies ” are driving gold higher .
Meanwhile , the dollar tumbled to its lowest since April 23 against the euro as stock prices slipped on Wall Street and in Europe .
Gold , which often moves opposite the dollar , extended gains .
Worries about the stability of two U.S. government - backed mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N were thought to be constraining the Federal Reserve 's ability to raise U.S. interest rates .
This fed inflation fears , which also hurt the dollar .
U.S. stock prices tumbled broadly on fears that record oil prices and problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could slow the economy .
Weak stocks buoyed gold in a flight to safety .
“ Risk aversion has been sweeping through the markets this week , ” said Calyon metals analyst Robin Bhar .
“ Obviously gold does well when there ’s heightened risk aversion , ( such as ) concerns about ... the financial system . ”
Platinum rallied late in the session , profiting from gold ’s rise and as signs of firmer Chinese demand for the metal used in autocatalysts , as well as ongoing supply fears linked to the South African supply shortage fuelled buying .
Spot platinum firmed to $ 2,023.0/2,043.0 an ounce by late in New York , having earlier hit a one - week high of $ 2,045.00 an ounce .
Among other precious metals , spot palladium rose to $ 448.50/456.50 an ounce from $ 449.00/457.00 an ounce late in New York , while silver advanced to $ 18.76/18.84 an ounce from $ 18.28/18.33 late in New York .

All hail Google !
Google has added another feature in Google docs which allows you to read PDF documents natively from within the browser
Instead of loading up a bloated adobe reader , or any alternatives on your computer just to open and read a PDF , Google has added a feature from within google docs that allows you to open and read PDF in its native format .
This feature also allows you to reference a URL of a PDF and open it up in your browser .
Previously , Google has provided a way to read PDF in HTML view , but that was iffy at best , as the formatting really got munged .
This new inline reader in Google docs maintains the PDF formatting fairly well .
Added bonus : the reader allows you to select text and copy the contents .
One of the shortcomings at this point is that there does n’t seem to be an easy way to open PDF and view attachments within Gmail with this new inline viewer , I had to download the PDF then re-upload to Google docs .
You could forward to your secret Google docs email address and access it that way also .
Not very intuitive .
Im guessing that they should be integrating the viewer within Gmail ‘ soon ’ .
Another limitation is that Google limits the PDFs to 10 MB in size .
This is similar to the Google ’s powerpoint reader that allowed you to open Powerpoint attachments within the browser without having to load up the native Microsoft application or reader on your computer .
Since then , they added their own presentation application within Google Docs that allows you to create simple Powerpoint - like presentations within your browser .
This is a yet another way cool feature in the whole suite of Google apps that make it one of the most useful Internet application , and ultimately coolest company , around .

Wii consoles sold around the world it is no longer possible to declare its success a fad .
But can Nintendo sustain its phenomenal momentum ?
Nintendo's global president Satoru Iwata is humble enough to admit that even he had been surprised by the epidemic - like success of the Wii console .
He told BBC News : " It was so fast .
We knew the Wii was the right direction for the company .
But the question was always how many years it would take to find success . "
The answer was two years .
In that brief time Nintendo has dramatically altered its fortunes in the home console business , while at the same time maintaining , and even improving , its dominance in the handheld gaming space with the DS .
Play time
The change of fortunes began when Mr Iwata took over as president of Nintendo in 2002 , only the fourth man to hold the position since the company was founded 109 years ago .
Speaking to BBC
News at the Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) In Los Angeles , he said : " Five years ago when I was appointed I thought that if we did n't do anything but took the same route there would be no bright future for the entire industry .
" So we decided we needed to increase the number of people gaming .
We really want to keep surprising people
Nintendo president Satoru Iwata
Nintendo unveils precision controller " We started thinking about people who were n't playing games and asked ourselves why they were not interested .
And why had some people stopped playing despite playing in their youth ? "
The solution was not a rush towards a high definition games platform targeted at the hard core gamer but remembering the simple pleasures of playing with family and friends .
The Wii console introduced a mass market of gamers to motion - sensitive play , replacing the button - laden controller with a wand that could direct action with the flick of a wrist .
Within weeks of the Wii's launch people were taking their new console around to the homes of friends and family , and word of mouth quickly spread .
" It was so fast because those who appreciated the new attractions of Wii must have been those who used to play video games .
And these people were telling friends and family about the console .
" People who first started playing with the Wii were so excited that they had to spread the news . "
History lesson
The success came after the perceived disappointment of the GameCube , which finished its lifespan behind the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in terms of global sales , selling 22 million units over seven years .
Nintendo had tried to compete directly with Microsoft and Sony and failed .
Nintendo's GameCube came a distant third in the console rankings
Its resulting and ultimately successful move was to realise that the market of people who could play games but were not was much bigger than the market of those already playing games on a regular basis .
" It was somewhat out of the boundaries of common sense for the time , " said Mr Iwata .
" From the perspective of people from outside the industry it might have looked like a gamble .
But I do not think it was a gamble at all . "
One of the original criticisms of the Wii at launch was that the underpowered machine would increasingly suffer in comparison to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as the machines went through their lifecycle .
But Mr Iwata dismissed talk of a console lifespan as nonsense and somewhat irrelevant .
" After all , the primary concern is not to let consumers purchase hardware but to enjoy software , " he said .
Future fun
But that did not mean Nintendo was not already thinking about life beyond the Wii .
" However hard our software developers try to create new and unprecedented titles with great ideas eventually there will be a day when devs will say they have no more means with that hardware .
" That 's exactly the time we need to introduce people to new hardware .
We do want to be flexible about this , " he said .
Wii sports games will get a boost from the new add - on " We just do n't want to decide upon a fixed lifecycle of any platform . "
Addressing another criticism of the Wii , Mr Iwata said it was a " misunderstanding and misconception " to say that the console was struggling to attract support from developers outside of Nintendo .
" The number of third - party titles for Wii is actually more than what is available for other platforms .
" And in the initial launch platform period for any platform , the third - party software titles for Wii are outselling any of the third - party titles for other platforms . "
Nintendo remains the home for some of gaming 's most enduring franchises and icons , from Mario to Zelda and the success of the Wii has ensured they will remain part of the landscape for some time to come .
But there were no details of any new Mario or Zelda titles given at the recent press conference held by Nintendo to highlight its plans for the months ahead .
" At this E3 we had to focus on software for the mass audience and software that will be sold in this year or next .
" This one of the rare opportunities to reach out to mass audiences around the world .
" In order for us to create a new Super Mario game or Legend of Zelda game that can cater to the strong demands of core gamers around the world it takes two to three years . "
While its competitors battle to become the multimedia hub for the digital living room Nintendo is determined to continue on its course of " putting smiles on people 's faces " .
He said : " All we have got to do is carry on .
People are going to get tired of new proposals .
We have to offer them new proposals before they do .
" We really want to keep surprising people , " he said , then added : " It 's not easy at all . "

What are these ?
A small menagerie of new Damien Hirst pickled animals took a bow yesterday , including a new shark , a zebra , a calf with solid gold horns and hoofs valued at up to Â £ 12 m , and even a unicorn – a white foal fitted with a resin horn , rather than an apparition from a fairytale .
All have been churned out by his small army of assistants this year for an auction at Sotheby ’s in September which will sell more than 200 pieces .
The auction is predicted to raise Â£ 65 m , comfortably setting a new world record for the artist , and blazing a trail which other artists will watch with interest , of bypassing the gallery and dealer system and going straight to auction .
Both the Gagosian Gallery , and Jay Jopling ’s White Cube , his American and British dealers , have given the auction their blessing , possibly through gritted teeth …

Bay prisoners have the right to go before US federal judges to challenge their years - long detention , the Supreme Court ruled today in a stinging setback for the Bush administration .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
By a 5 - 4 vote , the high court overturned a ruling that upheld a law President George Bush pushed through the Republican - led Congress in 2006 that took away the habeas corpus rights of the terrorism suspects to seek full judicial review of their detention .
" We hold these petitioners do have the habeas corpus privilege , " Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court majority in the 70 - page opinion , portions of which he read from the bench .
Habeas corpus is a long - standing legal right that allows prisoners to challenge their confinement by the government .
Kennedy said Congress had failed to create an adequate alternative for the prisoners held at the US military base in Cuba to contest their detention .
The 2006 law allowed for a limited review by a US appeals court in Washington of the military 's designation of the prisoners as " enemy combatants . "
It took away their right to a hearing before a US district court judge to challenge their confinement .
Kennedy said the court 's ruling did not address whether Bush has the authority to detain the prisoners .
He said this and other questions on the legality of their detention must be resolved by the federal judges .
Amnesty International , which has campaigned for the prisoners ' rights , welcomed the ruling .
" The Supreme Court did the right thing .
Everyone has the right to challenge why they 're being thrown in prison , to hear the charges against them and to answer to that , " Daila Hashad , Amnesty 's domestic human rights programme director , said .
" It 's a real shame that in the 21st Century , we 've taken such a step backward in the Bush Administration , to say we have the right to throw someone in jail and throw away the key - but no longer . "
The majority consisted of the court 's four liberals - Justices John Paul Stevens , David Souter , Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer , plus the moderate conservative Kennedy , who often casts the decisive vote .

The four conservative dissenters were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito , both appointed by Bush , and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas .
The Guantanamo prison opened in January 2002 after the administration launched what Bush called a " war on terrorism " in response to the 11 September attacks .
The administration has argued the naval base , on land leased from Cuba , is outside US territory so constitutional protections do not apply to the detainees .
There now are about 270 prisoners at Guantanamo .
Most have been held for years without being charged and many have complained of abuse .
( CNN ) --
Planning a road trip vacation can be tricky and downright frightening for people who are susceptible to carsickness .
CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says motion sickness is " paralyzing " and sometimes leaves him " incapacitated . "
Once the illness settles in , even the most soothing scenery whizzing past a car window will be no match for the symptoms : nausea , sweating , racing heart and difficulty breathing .
It 's a subject all too familiar to CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta , who spoke with CNN.com about his own history of acute carsickness and how sufferers can treat it .
CNN : What happens in the body when someone experiences carsickness or motion sickness ?
Watch what you can do to fight carsickness »
Gupta :
Basically , everything in your body , all your senses are activating at the same time .
If there is some sort of mismatch between your senses , say your eyes are telling you that you 're moving -- or not -- and your ears are telling you [ the opposite ] and for some reason they 're not connecting , you start to get what 's called disequilibrium , or motion sickness .
And it 's the body 's response of telling you " something is not quite right here . "
CNN : So what part of that disconnect is most likely to make you feel motion sickness ?
Gupta :
The inner ear is probably the biggest culprit , mainly because you literally have these bones in the inner ear and these fluid - filled canals that detect your motion , and they are constantly giving you feedback right to your brain stem about what your position in space is .
It 's called proprioception , and that is the ability to know your place in space .
CNN : Are there other circumstances , besides riding in cars , which make people feel motion sick ?
Gupta : Certainly there are certain things that are designed to do that , big theaters where you feel like you 're moving but you 're actually stationary in a chair , IMAX theaters for example .
Besides car rides , boat rides can certainly do that and are probably the biggest culprit .
Amusement park rides , that sort of thing as well .
CNN : Can anyone get motion sickness ?
Gupta :
You know it 's funny , I think that probably anybody could get motion sickness .
[ When I rode ] with the Blue Angels , I was talking to some of the pilots ahead of time , because I know that I 'm pretty prone to motion sickness .
I have certain techniques that I 've taught myself so that I can ward off some of the awful symptoms .
But some of the pilots I was talking to said they never -- and these are Naval pilots they go on boats and they fly planes : two things that you could really be subjected to it -- and they said that they 've never been motion sick , which I thought was kind of interesting .
The trainer of the pilots said all of these guys on their first couple of rides lost their cookies , at least once .
CNN : Are some people more likely than others to get motion sickness ?
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Car sick kids
Gupta :
People who have some sort of inner ear problem , we know that that can be an issue .
Someone who has difficulty with their vision is more likely to have that mismatch between what they see and what they 're feeling in their inner ear .
Diabetics -- because they have numbness in the feet -- often times wo n't be able to tell if they 're moving when they are , so they 'll get a mismatch .
There have been some studies that have shown that genetics play a role so that if your mother gets motion sick , you 're more likely to , but ... there 's a pretty weak association , genetically .
CNN : What does carsickness feel like for you ?
Gupta :
It is an awful feeling .
It is paralyzing , really , for me .
I go to New York a lot , and the ride from La Guardia to Time Warner Center ... it 's a quick ride .
And I need to be ready to go when I get there .
If I 'm having a bad ride , I am pretty much incapacitated for a good half an hour , 40 minutes after I get there .
And it is all those things : I get sweaty , I feel really sick to my stomach , I feel like I 'm going to throw up , I can't think straight , I can't even talk on the phone at that time because any kind of stimulus just really throws me off .
And what 's interesting is I never know exactly what to do .
I think if the symptoms have already started , then a lot of times I 'll try to lie down and close my eyes , basically taking away one of the sensory stimuli , the vision .
But you get a lot of starting and stopping and that can make it a lot worse .
So it is pretty bad , and it 's actually a real problem .
I have to do certain things now .
I have to sit in the front seat .
Sometimes I 'll ask the guys to let me drive .
I 'll drive even in New York , because I do n't get sick when I drive .
All your senses are firing on the same level when you 're driving the car .
I open the windows , even in the colder weather to get some fresh air .
That seems to help .
Sometimes I will eat something that 's calming on my stomach beforehand so I at least do n't get the nausea associated with it .
It 's very problematic for me .
It 's like a migraine .
If I get there , if I allow myself to get to the point where I 'm motion sick , then I 'm pretty much toast .
I 'm going to have a bad 45 minutes or so .
CNN : Why is it best to sit in the front seat as a passenger if you get carsick ?
Gupta : I do that because you 're able to look at those things moving around you , you have much more window space , you 're able to have a sense of what the driver 's doing .
So if the driver 's hitting the brakes , you see that happening and it matches up with your inner ear .
If you 're sitting in the backseat and all of the sudden the driver hits the brakes , you get that queasy feeling in your stomach because your brain was n't expecting that .
Your inner ear is telling you that they hit the brakes , you know that it 's happening , you may even clutch the hand rest and stuff , but it takes a second for your eyes to catch up .
That whole process can make you motion sick .
CNN : Is there any kind of therapy for motion sickness ?
Gupta :
Being someone who answers that not only as a doctor but a patient , there really is n't .
Motion sickness is something that people -- if you 're particularly bothered by it -- might resort to a Dramamine patch , or something like that to get rid of the symptoms , but to have it not actually occur in the first place is a pretty difficult thing to do , particularly through training .
The Blue Angels , coincidentally , told me the best therapy for me , was to just throw up .
Throw up as quickly as possible .
And they were absolutely right , because I tried not to , for the first 30 minutes of the ride , and I was miserable .
I kept turning the fans on because I was starting to get that cold sweat , and then I threw up and I felt a thousand times better .
CNN : Why are antihistamines and antimuscarinic drugs used for motion sickness ?
Gupta :
They 're all basically designed to prevent the nausea part of it .
For the diaphoresis and the sweating and all that , they 're not going to help you that much .
You have different receptors -- histamine and muscarinic receptors .
Once you have these chemicals released in your body for whatever reason , they trigger those receptors .
Histamine will cause you to release acid into your stomach , it will cause your skin to turn red , it feels like an allergic reaction .
Muscarinic is sort of a similar thing , it 's a different type of receptor but it 's similar .
But they do the same thing , they sort of quiet your stomach , quiet some of the symptoms associated with motion sickness but they do n't really take care of the cause of it in the first place .
CNN : So what can people do to alleviate carsickness on road trips -- either for themselves or for people they 're riding with ?
Gupta : I have two kids and we take road trips , and I will tell you that the DVD player can be a double - edged sword .
It 's great because it keeps them quiet even for just a little bit .
My younger one , I know , is prone to motion sickness , and she wants to watch the DVD , but it 's the worst thing you can do .
It 's stationary and everything else around you is moving .
[ To avoid getting carsick ] keep your head up as much as possible .
Point out the beautiful scenery outside because it 's moving with you , so that 's a good thing .
Get as much fresh air as much as possible .
Try not to eat any particularly spicy foods , especially when you 're on road trips .
Blander , drier foods , those are going to be good things .
Soda water is a really good thing , clear sodas if possible .
Heat tends to worsen the symptoms , so if it 's too hot to have the windows open and you can afford to have your air conditioning on these days , try and run your air a little bit .
And get the kids and elderly people in particular out of the car as much as possible .
Get them on terra firma from time to time , that also helps .

Westepped on an SD card , and what we found inside mystifies me .
Wait - that looks like a micro SD card !
Why in the world ... The back reads : 5123ACA -7A KORS VHL463 PA 704 Crazy .
Someone took a magic marker to every microSD card ( under marker reads ' 512 MB MMCmicro ' ) , and then hand soldered them onto a small PCB to create a larger SD card .
Talk about economies of scale .
There must have been a huge batch of microSD cards and a perceived shortage of full size SD cards ?
I can't explain it .
Why in the world would one pay money to solder these things together when a microSD to SD adapter ships free of charge with every microSD card ?
The micro card size looks a bit off .
Maybe it was ill formed MMC cards and they wanted to salvage the memory so they made SD cards out of the micro cards .
We will probably never know .

Homeowners who have fallen behind on their payments because of job loss , declining wages and family illness would also be eligible , even if their rates have not increased .
Homeowners are now eligible only if they were current on their mortgages before their interest rate was adjusted upward .
For its part , Congress is close to completing legislation on a $ 300 billion foreclosure - rescue plan that would help troubled borrowers refinance into more affordable loans insured by the federal government .
The Senate is expected to approve a measure by next week .
The Fed created the lending programs to Wall Street in March as part of a broader effort to prevent financial institutions from collapsing , as Bear Stearns nearly did before it was sold under heavy pressure from the Fed and the Bush administration to JPMorgan Chase .
The lending programs to the investment banks , a broad expansion of the Fed ’s historic practice of providing loans only to commercial banks that the Fed supervises , are intended to provide confidence to financial institutions that they will have enough cash to meet their daily needs .
And by permitting investment banks to post collateral for Fed loans , including hard - to - sell financial instruments backed by mortgages , the programs have helped prop up the enormous and troubled market in securities sold by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the all - important mortgage - finance companies .
The two buyers of mortgages , which together held more than $ 1.4 trillion of mortgage - backed bonds as of the end of last year , have struggled in recent months through the wave of foreclosures and declining housing markets .
On Tuesday , Fannie Mae closed up nearly 12 percent , and Freddie Mac rose 13 percent , after their regulator said he would probably not force them to raise more capital because of an accounting rule change .
The shares of both government - chartered companies had tumbled on Monday amid concerns over the accounting rule and worries that the worst of the mortgage crisis was yet to come .
Officials said that the Federal Reserve remained concerned that the declining housing market would not reach its bottom and financial markets would not become more stable before some time next year , and that the economy would continue to suffer as a result of declining consumer confidence , a sluggish global economy and the widespread effects of the rapid jump in oil prices .
“ The financial turmoil is ongoing , and our efforts today are concentrated on helping the financial system return to more normal functioning , ” Mr. Bernanke said at a forum in Virginia on lending for low - and moderate - income households .
He did not provide a forecast of how soon he expected markets would begin to turn .
While millions of American families struggle with falling house prices , soaring gasoline costs and tightening credit , some environmentalists , urban planners and urban real estate speculators are welcoming the bad news as signaling what they have long dreamed of -- the demise of suburbia .
In a March Atlantic article , Christopher B. Leinberger , a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a professor of urban planning , contended that yesterday ’s new suburbs will become “ the slums ” of tomorrow because high gas prices and the housing meltdown will force Americans back to the urban core .
Leinberger is not alone .
Other pundits , among them author James Howard Kunstler , who despises suburban aesthetics , and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman , see the pain in suburbia as a silver lining for urban revival .
Not so fast .
The “ out of the suburbs , back to the city ” narrative rests more on anecdote than demographic or economic fact .
Yes , high gas prices and rising sub - prime mortgage defaults are hurting some suburban communities , particularly newly built ones on the periphery .
But the suburbs remain home to a majority of Americans and a larger proportion of U.S. families -- and people are n’t leaving those communities in droves to live in cities .
Even with economic growth slowing , many suburbs , exurbs and smaller towns , especially those whose economies are tied to energy , are continuing to do better than most cities in terms of job creation and population growth .
The ominous predictions that the end of suburbia is at hand echo those in the 1970s , when there was also a run-up in gasoline prices .
Then it was neo -Malthusians such as biologist Paul Ehrlich , the author of “ The Population Bomb , ” who argued that the idea of suburbia was unsustainable because it eats up so much land and energy .
But suburban growth continued as people bought more fuel - efficient cars and companies moved jobs to the periphery , which cut commuting times .
Contrary to pundits ’ forecasts , during this decade of high energy prices , the country ’s urban populations , for only the first time in recent history , actually fell , according to a census analysis by economist Jordan Rappaport at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City .
But today ’s gas prices , at more than $ 4 a gallon , are the highest ever , and the prospects of them significantly dropping any time soon are slight .
The conditions for an exodus from suburbia to the cities would seem ideal once again .
Nevertheless , since 2003 , when gas prices began their climb , suburban population growth has continued to outstrip that of the central cities , with about 90 % of all metropolitan growth occurringin suburban communities , according to the 2000 to 2006census .
And the most recent statistics from the annual American Community Survey , which is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau , show no sign of a significant shift of the population to urban counties , at least through 2007 .
The flat condominium markets in most large urban markets are another sign that people are not streaming into cities from the suburbs and buying .
Many condo projects in such cities as Los Angeles , Chicago , Miami and San Diego have either been canceled or converted into rentals , with many units remaining vacant .
As a Southern California condo developer told me recently , lower house prices are not going to make people more disposed to buying apartments .
But the biggest reason the suburb - to - city narrative is not following the script of the urban boosters and theorists has to do with employment .
Living close to your workplace makes sense , not only because it cuts commuting costs and reduces greenhouse - gas emissions -- by saving time , it also gives people more time for family and leisure activities .
The problem for many cities is that they lack the jobs for people to move close to .
Since the 1970s , the suburbs have been the home for most high - tech jobs and now the majority of office space .
By 2000 , only 22 % of people worked within three miles of a city center in the nation ’s 100 largest metro areas .
And from 2001 to 2006 , job growth in suburbia expanded at six times the rate of that in urban cores , according to an analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics by the Praxis Strategy Group , a consulting firm with which I work .
A desire to live closer to their jobs does n’t mean that people have to move to the inner core , particularly if that ’s not where the jobs are .
Of the 20 leading job centers in Southern California by ZIP Code , none are downtown .
The central core does remain an important job center , but it accounts for barely 3 % of regional employment .
Among those who work downtown , some may shift from cars to public transit , although many will simply buy a more fuel - efficient car and stay put in the suburbs .
For residents who live in suburban areas with large concentrations of employment -- Burbank , Ontario and West L.A. -- commutes to work can be shorter than those experienced by their inner-city counterparts , according to Ali Modarres , a professor of geography at Cal State Los Angeles .
Commutes in these communities , on average , are less than 25 minutes , while in high - density areas , such as Pico - Union , they average 35 minutes .
The relative and continuing health of these suburban employment centers would seem to preclude any large - scale flight to cities .
But urban areas with limited or shrinking employment opportunities , and suburbs that bet on housing to sustain their economies , will continue to have trouble attracting residents either because of a scarcity of jobs or long commutes at a time of expensive gas .
The suburb - to - the - city narrative faces other obstacles .
By the early part of the next decade , the large millennial generation born since the early 1980s will begin to form families , and they will , as have previous generations , probably seek open space and good schools for their children -- and that means they will settle in the suburbs .
And there is no census evidence suggesting that immigrants have reversed their decade - old pattern of moving to the suburbs .
The growth of telecommuting , fed by technological advances , further ensures that suburbia has a future .
By 2006 , the expansion of home - based workers had grown twice as quickly as in the previous decade .
And by 2015 , according to demographer Wendell Cox , there will be more people in the country working electronically from home full time than are taking public transit .
More numerous will be those who work at home part time .
Nearly 29 million Americans telecommute at least once a month , according to WorldatWork , a nonprofit consultancy .
At many companies -- IBM , Sun Microsystems and AT&T among them -- upward of 30 % of their employees work from home .
In some regions , such as the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles , almost one in 10 workers are part - time telecommuters , according to a 2004 study done by Resources for the Future , a Washington - based think tank .
Continuing high energy prices will likely change the nation ’s geography , but not in ways some urban theorists are predicting .
Rather than cramming more people and families into cities , they may instead foster a more dispersed , diverse archipelago of self - sufficient communities .
From here , that looks like a far more pleasant scenario not only for suburban and exurbanites but for urban dwellers who do n’t want to live under dense conditions reminiscent of 19th century industrial cities or the teeming metropolises of the contemporary Third World .

Demonstrating that Dubya and the White House remain firmly inside their bubble , compare these two shots of Bush on Friday in Peoria .
The first shot is from the White House photo gallery .
The second is from a NYT article detailing how Bush , although largely frozen out of the campaign , continues to visit safe GOP districts , and otherwise is fundraising like a madman .
With the terror and security motif dying hard , it 's funny how the baby in the WH shot mirrors the agent .
Of course , the baby in the Times pic easily symbolizes the feelings toward Bush of approximately 8.5 out of 10 of the rest of us .
In this case , however , it 's the White House which offers the greater context -- at least , as to the locale .
Whereas the NYT identifies the setting as simply the Peoria airport , the White House indicates the exact spot is the Peoria Airport Air National Guard Ramp and the friendlies are military families .
Seems those military audiences , long a staple of the Bush photo op -- in the WH version , almost exclusively stocked with young girls and babies -- now serve as a last refuge .

When Paul G. Kaminski completed his graduate work in 1971 with degrees from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford , he started building advanced airplanes for the Air Force .
By the time he stopped several decades later , he had played a pivotal role in producing a flock of new weapons , including radar - evading stealth aircraft .
If Mr. Kaminski were coming out of school today , chances are he would be going to work for the likes of Microsoft or Google .
Over the last decade , even as spending on new defense projects has reached its highest level since the Reagan years , the Pentagon has increasingly been losing the people most skilled at managing them .
That brain drain , defense experts like Mr. Kaminski say , is a big factor in a breakdown in engineering management that has made huge cost overruns and long delays the maddening norm .
Mr. Kaminski ’s generation of engineers , which was responsible for many of the most successful defense projects of the 1970 ’s and 80’s , is aging .
But declining numbers of the nation ’s top young engineers , software developers and mathematicians are replacing them .
Instead , they are joining high - tech companies and other civilian firms that provide not just better pay than the military or its contractors , but also greater cachet  what one former defense - industry engineer called “ geek credit . ”
In a post titled , Wacky Obama accuser is wanted by the law , John wrote earlier today about Larry Sinclair who is pushing a bizarro story about Obama .
The guy has a very , very shady past .
Very shady .
Criminally shady .
In fact , the law got Sinclair today according to Dave Weigel :
I attended Larry Sinclair ’s press conference today and was confused when he concluded by rushing out of the room , taking no more questions .
The reason ?
He was arrested by the D.C. metropolitan police .
I called the First District station where he was being held and confirmed that Lawrence Wayne Sinclair was charged as a fugitive from justice based on an outstanding warrant .
Ben Smith has more .
Washington Mutual Inc. , responding to uncertainty in the marketplace , said it significantly exceeds all regulatory " well - capitalized " minimums for depository institutions and has excess liquidity of more than $ 40 billion .
The disclosure came hours after regional bank National City Corp. issued a similar missive after being forced to assert it is still credit - worthy .

Tomorrow , July 8th , could mark the beginning of official condoning of warrantless surveillance of law - abiding citizens in the US , not to mention foreign nationals .
Much of this information has been covered by Glenn Greenwald in the past week .
In the video below , I talk about what every American needs to know â€ ” and do in the next 24 hours â€ ” about the new FISA ( Federal Information and Surveillance Act ) amendments .
The interview , and below partial transcription , answers questions likeâ€ ¦
- I donâ€™t have anything to hide .
How does this affect me ?
- What if this type of surveillance is what has prevented another 9/11 from happening ?
- What are common inaccuracies about FISA reported in the media ?
Find below how you can make a real impact in less than 60 seconds .
Every person counts â€ ” the Senators who will vote are watching the numbers .
41 Senators can block the bill , and itâ€™s not too late .
Please do the following : How I ask you to spend 60 seconds
1. ALL AMERICANS : Go to the EFF website here and put in your zipcode to find your Senatorâ€™s phone number .
Call them and read the short script on the same page .
If no answer , click the link at the bottom of the page to e-mail them .
( Tell others verbally to go to â€œwww.eff.orgâ€ and click â€œtake actionâ€  )
2. OBAMA SUPPORTERS : Go to My.BarackObama.com here and join the group requesting he oppose ( as he did earlier ) the amendment .
This takes about 30 seconds .
I suggest changing â€ œListServâ€ in the bottom right to â€ œDo not receive e-mails.â€ 
( Tell others verbally to search â€œobama please vote noâ€ on Google and My.BarackObama.com will be in the top 3 results , currently # 1 )
Watch the video :
Some Highlights of the interview :
1 . Why does the vote this Tuesday , July 8th matter to normal people who have nothing to hide ?
Ordinary citizens who want to live in a democracy â€ ” including those with nothing to hide â€ ” should be concerned about the ability of the government to use private , sensitive personal information to blackmail , manipulate , and intimidate their representatives , journalists and their sources , potential whistleblowers , and activists or dissenters of any sort .
2. Couldnâ€™t it be argued that this type of surveillance ability has prevented another 9/11 from happening ?
Isnâ€™t it possible that this type of legislation has saved American lives ?
The administration has claimed that is has , but without presenting a single piece of evidence that this is so , even in closed hearings to Senators with clearances on the Intelligence Committee .
The FISA court has granted warrants in virtually every request thatâ€™s been made of it that has any color of helping national security .
The administrationâ€™s decision to bypass that court , illegally , leads to a strong suspicion that they are abusing domestic spying , as some of their predecessors did , in ways that even the secret FISA court would never approve .
3 . What are the most important factual inaccuracies about FISA found in the media ?
Advocates of the bill take pride that it makes this amended FISA the exclusive basis for overhearing citizens , but that exclusivity is , in fact , in the current 30 - year - old FISA bill already .
President Bush simply ignored it in bypassing FISA , and thereâ€™s not reason that he and his successors would not continue to do the same here .
Itâ€™s been inaccurately stated that if this amendments didnâ€™t pass , FISA would expire .
This is flatly false .
FISA is open - ended and will continue as it already has , adequately for 30 years .
What would expire are some blanket surveillance orders authorized last year , which the majority of Democrats , including Senator Obama , voted against .
The current bill does include one useful amendment to FISA , which could be passed with virtually unanimous approval in an afternoon , to allow warrantless interception of foreign - to - foreign communications that happen to pass through the United States .
No one opposes this .
Various administration officials have claimed that the requirement of applying for a warrant from the FISA court deprived them of speed and flexibility .
This is false .
The FISA allows for surveillance to be implemented in an emergency situation before a warrant is sought , and that could undoubtedly be extended with Congressional approval without controversy .
What the administration seeks , and this bill provides , is permanent warrantless surveillance .
4. Letâ€™s consider an analogy : police officers have the legal right to stop you if youâ€™re going 56 mph in a 55 - mph zone , but this right isnâ€™t often abused or applied to harass citizens .
What makes you think the administration would abuse their surveillance powers if this amendment is approved ?
The abuses of surveillance to which governments are drawn are those that keep them in office , used to intimidate and manipulate their rivals , and to avoid debate and dissent on their policies .
These are exactly the abuses that the Church Committee discovered in 1975 , which had been conducted on a wide - scale by the Johnson and Nixon administrations , and in some cases even earlier , which is what lead to FISA in the first place .
To remove judicial oversight , which this amendment would effectively do , is to invite the same kind of repressive abuse that lead to FISA in the first place .
5 . Why would the current administration want this amendment to pass , if not for safety of citizens and prevention of attacks ?
Using NSA to spy without judicial oversight or constraint on American citizens provides the infrastructure for dictatorship .
George W. Bush has frequently said what other presidents may only have thought : â€ œIt would be a heck of a lot easier in a dictatorship , if only I were the dictator.â€ 
Other presidents have violated the law and the Constitution in much the same way as Bush , so long as they could do it secretly , but they havenâ€™t proclaimed that as a right of their office as Bush , Cheney and their legal advisors have done .
The oath of office they took , along with all members of Congress , was to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies , foreign or domestic .
I believe that , in the matters weâ€™ve been discussing , the Founders had it right , not only for their time but for ours .
Whether you want to shop loose diamonds for an engagement ring or diamond studs , we have some insider tips that will make your online diamond buying journey easy .
Choosing A Diamond Shape
When you want to buy loose diamonds , one of the first considerations is diamond shape .
Diamonds are available in many shapes and each shape is uniquely beautiful .
So whether you want to buy an emerald cut diamond or a round brilliant diamond , it is all about personal choice .
The round cut diamond is the most popular , followed by the princess cut diamond .
Both cuts maximize brilliance , flash and fire .
In step - cut diamonds , the emerald and asscher cut diamond are quite popular .
These diamond shapes focus on flashes of fire rather than the brilliance .
The cushion cut diamond and radiant cut diamond have the brilliance of a round diamond in an unusual shape .
If you like vintage jewelry , the oval cut diamond or the pear shaped diamond may be a good choice .
If you want a diamond with a distinctive shape , take a look at the marquise cut diamond or heart shaped diamond .
Diamond Cut
Cut is one of the most important of the diamond 4Cs because the way a diamond is cut determines how much it will sparkle .
The cut refers to the way facets or polished flat surfaces have been cut on the diamond .
When light enters through a diamond , an expertly - cut diamond will refract and reflect the most light .
So , better cut diamonds sparkle more .
The GIA grades diamonds from Excellent to Poor .
We always recommend choosing the best cut grade possible within your budget .
Diamond Color
When choosing loose diamonds , people are usually looking for the absence of any color or tint .
Diamond color is a rather subjective topic .
Some people prefer bright white diamonds while others like the warmth of diamonds with lower color grades and so there is n't a definitive best color for diamonds .
The GIA grades color on a scale of D to Z .
The grade D signifies color - less diamonds , without the presence of yellow or any other tinge .
Diamonds show more and more color as the grades drop to Z on the diamond color scale .
Diamond Clarity
Diamonds have some natural flaws called inclusions .
The amount of inclusions present defines the clarity of a diamond .
The clearer the diamond , the more it will sparkle and the more it will cost .
The GIA diamond clarity scale starts with FL and goes down to I .
Diamonds have more inclusions as the diamond clarity chart moves towards .
Diamond Carat
Diamond carat refers to the weight of the diamond .
One carat is equal to 200 milligrams .
Diamond prices go up as the carat weight increases .
But , the price does not increase proportionally .
So , a 3 carat diamond does not cost 3 times as much as a one carat diamond but a lot more .
This is because bigger diamonds are rare and cost more .
The Importance of Certified Loose Diamonds
A diamond certificate from reputed labs like the GIA , AGS and HRD is a mark of authenticity .
These labs are independent and not affiliated with any diamond retailers .
When you buy GIA certified loose diamonds , AGS certified loose diamonds or HRD certified diamonds , the certification or lab reports are universally accepted .
How to Save on Loose Diamond
Loose diamond prices are a result of all the 4Cs and the certification .
To find loose diamonds that fit your budget you have to decide which of the 4Cs is the most important to you .
If diamond carat is your priority , you could choose a diamond with a G , H or I color grade , rather than the premium D , E and F .
For some , a lower color and clarity is a good trade off for a larger carat weight and better cut .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stocks and the dollar shrugged off recent weakness from credit concerns and moved higher on Tuesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reassured investors about liquidity for banking system needs and oil took another inflation - dampening tumble .
Signs that investors still fear the impact of a lingering credit crunch could be seen in Europe , where stocks fell and euro zone government bonds advanced amid worries about further potential write - downs by banks .
Trading started on a weaker note on Wall Street as a sharper - than - expected decline in pending U.S. home sales in May signaled more trouble for the beleaguered housing market and supported a rise in fixed - income markets .
But Bernanke bolstered the market with a speech saying that the U.S. central bank may extend emergency lending facilities for big Wall Street banks past year - end as it seeks to restore financial market stability .
“ What Bernanke ’s saying is helping Wall Street , and that ’s helping the dollar , ” said Boris Schlossberg , senior currency strategist at DailyFX.com in New York .
“ Everybody thinks the Fed ’s No. 1 mandate is to fight inflation , but it ’s actually to make sure the banks are solid .
“ What they ’re trying to do is avoid a panic on Wall Street , and in the near term that ’s dollar - positive , ” he added .
Bernanke 's comments stopped a sell - off in financial stocks on Monday when Lehman Brothers estimated a proposed accounting rule could force Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N billions in fresh capital .
Some thought the market reaction was overdone since Lehman said itself said it doubted an accounting change detrimental to the two largest U.S. mortgage lenders would be enacted .
The S&P financial index .
GSPF rose more than 2 percent .
Also lifting U.S. shares was a rally in defensive stocks such as pharmaceutical shares , with the American Stock Exchange .DRG index of 14 big Pharma companies up 2.7 percent .

Before 1 p.m. , the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 47.54 points , or 0.42 percent , at 11,279.50 .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 Index .SPX was up 4.12 points , or 0.33 percent , at 1,256.43 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 17.26 points , or 0.77 percent , at 2,260.58 .
In Europe , fresh concern about the outlook for the banking sector drove shares down .
A steep drop in crude prices and a rally in safe - haven sectors such as drugmakers helped stem the slide .
Some analysts believe there may be some respite to the selling in the European equity market , which has fallen by about 30 percent since last July ’s multi- year highs .

Just in case there was any ambiguity about Iran 's missile test today in the Hormuz Straits , the air force chief , General Hossein Salami , put any lingering uncertainty to rest .
Salami said the tests of long - and medium - range missiles were intended to demonstrate Iranian resolve " against enemies who in recent weeks have threatened Iran with a harsh language " .
There is no question that the principal enemy the Iranian government has in mind is Israel .
Israel is within range of the Shahab 3 missile , one of the weapons tested today .
And Israel is the only country currently employing " harsh language " about Iran .
George Bush repeatedly says " all options are on the table " but that diplomacy is his administration 's favoured approach .
Israeli officials , by contrast , have said explicitly they would carry out air strikes to prevent Iran building nuclear weapons .
Shaul Mofaz , a cabinet minister and former army chief , has said Israel would have " no choice " but to carry out an attack .
The EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , is due back in Tehran soon to discuss a proposed deal offering economic , energy and diplomatic incentives in return for suspension of uranium enrichment .
The signs so far are not good .
Iran 's initial response appears to have been a polemic that ignored the issue of suspension .
Israel has always believed that negotiations with Iran were doomed to failure and that the ruling clerics had made a strategic decision to go nuclear which they would not abandon .
Israeli officials had hoped the Bush administration would take action , but they now have doubts and are considering their own unilateral military options .
Those options are limited .
Israeli planes would have to fly a long way to reach their targets , presuming Jordan would not give its approval for overflights .
The strikes would be aimed at deeply buried targets , with no certainty that all Iran 's nuclear facilities are known to Israeli intelligence .
The strikes could spur Iran 's nuclear ambitions while failing to hobble them .
But Israel 's government believes it has no choice but to strike in the hope of slowing down the programme , even if it has to strike again and again to keep it in check .
It is derisive about Iran 's claims to be pursuing a purely peaceful energy generation scheme , seeing Tehran 's nuclear ambitions as an existential threat and for that reason , a government adviser said recently , the standards of proof are lower .
" While your intelligence has to be 90 % sure before handing the decision to the policy - makers for action , our intelligence only has to be 70 % sure , " the advisor said .
He added that the Israeli public might forgive a botched mission , but would never forgive inaction in the face of such a perceived mortal threat .
If the Iranian nuclear programme continues at the present pace , he said , a decision would have to be made in the next year to 18 months .
The Iranian response has been to underline its deterrent with events like today 's missile test and heightened rhetoric .
Ali Shirazi , an aide to Iran 's Supreme Leader , said Tel Aviv would " burn " if Iran was attacked .
It would not be a limited war .
Iranian officials have said that they would automatically presume an Israeli strike was western - backed and retaliate accordingly .
Shirazi said the US fleet in the Persian Gulf would also be hit .
In the past the Iranians have threatened asymmetric warfare using small boats and suicide bombers against much larger ships .
It is a fair bet that shipping in the Straits of Hormuz – through which 40 % of the world 's oil passes - would either be blocked or seriously squeezed .
Attacks on US and British troops could also be stepped up through proxies and allies in Iraq and Afghanistan .
US military intervention would be unavoidable .
The sabres being rattled across the Persian Gulf right now are very real and very dangerous .

Demand for biofuels will add to pressure on forests , the report warns Demand for land to grow food , fuel crops and wood is set to outstrip supply , leading to the probable destruction of forests , a report warns .
The Rights and Resources Initiative ( RRI ) says only half of the extra land needed by 2030 is available without eating into tropical forested areas .
A companion report documents poor progress in reforming land ownership and governance in developing countries .
Both reports were launched on Monday in UK government offices in London .
Supporters of RRI include the UK's Department of International Development ( DfID ) and its equivalents in Sweden and Switzerland .
The dual crises of fuel and food are attracting significant land speculation
Andy White , RRI " Arguably , we are on the verge of a last great global land grab , " said RRI 's Andy White , co-author of the major report , Seeing People through the Trees .
" It will mean more deforestation , more conflict , more carbon emissions , more climate change and less prosperity for everyone . "
Rising demand for food , biofuels and wood for paper , building and industry means that 515 million hectares of extra land will be needed for growing crops and trees by 2030 , RRI calculates .
But only 200 million hectares will be available without dipping into tropical forests .
Forest focus
The report foresees demand increasing further into the century .
' New crops needed ' to avoid famine It cites studies suggesting that " ... if the current plateau in productivity continues , the amount of additional agricultural land required just to meet the world 's projected food demand in 2050 would be about three billion hectares , nearly all of which would be required in developing countries . "
According to UN figures , the world currently has about 1.4 billion hectares of arable land and about 3.4 billion hectares of pasture .
Some academics place their hopes in agricultural technologies including genetic engineering to boost crop yields .
But since the spectacular successes of the Green Revolution , advances have been slow .
In some areas , yields are falling - a trend which is likely to be exacerbated by climate change .
However , eating into tropical forests to create extra agricultural land would , in turn , exacerbate climate change , with deforestation currently accounting for about 20 % of greenhouse gas emissions .
Reform call
One of RRI 's main conclusions is that reform of land ownership is crucial , if large - scale pillage of tropical forests is to be avoided .
The conclusion have been supported by DfID , whose minister Gareth Thomas was one of the speakers at the launch event .
" These new studies should strengthen global resolve to protect the property rights of indigenous and local communities who play a vital role in protecting one the most outstanding natural wonders of the world , " he said .
DfID runs programmes in West Africa aimed at helping forest dwellers acquire the legal right to manage their land .
Many indigenous peoples need help in acquiring rights to the land they live on " It is clear that the dual crises of fuel and food are attracting significant new investments and great land speculation , " said Andy White .
" Only by protecting the rights of the people who live in and around the world 's most vulnerable forests can we prevent the devastation these forces will wreak on the poor . "
But the second RRI report - From Exclusion to Ownership ?
- says progress in reforming ownership has been slow , with only a few countries such as Brazil , Cameroon and Tanzania handing over significant tracts to local communities .
Moves to curb climate change by preserving forests in developing countries could help , RRI concludes .
But it also raises the question of who owns rights to the trees - the rich Western countries that want to fund carbon sequestration , or the people who live in the forest areas ?
Sorting out ownership could not only help on the environmental front , but also remove reasons for conflict .
RRI calculates that about two - thirds of the world 's current violent conflicts are driven by land tenure issues .

What is it with Japan and weird drinks ?
Part of the answer lies in the love Japanese have for soft drinks – surveys show that about 40 % of the nation 's citizens drink at least one soft drink every day .
That 's about 50 million people !
In addition , trends come and go very quickly in Japan .
What 's cool today is as flat as warm Pepsi Ice Cucumber tomorrow ... so soft drink companies are constantly coming out with something new and ( hopefully ) attention - grabbing ' cause one success more than makes up for dozens of failures .
10 ) Unagi-Nobori Eel Soda
9 ) Fanta Furufuru Shaker
Unagi -Nobori soda is no ordinary energy drink , oh no ... this terrific tonic is infused with a generous helping of eel extract .
If you think there 's something fishy about that , you 're unfortunately right .
According to Japanese folk tradition , eating eel is reputed to give one extra energy on summer 's hottest , most humid days .
These days though , one does n't always have time for a leisurely lunch of delicious barbecued eel .
No problem – Unagi Nobori bottles essence of eel heads and bones bolstered with 5 essential vitamins in a carbonated medium .
Make my medium small , if you do n't mind ... and by the way , Unagi Nobori is brought to you by the nice folks at Japan Tobacco , famous for their wide range of " healthy " products with smoky flavors .
Ever made Jello using 7 - Up or Grape Crush instead of cold water ?
The gelatin retains a little carbonation after it cools .
seems to be designed on the same principle ; a semi - gelled drink that gets fizzy when you shake it .
We do n't knowyou drink it ... you 'd need a fairly wide straw , if not a spoon .
You 're probably best off drinking Furufuru Shaker direct from the can instead of trying to pour it out : doing so evokes the image of thick , gloopy mucus that sizzles evilly like the goop inside that nasty meteor from The Blob .
Mmm , meteor mucus !

8 ) Enemania
Let 's see now , what name would best describe a new energy drink that 's so delicious drinking it becomes a mania ?
Enemania , of course !
What could possibly go wrong ?
Well for one thing , consumers might wonder if the product is meant to be drank conventionally or , er , via some other method involving tubes , bags and other such accessories .
On the other hand , we hear Michael H. Kenyon ( also known as the Illinois Enema Bandit ) is free - as in , he 's been paroled after serving a six - year sentence - and would make an ideal pitch man .

7 ) Bilk
Bilk ... according to my dictionary , it means “ to cheat out of something valuable ” .
It also makes a terrible name for a new drink , unless that drink is an unholy marriage of milk and beer , in which case it 's entirely appropriate .
Besides , Japanese dairy farmers are pretty much swimming in surplus milk and if Bilk does n't work out they could resort to something truly awful like a cheese drink ( more to come ) .
Bilk ... 70 % beer , 30 % milk , 100 % disgusting .
Supposedly , Bilk possesses a subtle sweetness that women should find most appealing .
Ladies , welcome to the wide world of beer bellies , belches and lactose intolerance !
Bilk can be bought at 6 outlets in Japan 's northern province of Hokkaido where bears outnumber humans 2:1 .
Guess they like the stuff , for their pic - a -nic baskets and all .
( via Japan Probe )
6 ) NEEDS Cheese Drink
Well , you balked at Bilk so now it 's come to this : NEEDS Cheese Drink .
Nuh-uh , that 's where we draw the line .
Cheese should be enjoyed in the solid state , thank you , after shaving off slice after paper - thin slice with a fiendish funky cheese - shaving knife .
NEEDS Cheese Drink , nobody needs .
In fact , it seems the only ones who DO needs NEEDS are those pesky dairy farmers in Hokkaido who “ needs ” to do something about growing stocks of surplus milk .
If only there was some creature , sort of like a baby but still a cow , who could drink the surplus milk ... ah well , never mind .

5 ) Octopus - Ball Soda
How thirsty does one have to be before deciding to crack open a cold can of Takoyaki Soda ?
That 's " Octopus - Ball Soda " , by the way , and we hope you enjoy quenching your thirst while countless castrated cephalopods undergo unimaginable pain and suffering for - wait , wait , not those kinds of octopus balls !
Had you going there for a sec , did n't we ?
Actual canned Takoyaki Soda is made with much more palatable ( and morally acceptable ) ingredients meant to evoke the delicate flavor of tender baked spheres of chopped , seasoned octopus in a light and fluffy batter .
Still thirsty ?

4) Okkikunare " Bust - Building " Drinks
Okkikunare is Japanese for “ make them bigger ” , and do we really have to tell you what “ them ” refers to ?
Well , maybe we do - the world definitely does n't need more moobs .
Made by Welcia , the special bust - boosting ingredients in Okkikunare drinks are isoflavones and plant - based estrogen analogs reputed to stimulate the female hormone system .
Seems a little sketchy to us ... then again , the drinks are also sweetened with high - fructose corn syrup , which has been linked to obesity .
Therefore , EVERYTHING gets bigger the more you drink .
( via DumpSoda )
3 ) Kid's Wine
Kid's
Wine – not just a road trip complaint anymore !
Kid's
Beer topped our list last time around but did you know the same company , Sangaria , makes “ wine ” specially made for children ?
Well of course they do : beer is a notorious gateway drink and the wee rugrats can't be expected to make the leap to Kid's Scotch in a single leap , amiright ?
( via Sangaria )
2 ) Swine Placenta Drink
From Kid's Wine to Kid Swine ...
As odd as the former may seem , Kid's Wine has got nuthin ' on the latter : Placenta 400000 Drink made with swine placenta .
You know , ladies , there comes a point where bizarre beauty potions intended to make you luscious just make us nauseous – and Nihon Shokuten 's gag - worthy series of placenta products are a prime example .
Made with only the finest porcine placentas - possibly 400,000 of 'em per bottle - this revolting tonic should come pre-packaged with mints because there 's nothing worse than placenta - breath in the morning .
( via Japan Trend Shop )
1 ) Fukucup Sake
Ah yes , Fukucup 200 , the sake that insults as it inebriates !
One might even say drinking it will f*** you up , but that would mean reading the side of the handy single - serving can .
Some translations of the word " fuku " indicate a wish for good luck ; sort of the opposite of the English expression it so closely resembles .
( via 3Yen )
And there you have it , Ten More Weird and Bizarre Japanese Soft Drinks .
And , in case you were wondering , no Pocari Sweat again this time .
Not even the doggie version , “ Pet Sweat ” .
Strange as it sounds , Japan can do much better ... or worse , as the case may be .

Actually , it is not a knife and is known under the name of Finger Tree .
Update :
In a personal communication with :
In a personal communication with Eric Lippert it was revealed that , in his words :
" I worked up a full implementation as well but I decided that it was too complicated to post in the blog .
What I was really trying to get across was that immutable data structures were possible and not that hard ; a full - on finger tree implementation was a bit too much for that purpose . "
I am happy to correct my post and acknowledge that a previous C# implementation did exist .
Hopefully , Eric will publish his implementation .
So , the work discussed here is most probably the first published Finger Tree implementation in C# .
Background :
Created by Ralf Hinze and Ross Paterson in 2004 , and based to a large extent on the work of Chris Okasaki on Implicit Recursive Slowdown and Catenable Double - Ended Queus , this data structure , to quote the abstract of the paper introducing Finger Trees , is :
" a functional representation of persistent sequences supporting access to the ends in amortized constant time , and concatenation and splitting in time logarithmic in the size of the smaller piece .
Representations achieving these bounds have appeared previously , but 2 - 3 finger trees are much simpler , as are the operations on them .
Further , by defining the split operation in a general form , we obtain a general purpose data structure that can serve as a sequence , priority queue , search tree , priority search queue and more . "
Why the finger tree deserves to be called the Swiss knife of data structures can best be explained by again quoting the introduction of the paper :
" The operations one might expect from a sequence abstraction include adding and removing elements at both ends ( the deque operations ) , concatenation , insertion and deletion at arbitrary points , finding an element satisfying some criterion , and splitting the sequence into subsequences based on some property .
Many efficient functional implementations of subsets of these operations are known , but supporting more operations efficiently is difficult .
The best known general implementations are very complex , and little used .
This paper introduces functional 2 - 3 finger trees , a general implementation that performs well , but is much simpler than previous implementations with similar bounds .
The data structure and its many variations are simple enough that we are able to give a concise yet complete executable description using the functional programming language Haskell ( Peyton Jones , 2003 ) .
The paper should be accessible to anyone with a basic knowledge of Haskell and its widely used extension to multiple - parameter type classes ( Peyton Jones et al. , 1997 ) .
Although the structure makes essential use of laziness , it is also suitable for strict languages that provide a lazy evaluation primitive . "
Efficiency and universality are the two most attractive features of finger trees .
Not less important is simplicity , as it allows easy understanding , straightforward implementation and uneventful maintenance .
Stacks support efficient access to the first item of a sequence only , queues and deques support efficient access to both ends , but not to an randomly - accessed item .
Arrays allow extremely efficient O ( 1 ) access to any of their items , but are poor at inserting , removal , splitting and concatenation .
Lists are poor ( O ( N ) ) at locating a randomly indexed item .
Remarkably , the finger tree is efficient with all these operations .
One can use this single data structure for all these types of operations as opposed to having to use several types of data structures , each most efficient with only some operations .
Note also the words functional and persistent , which mean that the finger tree is an immutable data structure .
In .NET the IList < T > interface specifies a number of void methods , which change the list in - place ( so the instance object is mutable ) .
To implement an immutable operation one needs first to make a copy of the original structure ( List < T > , LinkedList < T > , … , etc ) .
An achievement of .NET 3.5 and LINQ is that the set of new extension methods ( of the Enumerable class ) implement immutable operations .
In the year 2008 , Finger Tree implementations have been known only in a few programming languages : in Haskell , in OCaml , and in Scala .
At least this is what the popular search engines say .
What about a C# implementation ?
In February Eric Lippert had a post in his blog about finger trees .
The C# code he provided does not implement all operations of a Finger Tree and probably this is the reason why this post is referred to by the Wikipedia only as " Example of 2 - 3 trees in C# " , but not as an implementation of the Finger Tree data structure .
Actually , he did have a complete implementation at that time ( see the Update at the start of this post ) , but desided not to publish it .
My modest contribution is what I believe to be the first published complete C# implementation of the Finger Tree data structure as originally defined in the paper by Hinze and Paterson ( only a few exercises have not been implemented ) .
Programming a Finger Tree in C# was as much fun as challenge .
The finger tree structure is defined in an extremely generic way .
At first I even was concerned that C# might not be sufficiently expressive to implement such rich genericity .
It turned out that C# lived up to the challenge perfectly .
Here is a small example of how the code uses multiple types and nested type constraints :
// Types :
// U — the type of Containers that can be split
// T — the type of elements in a container of type U
// V — the type of the Measure - value when an element is measured
public class Split < U , T , V >
where U : ISplittable <T , V >
where T : IMeasured <V >
{
// ………………………………………………… .
}
Another challenge was to implement lazy evaluation ( the .NET term for this is " deferred execution " ) for some of the methods .
Again , C# was up to the challenge with its IEnumerable interface and the ease and finesse of using the " yield return " statement .
The net result : it was possible to write code like this :
public override IEnumerable < T> ToSequence ( )
{
ViewL < T , M> lView = LeftView ( ) ;
yield return lView.head ;
foreach ( T t in lView.ftTail.ToSequence ( ) )
yield return t;
}
Another challenge , of course , was that one definitely needs to understand Hinze ’s and Ross ’ article before even trying to start the design of an implementation .
While the text should be straightforward to anyone with some Haskell and functional programming experience , it requires a bit of concentration and some very basic understanding of fundamental algebraic concepts .
In the text of the article one will find a precise and simple definition of a Monoid .
My first thought was that such academic knowledge would not really be necessary for a real - world programming task .
Little did I know …
It turned out that the Monoid plays a central role in the generic specification of objects that have a Measure .
I was thrilled to code my own version of a monoid in C# :
public class Monoid <T >
{
T theZero ;
public delegate T monOp ( T t1 , T t2 ) ;
public monOp the Op ;
public Monoid( T tZero , monOp a MonOp )
{
theZero = tZero ;
the Op = aMonOp ;
}
public T zero
{
get
{
return the Zero ;
}
}
}
Without going into too - much details , here is how the correct Monoids are defined in suitable auxiliary classes to be used in defining a Random - Access Sequence , Priority Queue and Ordered Sequence :
public static class Size
{
public static Monoid < uint > the Monoid =
new Monoid < uint >(
0 , new Monoid < uint >. monOp ( anAddOp ) ) ;
public static uint anAddOp ( uint s1 , uint s2 )
{
return s1 + s2 ;
}
}
public static class Prio
{
public static Monoid < double > the Monoid =
new Monoid < double >
( double.NegativeInfinity ,
new Monoid < double>.monOp(aMaxOp )
) ;
public static double aMaxOp ( double d1 , double d2 )
{
return ( d1 > d2 ) ? d1 : d2 ;
}
}
public class Key<T , V > where V : IComparable
{
public delegate V getKey ( T t ) ;
// maybe we should n’t care for NoKey , as this is too theoretic
public V NoKey ;
public getKey KeyAssign ;
public Key ( V noKey , getKey KeyAssign )
{
this .KeyAssign = KeyAssign ;
}
}
public class KeyMonoid<T , V > where V : IComparable
{
public Key<T , V> KeyObj ;
public Monoid < V > the Monoid ;
public V aNextKeyOp ( V v1 , V v2 )
{
return ( v2.CompareTo( KeyObj.NoKey ) == 0 ) ? v1 : v2 ;
}
//constructor
public KeyMonoid( Key<T , V> KeyObj )
{
this .KeyObj = KeyObj ;
this .
theMonoid =
new Monoid<V>( KeyObj.NoKey ,
new Monoid < V>.monOp(aNextKeyOp )
) ;
}
}
Yet another challenge was to be able to create methods dynamically , as currying was essentially used in the specification of finger trees with measures .
Once again it was great to make use of the existing .
NET 3.5 infrastructure .
Below is my simple FP static class , which essentially uses the .NET 3.5 Func object and a lambda expression in order to implement currying :
public static class FP
{
public static Func <Y , Z > Curry <X , Y , Z >
( this Func < X , Y , Z > func , X x )
{
return ( y ) => func( x , y ) ;
}
}
And here is a typical usage of the currying implemented above :
public T ElemAt ( uint ind )
{
return treeRep .
Split
( new MPredicate < uint >
(
FP . Curry < uint , uint , bool >( the LessThanIMethod2 , ind )
) ,
0
).splitItem .
Element ;
}
Now , for everyone who have reached this point of my post , here is the link to the complete implementation .
Be reminded once again that .NET 3.5 is needed for a successful build .
In my next posts I will analyze the performance of this Finger Tree implementation and how it fares compared to existing implementations of sequential data structures as provided by different programming languages and environments .
China Drills for Oil off the Coast of Florida , America Doesn’t
This is something that has bothered me for quite a while .
China has a
deal with Cuba and is drilling for oil just off of the Florida coast .
Needless to say , the enviro - nazis in America will not let us drill off the coast of Florida .
Whenever I hear a conversation about the high price of oil at work and I hear the liberals I work with blame everything except the fact that we are sitting on our own oil but we are n’t allowed to touch it I start to boil inside .
I usually throw out the line about how China is drilling off the coast of Florida but that the environmentalists wo n’t let us drill there .
I am usually met with a blank stare .
Naturally these people have no idea what I am talking about .
This scenario happened just yesterday to me .
After I mentioned that little tidbit about China I was told that Americans need to turn down their heat in the winter .
I was told that Americans feel as if it is their right to turn on every light in the house .
i was told that if we just did n’t waste so much energy everything would be alright .
Not in those exact words , but the point was made .
I then made the mistake of telling said liberal that America needs more nuclear plants .
I figured that I could play to the environmental side of this liberal by mentioning that nuclear energy was actually one of the cleanest forms of energy available .
He would have none of that .
That is why I do n’t usually debate with liberals at work .
That is why I usually keep to myself when it comes to politics .
You ca n’t reason with the unreasonable .
Well somehow I have gone off on a tangent and I need to get back on topic .
Where was I ?
Oh yeah , drilling off the coast of Florida .
The point that I was trying to make before I got distracted was that while China is drilling off of our own coast most Americans do n’t even seem to know , or care , that this is happening .
Thankfully Republicans in the senate today brought it out in the open .
Hopefully enough Americans out there who had no clue this was going on will now awaken and ask why .
Why ca n’t we drill for oil on our coast while China can ?
They probably wo n’t though , but finally this is getting some mention .
“ By prohibiting the United States from taking part in the same type of energy exploration that the Chinese are conducting just miles off our shores , the Democratic Majority on Capitol Hill continues to prove itself complicit in an energy crisis that has saddled American families and small businesses with gas prices that have reached $ 4.05 per gallon today , ” the news release said .
“ Do congressional Democrats actually believe China has more ingenuity and more concern for the environment than the United States ? ” Republicans asked .
That last sentence hits the nail on the head .
Do the environmentalists actually believe that China is more friendly to the environment then we are ?
There is already drilling going on there , if we drill it will not impact the environment any more than China is with their lax environmental standards .
Finally this is being brought to light , the problem is that most people do n’t even realize what is going on .
Most people do n’t seem to pay attention other than to bitch about the price of oil .
We are sitting on more black gold than we can shake a stick at , but shaking a stick at it is all we are allowed to do .
The oil just sits there off the coast of Florida waiting for someone to come and get it but the only ones who get it are the Chinese .
Yahoo recently released a new search API .
Known as Yahoo BOSS , for “ Build your Own Searcg Service , ” the API allows you to query search results from their servers , format them however you want , mash the data up with other services , and even re-order results .
You get “ Unlimited * ” queries ( they just reserve “ the right to limit unintended usage , such as automated querying by bots ” ) and they do n’t even require attribution .
Even though I ’m what you could possibly call a “ Google / Apple fanboy ” ( though you would be advised to not say such things … ) , and I ’ve long dismissed Yahoo as boring , geared towards web newbies , among other things , I have to admit , this is a great API .
Google never gave us anything like this ( despite their seemingly unlimited resources ) and they discontinued their fairly limited search API .
( As a side note , I also admit that Yahoo owns some great web services , such as Flickr and Del.icio.us . )
I ’ve already got to work playing with the API , creating a sort of search mashup .
I figured I ’d share a little bit of code , and show you how to create a basic SERP .
Be warned , the following requires PHP5 and some cURL black magic .
( If you have no idea what I just said , read a book , and come back later . )
In order to use Yahoo BOSS , you need to get an API key .
If you have a Yahoo account , it will only take about five minutes .
Once you ’ve got a key , you may want to take a quick look at the API documentation .
There are n’t any functioning examples or tutorials , but the guide tells you what sort of queries you can send , and what you can expect to get back in response .
Now for the fun part .
Here ’s a basic example I threw together .
You can use it as a starting point for your own project .
It ’s fairly basic , as it ’s main goal is to illustrate how to go about requesting data from the api and displaying it .
You should be able to run the code as - is , though you ’ll need to insert your API key before running the script :
<? php if ( $ _GET [ 's ' ] == '' ) { ?>
< form method = " get " style=" margin - bottom:30 px ; margin - top:20 px ; " >
< input type =" text " name= " s " size = " 30 " /> < input type =" submit " value = " Search " />
</ form >
<? php } ?>
<? php
if ( $ _GET ['s ' ] != '' ) {
// Gather data and prepare query
$ thequery = urlencode ( $_GET ['s ' ] ) ;
$ yhost = ' http://boss.yahooapis.com';
$ apikey = ' PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE ';
$url = $ yhost . '/ ysearch/web/v1/'.$thequery.'?appid='.$apikey.'& format=xml ' ;
// Get the results
$ ch = curl_init ( $url ) ;
curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER , true ) ;
curl_setopt( $ch , CURLOPT_HEADER , 0 ) ;
$ data = curl_exec ( $ch ) ;
curl_close ( $ch ) ;
$ results = new SimpleXmlElement ( $data , LIBXML_NOCDATA ) ;
/ /echo the results
foreach ( $ results ->resultset_web -> result as $ theresult ) {
echo ' < a href= " '.$ theresult -> clickurl . ' " >'.$ theresult -> title .'</a>< br/>';
echo $ theresult ->abstract .'< br / >';
echo '< small >< i >'.$ theresult -> dispurl .'</i></small ><br/>';
echo '< br /><br/>';
}
}
?>
As you can see , this is about as basic as an example as you can get .
It shows the first ten web results for whatever you enter in the box .
If you were to append “ &start=20 ″ to the end of the query URL in the $url variable , it would show results 11 - 20 instead .
That ’s the beginning of creating a pagination system to allow a user to move beyond page one of the results .
If you have a little bit of PHP experience ( like I recommended earlier ; were n’t you listening ? ) , the code should be fairly self - explanetory .
First , the script outputs a search box , unless the form has already been submitted .
If that ’s the case , the script will move on two step 2 .
If someone has submitted the form , the value of the “ s ” variable from the browser URL ’s query string ( it looks like “ ? s=blah ” ) is reformatted so spaces and other special characters wo n’t make the BOSS API puke when it sees them .
The API query is assembled .
If you were to place the word “ echo ” before the “ $url= … ” statement you ’d get to see the complete URL when the result page loads .
It looks something like “ http://boss.yahooapis.com/ysearch/web/v1/iphone?appid=YOUR_API_KEY&format=xml”, where iPhone is the search query and YOUR_API_KEY is , well , your API key .
If you ’re a JSON maniac you can replace format=xml with format=json , but if you want to do that , you probably do n’t need my tutorial .
Next , we use the useful cURL extension to send a request to Yahoo saying “ give us the data , Yahoo . ”
After it gets a response , the SimpleXmlElement line parses the returned XML file into a PHP Object .
Now we move onto the part where we display the results with a simple foreach ( ) loop .
You can style it however you want , maybe write some more semantically correct XHTML , but good old < br /> works well enough to illustrate my point .
( Yeah , I ’m lazy . )
Now make it your own .
You ’ve got a basic starting point , and hopefully some knowledge on how it works .
Do something unique with it , mash the data up with data from another API .
EDIT : Some of you have been having trouble with the code above .
WordPress seems to be trying to “ fix ” parts of it .

FREDERICK , Md. | Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett has underreported or failed to report roughly $ 1 million in property sales since 2004 , according to a newspaper report .
Mr. Bartlett , Western Maryland Republican , told the Frederick News - Post that the omissions - involving at least four properties - was a result of inattentiveness and his and others ’ confusion about the deals .
“ Nothing sinister , not trying to hide anything , ” said Mr. Bartlett , who plans to amend the reports to correct the discrepancies .
Mr. Bartlett , 82 , is running for a ninth term representing the 6th District , which includes all or part of eight counties from the state ’s western border to the Susquehanna River .
The News - Post reported the discrepancies Sunday after comparing Mr. Bartlett ’s federally mandated personal financial - disclosure forms with state property records .
Under federal law , members of Congress must disclose details of their finances annually , including their earned and unearned income , assets , gifts and travel .
Failing to file a disclosure statement carries a civil penalty of up to $ 11,000 .
Falsifying a statement can result in the fine and criminal penalties of up to five years ’ imprisonment .
The News - Post reported Mr. Bartlett failed to disclose the sale of a house near Mount Pleasant for $ 449,000 in 2004 .
He bought the house for $ 180,000 in 2001 , according to state property records .
The newspaper reported Mr. Bartlett also failed to disclose the sale of a house in Knoxville for $ 299,900 in 2006 .
He bought the building for $ 42,000 in 2000 , according to the report .
He said the Liberty Road property was confused with an adjacent one because it had been split off from a larger parcel .
Mr. Bartlett also said the Knoxville house was one of several he owns in the area .
State records and Mr. Bartlett ’s financial disclosures show he owns or has owned other nearby properties over the years .
One of them he reported owning for several years after state records show it was sold .
Mr. Bartlett said he was only peripherally involved in the restoration of the Knoxville house .
“ I really was a bit player , ” he said .
“ My son rebuilt the houses ; my wife wrote the checks . ”
Mr. Bartlett reported selling a house in Ijamsville in 2004 for $ 50,000 to $ 100,001 .
State property records list the sale price as $ 435,000 .
Mr. Bartlett blamed the error on staff not reading his handwritten notes correctly .
He said he signed the finished form without reading it , something he said he should n’t have done .
Dan Auble , financial - disclosure researcher with the watchdog group Center for Responsive Politics , said lawmakers ’ financial - disclosure forms are vetted by legislative ethics committees before they are publicly released , but it ’s hard for anyone to know what ’s not there .
Mr. Bartlett reported overall assets of $ 1.8 million to $ 6.8 million , mostly tied up in his Buckeystown Pike home , which he reported to be worth $ 1 million to $ 5 million .
His Democratic challenger , Jennifer P. Dougherty , reported assets valued at $ 256,000 to $ 591,000 , mostly in the form of her namesake restaurant in Frederick , which she reported as valued at $ 250,001 to $ 500,000 .
The newspaper said its review of Miss Dougherty ’s personal financial - disclosure form and state property records revealed no discrepancies .

FCC Overruled in Janet Jackson Super Bowl Nudity ( Photo , Video )
caused a fire storm of controversy in 2004 while she andwere performing during the Super Bowl half time show .
The duo were rocking the crowd as Timberlake sang " Gonna have you naked by the end of this song " .
In a seemingly deliberate move , he tore away part of Jackson 's costume , revealing her breast .
Jackson , in what she believed to be a career limiting backlash , apologized for the situation , though she never admitted to planning the stunt .
The FCC promptly levied a $ 550,000 fine against CBS .
The network decided to fight the stiff and unprecedented sanction .
Four years later , the matter has finally hit the bench of a three - judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Federal Court of Appeals .
The group has ruled that :
" The Federal Communications Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the fine for the fleeting image of nudity .
Like any agency , the FCC may change its policies without judicial second guessing but it cannot change a well - established course of action without supplying notice of and a reasoned explanation for its policy departure . "
Interestingly , Jackson told Oprah Winfrey , more than two and a half years after the incident , that she regrets apologizing for the accident because it made her look guilty in the eyes of the 100 million people who witnessed the wardrobe malfunction .
In case you missed it or want to refresh your memory , check out the video below .

Christina Applegate 's Boyfriend Lee Grivas Found Dead
Actress 's on - again off - again boyfriendwas found dead in his Hollywood apartment on July 1st .
A neighbor discovered the body of the 26 - year - old in his living room .
Applegate , 36 , met Grivas , an Alaskan fisherman , skateboarder and aspiring photographer while in the middle of a divorce from actor Jonathan Schaech .
The two have dated off and on since then , reconciling the last time in April .
Grivas battled drug and alcohol problems and left Christina in a last ditch effort to get clean .
The two were not dating at the time of his death .
" I am profoundly saddened . "
" Lee was an incredible human being who was an extremely important and beautiful part of my life .
" He is missed beyond words , " she added .
" He touched so many and I feel much sadness for his mother , father , brother , and all of his family and friends . "
There were no visible signs of trauma and the death was reported as a possible accident or suicide .
A heroin overdose is suspected , however , no cause of death has been issued pending toxicology tests .
In a statement to Usmagazine.com , Christina said : Our thoughts and prayers go out to family and friends .
It is one of many ocean mysteries : where do basking sharks - the biggest fish in UK waters - go in the winter ?
A basking shark has been tracked with a satellite tag and was found to travel farther and deeper than known before , swimming more than 5,903 miles from British waters to the Canadian coast and diving more than half a mile down .
Research scientists are not sure why the 26ft - long female made the incredible trip , speculating she could have been looking for a mate , for a better food supply , or returning ' home ' after a summer in British waters .
Another option is that she was on a previously undiscovered migration route , prompting debate among some experts that basking sharks in Britain , North America , southern Africa and as far afield as New Zealand could be part of one big family .
' We 're asking the questions - these are just some ideas we 're thinking about why she chose to do what she did , ' said Mauvis Gore of Save Our Seas Foundation , one of the team who took part in the project .
Basking sharks are the second biggest fish in the world , growing up to 39ft long and reported in shoals of up to a few hundred at a time .
They are a common sight in British waters in summer and are thought to be one possible source for the myth of giant sea serpents , because when males follow a female up to nine snouts and fins rise out of the water in a line .
But until 10 years ago experts had no idea where they went in winter .
Recent tracking suggested many dive deeper into the ocean or move a little way off shore on to the continental shelf .
For this study two sharks were fitted with satellite tags last summer and tracked for 100 days .
One shark got no farther than the west coast of Scotland ; the other , shark A , stayed near Cornwall for a short time , then headed to Newfoundland , where it dropped its tag .
The journey was more than three times the longest recorded by the species , something researchers think was possible because she was big enough to survive with little food .
It is almost certainly not a one - off , though , said Jackie Hall from Manx Wildlife Trust and Manx Basking Shark Watch on the Isle of Man , and another member of the project team .
' We just did n't know about it before , ' said Hall .
The discovery has raised hopes , too , that protection for the world 's estimated 8,000 remaining basking sharks will be raised from national to international level .
' They are one of the great wonders of the British Isles , ' said Douglas Herdson , of the National Marine Aquarium in Plymouth .
' It 's great we 're finding out about them , and the more we know the more we can conserve them . '

The Pinwheel galaxy , otherwise known as Messier 101 , sports bright red edges in this new infrared image from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope .
Image credit : NASA / JPL - Caltech / STScI
( PhysOrg.com ) --
The Pinwheel galaxy is gussied up in infrared light in a new picture from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope .
The fluffy - looking galaxy , officially named Messier 101 , is dominated by a mishmash of spiral arms .
In Spitzer 's new view , in which infrared light is color coded , the galaxy sports a swirling blue center and a unique , coral - red outer ring .
A new paper appearing July 20 in the Astrophysical Journal explains why this outer ring stands out .
According to the authors , the red color highlights a zone where organic molecules called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , which are present throughout most of the galaxy , suddenly disappear .
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are dusty , carbon - containing molecules found in star nurseries , and on Earth in barbeque pits , exhaust pipes and anywhere combustion reactions take place .
Scientists believe this space dust has the potential to be converted into the stuff of life .
" If you were going look for life in Messier 101 , you would not want to look at its edges , " said Karl Gordon of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Md. " The organics can't survive in these regions , most likely because of high amounts of harsh radiation . "
The Pinwheel galaxy is located about 27 million light - years away in the constellation Ursa Major .
It has one of the highest known gradients of metals ( elements heavier than helium ) of all nearby galaxies in our universe .
In other words , its concentrations of metals are highest at its center , and decline rapidly with distance from the center .
This is because stars , which produce metals , are squeezed more tightly into the galaxy 's central quarters .
Gordon and his team used Spitzer to learn about the galaxy 's gradient of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons .
The astronomers found that , like the metals , the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons decrease in concentration toward the outer portion of the galaxy .
But , unlike the metals , these organic molecules quickly drop off and are no longer detected at the very outer rim .
" There 's a threshold at the rim of this galaxy , where the organic material is getting destroyed , " said Gordon .
The findings also provide a better understanding of the conditions under which the very first stars and galaxies arose .
In the early universe , there were not a lot of metals or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons around .
The outskirt of the Pinwheel galaxy therefore serves as a close - up example of what the environment might look like in a distant galaxy .
In this image , infrared light with a wavelength of 3.6 microns is colored blue ; 8 - micron light is green ; and 24 - micron light is red .
All three of Spitzer instruments were used in the study : the infrared array camera , the multiband imaging photometer and the infrared spectrograph .
Other authors of the paper include Charles Engelbracht , George Rieke , Karl A. Misselt , J.D. Smith and Robert Kennicutt , Jr. of the University of Arizona , Tucson .
Smith is also associated with the University of Toledo , Ohio , and Kennicutt is also associated with the University of Cambridge , England .

We have set out to be a voice for all renters across the U.S. that have been taken advantage of by landlords and real estate investors , in an effort to maximize profits and pad their own pockets , while leaving tenants / renters holding the bag when the dust settles .
During the recession a few years ago , professional home buyers in Texas & real estate investors across the U.S. pocketed thousands of dollars from their tenants , while not paying the underlying mortgage payment , thereby becoming delinquent on their mortgage .
Under normal circumstances , banks would simply foreclose on the underlying mortgage , and take back the assets , but instead the U.S. government decided to bail out mortgage companies across the U.S. , thereby bailing out the investors that were profiting hand over fist from their tenants .
Here at AngryRenter.com , our core aim is to shed light on the travesty that ’s occurred .

At the architectural library at the Delft University of Technology , there ’s a copy of a 736 - page book by MVRDV called “ Farmax : Excursions on Density , ” which is a hodgepodge of essays , transcripts , photos , computer designs , graphs and charts , all examining the growing suburban “ grayness ” of the Dutch landscape and proposing different solutions for saving the pastoral landscape by “ carrying density to extremes . ”
So many students have borrowed , read and plundered that copy of “ Farmax ” that it had to be pulled from circulation and has sat in a state of complete disintegration inside a kind of glass vitrine .
When I mentioned this to van Rijs , he laughed and said : “ Yeah , I ’ve seen that .
Our book is like a museum piece .
Is n’t that fun ? ”
While projects like VPRO and the Hanover pavilion were leading to design commissions in Copenhagen , Madrid , Paris , Tokyo and China ’s Sichuan province , MVRDV was also reaching outside the realm of established architectural practice by producing a series of theoretical exercises  books , films , exhibitions , even computer games  that amounted to an ongoing propaganda war on behalf of the firm ’s radical ideas about space .
After “ Farmax , ” MVRDV put out another doorstop manifesto , “ KM3 : Excursions on Capacities , ” which warned that if the global population “ behaved with U.S. - citizen - like consumption , ” another four earths would be required to sustain it .
In the exhibit 3D City , they pushed ever upward , advocating giant stacking cities that , as MVRDV breathlessly described them , exist “ not only in front , behind or next to you , but also above and below .
In short a city in which ground - level zero no longer exists but has dissolved into a multiple and simultaneous presence of levels where the town square is replaced by a void or a bundle of connections ; where the street is replaced by simultaneous distribution and divisions of routes and is expanded by elevators , ramps and escalators .
. . . ”
Perhaps MVRDV ’s most ambitious theoretical exercise was the traveling computer installation they called MetaCity / Datatown .
Predicting that globalism and an exploding planetary population will push certain regions throughout the world into continuous urban fields , or megacities , MVRDV conceived a hypothetical city called Datatown , designed solely from extrapolations of Dutch statistics .
( “ It is a city that wants to be explored only as information ; a city that knows no given topography , no prescribed ideology , no representation , no context .
Only huge , pure data . ” )
According to its creators , Datatown was a self - sufficient city with the population of the United States ( 250 million ) crammed into an area the size of Georgia ( 60,000 square miles ) , making it the densest place on earth .
MVRDV then subjected this urban Frankenstein to 21 scenarios to see how they would affect the built environment :
What if all the residents of Datatown wanted to live in detached houses ?
What if they preferred urban blocks ?
What could be done with the waste ?
( Build 561 ski resorts . )
What kind of city park would be needed ?
( A million Central Parks stacked up over 3,884 floors . )
“ The seas , the oceans ( rising as a result of global warming ) , the polar icecaps , all represent a reduction in the territory available for the megacity .
Does that mean that we must colonize the Sahel , the oceans or even the moon to fulfill our need for air and space , to survive ?
Or can we find an intelligent way to expand the capacities of what already exists ? ”
On one level , MetaCity / Datatown was a game and a provocation  architecture as a kind of thought experiment : can the urban landscape be reduced to a string of ones and zeroes ?
Is what we think of as outward reality nothing more than the physical manifestation of information ?
But MetaCity / Datatown was also a serious investigation : by translating the chaos of the contemporary city into pure information  or , as MVRDV called it , a datascape  and then showing the spatial consequences of that datascape through computer - generated designs , MVRDV set out to reveal how our collective choices and behaviors come to mold our constructed environments .
“ These datascapes show that architectural design in the traditional sense only plays a very limited role , ” Bart Lootsma , an architectural historian , writes in one of many essays inspired by the exhibit .
“ It is the society , in all its complexities and contradictions , that shapes the environment in the most detailed way , producing ‘ gravity fields ’ in the apparent chaos of developments , hidden logics that eventually ensure that whole areas acquire their own special characteristics  even at a subconscious level . ”
Lootsma cites a number of these invisible forces  market demands precipitating a “ slick ” of houses - with - gardens in the Netherlands , political constraints generating “ piles ” of dwellings on the outskirts of Hong Kong , the cultural preference for white brick causing a “ white cancer ” of housing estates in the Dutch province of Friesland .
These are “ the ‘ scapes ’ of the data behind it , ” he writes .

Lab Director Disobeyed Orders to Fly Flags at Half Staff to Honor Late Senator ...
' I cannot in good conscience honor such a man who fought so hard against civil and human rights throughout his life '
Jon Ponder Byon

Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
L.F. Eason III , the director of the state of North Carolina 's Standards Laboratory in Raleigh , was forced to resign this week because he refused to follow an order to lower the laboratory 's flags in honor of former North Carolina Sen .
Jesse Helms , who died late last week .
Eason , 51 , had worked for the state for 29 years , the entirety of his career .
In email explaining his position , Eason wrote ...
" I made a decision to refuse to lower our flags at the NC Standards Laboratory to half mast in honor of Jesse Helms as soon as I heard of his death .
I cannot in good conscience honor such a man who fought so hard against civil and human rights throughout his life .
Even to his death bed , he refused to apologize for the damage he caused .
Now , I stand by this decision .
It is a personal decision , but obviously affects my job at the lab .
It has been over ruled by Division and Departmental Management and as I look out my window , I 'm ashamed to see the flags lowered ... " I also understand that my decision is not acceptable .
You can not ignore that fact .
There is the law , but there is also a higher law I must follow as a matter of conscience . "
In another email to his staff , Eason said he opposed honoring Helms because of Helms ' " doctrine of negativity , hate and prejudice . "
He cited Helms ' lifelong opposition to extending civil rights to African - Americans and his " doctrine of negativity , hate , and prejudice [ that ] cost North Carolina and our nation much that we may never regain . "
The order to lower flags on all state facilities came from the office of Gov. Mike Easley , a Democrat , and flags were lowered at the state capitol , both houses of which are controlled by Democrats .
Eason is a Democrat , but he told a reporter that he often splits his vote ...
[ He ] had no problems lowering the flag for former [ Democratic governor and senator ] Terry Sanford or President Ronald Reagan .
But he remembers wondering whether he would be willing to lower the flag after President Richard Nixon 's funeral .
He never had to make that decision , since it rained both days .
Eason 's decision to follow his principles in not lowering the flags for Helms exacted a great personal and professional cost :
[ He ] pleaded several times to be allowed to stay at the lab .
[ He ] had worked for the agriculture department since graduating from college , was paid $ 65,235 a year as the state metrology lab manager .
" I designed and built that lab , " he said .
" Even though technically the bricks and mortar belong to the state of North Carolina , I feel very strongly that everything that comes out of there is my responsibility . "
This story underscores the deep and abiding antipathy felt by millions of North Carolinians toward Jesse Helms , whose courtly manners masked a seething hatred of blacks , gays and other minorities .
For the entirety of Helms ' three decades in politics , voters in the nation 's 10th largest state were equally divided about him , with 45 percent who loathed him and 45 percent who loved him .
In the 1980s and 1990s , Helms perfected the strategy of winning elections using the " 50 plus 1 " formula that Karl Rove and George Bush used to win the presidency in 2000 and 2001 .
To get to 50 - plus - 1 , rather than building a consensus among blocks of voters in order to win decisively , politicians use divisive tactics to inflame fear or hatred among the lesser - educated , conservative - leaning undecideds that are guaranteed to drive them to the polls .
North Carolina Republicans cynically ( and secretly ) referred to Helms ' tactics as either " emptying the pews " --- by creating a firestorm around so - called moral issues --- or " emptying the trailer parks " --- by creating a controversy around race .
The most famous instance of the latter was in Helms ' 1990 race against Harvey Gantt , the charismatic and politically centrist former mayor of Charlotte , the state 's largest city .
Just a few days before the election , Helms released his infamous " Hands " ad that depicted a white man losing a job , supposedly because it had been given to a unqualified black man .
( See video of the ad above . )
Jesse Helms retired from the Senate in 2003 , and spent his final years lost in dementia .
In the few short years since , he has all but been forgotten .
L.F. Eason was right on principle : Helms was an embarrassment who should not be glorified in death .
Being forgotten is better than he deserves .
Squeezed by soaring energy prices , governments around the nation are reacting just like consumers -- changing basic routines , and scrimping and saving in order to get by .
The El Paso County Sheriff ’s Department in southeastern Colorado has ended car patrols of its 2,000 - square - mile jurisdiction .
One Ohio sheriff is putting his deputies into golf carts .
Stillwater , Okla. , has stopped mowing the grass on nearly half of its parkland .
Cleveland is remapping its trash pickup routes to cut costs .
“ I know it ’s a step backwards , ” said El Paso County Sheriff Terry Maketa , whose deputies will now respond only to calls for help .
“ But when the dollars are n’t there , they are n’t there . ”
High energy costs have taken a toll on government budgets already strained by the housing collapse .
“ They have a much more direct role in affecting consumer confidence , which can affect sales tax revenue , which accounts for one - third of state revenues , ” said Arturo Perez , an analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures .

That has helped push nearly half the states into budget deficits this year ; 24 are cutting services to close the gaps , Perez said .
In California , lawmakers are struggling to close a $ 15.2 - billion deficit .
Municipal governments , which rely on state aid plus local tax money , are also feeling the pinch .
School buses are major gas guzzlers , and several districts are cutting back routes .
In suburban Seattle , the Northshore School District has cut eight bus routes , requiring some students to walk farther to get to their stops .
Children will no longer be able to use school buses to travel to gifted programs at far - off schools .
Parents are not happy .
“ It took some getting used to , because people like having their bus stop really close to their home , ” spokeswoman Susan Stoltzfus said .
“ But school buses generally get six miles to a gallon . ”

In St. Joseph County in Indiana , the library system is facing major cuts and has decided to park its Readmobile for most of the summer .
“ It ’s very frustrating .
. . .
We just ca n’t do the regular runs like we did in the past , ” spokesman David Hanna said .
Several cities , counties and states are either shifting to a four - day workweek or considering it .
Utah announced that starting in August , state offices will be open Monday through Thursday .
Officials expect to save at least $ 3 million in energy costs by going dark on Fridays .
In Lubbock County , Texas , commissioners are trying to figure out a way to shift to a four - day week but fear the change could deprive taxpayers of services .
“ We ’re trying to save all we can , ” Commissioner Mark Heinrich said .
“ If you do something , you ’re not going to please everyone . ”

Government officials have struggled this year over how to save money on energy without cutting essential services .
According to a recent survey by the National Conference of Mayors , a quarter of mayors have cut services to make up for increased fuel costs .
Some cities are taking innovative approaches .
In Oklahoma , Stillwater has designated “ natural areas ” of parkland where grass will be allowed to grow unimpeded .
Starting this month , workers are mowing less than half the acreage they were mowing last year .
“ There ’s been a lot of building here recently , ” spokeswoman Sherry Fletcher said .
“ We do n’t have as many natural areas as we should . ”
In Texas , fuel costs account for 10 % of the capital city ’s projected $ 20 - million deficit .
Austin is requiring all employees who drive public vehicles to attend seminars on proper maintenance schedules and other ways to reduce fuel costs .
It ’s also converting its fleet of public vehicles , buying for the Police Department 118 Crown Victorias that run on an ethanol - gasoline blend , said Matt Watson , policy director for the mayor ’s office .

Denver has turned up thermostats in city buildings 4 degrees and allowed its workers to shed jackets and ties to compensate .
“ What you ’re getting is a more casual , comfortable lifestyle that saves money and puts less CO2 in the atmosphere -- what ’s not to like ? ” Mayor John Hickenlooper said .
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has directed city departments to cut fuel usage and reduce their fleets by 10 % .
The city is finishing a new system that will track gas usage in each of its 9,000 cars , said Tony DeClue , assistant general manager of the General Services Department .
“ We do n’t expect to have any reductions in services due to the fuel crisis , ” he said .
Cleveland was already in the midst of a major efficiency campaign when officials found that they were going to be several million dollars over budget .
They ’ve cut 1,000 cars from the city fleet and used computer analysis to rearrange trash pickup routes .

“ What ’s smacked us in the face is the same thing that ’s hit everyone -- gas prices , ” said Chief Operating Officer Darnell Brown , who has asked department heads to shave 10 % from their fuel costs .
Public safety -- police , fire and ambulance services -- account for nearly half the city ’s expenses , Brown said , and that area is tough to cut .
The burden of fuel costs has fallen disproportionately on law enforcement agencies .
“ If fuel prices keep going up , it ’s going to have a devastating impact on our ability to function , ” said Hubert Williams , president of the Police Foundation in Washington .
Governments are in a bind : “ You ca n’t increase taxes and you ca n’t raise revenues , but you ca n’t cut back on policing , ” he said .

Departments across the country have tried to come up with ways to cut fuel use .
In Fairfield County , Ohio , the Sheriff ’s Department has bought two golf carts to replace cruisers patrolling small towns .
Some are shifting to two - officer patrol cars .
In Newberry , S.C. , Police Chief Jackie Swindler has ordered his officers to spend more time on foot patrol .
Increased foot patrols , he said , provide better community policing and are preferable to the department ’s response during the oil shock of the 1970s :
He recalls wrestling with a propane - powered squad car that was so small he could n’t fit anyone into the rear seat .
In sprawling El Paso County , which includes Colorado Springs , Sheriff Maketa does n’t have the option of having his deputies walk their beats .
His agency ’s fuel costs were $ 160,000 in 2003 .
This year they ’re $ 700,000 , and he ’s expecting them to jump more next year .
Maketa initially switched to two deputies per car .
Then he forbade idling vehicles .
Neither led to big enough savings .
This month , he decided to end all patrols to save money , though he predicts his deputies will catch fewer drunken drivers and fewer suspects with outstanding warrants .
The department will reassess the end of patrols if it finds there is a serious effect on public safety .

“ This decision goes against everything I believe in , ” Maketa said .
“ I believe in preventing crime .
I believe in being proactive . ”
He said he did n’t know of another agency that had taken such a dramatic step .
But based on his discussions with other law officers , he expects company .
“ If fuel continues on the pattern we ’ve seen the last two years , ” he said , “ you ’ll see a lot of people making a similar decision . ”

St. Louis is furious that the Belgian brewer InBev might buy their beloved American Icon , Anheuser - Busch ( BUD ) .
Although residents of St. Louis stand to make billions on their shares , not all the negatives of the InBev buyout would be psychological .
The St. Louis commercial real estate market is slumping , and the city fears losing BUD will exacerbate the problem .
St. Louis ' current woes include ( WSJ ) :
Chrysler said it would idle its St. Louis South minivan plant indefinitely in October , a blow to warehouse owners that partly count on the auto maker 's suppliers as tenants .
The high - profile Ballpark Village multi-use project that was to rise next door to the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team 's two - year - old Busch Stadium remains stalled .
The city suffered a setback in March when Centene Corp. , a health - care company , opted out of plans to move its headquarters from the city 's Clayton suburb into the proposed $ 650 million project .
While InBev has promised not to close US breweries or slash too many jobs , promises leave wiggle room .
But at least one analyst is confident that the St. Louis real estate can absorb the losses , albeit gradually :
" It would n't be a huge sucking sound , " says Jeff Algatt , regional manager in St. Louis for Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment Services .
But that does n't mean it would n't suck .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
The Shanghai Composite 's latest retreat on Wednesday pushed Chinese equities to rock bottom in the global rankings , replacing Vietnam as the worst - performing stock market .
The Shanghai Composite index closed down 2.7 % at 2,705 on Wednesday .
It has now fallen 48.6 % year to date , the biggest decliner among stock markets globally .
See Asia Markets .
In Vietnam , the benchmark VN index gained 1.4 % on Wednesday , putting its year - to - date retreat at 47.5 % .
" We 're at a rocky period , " said Robert Lutts , president and chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management , referring to Chinese equities .
" The valuation and the technical condition of the market are trying to set a bottom , " he said .
After the Shanghai 's market 's strong performance in recent years , " the corrective phase is not unexpected , " Lutts said .
From best to worst
What a difference a few months makes .
The Shanghai Composite index has tumbled this year after being the best performer among major global stock indexes in 2007 , when it recorded an astronomical gain of 97 % for the year .
The Shanghai index has now fallen nearly 55 % from its peak over 6,000 , reached in October 2007 .
By comparison , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % and the S&P 500 index SPX , - 0.48 % have both lost about 21 % from their October highs .
Chinese shares " had risen at such a rate that it was not really based on economic fundamentals or the value of the equities , " said Rachel Ziemba , an analyst at RGE Monitor .
" Chinese investors , many of whom rushed into the equity markets last year , are increasingly wary of putting their assets in equities , " Ziemba said .
She emphasized that the government 's role in the equity market is key .
A majority of shares are still held by government institutions .
" We still see a market that , because of government involvement , is a speculative market , " Ziemba said .
" It 's very difficult to get information on these equities , so it 's hard for value - based investors .
Growth remains robust , but [ the economy ] is growing at a slower pace .
Inflation remains elevated . "
Lutts of Cabot Money Management is optimistic about the long - term outlook for Chinese companies .
" You could establish a rally this fall that would be meaningful , " Lutts said .
" The companies I 'm reviewing are continuing to come out with very good performance . "
He invests in Chinese equities listed in Hong Kong and the United States .
Hong Kong 's benchmark Hang Seng index ( 1804580 ) is down 23.7 % for the year to date -- much better in terms of performance as opposed to the Shanghai Composite index .
Chinese authorities restrict foreign participation in the mainland 's equity markets , with only those foreign institutional investors selected by Beijing allowed to participate .
As a result , many foreign investors buy shares of Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and on other foreign exchanges as so - called H shares .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrats in the Senate on Wednesday unveiled a new energy package that would revoke $ 17 billion in tax breaks extended to big oil companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and slap a 25 percent windfall profits tax on firms that do n’t invest in new energy sources .

The Consumer - First Energy Act -- assembled by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other key Democrats -- would also stop the Energy Department from filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve until crude oil prices average $ 75 a barrel or less for 90 days .
The Democrats ’ energy bill seeks to lay the blame for record - high gasoline prices over $ 3.60 a gallon on the Bush administration , big oil companies like Exxon and the OPEC oil cartel .
The oil industry slammed the measure .
“ New taxes targeting the U.S. oil and natural gas industry would discourage investment in domestic fuel production , ” the American Petroleum Institute trade group said in a statement .
In a bill summary , Democrats point out that gasoline prices have more than doubled since President George W. Bush took office in 2001 , while “ Big Oil ” companies made over $ 500 billion in profits over the same period .
“ The Bush administration has led us down the path of the most significant energy crisis we have had in decades , if not in all time , ” Reid told reporters .
“ Big Oil is making money hand over fist while doing little to invest in alternative fuels yet Bush Republicans want to keep handing them huge tax breaks . ”
Republicans in the Senate in turn unveiled their own plan , which calls for new U.S. oil production in offshore areas as well as Alaska ’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
The bill seeks to revive a plan already passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives that would allow the federal government to sue OPEC -- source of one - third of global oil supply -- for price manipulation .
It also seeks to rein in speculation in oil markets , which Senate Democrats see as a prime mover behind crude oil prices which hit a record high of $ 123.80 a barrel on Wednesday .
The bill would prevent companies that trade U.S. oil futures from routing transactions through off - shore markets to evade position limits and requires the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to boost margin requirements for all oil futures transactions .
However , CFTC Chairman Walter Lukken told a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday that speculators were not behind the jump in oil prices and he warned that higher margins would push energy trading off government - regulated exchanges .
“ I think there would be a migration off exchanges , ” said Lukken , adding that higher margins act like “ a tax on traders . ”
The bill would have to pass the Senate and be approved by the House and White House before becoming law .
LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Oil services companies will increasingly branch into activities currently the domain of their traditional customers , the international oil majors , a senior industry executive said on Tuesday .
Ayman Asfari , Chief Executive of and the largest shareholder in the UK's third - largest listed oil services company by market value , Petrofac PFC.L , said rather than just building and operating oil production facilities for a fee , oil services companies will in future seek a chunk of project profits .
“ Most service companies are trying to migrate their businesses , ” Asfari told Reuters in an interview .
The development could be a threat to opportunity - starved oil majors such as Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Exxon Mobil XOM.N .
Historically , the oil companies negotiated concessions with resource holders and then hired the oil services companies to do much of the heavy lifting such as drilling , facilities construction and operating equipment .
But Asfari said companies like his and larger U.S. rival Schlumberger SLB.
N can now often perform the project management function the oil majors previously did .
In return , they may seek a stake in the project , either from the oil major or from the National oil company ( NOC ) which owns the reserves or a return tied to successful project delivery .
“ What they are doing is replacing , in most of these cases , the role that the international oil company would have played , ” he said .
The world ’s richest reserves are held by NOCs from countries like Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Venezuela and Mexico which are reluctant to cede reserves to foreign oil companies .
Oil services companies may offer an attractive alternative because they do n’t seek to book reserves or capture upside from higher oil prices .
Asfari cited his contract to manage Dubai oil and gas fields previously operated by ConocoPhillips COP.N , which was gained after Dubai refused U.S. oil majors demands for better terms , as an example of a service firm offering a more competitive solution .
However , Asfari said there was a limit to the extent to which companies like Petrofac could replace the big oil firms .
Oil services are likely to leave exploration , more complex projects such as liquefied natural gas and developments in tough locations such as the Arctic , to the oil majors .
“ They have areas of expertise that no one else has , ” Asfari said .
" She said the best thing for a woman is for her to drink whisky before she does anything , every day , " he said .
" I do n't feel my age .
I 've still the mind of a young man .
But if I had the company of a good woman , I 'm sure I 'd feel 40 years younger in a flash . "
Children as young as three should be reported for ' racism ' , Government - funded group claims
Nursery teachers should inform on youngsters such as these if there is a ' racist incident ' , says a Government - funded advisory group
Toddlers should be taught about racism and singled out for criticism if they have racist attitudes , a Government - funded advisory group said yesterday .
It told nursery teachers , playgroup leaders and childminders to record and report every racist incident involving children as young as three .
These could include saying ' Yuk ' about unfamiliar food .
Even babies should not be ignored in the hunt for racism because they can ' recognise different people in their lives ' , a new guide for nurseries and child care centres said .
The instructions for staff in charge of pre-school children in day care have been produced by the National Children 's Bureau , which receives £ 12 million a year , mostly through taxpayer - funded organisations .
The NCB , which describes itself as ' an umbrella body for the children 's sector ' , has long used its resources to campaign on controversial issues , for example in favour of a legal ban on smacking by parents .
It also runs the Sex Education Forum , a campaign for more sex education in schools .
The new 366 - page guide , Young Children and Racial Justice , warned that ' racist incidents among children in early years settings - tend to be around name - calling - casual thoughtless comments , and peer group relationships ' .
It said such incidents could include children using words like ' blackie ' , ' Pakis ' , ' those people ' or ' they smell ' .
Children might also ' react negatively to a culinary tradition other than their own by saying " yuk " . '
Nursery staff are told : ' No racist incident should be ignored .
When there is a clear racist intent , it is necessary to be specific in condemning the action . '
If children ' reveal negative attitudes the lack of censure may indicate to the child that there is nothing unacceptable about such attitudes ' .
Nurseries are encouraged to report as many racist incidents as possible to local councils .
' Some people think that if a large number of racist incidents are reported , this will reflect badly on the institution , ' it said .
' In fact , the opposite is the case . '
The guidance said that anyone who disagrees is racist themselves .
It also suggests cultivating the home languages of new immigrants - despite Government anxiety to promote the learning of English .
It said : ' English is now viewed as the major language of the world but this is not because it has any innate linguistic advantages - it is because English is the language of power in a world dominated by English - speaking peoples . '
Critics of the race programme for pre- school children labelled it ' totalitarian ' .
Author and researcher on family life Patricia Morgan said : ' Stepping in to stop severe bullying is one thing , but this is interference in the lives of children .
It smacks of totalitarianism .
' It is regulation of private speech and thought .
They intend nursery staff to step into children 's playground squabbles and then report them to the local council as race incidents .
Who would ever have thought that the anti-racism crusade would go so far ? '
Case Study
Judge Jonathan Finestein ordered the local authority to review its decision to prosecute
A boy of ten has already been taken to court for calling a mixed race 11 - year - old ' Paki ' and ' Bin Laden ' in a school playground argument .
The pair subsequently made up and became friends again , yet the Crown Prosecution Service decided to go ahead because the victim 's mother made a complaint .
The ten- year - old eventually appeared at Salford Youth Court in 2006 where he denied a raciallymotivated offence under the Public Order Act of using threatening , abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause another person harm or distress .
But District Judge Jonathan Finestein ( pictured ) ordered the authorities to review their decision to prosecute .
He said of the defendant : ' I should n't think he understands Bin Laden or Al Qaeda .
I 'm not condoning what he supposedly said but there must be other ways of dealing with this apart from criminal prosecution . '
Prosecutors later decided not to pursue the case .
" The time from here to Singularity depends sensitively on the particulars of what we humans do during the next decade ( and even the next few years ) . "
Introduction
The tech world has kept an interested eye on VIA 's Nano since before the turn of the year , but the level of interest in the new processor has grown significantly in recent months , thanks in part to Intel 's focus on the ultra - low - power / low - cost market .
Over the past six months , VIA has found itself pushed from the perpetual twilight of an also - also - ran into a position of genuine competitive interest .
The company is finally ready to sample Nano for performance testing , and I 've had the opportunity to put the chip through its paces .
Atom vs. Nano : not a perfect match
In order to test VIA 's new chip , I 've benchmarked it against Intel 's Atom .
There 's a lot of curiosity out there about how the two low - power processors stack up against each other , and this article attempts to satisfy that curiosity , but it 's important to note that this is not an apples - to - apples comparison .
According to Intel executive VP Sean Maloney , Atom is " built for low power and designed specifically for a new wave of Mobile Internet Devices and simple , low - cost PC's . "
As for Nano , VIA 's whitepaper ( PDF ) states : " It [ Nano ] will initially power a range of ‘ slim ‘ n ’ light ’ notebooks . " and " will also appear in ultra mobile mini - note devices and small form factor , green desktop systems for home and office use . "
In this case , we 're benchmarking a Nano reference system at the upper end of VIA 's product range .
The L2100 CPU at the heart of the system is a single - core 1.8GHz processor , with a TDP of 25 W .
Chip Design
Type Process Frequency
MHz SMT
FSB
MHz L2
cache TDP
( W) Intel Atom 230 In Order
45 nm 1600 Yes 533
512K 4
VIA Nano L2100 Out - of - order 65nm
1800 No 800 1024 K 25
While there is a certain degree of overlap between the two processors , it 's limited to the relative upper end of Atom 's target market and the relative lower end of Nano's .
This might not seem so evident at the moment , given the limited number of Atom configurations Intel is currently selling on the DIY market ( one ) , but the two products are focused in two different directions .
There are other factors that cloud the comparison , including an early reference platform from VIA and a horribly mismatched processor + chipset combination from Intel , but I 've done what I can to tease those differences out and present the two products from a variety of angles .
Performance summary
There are a number of different facets to consider when evaluating Atom vs. Nano , and that 's a good thing for Intel .
Were this simply a question of which CPU was faster , Nano would win , and by no small margin .
Our benchmark results demonstrate that VIA 's wunderkind is more than capable of competing in its target market ; Nano beat the tar out of Atom in the majority of the tests we ran .
The chip might have extended its lead further on a different platform ; several tests indicated that the integrated S3 GPU was limiting total performance .
Results are directly accessible from the links below .
Anyone interested in the questionable effects of benchmark " optimization " should find the PCMark 2005 results of particular interest , while the DVD / HD content playback tests are one spot where the Atom + 945 GC chipset pull well ahead of Nano 's integrated GPU .
The entire point of these platforms , however , is that they do n't focus on raw performance to the exclusion of all else .
Power
efficiency is at least as important as raw speed these days , but how VIA and Intel rank in this area depends entirely on how we choose to
measure performance - per-watt ( ppw ) .
If we only consider processor TDP , Atom wins by a landslide .
It may lose most benchmarks in
absolute terms , but it always remains competitive enough to easily win any power efficiency comparison .
So , VIA wins absolute performance
but Intel wins power efficiency , right ?
Wrong .
Superman has Kryptonite , Rogue can't touch people , and Atom , for all its super - low TDP , has been effectively hamstrung by the 945GC chipset .
With a TDP of 22W , Intel 's chipset draws nearly six times more power than the processor itself , a fact that 's driven home when you realize that the tall heatsink + fan combination on the retail D945GCLF board is actually cooling the northbridge , rather than the CPU .
The power - hungry nature of its platform destroys any current chance Atom had of establishing itself as a truly low - power alternative .
Total system power draw is still quite low by desktop standards , but the D945GCLF 's maximum load power of 59W is only about nine percent lower than VIA 's reference motherboard .
That narrow discrepancy is n't enough to offset VIA 's sizeable performance advantage in many benchmarks , and the Nano ends with a higher overall , platform - level performance - per - watt ratio than Atom in many of our benchmark tests .
The bottom line
Nano is an excellent step forward for VIA .
It 's by far the most compelling CPU the company has ever launched , and could potentially carve a spot for itself in its target market segments .
VIA 's mini-ITX reference platform is similarly impressive ; the board 's PCIe x16 slot opens the door for a variety of potential applications that the Atom reference platform can only dream about .
Intel 's D945GCLF may run just $ 75 for a 1.6GHz HyperThreaded
Atom processor , but it 's painfully obvious that the board was designed with an eye towards guarding Celeron sales , and the lack of expansion capabilities hurts Atom 's overall attractiveness .
VIA 's CN896 chipset may be a better overall fit for Nano , but the integrated Chrome9 HC graphics solution leaves much to be desired .
While it proves marginally faster than Intel 's GMA950 in some tests , it slumps badly when asked to decode much of anything .
The built - in PCIe x16 slot significantly addresses this issue , but the availability of an expansion slot , in and of itself , does not compensate for lousy integrated video — even on a netbook - class solution .
There are too many long - term questions across too many areas to deem this a complete slam - dunk for VIA .
Reviewer samples and reference platforms are great for publicity , but VIA has yet to demonstrate that it can ship Nano boards and chipsets in volume .
The company has promised that mini-ITX Nano boards will be available in the retail channel by the end of the third quarter , so we should know in a few months if the company can make good on its promise of availability .
The fact that Nano is a drop - in replacement for C7 could make the chip attractive to manufacturers with C7 - based devices , but again , neither VIA nor its partners have announced plans in this area .
A few words from HP confirming Nano as a basis for an upcoming refresh of the 2133 would do wonders for both Nano sales and VIA 's reputation .
The largest potential barrier to Nano 's long - term success , of course , is Intel .
Santa Clara has made no secret of the fact that it believes MIDs , netbooks , and nettops are the future of the industry , and that it intends to offer an Atom that could fit inside any of these devices .
Right now that might sound laughable , but Intel is n't kidding .
The company 's current retail Atom 230 - based board might not be what you 'd call compelling , but that does n't mean that future products wo n't be .
VIA 's long - term success will be directly proportional to the number of design wins the company can gather for itself in an area
Intel has announced it intends to dominate long term .
Rogers : Clark " demeans " McCain 's military record
One real third rail this campaign — more even than race , sex , or age — has been the substance of McCain 's military service .
But on " Face the Nation " today , retired Gen. Wesley Clark challenged it as a qualification :
“ He has been a voice on the Senate Armed Services Committee .
And he has traveled all over the world .
But he has n't held executive responsibility .
That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded — that was n't a wartime squadron , ” Clark said .
“ I do n’t think getting in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to become president . ”
McCain spokesman Brian Rogers just fired back , on message , at Clark , a former Clinton backer who 's now with Obama :
If Barack Obama 's campaign wants to question John McCain 's military service , that 's their right .
But let 's please drop the pretense that Barack Obama stands for a new type of politics .
The reality is he 's proving to be a typical politician who is willing to say anything to get elected , including allowing his campaign surrogates to demean and attack John McCain 's military service record .
John McCain is proud of his record of always putting the country first — from his time in the Navy , in Vietnam and through to today .
Rogers went on to attack Obama for not having visited Iraq , and to renew McCain 's demand of town hall meetings .
The teaser trailer for the upcoming Oliver Stone - directed George W Bush biopic , entitled “ W , ” starring Josh Brolin , James Cromwell , Ellen Burstyn , Elizabeth Banks , Richard Dreyfuss , and Thandie Newton , is now available online .
Whether you love him or hate him , there is no question that George W. Bush is one of the most controversial public figures in recent memory .
In an unprecedented undertaking , acclaimed director Oliver Stone is bringing the life of our 43rd President to the big screen as only he can .
“ W ” takes viewers through Bush ’s eventful life — his struggles and triumphs , how he found both his wife and his faith , and of course the critical days leading up to Bush ’s decision to invade Iraq .
“ W ” is due out October 17th .

As the hours tick by the likelihood of widespread disruption looks increasingly likely
It therefore looks like Ineos will have to proceed with closing the plant which they say will take 4 weeks to restart .
We 'll be back with a fresh thread in a couple of hours .
BBC Scotland understands operators Ineos and the Unite union have failed to agree a halt to an impending strike by workers at the Grangemouth plant .
Posted by Prof. Goose on April 23 , 2008 - 1:45 am in The Oil Drum : Europe
[ update 3 by Euan , 23 April ]
Wednesday lunchtime and Ineos are still meeting with trade unions seeking a settlement .
Fuel runs out at some gas stations - according to the BBC news .
Some background on The European Gas Market .
[ update 2 by Euan , 22 April ]
According to this report by CNN , BP has confirmed that the Forties pipeline system may have to close if the Grangemouth strike goes ahead .
700,000 bpd UK North Sea production may be lost .
In addition to lost oil production , many gas fields may also have to be shut down as liquids produced with the gas will have no export route .
More news on natural gas production if it is confirmed that the strike will go ahead .
Ineos is reported to be the world 's third largest petrochemicals company .
Privately owned by UK businessman Jim Ratcliffe .
[ update by Euan , 22 April ]
According to Reuters :
Management and trades union officials at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland are to meet on Tuesday at the ACAS conciliation service for talks to avoid a strike planned at the weekend , a union official said .
" There 's a party going to ACAS this morning for a meeting at 2 pm , " Gordon Russell , a union convenor at the refinery for the trade union UNITE .
Russell said management had made no new proposals at talks with the union on Monday evening to avert the strike called over the 200,000 barrel a day refinery 's pension scheme and the two - day strike was still set to go ahead on Sunday .
" Everything stays as it is pending the discussions , " he said .
The planned strike at Grangemouth was one of the factors driving oil prices to a record high on Monday .
Refinery owner Ineos has started closing one of the refinery 's three crude processing units as part of a safety shutdown ahead of the strike .
A shutdown at Grangemouth would reduce flows of North Sea crude into Britain and hit British gas supplies , if the Forties pipeline , which feeds the refinery , is forced to close .
Roads are visibly quieter around Aberdeen today .
[ original by PG , 21 April ]
First the BBC reports :
Motorists have been urged not to panic buy fuel amid warnings that the shutdown of Scotland 's only crude oil refinery could lead to shortages .
Ineos claims it could have to close its refinery at Grangemouth for a month on safety grounds ahead of a strike by 1,200 members of the Unite union .
Industry analysts told the BBC that there is no need for drivers to stock up with petrol at the pumps .
Here 's a map of the BP refinery and pipeline system in the area :

Under Clinton 's rules , Obama still wins
Barack Obama can fully accept Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s terms on Michigan and Florida and still win a majority of pledged Democratic delegates on June 1 , allowing him to lay claim to the nomination under the New York senator ’s own rules .
A Politico analysis of the delegate numbers after Tuesday ’s primaries in North Carolina and Indiana shows Obama can concede to Clinton ’s position on Michigan and Florida and still claim victory — potentially forestalling the Democratic nightmare scenario of a floor fight at the Denver convention .
Advertisement
The Clinton campaign rejected the premise of Politico ’s analysis , dismissing it as “ artificial metrics ” that “ might make for interesting cocktail party conversation ” but would give Obama no legitimate claim on the nomination .
But the numbers could add to Obama ’s growing strategic advantage .
Some background :
The magic number of pledged delegates — excluding Florida and Michigan , which were stripped of their delegates for holding early , unsanctioned primaries — is 1,627 to have a definitive majority .
Obama will reach that threshold on May 20 , after the Kentucky and Oregon primaries , and plans to declare victory .
The Democratic National Committee sets the clinching number at 2,025 pledged delegates and superdelegates , excluding Florida and Michigan .
The rationale of the Obama camp is that hitting 1,627 means the candidate is a lock for the higher DNC number also , because superdelegates are unlikely to overturn voting results .
Many neutral Democratic strategists agree .
“ It ’s not going to happen , ” said Carter Eskew , the chief strategist for Al Gore ’s 2000 campaign .
“ I do n’t think anybody in Democratic circles , not aligned with either campaign , believes any different . ”
Clinton ’s campaign , however , has argued that Obama needs to clear yet another figure — 2,209 pledged delegates and superdelegates , a figure that includes the two rogue states .
Clinton aides have said Obama wo n’t meet that target on May 20 .
But using Clinton ’s own numbers , there now seems a clear path for Obama to claim victory .
Clinton ’s push for the full inclusion of Florida and Michigan brings the total pledged delegates to 3,566 .
That would mean the magic number for a majority would rise to 1,784 .
A conservative assessment of Obama ’s chances shows he would reach 1,785 pledged delegates on June 1 , when polls close in the Puerto Rican primary .
This showing by Obama is possible even under extremely generous expectations for Clinton in the weeks ahead .
Should she win about 70 percent of the delegates in West Virginia next week , a showing she has only accomplished in her husband ’s native state of Arkansas , she would walk away with 19 additional delegates to Obama ’s nine delegates .
A week later , should Clinton win 62 percent of the delegates in Kentucky , larger than her win in her home state of New York , she would walk away with 32 additional delegates while Obama would walk away with 19 .
If Clinton managed a split in Oregon — a state Obama is heavily favored to win — he would still need only 35 percent of the delegates in Puerto Rico to clinch a lead in earned delegates .
The Clinton campaign insisted that even if Obama reaches 1,785 , he ’s not the nominee .
“ Declaring mission accomplished does n’t make it so .
The Democratic Party ’s rules do not differentiate between the different types of delegates .
Using artificial metrics . . . wo n’t change the fact that it takes 2,209 delegates to win the nomination , " said deputy communications director Phil Singer .
An unassailable lead in pledged delegates , however , also would give Obama wide flexibility in negotiations over how to handle Michigan and Florida .
Obama ’s campaign currently refuses to tie delegate allocation in Florida and Michigan to voting results in the two states because both candidates pledged not to campaign in either state .
Obama was also not on the ballot in Michigan .
Clinton ’s argues that to not recognize either contest would be equivalent to disenfranchising voters .
Clinton ’s aides also point out that Obama chose to remove himself from the Michigan ballot .
Howard Wolfson , one of Clinton ’s two strategists , said Friday during a breakfast with reporters that the campaign would be willing to offer Obama all of the “ uncommitted ” votes from Michigan providing both states were seated in with delegate totals reflecting their votes .
Obama ’s supporters had to vote “ uncommitted ” when they went to the polls in the Jan. 15 Michigan contest .
Both the Michigan and Florida Democratic parties have expressed a preference for Clinton ’s stance — though the position has been opposed by Obama .
The DNC and state parties have broadly indicated that they would accept any deal the two campaigns agreed on .
“ If there was a proposal that both campaigns and the leadership of both states agreed upon , it 's likely the [ DNC ’s Rules and Bylaws Committee ] would accept that , ” said a Democratic Party veteran who has not sided with either campaign .
Obama ’s campaign has not agreed to Clinton ’s terms , in part for fear it would shift the paradigm of the race and offer Clinton a way to narrow the gap in pledged delegates .
But the Politico analysis shows that if Obama gets all the “ uncommitted ” votes in Michigan , as Clinton ’s team proposes , and Obama 's rogue state delegates are bona fide supporters , he will still win a majority of pledged delegates .
This also means that any decision on the status of Florida and Michigan by the eagerly anticipated RBC session May 31 could largely be moot , in terms of shaping who wins the nomination .

Advertisement India is fast becoming the centre of a revolution in motoring .
A new generation of ultra-cheap cars is about to hit the streets , allowing millions of would - be drivers to dream of personal mobility for themselves and their families .
" A totally new market is opening up - the way we are receiving comments and inquiries is quite mind - boggling , " said Ravi Kant , the managing director of Tata Motors .
International car manufacturers are also scrambling to establish a firm foothold in India , which is set to become the fastest growing car market in the world .
The Tata Nano was unveiled with great patriotic fanfare in January .
Its basic price - about $ 2,500 - is about half of its nearest current rival .
The BBC travelled to the huge Tata Motors complex in the western city of Pune to get an exclusive look at the Nano in action , and to talk to the team which created the ultimate no -frills car , cutting costs part by part .
Everything from the number of wheel nuts to the number of parts in the door handle was re-examined .
" The body was redesigned three or four times , and the engine three times , " said Girish Arun Wagh , the head of Tata 's small car project .
" Simplicity was the key . "
And that means that when the Nano goes on sale towards the end of this year it will be in a position to overturn the economics of motoring .
" We believe that more than goods transportation it is people transportation that is going to see a massive change , and we are prepared to tap into this opportunity , " said Ravi Kant .
But Tata wo n't have it all its own way .
Rival car Another Indian company Bajaj Auto , which makes auto - rickshaws and motorbikes , has announced plans - in partnership with Renault and Nissan - to produce a direct competitor to the Nano by 2011 .
The starting price will be the same .

" Whoever wants to do it at least has to manufacture it in India , " said Rahul Bajaj , the company 's chairman .
" If Tata motors can make money I can make money .
My costs are lower than Tata Motors .
But if General Motors or Volkswagen tries , I do n't think they can make money . "
But even if they wo n't compete at the very cheapest end of the market , that has n't stopped a host of global car companies investing in new factories on the outskirts of cities like Pune and Madras ( Chennai ) .
Soon the region around Pune alone will make more cars than Britain .
Many of them will be sold to India 's eager domestic market .
And there 's plenty of room for expansion out in the countryside , where 70 % of Indians still live .
But India 's cities are already suffering from congestion and pollution , and millions of new cars will only make matters worse .
" You want to give mobility to all , " said Anumita Roychowdhury of the Centre for Science and Environment .
" And cars can never give mobility to all in Indian cities . "
" You just do not have the space in Indian cities where you can motorise and meet the needs of everyone .
There 's a big equity issue here . "
The response from the motor industry is robust .
" I 'm all for a clean environment , " declared Rahul Bajaj .
" But if you want a real clean environment , go back to the cave age . "
The rapid increase in demand for cars is closely linked to soaring economic growth , and Indians are understandably sensitive to suggestions that they should n't be able to enjoy freedoms people in the West take for granted .
But that still leaves India grappling with a familiar challenge on a massive scale :
How to meet the demand for private cars and personal mobility in a way that works .
For a billion people , and counting .

Civic Outsells F - 150 for First Time Ever
Coupled with GM ’s news that the company will be closing plants and scaling back SUV production , the word that the F150 is finally not the country ’s best - selling vehicle seems to put the final nail in the coffin of American gas guzzling .
Sure , there are still tons of F150s selling ( a lot of them to people who do n’t really need them ) , but this change represents one of the biggest swings in the US auto market recently .
The numbers tell the whole story .
Here are May ’s top five selling vehicles :
Honda Civic – 53,299 Toyota Corolla – 52,826 Toyota Camry – 51,291 Honda Accord – 43,728 Ford F - 150 – 42,973
Overall , most of the automakers were way down in sales , except for Nissan and Honda , with Honda posting an increase of 11 % .
Strong sales of traditional economy cars show that people are not just trying to save money on gas , but are buying less expensive , less powerful cars in order to cope with an economic slowdown .
So what does all this really mean ?
It ’s hard to say .
On the one hand , the Prius is the most searched for new car on cars.com , but hybrid sales are also slumping .
It seems that buyers know about the fuel economy possibilities with hybrids like the Prius , but are getting scared off by the price premium and moving towards either no car or a small car like the Civic or Corolla .
The real question now is , will it stick ?

1919
In the patriotic fervour of the First World War , more than 2,000 people were prosecuted for disagreeing with the government 's war policies
Every day , every day , the rah - rah boys – preachers , teachers , newspapermen – were saying , " Whatever you do , do n't rock the boat " .
The boat was on the way to war .
The war hysteria mounted .
The right to conduct meetings was cancelled .
When people tried to hold meetings against the war , we were called traitors .
People who opposed the war were fired .
They lost their jobs widely and freely .
I wrote a simple little 32 - page pamphlet called The Great Madness , which was published before the end of the war .
I analysed the causes of the war – the political causes , the economic causes , and so on – showing that it was not a war of patriotism or a war for democracy , but a businessman 's war .
The Espionage Act , which was enacted ostensibly to cope with the German spy system , was used against people such as me who opposed the war .
An indictment against me was handed down in New York after the end of the war , and I was charged with writing a pamphlet that would interfere with recruitment and enlistment in the armed forces of the United States .
It carried up to a 20 - year sentence .
We felt the trial was our chance to publicise our views and we used the pamphlet in presenting our case .
We spent eight days going through it , paragraph by paragraph , and I gave a detailed explanation each time .
The newspapers and magazines were full of it .
We said we did n't care if we were found guilty or not : we were interested in furthering the cause of peace and socialism .
In the end , the jury acquitted me for writing the pamphlet and convicted the Rand School for publishing it .

Louise Thompson Patterson
1934
In Birmingham , Alabama in the 1930s , demonstrations for relief from the Depression were attacked .
Police beat up speakers and raided the homes of suspected leaders
I came to the International Workers Order ( IWO ) in New York as an office worker in 1933 : a fraternal group for immigrant workers , it gave them a base in this country , and provided them with low - cost insurance .
I expressed an interest in organising for them , so I went down to Alabama , Georgia and New Orleans , and got groups together through churches and local trade unions .
This I did in 1933 and 1934 .
I was in Birmingham when the coal strike was on .
I had gone to a meeting in a middle - class , white neighbourhood , but when I opened the door , the police were in the middle of a raid .
I was so stunned .
The woman who lived there tried to protect me , and said : " I have no sewing for you today . "
But this one cop said , " Oh , no .
That wo n't go .
I know you 're one of them . "
They took me off to an ancient city jail .
This one , like all the others in Alabama , was segregated .
About 50 black women were there in a long room .
At the end of the room was one filthy bathroom .
The next morning , they told me they were going to take my picture and fingerprints .
I met Bull Connor [ who later became Birmingham 's public safety commissioner ] in the elevator .
He said , " Whatcha got there ? "
They said , " We got one of them Yankee bitches .
We ought to do like Mussolini does , put them up against the wall and shoot them . "
They transferred me to the county jail .
As we went in , I noticed a saying over the door about " justice " – and here I was in prison for the crime of attending a meeting .
Minoru Yasui
1942
In the Second World War , a notice was suddenly posted throughout Japanese neighbourhoods : " All persons of Japanese ancestry will be evacuated from the above designated area by 12 o' clock noon "
There was nothing in the evacuation order or in any public law that allowed the United States government to keep Americans within any restricted area .
But the War Relocation Authority , by pure executive fiat , detained us under their jurisdiction and sent us to camps .
The military , without imposing martial law , was ordering the civilian to do something .
In my opinion , that 's the way dictatorships are formed .
And if I , as an American citizen , stood still for this , I would be derogating the rights of all citizens .
I had to stand up and say , " That 's wrong " .
I refused to report for evacuation .
Sure enough , within the week , I got a telephone call saying , " We 're coming to get you " .
I can still see them .
The lieutenant was in a saloon car .
A jeep followed with four military policemen .
I was thrown into the North Portland Livestock Pavilion , where Japanese - Americans had been put .
In stalls where horses and cows were kept , people now lived .
It was sweltering , but we had no way to escape it .
They would n't let us outside .
In September , they started moving us into desert camps .
You were surrounded with barbed - wire fences , armed guards , searchlights , and machine - gun nests .
We wondered how long we were going to be interned .
What was going to happen ?
By then , we had heard rumours of forced labour camps in Germany .
Were they , as [ the journalist ] Westbrook Pegler and others were suggesting , going to castrate the men and ship them back to Japan ?
These things were in the papers constantly : make them suffer .
Make them hurt .
And I kept on thinking , " What did I do ? "
Frances Chaney Lardner
1947
In the McCarthy era , the House Committee on Un- American Activities ( HUAC ) blacklisted actors , and those deemed " subversive " quickly found themselves unemployable
I was an actress and I had a decent career in New York .
But after the HUAC hearings , I could n't get any real work .
From 1947 till 1963 , I was able to play only one part on night - time television .
An agency sent me for a big part on the Philco Playhouse , in a script written by Paddy Chayefsky .
I thought , " See , by God , I 've sneaked through . "
That spring , the same agency said they had a part for me in Marty .
Chayefsky had written it with me in mind , and all they wanted was script approval .
And then the process started : " Call us back in an hour . "
They finally said they were very sorry .
Someone else had been cast in the part .
Then they recast the first Chayefsky programme : I was out .
The terrible thing about the whole business is what it did to people .
It made the victims of the blacklist suspicious and fearful .
For example , I remember well the time that I got my first important job in a Broadway play in 1962 .
There was a lovely woman who understudied me .
We were in the dressing - room we shared , and I suddenly felt , " What if she 's from the FBI ? "
I had nothing to conceal whatsoever , and yet I had this sense that she was put there .
You found yourself worried because there were things that had to be protected : children had to be protected , your livelihood had to be protected .
I went from being an open , free , healthy , outgoing person to suddenly having these walls around me .
Anne Braden
1954
When Anne and Carl Braden bought a home in a white suburb of Louisville , Kentucky , for the Wades , an African - American family , the house was fire - bombed .
Andrew and Charlotte Wade and their young child escaped injury , but the Bradens were charged with sedition
When the grand jury met I was the first one called .
I 'd only been there a few minutes when I realised it was not the bombing that was under investigation – it was me .
They began by asking me what organisations I belonged to and what books I had in my house .
I 'd heard that questions like those were being asked by HUAC , but I did n't expect them from the grand jury .
I told them , " It 's none of your business .
It does n't have a thing to do with who blew up this house . "
The next day , the prosecutor made a statement that there were two theories about the bombing .
One was that the neighbours blew it up to get the Wades out .
The other was that it was a Communist plot to stir up trouble between the races and bring about the overthrow of the governments of Kentucky and the US .
By the beginning of October , those of us who had been openly supportive of the Wades were charged with sedition .
A combination of anti-black and anti-red mania gripped this community .
If you have n't lived through such hysteria , it 's hard to imagine .
People were so scared , they were going through their libraries and getting rid of books .
The hysteria had taken everybody 's minds off the real issue : whether a black man has a right to live in his house .
The Wades were never able to move back and the real dynamiter was never punished .
We became part of a resistance movement , a small group of people who were scared but not intimidated , and were still fighting – they were the soul of America .

Pete Seeger
1955
For more than half a century , Seeger 's songs have provided the soundtrack to protest : at union halls , civil rights marches and anti-Vietnam War protests .
As a result , he has been investigated for sedition , harassed by the FBI , and called before the House Committee on Un- American Activities
I was hauled up before the HUAC along with about 30 other actors and musicians in New York .
The committee claimed that it was investigating the Communist conspiracy in the entertainment business .
Of course , they were just investigating their own definition of heresy .
The committee asked me , " Did you ever sing a song called ' Was n't That a Time ' ? "
I still sing that song .
It has a verse for Valley Forge , a verse for Gettysburg , a verse for the Second World War , and a verse for the McCarthy days .
But it ended on an optimistic note : " Our faith cries out .
Is n't this a time , a time to free the soul of man ? "
So I told the committee , " That 's a good song , and I know it .
I 'll sing it for you . "
They replied : " No .
We do n't want to hear it .
We want to know , did you sing it on such and such a place and date ? "
I said , " I would be glad to sing any song I ever sang .
But as to where I 've sung them , I think that 's no business of this committee .
I 've got a right to sing them anywhere . "
A year later , I was cited for contempt of Congress because I had refused to answer the committee 's questions .
In 1961 , I was tried , convicted and sentenced to a year in jail .
My family and friends stood behind me .
And all around the world , people sent dimes and dollars to help pay the legal expenses .
A year later , the appeals court unanimously acquitted me .
I 'm only sorry I had n't done what Paul Robeson did .
He stood up and shouted , " This whole hearing is a disgrace .
You are the Un - Americans ! "
Ruby Sales
1965
Those who defied segregation risked their lives , such as civil rights activist Jonathan Daniels , killed in broad daylight .
Despite death threats , Ruby Sales testified at the trial – but the all - white jury found the killer , Tom Coleman , not guilty
I was a 16 - year - old student at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama .
After the terrible beating of the people in Selma on Bloody Sunday [ in March 1965 ] , we felt we wanted to make our own statement .
About a thousand of us marched to Montgomery and had a sit-in .
We were hemmed in for a day and a night , surrounded by dogs and by very menacing white vigilantes who called themselves policemen .
For the first time , I saw people resisting police in a non-violent way .
That was the turning point in my life : I became part of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee [ SNCC ] .
Young people from the town of Fort Deposit had begun to organise themselves around the exploitation of their parents as sharecroppers , and asked us to join their demonstration .
When we got there , a mob of white men was waiting .
Then the city came with a garbage truck .
They put us in it along with the garbage and took us to prison .
We were refused bail and kept in jail for seven days .
Suddenly they ordered us to leave .
We left with great trepidation and I walked to the corner grocery with Father Richard Morrisroe and Jonathan Daniels .
A white man , Tom Coleman , was standing in the doorway with a shotgun .
He hurled obscenities at us .
He told me he would blow my brains out .
Jonathan pulled me back in an attempt to protect me .
In that instant , he got shot .
Then there was another shot , and Father Morrisroe fell .
They made him ride to the hospital in a hearse on top of Jonathan 's dead body .
Stokely Carmichael
1968
Kwame
Ture – known until the late 1970s as Stokely Carmichael – was arrested while pressing for the right of African - Americans to vote in the South .
Elected chairman of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee , the FBI sought to silence and discredit him
When I was an organiser in Greenwood , Mississippi , [ SNCC organiser ]
Bob Moses informed me that I should report the beatings , the shootings , and the burnings to the FBI .
But I did n't want to waste my time .
They never did anything with the reports .
And we saw the FBI exactly for what it was .
We saw its racism .
We saw its defence of segregated policies .
At first , we would present the facts to the FBI .
But we learnt that it would endanger the local person who saw it .
Whatever we told the FBI , its agents told the local police .
But nothing the FBI did stopped us from organising .
Later , when I had disputes with SNCC , the FBI manipulated them to wreak havoc on us .
I can remember when it spread three rumours about me at the same time : I bought a $ 70,000 house ; I ran away to Africa ; I was a CIA agent .
It had informers in every city and every organisation .
All the FBI had to do was send out one memorandum , and overnight a rumour was dropped everywhere , and it appeared to be the truth : " It is also suggested that we inform a certain percentage of reliable criminal and racial informants that 'we heard from reliable sources that Carmichael is a CIA agent ' .
It is hoped that these informants would spread the rumour in various large Negro communities across the land . "
You really can't fight this .
How can you go to every large city and say , " It 's not true .
The FBI said it . "
You can't .
Some people in SNCC actually believed all that about me .
We were unified against local southern sheriffs and the Ku Klux Klan .
But the FBI was able to split us on every conceivable issue with their channels to the press and their informants inside our organisation .
Linda Hajek
1982
When the FBI infiltrated the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador ( CISPES ) , a group opposed to Ronald Reagan 's policy in Central America , Linda Hajek , a Catholic sister , found herself under scrutiny
We started our community - based chapter of CISPES in Dallas about 1980 .
Up to then , there had been a small group of church people exchanging information on Central American events .
We tried to speak to as many groups as we could about El Salvador .
We did lobbying .
Our first demonstration was during Central America Week in 1981 .
We suspected there might be some plants – we knew they had been placed in other organisations – but I have to say that every time I took it seriously , I felt I was being arrogant .
We were a small group , and what we were doing did n't seem to merit that kind of attention .
Then the story came out , a long front - page Sunday morning type of thing .
And there was my name in the middle of it .
It read like a soap opera , like Dallas : the story of this guy , this FBI informant Frank Varelli , who was going to get me in a motel room and seduce me and have the sex scene recorded on film .
I mean , it was so ridiculous – at the time I was a Catholic sister .
I thought , " Who would do this kind of thing in the name of national security ? "
Varelli also said they had a device that could record conversations .
He said they used it mainly to keep track of the numbers we phoned .
And Varelli said they tampered with our mail .
They watched where we lived , the Bethany House of the Holy Cross Catholic Church .
They sat out there in the parking lot and copied down the licence plates of all the people who came here .
But in a sense , Frank Varelli was not the problem .
The real problem was that the government believed it had the right to break into citizens ' homes , put taps on their phones , and send people to meetings to spy on them if they dissented from the government 's policy .
Maher Arar
2002
Maher Arar , a Syrian - born Canadian citizen whose name was on a " terrorist look - out list " , was sent by the US government to Syria , where he was tortured .
He was later exonerated in Canada
On 26 September 2002 , on my way back to Canada after a vacation in Tunisia , my plane stopped at JFK airport , New York .
At Immigration they pulled me aside , took my fingerprints and my picture .
I saw a bunch of guys coming .
They said : " There 's just a couple of questions and we 'll let you catch your plane . "
I answered all their questions , but they did n't let me catch the plane .
I asked for a lawyer , but they just ignored me .
Later , three FBI agents took me to a detention centre in Brooklyn .
I was terrified .
They kept me in solitary confinement for about 10 days , and on 2 October , they showed me a document that alleged I was a member of al - Qa'ida .
Two guys from Immigration handed me a document that said the director had decided to deport me , and I had the right to designate the country .
I wrote , " Canada " .
Then I was chained and a woman read that , based on information that they could not reveal , they were sending me to Syria .
They drove me to an airport in New Jersey and put me on a private jet , chained and shackled .
They flew to Amman , Jordan , where six or seven men were waiting for us .
They put a blindfold on me , and put me in the back of a van , then sent me to Syria .
The interrogation started the first day , then they took me to a cell the size of a grave .
I spent 10 months in that place .
Sometimes they put me in another room , where I could hear people being severely tortured .
They wanted me to say that I 'd been to Afghanistan .
I am not a terrorist , or a member of al - Qa'ida .
There 's nothing on earth that justifies what they did .

The Top 10 Foods Only America Could Have Invented
Photo : Emdot
When it comes to food , America gets a bad rap .
It ’s a common refrain that America has no cuisine to call our own .
We ’ve got apple pie and hot dogs , but that ’s about it .
( And when you really get down to it , the Germans invented hot dogs , and the British were eating apple pie like 1,000 years ago . )
But the truth is , America does have a cuisine to call it ’s own .
Over the past 232 years we ’ve invented some of the most creative , daring , and yes , downright craziest dishes the world has ever seen .
Sure , they can be overly greasy , a little too cheesy , and sometimes fried a few times too many .
But they ’re ours .
So to celebrate Independence Day , we ’ve put together this list of the best foods that only a country with just the right combination of greed , grit , and gluttony could have possibly dreamed up .
The Top Ten Foods Only America Could Have Invented :
10 . Corn Dog
Photo : Intangible Arts
In 1942 , at a beautiful place called the Texas State Fair , an industrious young man named Neil Fletcher came up with a way to make his hot dogs sell quicker : dip them in corn meal , deep fry ’em , and pop ’em on a stick .
And so an American tradition was born .
Every year , as the weather turns warmer and state fair season comes around , Americans say to themselves : what can we deep fry next ?
We ’ve deep fried twinkies , oreos , hamburgers , even coca-cola .
But all of these wondrous achievements owe a debt to the original food that really did n’t need to be battered and fried but just had to be : the corn dog .
9. Philly Cheesesteak
Photo : x-eyedblonde
Only Philadelphia , the most American of all cities , could invent an iconic sandwich and then vehemently insist that there shall be no attempts to make it good .
Crappiest ingredients only , please .
Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell explained problems non PA -ers have when trying to make cheesesteaks : “ First , they use good meat .
You need the fattiest , stringiest meat to get a proper taste . ”
The second mistake , of course , is that you ’ve got to use Cheese Whiz ; no real cheese allowed .
Rendell insists this is became “ real cheese does n’t melt , ” which is of course a lie .
But never matter .
The Philly Cheesesteak is delicious .
Would it be more delicious if it were made with thinly slice Kobe steak and melted Gruyere ?
Of course it would be .
But it would n’t be as amazing .
8. “ Chinese Food ”

One of the great things about American cuisine is that when we come up with something so outrageous that even we ca n’t stand behind it , we figure out a way to pin it on someone else .
Case in point : “ Chinese Food . ”
All across America , Chinese buffets offer endless arrays of beautiful , deep - fried , grease - soaked food .
General
Tso ’s chicken , chop suey , egg rolls , chow mein , fortune cookies .
What do all these dishes have in common ?
They were all invented in America .
Seriously people , do you really think Chinese people eat this crap ?
No .
They eat rice .
With vegetables and maybe a little meat .
And it ’s not battered or fried , or double fried , or double battered , and it ’s certainly not filled with cheese .
I mean , crab rangoon ?
Come on , that stuff has imitation crab meat and cream cheese .
It could only have been invented in one place , and I think you know where that is .
7. S’mores

It ’s difficult to say exactly how s’mores became so popular throughout America .
Graham crackers are not particularly well - liked , and neither are marshmallows .
We generally do not enjoy eating things that were cooked on a stick our little brother just found in the dirt , nor do we usually like to burn our food to a crisp before dinnertime .
Yet somehow , s’mores just work .
Despite their cutesy contraction of a name , and the fact that we have to actually cook and assemble them ourselves , rather than order them from a fast food window , I ’ve yet to meet a person who does not love s’mores .
Except for foreigners , who will look at you like you are the craziest person ever if you try to explain what a s’more is .
6. Reuben Sandwich

This fully - loaded sandwich may seem like an international delicacy , but the reuben is as American as it gets .
Start with pastrami–a meat so infused with spices that it has more flavor in a single bite than most full meals .
Pile this sky - high , preferably using at least a pound of meat per sandwich .
Add on some “ swiss ” cheese–a bland , hole -y cheese that no actual Swiss person would ever touch .
Top it off with “ Russian dressing , ” a beautiful orange mayonnaise concoction that –you guessed it –has n’t a thing to do with Russia .

Quick Intro To SEO ( Search Engine Optimization )
Put quite simply , SEO is the process of optimizing your website for the search engines ( like Google ) .
By “ optimizing ” , I mean attempting to make it such that searches for specific phrases rank your website higher in the search results than other websites .
There are lots of good reasons to want to rank higher , but for businesses , the primary reason is to generate good leads for your offering .
Millions of people use Google every day looking for a product , service , or information .
Some of these people might be potential clients looking for your particular offering .
If you can
There are two ways for you to show up on the results page when users are doing a search .
The first is with paid search ( I ’ll talk about this in a future article ) and the second is what is known as “ organic ” ( or “ natural ” ) search .
The natural search results are listed free and are dependent on Google ’s estimation of how relevant and credible your website is .
Natural search results are my favorite kind , because you do n’t have to pay money for them , and they often works better than paid advertising .
I liken this to the difference between getting mentioned in a magazine article and purchasing an ad in that same magazine .
If you can rank high on the free ( organic ) search results for Google , it ’s like getting tens of thousands of dollars worth of free advertising in the most relevant trade magazines for your industry , every time a new issue comes out .
I ’m not sure about you , but that ’s pretty interesting to me .
It ’s a great way to grow your business and find new clients .
So , how do you get all this free , effective advertising in the search engines ?
Well , to do that you need to understand the Google algorithm and how it determines who gets listed .
Google ’s Search Algorithm
How PageRank Is Calculated
What ’s Your PageRank ?
Quick recap :
If you ’ve spent time ( or are simply curious ) about online marketing , then the topic of search engine optimization ( SEO ) usually comes up .
And , no discussion of search engine anythingis complete these days without some mention of Google .
This article provides a brief overview of how Google ranks search results with a look at their PageRank™ algorithm ( a key component ) .
I ’m not a search engine expert ( that ’s the bad news ) .
The good news is that I know enough to describe Google PageRank in relatively simple terms ( such that you can impress your friends and family with your new - found knowledge ) .
First , let ’s establish a simple example which we can use to frame our discussion .
Let ’s assume you are the partner in a boutique strategy consulting firm .
Lets further say that your specialization is advising technical founders of high - growth , venture - backed companies on how to be better at selling .
Now , you could probably identify a number of search phrases that your potential clients might use when interested in this particular topic .
Users may search for something like “ technical sales consultant to founder ” .
Or , they may just start by looking for content ( instead of consulting ) and search on “ successful technical selling ” .
In either case , Google has an algorithm that figures out which websites of the hundreds of millions out there should be displayed in rank order on the results page .
These are the organic ( i.e. non-paid ) results .
You want to rank high on these results .
[ Author ’s note :
If you do actually search Google on “ successful technical selling ” , you ’ll find that my OnStartups.com blog ranks # 1 ] .
Though Google ’s algorithm is extremely sophisticated , it boils down to something like this : Search Ranking = Relevance * PageRankRelevance is basically the measure of how your website ( or more accurately one of your web pages ) matches the search phrase the user has entered .
Measuring relevance is a relatively sophisticated process , but it boils down to some fundamentals like the title of the page , words on the page and how frequently they occur , etc .
So , if your home page contains keywords like “ technical selling ” , it drives up the relevance for this particular search .
The reason my blog article is ranked # 1 on Google for “ successful technical selling ” is in no small part because of the title OF ONE OF MY ARTICLES ( “ Successful Selling Tips For The Technically Gifted ” ) .
Basically , Google figures out what your page is “ about ” by looking at it ’s content ( and by looking at other sites with similar content that are linking to yours ) , and then uses this to figure out how relevant your site is for a particular search phrase .
PageRank is an independent measure of Google ’s perception of the quality / authority / credibility of an individual web page .
It does not depend on any particular search phrase .
For the public ( you and me ) , Google conveniently reports this as a number from 0 - 10 ( 10 being the best ) .
So , assuming for a second that your web page and your competitor 's web page have the same relevance – whoever has the higher PageRank gets the better ranking and shows up at the top of the results page .
This is why PageRank is so important .
Your relevance is based on your content ( if you ’re a consulting company specializing in technical selling , your relevance for stainless steel monkey wrench searches is going to be understandably low ) .
Your PageRank is what counts .
There has been a lot written and a lot debated about Google ’s PageRank , but on one point there is near unanimous agreement .
PageRank is primarily determined by how many other web pages are linking into you .
Google considers this kind of inbound a link a vote of confidence .
But , here ’s the trick :
Not all inbound links are created equal .
Web pages with more credibility that link to you have more “ value ” to your PageRank than those with less credibility .
How is this credibility determined ?
Why , by their PageRank , of course !
So , let ’s take an example .
Let 's say you have your Uncle Charlie link to you from his blog to your small business website .
Let ’s also say that Uncle Charlie ’s blog has a Page Rank of 3 ( this is being a little generous because all Uncle Charlie writes about is his dog Sparky and he has limited inbound links ) .
This link from Uncle Charlie will certainly help you – a little bit .
It will help you more if you can find 100 such Uncle Charlie websites with a PageRank of 3 and get them to link to you .
However , if you get a single link from HubSpot.com ( the sponsor of this blog ) , it ’ll help you more than a 100 Uncle Charlie websites .
Why ?
Because HubSpot.com has a PageRank of 6 and a link from it is much more valuable .
I divide up PageRank into these broad categories : 0 - 3 : New sites or sites with very minimal links4 - 5 : Popular sites with a fair amount of inbound links6 : Very popular sites that have hundreds of links , many of them quality links7 - 10 : Usually media brands ( NYTimes.com ) , big companies or A - list bloggers .
Now , it ’s important to note that PageRank is believed to be calculated on a logarithmic scale .
What this roughly means is that the difference between PR4 and PR5 is likely 5 - 10 times than the difference between PR3 and PR4 .
So , there are likely over a 100 times as many web pages with a PageRank of 2 than there are with a PageRank of 4 .
This means that if you get to a PageRank of 6 or so , you ’re likely well into the top 0.1 % of all websites out there .
If most of your peer group is straggling around with a PR2 or PR3 , you ’re way ahead of the game .
There are two ways to figure out what your approximate PageRank is .
One , you can download the Google Toolbar ( the PageRank feature is not turned on by default , so you ’d have to enable it after installation ) .
The other way is to use our immensely popular ( and free ) Website Grader tool .
It will not only tell you your Google PageRank , but a bunch of interesting other stuff too .
Over the last few months , our browser team at Nuanti Ltd. has been developing Meta , a brand new WebKit port suited to embedding in OpenGL and 3D applications .
The work is being driven by Linden Lab , who are eagerly investigating WebKit for use in Second Life .
While producing Meta we ’ve paid great attention to resolving the technical and practical limitations encountered with other web content engines .
uBrowser running with the WebKit Meta engine
High performance , low resource usage
Meta is built around WebKit , the same engine used in web browsers like Safari and Epiphany , and features some of the fastest content rendering around as well as nippy JavaScript execution with the state of the art Squirrel Fish VM .
The JavaScript SDK is available independently of the web renderer for sandboxed client - side game scripting and automation .
It ’s also highly scalable .
Some applications may need only a single browser context but virtual worlds often need to support hundreds of web views or more , each with active content .
To optimize for this use case , we ’ve cut down resource usage to an absolute minimum and tuned performance across the board .
Stable , easy to use cross-platform SDK
Meta features a single , rock - solid API that works identically on all supported platforms including Windows , OS X and Linux .
The SDK is tailored specifically to embedding and allows tight integration ( shared main loop or operation in a separate rendering thread , for example ) and hooks to permit seamless visual integration and extension .
There is no global setup or initialization and the number of views can be adjusted dynamically to meet resource constraints .
Minimal dependencies
Meta does n’t need to use a conventional UI toolkit and does n’t need any access to the underlying windowing system or the user ’s filesystem to do its job , so we ’ve done away with these concepts almost entirely .
It adds only a few megabytes to the overall redistributable application ’s installed footprint and wo n’t interfere with any pre-installed web browsers on the user ’s machine .
Nuanti will be offering commercial and community support and is anticipating involvement from the gaming industry and homebrew programmers .
In the mid term , we aim to submit components of Meta to the WebKit Open Source project , where our developers are already actively involved in maintaining various subsystems .
Find out more
Today we ’re launching meta.nuanti.com and two mailing lists to get developers talking .
We ’re looking to make this site a focal point for embedders , choc-full of technical details , code samples and other resources .
Definitely not fake .
We have two angles !
Look at this guy , this is madness !

There 's concern in some corners of the U.S. military about " enemy activities in sleep research , " neuro - pharmaceutical performance enhancement , and " brain - computer interfaces . "
And it 's not coming from the Pentagon 's scientific fringe , or from some tin-hat kook with a Defense Department badge .
The celebrated scientists on the Pentagon 's most prestigious scientific advisory panel , JASON , are the ones worried about adversaries ' ability " to exploit advances in Human Performance Modification , and thus create a threat to national security . "
In a recent report , unearthed by Secrecy News , the JASONs are recommending that the American military push ahead with its own performance - enhancement research – and monitor foreign studies – to make sure that the U.S. ' enemies do n't suddenly become smarter , faster , or better able to endure the harsh realities of war than American troops .
The JASONs are particularly concerned about ( and excited by ) new drugs that promote " brain plasticity " – rewiring the mind , essentially , by helping to " permanently establishing new neural pathways , and thus new cognitive capabilities . "
The military has already tested these neuro - modulators as a way to keep troops alert after sleepless nights .
But these new drugs will certainly have extensive off - label use for improvement of memory and cognitive performance .
[ They ] may have the additional effect of weakening or overwriting existing memories .
Depending on the ultimate performance of these drugs , adversaries might use them in training programs or field operations ... to increase troop effectiveness or modify troop behavior and / or emotional responses .
The scientific group also wants the military to keep close watch on the hardware and software which connects the human brain to machines .
American researchers have used these brain - computer interfaces to develop new prosthetics – and to train monkeys to control robotic limbs .
Northrop Grumman just won a Pentagon contract to develop binoculars that will tap the subconscious mind .
The JASONs believe " the primary threat potential for adversarial use of a
Brain - Computer interface ...
... may arise in a feedback mode , in which a the interface provides a soldier with a simple signal or a pain / pleasure pulse in response to externally provided situational information .
Longer term adversarial developments may include prosthetic applications providing specialized sensory input or mechanical output .
None of this is likely to happen soon , of course .
Even the most basic of these advances – a drug to effectively , consistently fight sleep deprivation – still is n't ready for wartime .
" If an opposing force had a significant sleep advantage , this would pose a serious threat .
However , the technical likelihood of such a development is small at present , " the JASONs note .
But since " existing neuro - pharmaceuticals " are " used rather commonly ... as study aids . "
And since " the US military will certainly test whether , and to what extent , the new lessons of neuroscience can be used in military training ... it is reasonable to expect that adversaries will do so as well .
We do not expect the development of super - soldiers as a result of improved training , although enhanced military capability can certainly be expected . "
* While it is possible to improve athletic performance using supplements , or banned substances ( e.g the former East German sports teams ) , such improvements often are either small in effect , highly variable from individual to individual , or dependent on coordination with highly disciplined training regimes .
As a result , the tactical advantage that might be gained by any adversary employing supplements is not likely to be overwhelming in general operations .
Special circumstances , as in the use of khat in Somalia , can however contribute to unexpected enemy behavior .
Therefore it is important for the US to establish and maintain awareness of adversaries ’ uses of performance modifying substances ( either as part of local culture , or officially established military policy ) . *

La Condition Humaine " by René Magritte ( 1898 –1967 )
I. Introduction
Up to the 18th century , historians paid little or no attention to the epistemological problems of their craft .
In dealing with the subject of their studies , they again and again referred to some regularities that — as they themselves and their public assumed — are valid for any kind of human action irrespective of the time and the geographical scene of the action as well as of the actors ' personal qualities and ideas .
But they did not raise the question whether these regularities were of an extraneous character or inherent in the very nature of human action .
They knew very well that man is not able to attain all that he wants to attain .
But they did not ask whether the limits of a man 's power are completely described by reference to the laws of nature and to the Deity 's miraculous interference with them , on the one hand , and to the superior power of more puissant men , on the other hand .
Like all other people , the historians too distinguished between behavior complying with the moral law and behavior violating it .
But , like all other people , they were fully aware of the fact that nonobservance of the laws of ethics did not necessarily — in this life — result in failure to attain the ends sought .
Whatever may happen to the sinner in the life hereafter and on the day of the Last Judgment , the historian could not help realizing that on earth he could sometimes fare very well , much better than many pious fellow men .
Entirely new perspectives were opened when the economists discovered that there prevails a regularity in the sequence and interdependence of market phenomena .
It was the first step to a general theory of human action , praxeology .
For the first time people became aware of the fact that , in order to succeed , human action must comply not only with what are called the laws of nature , but also with specific laws of human action .
There are things that even the most efficient constabulary of a formidable government cannot bring about , although they may not appear impossible from the point of view of the natural sciences .
It was obvious that the claims of this new science could not fail to give offense from three points of view .
There were first of all the governments .
Despots as well as democratic majorities are not pleased to learn that their might is not absolute .
Again and again they embark upon policies that are doomed to failure and fail because they disregard the laws of economics .
But they do not learn the lesson .
Instead they employ hosts of pseudoeconomists to discredit the " abstract , " i.e. , in their terminology , vain teachings of sound economics .
Then there are ethical doctrines that charge economics with ethical materialism .
As they see it , economics teaches that man ought to aim exclusively or first of all at satisfying the appetites of the senses .
They stubbornly refuse to learn that economics is neutral with regard to the choice of ultimate ends as it deals only with the methods for the attainment of ends chosen , whatever these ends may be .
There are , finally , authors who reject economics on account of its alleged " unhistorical approach . "
The economists claim absolute validity for what they call the laws of economics ; they assert that in the course of human affairs something is at work that remains unchanged in the flux of historical events .
In the opinion of many authors this is an unwarranted thesis , the acceptance of which must hopelessly muddle the work of historians .
In dealing with this brand of relativism , we must take into account that its popularity was not due to epistemological , but to practical considerations .
Economics pointed out that many cherished policies cannot result in the effects aimed at by the governments that resorted to them , but bring about other effects — from the point of view of those who advocated and applied those policies — were even more unsatisfactory than the conditions that they were designed to alter .
No other conclusion could be inferred from these teachings than that these measures were contrary to purpose and that their repeal would benefit the rightly understood or long - run interests of all the people .
This explains why all those whose short - run interests were favored by these measures bitterly criticized the " dismal science . "
The epistemological qualms of some philosophers and historians met with an enthusiastic response on the part of aristocrats and landowners who wanted to preserve their old privileges and on the part of small business and employees who were intent upon acquiring new privileges .
The European " historical schools " and American Institutionalism won political and popular support , which is , in general , denied to theoretical doctrines .
However , the establishment of this fact must not induce us to belittle the seriousness and importance of the problems involved .
Epistemological relativism as expressed in the writings of some of the historicists , e.g. , Karl Knies and Max Weber , was not motivated by political zeal .
These two outstanding representatives of historicism were , as far as this was humanly possible in the milieu of the German universities of their age , free from an emotional predilection in favor of interventionist policies and from chauvinistic prejudice against the foreign , i.e. , British , French , and Austrian science of economics .
Besides , Knies wrote a remarkable book on money and credit , and Weber gave the deathblow to the methods applied by the schools of Schmoller and Brentano by demonstrating the unscientific character of judgments of value .
There were certainly in the argumentation of the champions of historical relativism points that call for an elucidation .
II . Positivist Dogma and Human Action
Before entering into an analysis of the objections raised against the " absolutism " of economics , it is necessary to point out that the rejection of economics by epistemological relativism has nothing to do with the positivist rejection of the methods actually used by historians .
In the opinion of positivism , the work of the historians is mere gossip or , at best , the accumulation of a vast amount of material that they do not know how to use .
What is needed is a science of the laws that determine what happens in history .
Such a science has to be developed by the same methods of research that made it possible to develop out of experience the science of physics .
The refutation of the positivistic doctrine concerning history is an achievement of several German philosophers , first of all of Wilhelm Windelband and of Heinrich Rickert .
They pointed out in what the fundamental difference between history , the record of human action , and the natural sciences consists .
Human action is purposive , it aims at the attainment of definite ends chosen , it can not be treated without reference to these ends , and history is in this sense — we must emphasize , only in this sense — finalistic .
But to the natural sciences the concept of ends and final causes is foreign .
Then there is a second fundamental difference .
In the natural sciences man is able to observe in the laboratory experiment the effects brought about by a change in one factor only , all other factors the alteration of which could possibly produce effects remaining unchanged .
This makes it possible to find what the natural sciences call experimentally established facts of experience .
No such technique of research is available in the field of human action .
Every experience concerning human action is historical , i.e. , an experience of complex phenomena , of changes produced by the joint operation of a multitude of factors .
Such an experience cannot produce " facts " in the sense in which this term is employed in the natural sciences .
It can neither verify nor falsify any theorem .
It would remain an inexplicable puzzle if it could not be interpreted by dint of a theory that had been derived from other sources than historical experience .
Now , of course , neither Rickert and the other authors of the group to which he belonged , the " Southwestern German philosophers , " not the historians who shared their conception went as far as this last conclusion .
To them , professors of German universities at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century , the very idea that there could be any science claiming for its theses universal validity for all human action irrespective of time , geography , and the racial and national characteristics of people remained unknown .
For men living in the spiritual climate of the second German Reich , it was an understood thing that the pretensions of " abstract " economic theory were vain and that German wirtschaftliche Staatswissenschaften ( the economic aspects of political science ) , an entirely historical discipline , had replaced the inane generalization of the school of Hume , Adam Smith , and Ricardo .
As they saw it , human action — apart from theology , ethics , and jurisprudence — could be dealt with scientifically only by history .
Their radical empiricism prevented them from paying any attention to the possibility of an a priori science of human action .
The positivist dogma that Dilthey , Windelband , Rickert , and their followers demolished was not relativistic .
It postulated a science — sociology — that would derive from the treatment of the empirical data provided by history a body of knowledge that would render to the mind the same services with regard to human action that physics renders with regard to events in the sphere of nature .
These German philosophers demonstrated that such a general science of action could not be elaborated by a posteriori reasoning .
The idea that it could be the product of a priori reasoning did not occur to them .
III .
The Alleged Materialism of Economics
The deficiency of the work of the classical economists consisted in their attempt to draw a sharp line of demarcation between " purely economic activities " and all other human concerns and actions .
Their great feat was the discovery that there prevails in the concatenation and sequence of market phenomena a regularity that can be compared to the regularity in the concatenation and sequence of natural events .
Yet , in dealing with the market and its exchange ratios , they were baffled by their failure to solve the problem of valuation .
In interpersonal exchange transactions objects are not valued according to their utility , they thought , because otherwise " iron " would be valued more highly than " gold . "
They did not see that the apparent paradox was due only to the vicious way they formulated the question .
Value judgments of acting men do not refer to " iron " or to " gold " as such , but always to definite quantities of each of these metals between which the actor is forced to choose because he cannot have both of them .
The classical economists failed to find the law of marginal utility .
This shortcoming prevented them from tracing market phenomena back to the decisions of the consumers .
They could deal only with the actions of the businessmen , for whom the valuations of the consumers are merely data .
The famous formula " to buy on the cheapest and to sell on the dearest market " makes sense only for the businessman .
It is meaningless for the consumer .
Thus forced to restrict their analysis to business activities , the classical economists constructed the concept of a science of wealth or the production and distribution of wealth .
Wealth , according to this definition meant all that could be bought or sold .
The endeavors to get wealth were seen as a separate sphere of activities .
All other human concerns appeared from the vantage point of this science merely as disturbing elements .
Actually , few classical economists were content with this circumscription of the scope of economics .
But their search for a more satisfactory concept could not succeed before the marginalists substituted the theory of subjective value from the various abortive attempts of the classical economists and their epigones .
As long as the study of the production and distribution of wealth was considered as the subject matter of economic analysis , one had to distinguish between the economic and the noneconomic actions of men .
Then economics appeared as a branch of knowledge that dealt with only one segment of human action .
There were , outside of this field , actions about which the economists had nothing to say .
It was precisely the fact that the adepts of the new science did not deal with all those concerns of man which in their eyes were qualified as extraeconomic that appeared to many outsiders as a depreciation of these matters dictated by an insolent materialistic bias .
Things are different for modern economics , with its doctrine of the subjective interpretation of valuation .
In its context the distinction between economics and allegedly noneconomic ends becomes meaningless .
The value judgments of the ultimate consumers express not only the striving after more tangible material goods , but no less the striving after all other human concerns .
The narrow viewpoint of a science of — material — wealth is surpassed .
Out of the discipline of wealth evolves a general theory of all choices made by acting men , a general theory of every kind of human action , praxeology .
In their behavior on the market people evidence not only their wishes to acquire more material goods , but no less all their other preferences .
Market prices reflect not only the " materialistic side " of man , but his philosophical , ethical , and religious ideas as well .
The observance of religious commandments — to build and maintain houses of worship , to cease working on holidays , to avoid certain foods either always or on specific days and weeks , to abstain from intoxicating beverages and tobacco , to assist those in need , and many others — is one of the factors that determines the supply of and the demand for consumers ' goods and thereby the conduct of business .
Praxeology is neutral with regard to the ultimate ends that the individuals want to attain .
It does not deal with ultimate ends , but with the means chosen for their attainment .
It is merely interested in the question whether or not the means resorted to are fitted to attain the ends sought .
The enormous quantity of antieconomic literature published in the last hundred and fifty years turns around one argument only .
Its authors repeat again and again that man as he really is and acts strives not only after more material amenities , but also after some other — higher or loftier or ideal — aims .
From this point of view the self - styled Historical School attacked what they called the absolutism of the economic doctrine and advocated a relativistic approach .
It is not the theme of this paper to investigate whether the economists of the classical school and their epigones were really guilty of having neglected to pay due attention to the nonmaterialistic concerns of man .
But it is to be emphasized that all the objections raised by the Historical School , e.g. , by Knies in his famous book , are futile and invalid with regard to the teachings of modern economics .
It is customary in German political literature to distinguish between an older and a later Historical School .
As the champions of the older school , Roscher , Bruno Hildebrand , and Knies are named .
The younger school consists of the followers of Schmoller who after the establishment of the Reich in 1870 held the chairs of economics at the German universities .
This way of subdividing into periods the history of ideas is an outcome of the parochialism that induced German authors to slight all that was accomplished abroad .
They failed to realize that the " historical " opposition against what was called the absolutism of economics was inaugurated outside of Germany .
Its outstanding representative was Sismondi rather than Roscher and Hildebrand .
But it is much more important to realize the fact that all those who in Germany as well as in other countries after the publication of the books of Jevons , Menger , and Walras criticized economic doctrine on account of its alleged materialism were fighting against windmills .
IV .
Science and " Irrationality "
Max Weber 's concept of a general science of human action — to which he applied the name sociology — no longer refers to the distinction between economic action and other activities .
But Weber virtually endorsed the objections raised by historicism against economics by distinguishing between genuinely rational action , on the one hand , and other kinds of action .
His doctrine is so closely connected with some untranslatable peculiarities of the German language that it is rather difficult to expound it in English .
The distinction that Weber makes between " social action " and other action is , from the point of view of our problem , of little importance .
The main thing is that Weber quite correctly distinguishes between sinnhaftes Handeln and the merely physiologically determined reactions of the human body .
Sinnhaftes Handeln is directed by the Sinn the acting individual attaches to it ; we would have to translate : by the meaning the actor attaches to it and by the end he wants to attain by it .
This definition would appear as a clear distinction between human action , the striving after a definite end , on the one hand , and the physiological — quasi-automatic — reactions of the nerves and cells of the human body , on the other hand .
But then Weber goes on to distinguish within the class of sinnhaftes Handeln four different subclasses .
The first of these subclasses is called zwechrationales Handeln and is defined as action aiming at a definite end .
The second subclass is called wertrationales Handeln and is defined as action determined by the belief in the unconditional intrinsic value ( unbedingter Eigenwert ) of a certain way of conduct as such , without regard to its success , from the point of view of ethics , aesthetics , religion , or other principles .
What Weber failed to see is the fact that also the striving after compliance with definite ethical , aesthetical , and religious ideas is no less an end than any other end that men may try to attain .
A Catholic who crosses himself , a Jew who abstains from food and drink on the Day of Atonement , a lover of music who forgoes dinner in order to listen to a Beethoven symphony , all aim at ends that from their point of view are more desirable than what they have to renounce in order to get what they want .
Only a personal judgment of value can deny to their actions the qualification zweckrational , i.e. , aiming at a definite end .
And what in Weber 's definition do the words " without regard to its success " mean ?
The Catholic crosses himself because he considers such behavior as one link in a chain of conduct that will lead him to what for him is the most important success of man 's earthly pilgrimage .
It is tragic that Max Weber , the eminent historian of religion , the man who tried to free German sociological thought from its naive commitment to judgments of value , failed to see the contradictions of his doctrine .
Other attempts to distinguish between rational action and nonrational or irrational action were likewise based on crass misconstructions and failed .
Most of them called " irrational " conduct directed by mistaken ideas and expectations concerning the effects of definite methods of procedure .
Thus , magic practices are today styled as irrational .
They were certainly not fitted to attain the ends sought .
However , the people who resorted to them believed that they were the right technique in the same way in which physicians up to the middle of the past century believed that bleeding is a method of preventing and curing various diseases .
In speaking of human action , we have in mind conduct that , in the opinion of the actor , is best fitted to attain an end he wants to attain , whether or not this opinion is also held by a better informed spectator or historian .
The way in which contemporary physicians deal with cancer is not irrational , although we hope that one day more efficacious therapeutic and prophylactic methods will be discovered .
A report concerning other people 's actions is confusing if it applies the term irrational to the activities of people whose knowledge was less perfect than that of the reporter .
As no reporter can claim for himself omniscience , he would at least have to add to his qualification of an action as irrational the proviso " from my personal point of view . "
Another way in which the epithet " irrational " is often employed refers , not to the means , but to the ends of definite modes of conduct .
Thus , some authors call , either approvingly or disapprovingly , " irrational " the behavior of people who prefer religious concerns , national independence , or other goals commonly called noneconomic to a more abundant supply of material satisfactions .
Against this highly inexpedient and confusing terminology there is need to emphasize again and again the fact that no man is called to sit in judgment on other people 's judgments of value concerning ultimate ends .
When the Huguenots preferred the loss of all their earthly possessions , the most cruel punishments , and exile to the adoption of a creed that in their opinion was idolatrous , their behavior was not " irrational . "
Neither was Louis XIV " irrational " when he deprived his realm of many of its most worthy citizens in order to comply with the precepts of his conscience .
The historian may disagree with the ultimate ends that the persecutors and their victims were aiming at .
But this does not entitle him to call the means to which they resorted in order to attain their ends irrational .
The terms " rational " and " irrational " are just as much out of place when applied to ends as when applied to means .
With regard to ultimate ends , all that a mortal man can assert is approval or disapproval from the point of view of his own judgments of value .
With regard to means there is only one question , viz. , whether or not they are fitted to attain the ends sought .
Most of our contemporaries are guided by the idea that it is the worst of all crimes to force a man , by recourse to violence , to behave according to the commandments of a religious or political doctrine that he despises .
But the historian has to record the fact that there were ages in which only a minority shared this conviction , and unspeakable horrors were committed by fanatical princes and majorities .
He is right in pointing out that Louis XIV , in outlawing Protestantism , inflicted irreparable evils on the French nation .
But he must not forget to add that the King was not aware of these consequences of his policy and that , even if he had anticipated them , he would perhaps nonetheless have considered the attainment of religious uniformity as a good for which the price paid was not too high .
The surgeons who accompanied the armies of ages past did their best to save the lives of the wounded warriors .
But their therapeutic knowledge was pitifully inadequate .
They bled the injured man whom only a transfusion of blood could have saved and thus virtually killed him .
Because of their ignorance , their treatment was contrary to purpose .
It would be misleading and inexpedient to call it irrational .
Present - day doctors are not irrational , although probably better informed physicians of the future will qualify some of their therapeutical techniques as detrimental and contrary to purpose .
V. The Serviceableness of the Means Employed to Attain the Ends Sought
Whenever the distinction between rational and irrational is applied to ultimate ends , the meaning is that the judgments of value underlying the choice of the end in question meet with approval or disapproval on the part of the speaker or writer .
Now the promulgation of judgments of value is not the business of a man in his capacity as a praxeologist , economist , or historian .
It is rather the task of religion , metaphysics , or ethics .
History of religion is not theology , and theology is not history of religion .
When the distinction between rational and irrational is applied to means , the meaning is that the speaker or writer asserts that the means in question are not serving their purpose , i.e. , that they are not fit to attain the ends sought by the people who resort to such means .
It is certainly one of the main tasks of history to deal with the serviceableness of the means people employed in their endeavors to attain the ends sought .
It is also certain that the main practical goal of praxeology and its hitherto best - developed part , economics , is to distinguish between means that are fit to attain the ends sought and those that are not .
But it is , as has been pointed out , not expedient and rather confusing to use for this distinction the terms " rational " and " irrational . "
It is more appropriate to speak of means answering the intended purpose and those not answering it .
This holds true also with regard to the way in which the terms " rational " and " irrational " are employed by psychoanalysts .
They " call behavior irrational that is predominately emotional or instinctual , " and furthermore " all unconscious functions " and in this sense distinguish between " irrational ( instinctual or emotional ) action as opposed to rational action , and irrational as opposed to rational thinking . "
Whether this terminology is expedient for the treatment of the therapeutic problems of psychoanalysis may be left to the psychoanalysts .
From the praxeological point of view , the spontaneous reactions of the human body 's organs and the activity of instinctual drives are not action .
On the other hand , it is manifestly the outcome of a personal judgment of value to call emotional actions — e.g. , the action with which a man may react to the awareness of his fellow men's distress — irrational .
It is further obvious that no other meaning can be ascribed to the term " irrational thinking " than that it is logically invalid thinking and leads to erroneous conclusions .
VI . Historical Relativism versus Praxeology
The philosophy of historical relativism — historicism — fails to see the fact that there is something unchanging that , on the one hand , constitutes the sphere of history or historical events as distinct from the spheres of other events and , on the other hand , enables man to deal with these events , i.e. , to record their succession and to try to find out their concatenation , in other words , to understand them .
This unchanging phenomenon is the fact that man is not indifferent to the state of his environment ( including the conditions of his own body ) and that he tries , as far as it is possible for him to do so , to substitute by purposive action a state that he likes better for a state he likes less .
In a word : man acts .
This alone distinguishes human history from the history of changes going on outside the field of human action , from the study of " natural history " and its various subdivisions as , e.g. , geology or the evolution of various species of living beings .
In human history we are dealing with the ends aimed at by the actors , that is , with final causes .
In natural history , as in the other branches of the natural sciences , we do not know anything about final causes .
All human wisdom , science , and knowledge deal only with the segment of the universe that can be perceived and studied by the human mind .
In speaking of human action as something unchanging , we refer to the conditions of this segment only .
There are authors who assume that the state of the universe — the cosmos — could change in a way about which we simply do not know anything and that all that our natural sciences say about the behavior of sodium and levers , for example , may be invalid under this new state .
In this sense they deny " any kind of universality to chemical and mechanical statements " and suggest that they be treated " as historical ones . "
With this brand of agnostic hyperhistoricism that deals in its statements with visionary conditions about which — as they freely admit — we do not know and cannot know anything , reason and science have no quarrel .
Thinking man does not look upon the world with a mind that is , as it were , a Lockean paper upon which reality writes its own story .
The paper of his mind is of a special quality that enables man to transform the raw material of sensation into perception and the perceptual data into an image of reality .
It is precisely this specific quality or power of his intellect — the logical structure of his mind — that provides man with the faculty of seeing more in the world than nonhuman beings see .
This power is instrumental in the development of the natural sciences .
But it alone would not enable man to discover in the behavior of his fellow men more than he can see in the behavior of stars or of stones , in that of amoebae or in that of elephants .
In dealing with his fellow men , the individual resorts not only to the a priori of logic , but besides to the praxeological a priori .
Himself an acting being , he knows what it means to strive after ends chosen .
He see more in the agitation and the stir of his fellow men than in the changes occurring in his nonhuman environment .
He can search for the ends their conduct is aiming at .
There is something that distinguishes in his eyes the movements of germs in a liquid as observed in the microscope from the movements of the individuals in the crowd he may observe in the rush hour at New York 's Grand Central Terminal .
He knows that there is some " sense " in a man 's running around or sitting still .
He looks upon his human environment with a mental equipment that is not required or , to say it more precisely , is downright obstructive in endeavors to explore the state of his nonhuman environment .
This specific mental equipment is the praxeological a priori .
The radical empiricism of the historicists went astray in ignoring this fact .
No report about any man 's conduct can do without reference to the praxeological a priori .
There is something that is absolutely valid for all human action irrespective of time , geography , and the racial , national , and cultural characteristics of the actors .
There is no human action that can be dealt with without reference to the categorical concepts of ends and means , of success and failure , of costs , of profit or loss .
What the Ricardian law of association , better known as the law of comparative cost , describes is absolutely valid for any kind of voluntary human cooperation under the division of labor .
What the much - derided economic laws describe is precisely what must always and everywhere happen provided the special conditions presupposed by them are present .
Willy nilly , people realize that there are things they cannot achieve because they are contrary to the laws of nature .
But they are loath to admit that there are things that even the most powerful government cannot achieve because they are contrary to praxeological law .
VII .
Historicist Self - Contradiction
Different from the case of the historians who are loath to take cognizance of the praxeological a priori is the case of the authors who belong to the various historical , " realistic , " and institutional schools of economics .
If these scholars were consistent , they would limit their studies to what is called economic history ; they would deal exclusively with the past and would carefully abstain from asserting anything about the future .
Prediction about events to come can be made only on the ground of knowledge of a regularity in the succession of events that is valid for every action irrespective of the time and the geographical and cultural conditions of its occurrence .
Whatever economists committed to historicism or institutionalism do , whether they advise their own governments or those backward foreign countries , is self - contradictory .
If there is no universal law that describes the necessary effects of definite ways of acting , nothing can be predicted and no measure to bring about any definite results can be recommended or rejected .
It is the same with those authors who , while rejecting the idea that there are economic laws valid for all times , everywhere , and for all people , assume that every period of history has its own economic laws that have to be found a posteriori by studying the history of the period concerned .
These authors may tell us that they have succeeded in discovering the laws governing events up to yesterday .
But — from the point of view of their own epistemological doctrine — they are not free to assume that the same laws will also determine what will happen tomorrow .
All that they are entitled to affirm is : experience of the past shows that A brought about B ; but we do not know whether tomorrow A will not bring about some other effects than B .
Another variety of the denial of economics is the trend doctrine .
Its supporters blithely assume that trends of evolution as manifested in the past will go on .
However , they cannot deny that in the past trends did change and that there is no reason whatever to assume that present trends will not one day change too .
Thus , this becomes especially manifest when businessmen , concerned about the continuation of prevailing trends , consult economists and statisticians .
The answer they get is invariably this : statistics show us that the trend you are interested in was still continuing on the day to which our most recent statistical data refer ; if no disturbing factors turn up , there is no reason why the trend should change ; however , we do not know anything about the question whether or not such new factors will present themselves .
VIII .
Ethical Relativism
Epistemological relativism , the essential doctrine of historicism , must be clearly distinguished from the ethical relativism of other schools of thought .
There are authors who combine praxeological relativism with ethical relativism .
But there are also authors who display ethical absolutism while rejecting the concept of universally valid praxeological laws .
Thus , many adepts of the Historical School of economics and of institutionalism judge the historical past from the point of view of what they consider as indisputable , never - changing moral precepts , e.g. , equality of wealth and incomes .
In the eyes of some of them private property is as such morally objectionable .
They blame the economists for an alleged praise of material wealth and disparagement of more noble concerns .
They condemn the system of private enterprise as immoral and advocate socialism on account of its presumed higher moral worth .
As they see it , Soviet Russia complies better with the immutable principles of ethics than the nations of the West committed to the cult of Mammon .
As against all this emotional talk there is need to point out again : praxeology and economics , its up - to - now best - developed branch , are neutral with regard to any moral precepts .
They deal with the striving after ends chosen by acting men without any regard whether these ends are approved or disapproved from any point of view .
The fact that the immense majority of men prefer a richer supply of material goods to a less ample supply is a datum of history ; it does not have any place in economic theory .
Economics neither advocates capitalism nor rejects socialism .
It merely tries to show what the necessary effects of each of these two systems are .
He who disagrees with the teachings of economics ought to try to refute them by discursive reasoning , not by abuse , insinuations , and the appeal to arbitrary , allegedly ethical standards .
The Rock - afire Explosion New Show Bid List
This update made on 3/10/2010
My " fanbid " idea was not financially successful enough to continue doing it .
If anyone makes a bid on a song that is not already on the list , I am returning the money to them .
I still keep the list of songs up that were bid on so that , in case I am ever able to start programming them , I will , but the bids never got high enough for me to make choosing a song from the top of the list and programming it on a regular basis possible .
Even though I established a minimum bid to do the work , I had hoped and needed for the bids to really get much higher .
If you have a band that would like to have its song " Rock - afired " , and can afford reasonable rates to have the work done , please write me at aaron@starsof.com and we can discuss it .
Meanwhile , if you have bid on a song on this list and are upset that I wo n't be getting to program your song for quite a while and wish to have your bid money returned , please write me and let me know so I can give you a refund .
Thank you to all who have participated in this idea , and please still look for all the newest productions to come out on my YouTube channel , " therockafire " .
Aaron Fechter
Dear Daughters
If we , or rather you , since I am beginning to entertain ideas unbecoming a mother , are to survive this time while the additional parent usually present in the home is absent , ( Joe has gone to Newfoundland ) then the following rules and regulations are to be observed .
1 . The soup is not ready when it explodes .
The soup is ready right before it explodes .
While I am grateful for the time saved by having daughters old enough to make their own dinner , please be more vigilant in your microwaving habits , since time is not saved by me having to scrub disgusting little flecks of carrot soup of the interior of the thing every time one of you has a bowl .
2 . I am not interested in the fight about whether or not your sandwich is " cheesed " to the same level as your sister .
Cheese is not a symbol of love and affection , it is a dairy product , nothing more , nothing less .
The fact that you have 1.2 grams more cheddar than your sister has nothing , I repeat NOTHING to do with my love for you , or my feelings about cheese .
I can't even begin to tell you the ways in which slices of cheese do n't freaking matter .
Let it go .
3 . I know we have been over this before , but clearly it bears repeating .
Dishes go IN the dishwasher , not ON the dishwasher .
The only difference between the two choices is that with one , the job is done , and with the other , your disparaged mother has to either move your soup bowl ( devoid of exploded soup ) into the dishwasher or call you into the kitchen and start that fight again , and with the other , she ( and you ) can move on .
4. Do. Not .
Talk to your mother until she has had at least one cup of coffee in the morning .
Feel free to check my cup and divine my progress , or note that if I am ready for communication , I will speak to you .
5 . Further to item 4 , please note that any attempt to get money / notes for school / clean laundry / the cute hairband you have misplaced since last night BEFORE your mother has had that single glorious brown elixir of life will likely be met with a negative response .
If you really want money / notes / laundry / hairbands , you may increase your odds by bringing me coffee or wiping something .... hell .
Anything , with a damp washrag .
6 . Soap dissolves in water .
This is why the soap in the tub is always gone .
You 're smart kids .
Put it together .
7 . Teenage boys want to have their way with you .
Please do not speak to me of their purity of soul and intent .
I am too old and skeptical to believe any other motive .
( I am willing to entertain that when they are 35 they may have another goal .
Not before . )
7b .
This does not mean that I think that boy is a jerk .
He seems to be a very good boy , I even like him .
Unfortunately , he is also teenaged and that means that even if he is the best boy alive he has suspect motivations , even if he does n't think so himself .
7 c. I know about your motivations too .
8. I pay for the phone .
If I want to make a phone call , I 'm not mean , insensitive , or calloused to your needs .
I am the lady with a JOB .
Hand it to me , or I shall devote every single moment of time that I can wrench the phone from your hands to calling boys your age that you think are hot and telling them stories from when you were breastfed and how I made the decision to cloth diaper you .
I will not leave out the part about the rash .
9 . The internet does not actually supply oxygen .
If the router quits again there is absolutely no need for that high pitched keening .
Or for you to shriek " Fix it !
Fix it !
MUM ! THE ROUTER ! " like it was the life support system of The Starship Enterprise .
10 .
Since , further to that JOB part up above , I have to go and speak to the KW - Knitters Guild tonight I expect that during the time that the three of you are alone in the house you will not look for ways to make sure I need to go completely bonkers when I get home .
This includes , but is not limited to -
- Dying your hair a strange colour .
I actually could care less what colour your hair is , since hair colour is not related to goodness as a person .
Covering the bathroom in hairdye is , however , related to goodness and how much I of it I believe you to possess .
- Drinking , between the three of you , 4 litres of milk in one evening .
- Using three towels per bath .
There are three of you .
Either do laundry , bath less or have a load in the washer when I get home .
I 'd be happy to move it to the dryer for you .
- Creating , through unknown means a " mystery smell " that I will neither be able to identify nor locate .
- Immediately tuning the tv to a banned show like " Next " " Flavor of Love " or any show that has improving women through plastic surgery as a theme , any show that is having a good day when there is a " catfight " between contestants or any show that has women competing for the attention and affection of a single male who is allowed to choose between them for his own purposes .
I do n't give a crap how trendy a harem is , all the women I know ( including you ) are worth more than that .
Thank you for your kind attention to these matters .
I will be lying on the couch with a cool cloth over my head until the parent that you say is nicer than me and actually claim to like and respect returns in a few days .
( Please note that the irony that you will dump all of this crap on him ten seconds after he comes home is not lost on either of us . )
Your mother .
PS .
Since a wise mother giving three teenagers nine hours alone provides some measure of supervision , I have arranged for a series of relatives and friends to look in on the three of you tonight .
They will arrive at random intervals .
I am not going to tell you when , or for how long .
Look alert .

Religion has existed since man ’s first thought , and this list probably illustrates that it is unlikely to go away anytime soon .
So here is a list of 10 religions that you ( probably ) never knew existed .
10 Cheondoism
Cheondoism is a 20th - century Korean religious movement that has its origins in a peasant rebellion in 1812 .
Cheondoist theology is basically monotheistic , pantheistic and panentheistic .
Cheondoism is rooted in Korean shamanism and Korean Buddhism , with elements drawn from Christianity .
It has become so popular in Communist North Korea that it is now the leading religion there .
The religion believes that God exists in each of us and that we should all strive to make earth a paradise .
It attempts to transform the believers into intelligent moral beings with a high social consciousness .
[ Image above : Cheondoism central temple ]
9 Mazdakism
Mazdakism is a religion founded by Mazdak , a socialist Persian ( Iranian ) reformer in the 6th century BC .
He claimed to be a prophet ( similar to Mohammed 1,200 years later ) and instituted communal possessions and social welfare programs .
The two distinguishing factors of Mazdak ’s teaching were the reduction of the importance of religious formalities — the true religious person being the one who understood and related correctly to the principles of the universe — and a criticism of the strong position of Zoroastrian clergy , who , he believed , had oppressed the Persian population and caused much poverty .
Despite the concepts of good conduct and Pacifism , the followers of Mazdak raided the palaces and harems of the rich , removing the valuables to which they believed they had equal rights .
8 Builders of the Adytum
Builders of the Adytum ( or BOTA for short ) is a religion created in California by Dr. Paul Foster Case .
The religion teachs its adherants by correspondence but also has bases around the world where people meet and perform religious ceremonies .
Most of the beliefs and teachings are based on esoteric psychology , occult tarot , Hermetic Qabalah , Astrology , and meditation techniques .
BOTA is not a strictly Christian organization , nor is it Jewish .
B.O.T.A believes that the Qabalah is the mystical root of both ancient Judaism and the original Christianity , but people of all faiths are accepted if they are mystically inclined .
The clip above features BOTA member Sonia Choquette .
7 Asatru
Asatru is a revival of ancient Nordic religion based upon polythesitc faith and mythic tales .
According to the religion , there are four key deities and several minor gods .
Adherents usually live in communities called Kindreds .
They ascribe to the “ Nine Noble Virtues ” as a model for their lives .
While the original Norse would have participated in animal sacrifice , modern worshipers offer mead , a honey - wine , to the gods .
Major holidays revolve around the changing seasons with Yule being the most important .
It is celebrated in late December and continues for twelve days .
6 Eckankar
Eckankar was established by American John Paul Twitchell in 1965 .
It is a monotheistic faith , which worships the divine spirit “ Eck . ” Eckankar is similar to some Eastern religions in its belief that the soul is constantly reincarnated until it achieves spiritual liberation .
The religion teaches that spiritual growth is only possible through special meditative exercises similar to yoga .
Through these practices , the soul can escape the physical form and enter the Sugmad , or spiritual realm .
Successful completion of one ’s spiritual journey results in a reunification with Eck .
5 Jainism
Jainism was founded in India over 2500 years ago .
It survives today with approximately four million believers , called J. This polytheistic faith preaches that many gods exist alongside humans in a complex hierarchy .
The Jain gods are symbolic of common human ideas .
Similar to Buddhism , the goal of “ Jain Life ” is to achieve spiritual perfection and free the soul from the cycle of rebirth .
Those who succeed in this endeavor are called jinas .
Jain worship centers on icons and numerous Jain temples in India contain images of the 24 tirthankaras , revered spiritual leaders .
Offerings are frequently made to these images as part of Jain ritual .
Meditation and monasticism are also key features of Jainism .
4 Aladura
Founded in the early 20th century , this religion is based around so - called “ prophet healing ” churches in Africa .
It claims around one million adherents , mostly in Nigeria .
Aladura is directly related to the Anglican movement of Christianity .
It was founded as a response to missionary movements in Africa .
The religion emphasizes divine healing and a strict moral code .
Its practices mix Anglican traditions with African rituals .
Many ritual objects are involved in the practice , and the faiths leaders are known as prophets who are entrusted with healing believers through rituals and prayer .
3 Cao Dai
This Vietnamese religion combines elements of Confucianism , Taoism , Buddhism , and Catholicism .
It was founded in 1926 and claims up to 6 million adherents .
Believers worship a vast array of saints , which includes such notable figures as Julius Caesar and Pericles .
The ecclectic nature of Cao Dai complements its idealistic mission to create a more tolerant world .
Adherents see all humans as sharing a divine heritage .
The practicies of this faith are somewhat occult and derived from Taoist traditions .
Believers hold seances in addition to group prayer and elaborate ritual ceremonies .
2 Unification Church
Established in South Korea in 1954 , the Unification Church ascribes to a unique interpretation of Christianity .
Its 3 million believers praise the faith ’s founder Sun Myung Moon , the religion ’s founder , as the Messiah and ascribe to a doctrine known as the “ Divine Principle ” .
This doctrine emphasizes duality in nature and the harmonious union of masculine and feminine .
Subsequently , the aim of the Unification Church is to create “ true families , ” which is often achieved through mass weddings .
These unions are also a means of fulfilling the faith ’s version of God ’s purpose , which is to experience joy and love through life .
True joy and love can only be achieved by creating a perfect , sinless family .
Only in this way does the Unification Church believe the Kingdom of God can be created .
While there is no description of an afterlife , the faith preaches that the spirit will live for all eternity .
1 Falun Gong
Falun Gong is a recent religious movement with roughly three million practitioners .
It was founded in China in 1992 by Li Hongzhi .
It combines elements of Buddhism , Taoism , and Confucianism with traditional Chinese folklore .
Falun Gong aims to obtain mental and spiritual renewal through meditation .
Adherents practice special exercises to awaken their center of spiritual energy and rid themselves of physical and spiritual ailments .
The faith has received extensive criticism from the Chinese government , which initially saw the new cult as a threat .
Outsiders also tend to ridicule Falun Gong ’s contention that antagonistic space aliens are manipulating world leaders .

Rumor is that really did happen , and this is a real ca ...
The main point of my piece is that inter- and intra-national
restrictions on trade in rice are bad , not that free trade reduces
the price of rice for everyone .
Consider a simple analogy : if the quality of
Interstate 95 declined , the price of barbecue in North Carolina might
fall , namely because people like me would n’t drive to go eat there .
Yet few
people would argue that a nation can do better feeding itself by
lowering the quality of its roads or for that matter littering its
harbor with dangerous rocks or for that matter imposing export restrictions .
It does n’t knock down the trade argument , as an empirical claim , to cite the existence of pecuniary externalities .
Maybe Rodrik has in mind the commonly - heard argument that eliminating the agricultural subsidies of rich countries would produce vast benefits for poor countries .
I ’ve criticized that claim myself ; my column is careful to argue that the poor countries are the worst protectionists , often internally as well as externally .
Here is a related part of Rodrik ’s critique :
Freer trade would reduce prices of food ( relative to other prices ) only
in countries that are food importers .
Food exporters would experience
a rise in the relative price of food , and there is simply no way of
escaping that reality .
The great strength of Rodrik ’s work is how much he stresses the
context - dependent nature of economic arguments and how " one size fits
all " is often an oversimplification .
So beware when anyone writes " there is simply no way of
escaping that reality . "
Increasing returns are one way of escaping that reality .
Would the price of cars be lower in Japan today , if the Japanese had placed heavy export restrictions on Toyota autos ?
Probably not .
( Constant returns , by the way , are another means of escaping from that reality . )
Now rice production may or may not be subject to increasing returns , but surely rice trade is a positive - sum game and also has broadly pro-egalitarian effects .
Trade really is an issue where a ) economists have something to say and b ) human lives are on the line .
If Rodrik wishes to argue , " Indonesia should ban the export of rice , " then by all means he should just come right out and say so .
Let ’s have that debate .
But if not , I wonder if he could see his way toward using his considerable influence and writing eight simple words :
" The world should have free trade in rice . "

mnesia:match_object( ) on an ordered_set
I started writing some code happily assuming that calling mnesia : match_object / 2 on an ordered_set table will return an ordered set of objects .
For a brief moment , some doubt snuck in and I decided to check the actual implementation ...
It turns out , AFAICT , that mnesia simply prepends objects written during the transaction , thus breaking the ordered_set semantics , and -- In my opinion -- violating the Principle of Least Surprise ( tm ) .
The Mnesia documentation does n't make any promises regarding order , so this behaviour does n't formally violate the Mnesia interface .
However , where anything is written about the expected semantics of match_object ( ) , the following can be found in the ETS Reference Manual : " On tables of the ordered_set type , the result is in the same order as in a first / next traversal . "
Given the current implementation of mnesia: match_object ( ) , I do n't think preserving the order would have to impact performance , esp. not on large sets ( and on small sets , I do n't think it matters . )
I 've not made a patch .
I could suggest a fix , but not today .

Not As I Imagined

BODY WEIGHT : 180 lb
The report I am writing is explaining about my first time ever drinking a real amount of alcohol ( all other times were simple sips ) .
I was in the middle of high school when this experience happened , so I am probably quite a ' lightweight ' to most of you guys .
I have never touched tobacco or cannabis .
The last time I tried to drink alcohol , all of my friends got really drunk , and I was busy dealing with them .
By the end of the night , I never got a chance to drink .
I sure learned a lot that night though , mainly that you need to be careful about how much alcohol someone around you consumes ( two of my friends probably got alcohol poisoning that night ) .
So for my first time , I was careful to make sure the enviroment around me was safe and easy to interact with .
I knew that I was going to use the computer and my Xbox , so I made sure both were up and running before I would consume any alcohol .
My mom was going to bed early due to work she had the next day , and so I designed my preparations around not waking her up mainly .
At the time of writing this , I can be pretty proud about the preparations I took , and it led to no complications .
Planning ahead definitely has its benefits .
I had my ' plan ' all thought out days before , and it was only a couple of hours before I would start drinking .
All I needed to do was wait for my mom to go to bed , and I would be off drinking .
However , I had one problem with a cold that I had for quite a long time .
I started coughing a lot , so decided I needed to take some sort of cough medicine .
I had Dayquil and Nyquil , and at the time it was 9:30 pm .
I knew I 'd be up till around 3 am , but for some reason I thought that Dayquil would keep me up all night .
I knew that Nyquil is a powerful drug , and it will combine with the alcohol to do some negative effects , but I chose to take it anyway .
It was in my stomach for around one and a half hours before I started to drink , and I was starting to get really tired .
This effect eventually went away .
I think Nyquil might have had a big effect on my body that night , but I am no expert , so I do n't know for sure .
Right before my mom went to bed , I actually had a lengthy conversation with my mom about alcohol , and I eventually realized I did n't need to be so secretive about it .
I still decided to stick with the plan of her not knowing , but now I know if I get caught it wo n't be as big of a deal .
My mom went to bed , I waited about 20 minutes , and then the ' show ' began .
The first thing I decided to drink was all of the whiskey I had on me , and I mixed it into orange juice .
I honestly think I did n't have enough to even get a ' buzz , ' so I chugged the whole orange juice / whiskey combo while holding my nose .
It was 11:00 pm when I did this .
I played one game of Halo 2 online that lasted around 10 minutes , and then I went down stairs to chat on my computer .
It was after about 2 minutes of chatting that the effects really hit me , I mean , I never expected the effects to hit me so fast like that .
I drank this strong old red wine that my mom had , and then I went back upstairs .
I was totally new to alcohol , so the effects surprised me .
The world around me was n't a blur at all like I thought it would be , but I felt really dizzy .
The only way I could compare it to is when you are one of those spinning rides in a theme park , and you can feel the G - forces weighing down on your body .
The only difference was that I could move my body much more , and the feeling did n't make me feel bad at all .
I had fun just moving my head side to side , because it just felt cool moving my head .
I also noticed that walking felt really weird , I kept stumbling and had to keep holding onto walls in order to walk .
Tastes in my mouth also felt really numb , and I fear that most people that are drunk can start drinking a lot of hard alcohol without feeling the taste .
I knew I needed to try out the ' social ' aspects of drinking , so I started talking to my friends on Xbox Live while playing Halo 2 .
I am usually pretty timid , but I noticed that I kept talking almost nonstop .
I knew it was also the typical slurred speech you get from drunks , and I kept trying to make my speech intelligent , but I always failed .
Alcohol basically screwed up my speech , but I could still think fairly good .
I could see that my inhibitions were lowered , and it did n't really bother me at all .
At around 2 am , I knew I was coming down .
One of the odd things about alcohol is that the effects come in waves , in which I feel the effects greatly , and then it goes down to an almost sober feeling , and then back up again .
I was in a continued state of feeling the lower ' sober ' feeling , so I knew that I was coming down .
It was at this point that I recognized the true danger of alcohol .
I felt very tempted to go and drink more in order to get the higher ' feeling ' that I had , but I knew I should n't .
The next day , I felt like getting drunk again , and that really scared me .
I had no hangover though .
I can see why this is a drug that requires A LOT of respect , because it is so easy to abuse .

The growing popularity of digital video recorders is brightening the picture for network TV , which has been buffeted by steady erosion to cable .
Only 23 % of TV homes owned a DVR in May , Nielsen says .
But that 's nearly double the 12.4 % average for the 2006 - 07 season .
And because DVR users watch more TV than others , their impact on ratings is magnified .
" People with DVRs have the capability of watching this stuff whenever they want , " says ABC 's Larry Hyams , adding that the most - recorded shows have ratings 40 % higher in DVR homes .
Take Lost . " Live " viewership was down 12 % last season to 11.3 million viewers .
But the decline was only 7 % when factoring in those who delayed it but watched the same day .
Add those who watched it anytime within seven days of the initial telecast , and the drop is a modest 3 % , based on new year - end Nielsen figures .
The total audience rises to 14.7 million , a net gain of 3.4 million , or 23 % of its total .
Among adults ages 18 to 49 , delayed viewing accounts for 28 % of the audience .
The equation is similar for shows in competitive time slots .
Thursdays at 9 ET / PT , CSI 's live viewing is down 11 % , but its seven - day total is off 6 % .
Grey 's Anatomy is down a sharp 24 % live , which moderates to a smaller ( but still significant ) 16 % drop when seven - day viewing is factored in .
NBC's
The Office bucked the trend entirely :
The comedy was off 1 % live but up 10 % overall last season , for a total of 9.9 million viewers .
And CW 's Smallville is down 12 % live , but only 2 % with delayed viewing included .
CW 's low ratings give delayed DVR viewing an outsized effect .
Just 653,000 viewers watch Gossip Girl that way , but that figure is 24 % of the show 's total , second only to The Office 's 26 % .
Problem is , until recently , networks have n't profited from procrastinators .
In a compromise , they can now charge advertisers for delayed viewership , but only within three days .
DVR users also can more easily skip commercials .
Still , it could be worse .
" The biggest challenge is apathy , " says ad buyer John Rash of Campbell Mithun .
" If the network programming is compelling enough for some viewers to DVR , that 's a much better scenario than audiences simply not watching . "

Because they stand up to power :
A Chinese ship carrying arms destined for Zimbabwe was last night forced to turn back after South African unions refused to unload it , claiming that to do so would be “ grossly irresponsible ” , South African media reported .
The reversal is a humiliation for President Mbeki , who had said that the Government was powerless to stop the shipment of three million rounds of AK47 ammunition , 1,500 rocket - propelled grenades and more than 3,000 mortar rounds and mortar tubes to President Mugabe ’s armed forces .
It was not clear last night where the ship was now destined , or whether it was trying to deliver the arms by a different route .
The retreat , if confirmed , would represent a victory for human rights activists , who had filed a legal petition to block the transfer of the goods , and also for the 300,000 - strong South African Transport and Allied Workers ’ Union , who had said that the arms would worsen the political crisis in Zimbabwe .
“ Our members employed at Durban container terminal will not unload this cargo , neither will any of our members in the truck - driving sector move this cargo by road , ” Randall Howard , a union spokesman , said .
“ South Africa can not be seen to be facilitating the flow of weapons into Zimbabwe at a time where there is a political dispute and a volatile situation between Zanu ( PF ) and the MDC [ Movement for Democratic Change ] , ” he said .
Legal action was taken to ensure that the ship would not be unloaded and the South African courts ruled against permitting the ship to be unloaded :
The court ruling followed an application brought with the support of the South African Litigation Centre under legislation prohibiting the supply of arms to " governments that systematically violate , or oppress ... human rights and fundamental freedoms " .
The director of the centre , Nicole Fritz , said : " It is hard to imagine clearer circumstances in which South African authorities were obliged to refuse to grant any conveyance permit . "
Helen Zille , the leader of South Africa 's opposition party , the Democratic Alliance , warned that the shipment could result in carnage of " genocidal proportions " .
Pointing out that a consignment of Chinese machetes had prefaced the genocide in Rwanda , she said : " The mind boggles when one considers the damage that could be done with the consignment of arms sitting in Durban harbour . "
These arms are still a problem .
While the court was making its ruling , the ship left South African waters and its location is n't currently known , although there 's speculation it 's headed to Mozambique .
And even if this shipment of arms does n't make it to Zimbabwe , things appear to be getting uglier , especially if this report is proven accurate :
Chinese troops have been seen on the streets of Zimbabwe 's third largest city , Mutare , according to local witnesses .
They were seen patrolling with Zimbabwean soldiers before and during Tuesday 's ill - fated general strike called by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) .
Earlier , 10 Chinese soldiers armed with pistols checked in at the city 's Holiday Inn along with 70 Zimbabwean troops .
One eyewitness , who asked not to be named , said : " We 've never seen Chinese soldiers in full regalia on our streets before .
The entire delegation took 80 rooms from the hotel , 10 for the Chinese and 70 for Zimbabwean soldiers . "
Officially , the Chinese were visiting strategic locations such as border posts , key companies and state institutions , he said .
But it is unclear why they were patrolling at such a sensitive time .
They were supposed to stay five days , but left after three to travel to Masvingo , in the south .
China 's support for President Mugabe 's regime has been highlighted by the arrival in South Africa of a ship carrying a large cache of weapons destined for Zimbabwe 's armed forces ...
According to [ the South African newspaper ]
Beeld , the documentation for the shipment was completed on 1 April , three days after the presidential vote .
Zimbabwe and China have close military ties .
Three years ago , Mr Mugabe signed extensive trade pacts with the Chinese as part of the " Look East " policy forced on him by his ostracising by Western governments over human rights abuses .
The deal gave the Chinese mineral and trade concessions in exchange for economic help .
In previous crack downs Mugabe has used troops on loan from North Korea .
China should be asked why it has military advisors in Zimbabwe during a political crisis .
Just as they should be pressured over their suppression of Tibet , they should be pressured over their apparent active support of Robert Mugabe .
In fact , it 's the kind of pressure the world 's most powerful state might be able to exert ... if the Bush administration had n't so devalued our international influence by its disdain for international law and institutions and for the invasion and occupation of Iraq .

Sie haben dabei so viel zu bieten , dass erst gar keine Entzugserscheinungen auftauchen !

Nice one , Mrs Harman .
With her Equalities Officer hat on , the Leader of the House has championed one of the most innovative changes to UK murder law in the past century : it is now slightly less legal for men to kill their partners in anger .
More specifically , a new proposal from Minijust the Ministry of Justice is calling for an end to the hopelessly misogynist provocation defence .
This is a defence dating back to the 17th century that can reduce a murder charge to manslaughter if a defendant can claim that he or , in rare cases , she , ‘ saw red ’ or was cajoled or insulted into lashing out at zir partner .
It ’s used in cases of infidelity where a partner might be induced to murder an adulterous spouse in a fit of jealousy .
It ’s used by husbands who claim to have been nagged to ( someone else ’s ) death , to have been asked to take the bins out one too many times until they somehow found their fingers around their partners ’ throats .
Although the provocation defence is not gendered , Harman was amongst the many to bravely acknowledge that it is ‘ overwhelmingly ’ used by men .
Yes , women too are capable of bullying , assaulting and even murdering their partners , but in 86 % of domestic murders the victim is a the wife or female partner of the male killer .
Quoted in the Guardian today , Vera Baird QC , the solicitor general , said that
The days of sexual jealousy as a defence are over .
Exceptionally , someone who loses control and kills from a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged by the victim ’s conduct will … have a partial defence .
However , unlike the current defence of provocation , this ca n’t be used when ordinary domestic conflicts cause friction and emphatically will not be available as a reaction to sexual infidelity .
Women have historically found themselves treated in a desperately unequal fashion by the British justice system in domestic violence cases , being labelled cold - blooded killers when they murder an abusive partner in fear of their own lives , as in the case of Kiranjit Ahluwalia , who suffered years of torture at the hands of her husband , including having a hot iron held to her face , before finally turning on her abuser in his sleep .
In another welcome move , the same proposal will outline plans for a new partial defence when men or women kill ‘ in response to a fear of serious violence ’ , without the current requirement for the crime to have been spontaneous .
Finally , a recognition that women and men who are seriously abused by their partners turn to murder out of fear , not anger .
That spontaneous crimes are committed in anger , but crimes of fear are often premeditated , simply because they have to be .
Finally , some acknowledgement that ‘ just losing it ’ is n’t an excuse for murder , but years of sustained violence and abuse just might be .
No one is born a cold - blooded killer .
I ’m certainly not of the school which believes that if you marry a man you ’ll fine a knife at your throat or a fist in your stomach .
But , just maybe , once we ’ve seen the back of sexist laws from a less civilised age , it ’ll make it easier for my sisters ’ generation to enter relationships and friendships with men without fear .
These legal amendments are a targeted part of a broader goal to eliminate systems which facilitate domestic violence .
It is never okay to lash out at a partner because they ’re nagging you or shagging another bloke .
Violence is not an appropriate reaction to frustration with a partner , let alone murder , and in the society we want to build ‘ provocation ’ has no place as a legal excuse .
This is n’t about misandry .
It ’s not about victimising men .
It ’s about justice .
COLUMBUS , Ohio  Paul Feeney did n't commute with the Segway his parents gave him for Christmas in 2005 until he moved close to work this spring .
The battery - powered , energy - efficient scooter makes the 1.4 - mile commute fun , the 35 - year - old Sun Microsystems sales representative said .
It also made his commute a lot less expensive .
When the Segway Personal Transporter came out in 2001 , inventor Dean Kamen said the self - balancing vehicles would revolutionize short - distance travel .
At first , however , they appealed mostly to police , mall security crews and airport personnel .
With gas prices escalating , sales are growing .
One Segway dealer identified as one of its top five in the U.S. — Riva Motorsports of Pompano Beach , Fla . — sold almost 200 in 2006 , 250 in 2007 and 175 in the first five months of 2008 , said Riva spokesman Matt Sermarini .
" Anything that seems to be economical on fuel or does n't use fuel at all , people are definitely researching and buying , " Sermarini said .
Jared Cavalier , the Columbus Segway dealer who sold Feeney his scooter , said the increased interest has allowed him to open stores in Toledo and Cincinnati this year .
" These last few months have been fantastic , " Cavalier said .
" We unbox them and they go out the door the same week . "
The self - balancing , standup scooters are getting more attention all around .
Two " catcalls " are the most popular , Feeney said .
" People yelling , ' Dork ! ' and people yelling , ' How much does that cost ? " '
The Segway 's $ 5,000 price tag and its geekiness — they were among many targets of Weird Al Yankovic 's parody " White & Nerdy " in 2006 — are probably the biggest limits on its popularity , Feeney said .
James Houchard , an early customer in Ohio who now owns three Segways with his wife , said he tells people who stop him that he sees no difference in his electric bill .
" People always ( wanted ) to know how they work and what they do , but now I 've had people ask about gas and say , ' Is that a lot cheaper ? " ' said Houchard .
Houchard , 56 , said they like the energy savings , but when he mentions what the scooters cost , it 's usually a surprise .
" Five - thousand dollars is an issue , " Bedford , N.H. - based Segway Inc. president and CEO Jim Norrod acknowledged — though he predicted recent years ' sales growth rate of 40 % to 50 % to continue in 2008 .
Dealers have seen a further uptick of 30 % to 40 % in walk - in traffic in the past month as people look for antidotes to expensive gasoline , according to Carol Valianti , a spokeswoman for Segway Inc .
The privately held company does not release sales data .
For now , the energy savings seem to be Segway 's strongest selling point .
Since buying a Segway in April , Kalispell , Mont. , resident John O'Connor estimates , he has saved at least $ 100 on gas for commuting .
Enough charge to make the four - mile round trip to his job with telecommunications provider CenturyTel costs 4 cents , he said .
" Gas prices are going up , and it just turns my stomach .
So I thought , ' I 'm done — I 'm not going to do it anymore , " ' said O'Connor , 53 .
He and his wife are selling one of their automobiles .
Segways do n't completely cure the pain at pump .
They need a charge after about 25 miles , can't protect riders from the elements or carry much cargo and have a top speed of 12.5 mph .
" I could probably ride 10 minutes in 10 - below - zero weather and not get so cold that I could n't stand it .
If the trip was a lot longer , I probably would n't want to do it , " said O'Connor .
Richard Doherty , an analyst with the Envisioneering Group research firm who has followed the Segway market for several years , said interest started rising in California when gas hit $ 4 a gallon there early this year .
" When SUV owners start driving slowly to save precious drops of gas , using a Segway looks more and more appealing — especially for middle of the day and weekend trips near home , " said Doherty .
The vehicle 's price is coming into range , said Doherty .
" They 're saying that a Segway now costs about what you 'd pay for the annual maintenance on many car models , " he said .
" It just makes sense , if it 's fair weather and you can make your trips by Segway . "

Gah !
I admit that I 've never watched Fox Business Channel , even though my cable company carries it .
Based on this clip of their " after - the - market - closes " show , Happy Hour , I see I 've made a wise choice .
What kind of surreal experience is this ?
Bar set , complete with a bartender and business men with their brewskis in the background , host Rebecca Gomez looking like she 's ready to hook up and whose only research before interviewing Naomi Klein appears to be skimming the reviews of The Shock Doctrine on Amazon , and to top it off , guest host Eric Bolling admits to not only being an oil trader , but never looking at the book ?
That 's respect , I 'll tell you , for the collective intelligence of their viewers as well as Naomi .
Still , with all the obstacles Fox Business Channel places in the way of having an intelligent discussion , Klein still gets in some great points that leave the embarassingly ill - informed
Fox hosts with little to do but sputter inanities like " Naomi , do you like capitalism ? "
Klein :
This is just a classic example of what I mean by ‘ disaster capitalism , ' which is using a real disaster , a real crisis , or a shock - like the oil shock - to push through policies that you can't get through in normal circumstances .
So here you have a shock , you have a real oil crisis .
People are in pain , they want solutions .
And you got the President , the " Extortionist - in - Chief " whose job is actually to solve the problems , but instead he holds the country hostage .
And he says , " Listen , unless you give me ANWR , you 'll never drive again . "
Gomez :
Wait a minute , so this is , just so I 've set it up correctly , this is so you 're saying that the President 's taking advantage of this crisis ...
Klein : Exactly ...
Gomez : ... to get into ANWR .
Klein : ... to push the wish list of the oil and gas industries .
These are not real solutions .
People need real solutions .
They 're presenting this as if it's a short - term solution and you guys know full well that it 's a long ... if it 's any ... going to have any kind of impact on gas prices , it 's in the long run .
But people are so desperate for solutions that they 're willing to buy anything .
Bolling : Listen , I have to take the other side of this ...
Klein :
You 're kidding !
Bolling : ... I 've been talking a long time about the actual ... you know , it 's really only about a year to 5 to 6 years to pull some oil out of the water in the outer continental shelf now .
Klein : A year ?
You need to build the rig !
Bolling : No , no , listen , they 're already built .
All you have to do is move it .
Klein : I 'm hearing different things .
Gomez :
He 's an oil trader though , Naomi , he may know !
Gah !
Mr Muchadehama said the MDC would do its best to get the petition heard Armed police in Zimbabwe have prevented lawyers from the opposition MDC from entering the high court to file a petition on the presidential elections .
Lawyer Alec Muchadehama said the police had threatened to shoot them .
The MDC wants the court to force officials to release the result of last Saturday 's poll .
It says its leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the ballot .
His opponent President Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party has said it will back him if a run -off is called .
Reuters news agency said the police apparently came from presidential offices across the street , telling the lawyers no - one could enter the court .
Another opposition lawyer , Andrew Makoni , later said the hearing - originally scheduled for 1200 local time ( 1000 GMT ) - had been postponed until Sunday .
Zimbabwean Deputy Information Minister Bright Matonga accused the MDC ( Movement for Democratic Change ) of spreading false and malicious reports to get international sympathy .
He said police had probably been trying to contain the party 's rowdy supporters .
The MDC has also called for international help to prevent possible violence if a second round is held .
But speaking in the UK , South African President Thabo Mbeki said that now was not the time to interfere , and the international community should wait to find out the outcome of the election .
Divided party
On Friday , Zanu - PF leaders backed Mr Mugabe 's participation in a possible run-off .

Speculation grips Harare Send us your comments
There had been speculation he would stand aside rather than face a second poll .
Correspondents say there are fears a second round - which would be expected to take place within three weeks - could lead to a resurgence of the violence and intimidation that has been a characteristic of past elections in Zimbabwe .
Announcing the legal challenge , another MDC spokesman , Nelson Chamisa , said the delay in reporting the result was unjustified .
" We 're fighting the anxiety , disappointment , speculation and rumours as a result of this delay , " he said .
Mr Chamisa said the ruling party would attempt to use a run-off as a way to exact revenge , and called for immediate international help .
" For Mugabe , a run - off is a strategy for retribution , " he said .
" He was beaten at the referendum in 2000 and we all know the violence which followed .
" This is what we want to avoid , rather than have the international community intervene after there has been bloodshed . "
Harare is still covered in election posters Zanu - PF said it would call for recounts for 16 seats in the parliamentary elections .
If successfully contested , these would be enough for the party to regain the majority it lost for the first time since 1980 .
The MDC says its candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , took 50.3 % of the vote , just over the 50 % needed to avoid a run-off .
An independent projection says Mr Tsvangirai gained 49 % , just below the threshold , with Mr Mugabe on 42 % .
' Provocation '
On Friday , hundreds of Zanu - PF supporters - some of them veterans from the war against white rule that led to independence - marched through the capital , Harare , the Associated Press news agency reported .
ELECTION RESULTS SO FAR Presidential results :
None so far Winner needs more than 50 % to avoid run-off Senate results : Zanu - PF : 5 MDC : 5 Source : ZEC
Voters predict results
Is Mugabe losing his grip ?
Jabulani Sibanda , head of the Zimbabwe War Veterans ' Association , which has been associated with past election violence , said Zanu - PF had lost the elections because " people were pushed by hunger and illegal sanctions " .
" Under current circumstances the spirit of our people is being provoked , " he said .
" We will be forced to defend our sovereignty . "
Western countries imposed sanctions following allegations that Mr Mugabe rigged the polls in 2002 .
The sanctions are targeted at Mr Mugabe and his close associates - they are subject to a travel ban and an assets freeze in the European Union and the US .
Mr Mugabe , 84 , came to power 28 years ago at independence on a wave of optimism .
But in recent years Zimbabwe has been plagued by the world 's highest inflation , as well as acute food and fuel shortages , which correspondents say have driven many voters to back the opposition .
The ruling party remains divided , the BBC's Peter Biles says , with many who would still like to see a change of leadership , believing that under Mr Mugabe , Zimbabwe has no future .
So far , 10 of the 60 Senate results have been officially announced , with each party taking five seats .
In the lower house of parliament , the MDC took 99 seats , while Zanu - PF won 97 .
A smaller MDC faction , which backed former Mugabe loyalist Simba Makoni in the presidential election , won 10 seats , leaving them with a potentially influential role .
However , Zanu - PF gained 46 % of the vote in the parliamentary race , against 43 % for the MDC , which supporters of Mr Mugabe say gives him hope of victory in a run-off .

What are these ?
Well this was bound to happen .
Ahead of schedule , Walt Mossberg has turned his official review of the new iPhone 3G , and we 've got the recap .
On the whole , Walt stays mostly positive about the device ; he likes the form factor ( which he wants to stress really has n't changed much ) , says the 3G speeds are a big improvement over EDGE ( no kidding ? ) , and informs us that the audio quality and phone reception are -- thankfully -- improved all around .
Downsides ?
There are plenty .
Mossberg takes issue with AT&T's new pricing policy , which he finds steep , says he barely squeezed 4 hours and 27 minutes of talk time out of the battery , and gripes that you can only sync Exchange or personal calendars and contacts -- not both .
If you 're like us , you 'll probably want to just read the whole thing .
Too lazy ?
Check the video after the break .
David Pogue of the New York Times has also turned in a kinda - sorta review of the iPhone 3G , though it reads more like an overview of its features than a honest - to - goodness critique .
He also makes passing reference to the GPS antenna being " too small " to function as a proper GPS , which makes roughly zero sense to us .
Feel free to figure it out on your own .
Can't forget Ed Baig of USA Today , who says the new model is " worth the wait " ( not to say we have any option at this point anyway , seeing how hard it is to find an original anywhere ) .
He seemed to have trouble picking up 3G service in some locations , though it 's not clear whether that can be chalked up to technical issues with the handset or a lack of coverage where he was testing .
Like the others , Baig discovered a noticeable improvement in audio quality and a noticeable hit in battery life when hooked up to the 3G network .
Gotta pay to play , we guess .
[ Congressional Record : February 26 , 2008 ( House ) ] [ Page H1065 - H1072 ] ADMINISTRATION NOT COOPERATING WITH CONGRESS
The SPEAKER pro tempore .
Under the Speaker 's announced policy of January 18 , 2007 , the gentleman from California ( Mr. Rohrabacher ) is recognized for 60 minutes .
Mr. ROHRABACHER .
Madam Speaker , I come to the floor tonight with a heavy heart .
The nature of the allegations I make speaks poorly of this administration .
In my heart of hearts , I have always wanted this administration to succeed , but the issue at hand is of such magnitude that the American people need to know what is being done and what precedents are being set .
In my tenure as a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , both as chairman and ranking member of an investigative subcommittee , I have witnessed firsthand behavior by the Bush administration which I find deeply troubling .
The disdain and uncooperative nature that this administration has shown toward Congress , including Republican Members , is so egregious that I can no longer assume that it is simply bureaucratic incompetence or isolated mistakes .
Rather , I have come to the sad conclusion that this administration has intentionally obstructed Congress ' rightful and constitutional duties .
Tonight I will discuss some serious examples of this administration 's contemptuous disregard for the authority delegated to Congress by the Constitution .
This bad attitude has consistently manifested itself in a sophomoric resentment toward Congress ' constitutional role as an equal branch of government .
The result has been an executive branch too insecure to let Congress do its job , an executive branch that sees Congress , even when Republicans held the majority , as a rival and a spoiler , rather than as elected representatives of the American people playing a rightful role in establishing policy for our great country .
Unfortunately , when the President of the United States rejects the legitimacy of congressional prerogatives , there are serious consequences .
Tonight , I will provide examples of how this administration for the past 7 years has undercut congressional investigators , has lied to Members of Congress , and has forged ahead with secret deals in spite of efforts and pleas by Congress to be informed , if not involved .
In the last Congress , I was chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
In that capacity , I learned that in the time immediately leading up to the bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City , convicted Oklahoma City bomber and murderer Terry Nichols had been in Cebu City in the Philippines .
His stay in Cebu City coincided with another visitor to that city , al Qaeda 's terrorist leader Ramsey Yousef .
Interestingly , both Nichols and Yousef used similar bombs and methods just 2 years apart to blow up two American targets .
Yousef was the mastermind of the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 .
Nichols was a coconspirator in the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995 .
By the way , I would like to acknowledge that today happens to be the 15 - year anniversary of that first devastating attack on the World Trade Center .
These individuals , one American and one Arab , were responsible for planning two of the most lethal terrorist attacks on our countrymen in our history .
We are to believe that by coincidence they ended up in an off - the - beaten - track city in the Southern Philippines ?
One does n't have to be a conspiracy nut to understand that this coincidence is certainly worth looking into .
I started an official congressional investigation sanctioned by Henry Hyde , then the chairman of the International Relations Committee , to see whether Terry Nichols or his accomplice , Timothy McVeigh , had foreign help in their murderous terrorist bombing of the Alfred Murrah Building in Oklahoma City .
In light of the fact that Terry Nichols and Ramsey Yousef were both in Cebu City at the same time prior to hauntingly similar terrorist attacks , it was no stretch for a congressional investigative committee to be looking into this matter .
However , the Bush administration felt quite differently .
To those I had to deal with , it was ``case closed , do n't bother us . ''
They had looked into the matter , and Congress should simply and blindly accept their conclusion that there was no Nichols - Yousef connection .
`` Do n't bother us . ''
This was at times bureaucratic laziness , and at other times it was clearly based on a disdain for congressional investigations and authority .
During my investigation , I secured Ramsey Yousef 's cell phone records .
The records were part of the phone calls that he made when he was in that New York City area in the months just prior to the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 .
The phone records show that Ramsey Yousef made at least two phone calls to a row house in Queens , New York . [ [ Page H1066 ] ]
That row house was occupied by the cousin of Terry Nichols ' Filipina wife .
Let me repeat that .
The terrorist bomber of the first World Trade Center attack , the nephew of al Qaeda 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammad , made phone calls to the same row house that was occupied by Terry Nichols ' cousins - in - law just 2 months before he exploded the bomb in the garage of the World Trade Center 15 years ago .
Another coincidence ?
I gave this information to the Department of Justice and since that time have repeatedly sought their help in investigating this matter .
Time after time , my requests have gone unanswered or have just been flatly denied .
I also asked the Department of Justice on numerous occasions to help me investigate the name Samir Khahil .
This name is on a list of unindicted co-conspirators of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , again in connection with Ramsey Yousef .
It also is the name , by the way , of an Iraqi man in Oklahoma City who at the time of the Oklahoma City bombing employed an Arab immigrant who fits the description originally made by numerous witnesses as to John Doe II .
This Oklahoma - based Iraqi lied , meaning the John Doe II look - alike , lied to the investigators about his whereabouts at the time of the Oklahoma City bombing , yet there was little if any follow - up on this John Doe II look - alike .
In fact , the FBI simply declared that John Doe II never existed .
The existence of John Doe II , let it be remembered , was based on a sketch and sketches derived from witnesses on the scene of the Oklahoma City bombing and the truck rental company in which that bomb was placed on a truck from that truck rental company .
Those witnesses described a man who , as I say , looked very much like Samir Khahil 's employee .
Now , I have repeatedly asked the Department of Justice to tell me if the Samir Khahil on the unindicted coconspirators list of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing is the same Samir Khahil who employed a man originally identified as John Doe II , the bomber , the number two bomber in the Oklahoma City bombing .
The Justice Department 's answer : `` It would be too burdensome to find out if it was the same man . ''
Further , we asked help in finding the Arab immigrant who looked like John Doe II and the man who was employed by Samir Khahil .
We traced him to Boston , but we have had no support or cooperation in finding this very possible terrorist , or at least terrorist suspect .
He may well have been working at Boston 's Logan Airport on 9/11/01 , the day that a plane took off from that airport and was hijacked and crashed into the World Trade Center .
Another weird coincidence to the Oklahoma City bombing .
Another coincidence , yes .
You do n't have to be a conspiracy nut to believe that these things should be investigated .
Instead , there has been no follow - through , no interest .
The case is closed , forget it , both in terms of Samir Khahil and his Iraqi employer and employee ; and both of these people , of course , reside in the United States right now .
That is just a small taste of the deplorable lack of cooperation for a legitimate congressional investigation .
And it was no fluke .
I did n't just happen to snag some uncooperative Federal employee .
No , this is the level of non-cooperation Congress has learned to expect from this administration .
Yes , Departments and agencies do have limited resources , and I understand that .
I used to work in the executive branch .
So , yes , there may be some better uses for and some good uses for those limited resources and better uses for their time and investigators , rather than just following up on leads that are provided by Members of Congress .
{time} 1715
You can hear someone explaining that .
But the lack of cooperation that we have had goes far beyond the fact that they are not going to give their limited resources or even use some of their investigators to track down what most of us would consider a very worthwhile lead , especially considering that the terrorist that we are asking to look into currently resides in the United States and may well have had something to do with the bombing of the World Trade Center and the bombing of the Oklahoma City building there .
But , again , a lot of my requests do n't require a lot of time and effort on the part of the executive branch , and I still have been stonewalled .
For the past year , for example , I have repeatedly requested to interview the imprisoned terrorist Ramzi Yousef .
He is in Colorado and in strict lockup .
He has been there for 10 years .
This would have taken no time and no resources from any executive branch or Federal employee .
None .
This request is well within my committee 's jurisdiction as ranking member of the Investigative Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee .
This request has been supported by the chairman of the Investigative Subcommittee , the chairman of the full Foreign Affairs Committee , the chairman of the Judiciary Committee , and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee .
Such attention by Congress should be welcomed by this administration and every administration .
The legislative branch can help bring new information to light and inform the public .
Nevertheless , the Department of Justice , consistent with its treatment of congressional inquiries during the tenure of this President , has dismissed this valid request .
This request has been treated with what can only be described as contempt and condescension .
The point is , unfortunately , that this rejectionist attitude is typical .
It is not that they do n't have enough resources to help out , to look into an easy matter to look into .
It is just that they do not want to cooperate with Congress , even when it 's a Republican in Congress , even when the Congress was controlled by a Republican majority .
So , why would this administration obstruct congressional inquiries such as this ?
Remember , Ramzi Yousef was the mastermind behind several devastating terrorist attacks and plots against America .
He led the first murderous attack on the World Trade Center in 1993 , as I say .
After fleeing to the Philippines , he and two other terrorists plotted to kill thousands of Americans by blowing up 12 commercial airliners over the Pacific at the same time .
It was known as the Bojinka plot .
It was within 2 weeks of being executed when it was discovered and thwarted by Philippine police .
Interestingly , the terrorist operation , the Bojinka plot , was to take place about the same time as the Oklahoma City Federal building bombing , perhaps on the same day .
We do n't know .
Perhaps we should know .
Perhaps we should ask Ramzi Yousef about that .
Ramzi Yousef has been in Federal prison for over a decade .
He is a prisoner with a unique understanding of the al Qaeda terrorist structure .
He is the nephew of Khalid Sheik Mohammed , the mastermind of the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center .
In 2006 , when I was the chairman of the House Oversight Investigations Subcommittee on the Foreign Affairs Committee , I was investigating Yousef 's movements and activities not only in the United States but in the Philippines .
I even traveled to the Philippines to question authorities who had captured Yousef 's roommate and coconspirator in the Bojinka plot .
In spite of that fact and in spite of the fact that I was looking into Yousef 's terrorist activities and in spite of the fact that I had obtained new information about Yousef 's phone calls right here in the United States and new information about his associates while he was in the United States , the Department of Justice still dismisses the effort and , more than that , they are obstructing a legitimate congressional investigation , refusing to permit this elected Member of Congress , a ranking member of a congressional investigating committee , to interview a Federal prisoner .
They refused access to Yousef claiming that there is a ``ongoing investigation . ''
This prisoner has been in jail for over 10 years .
It is more likely that what we have here is an ongoing coverup and not an ongoing investigation .
In fact , I have been told recently by a former member of the Justice Department that they were told routinely simply to give answers that there is an ongoing investigation even if no ongoing investigation was underway , but simply using it as a phrase to dismiss a request from Congress . [ [ Page H1067 ] ]
Well , this is outrageous , but it 's typical of this administration .
This is a lot more than just a hurtful pride on my part of being turned down .
This administration is setting a terrible precedent .
What people have to understand , when I am turned down like this , is when there is a liberal Democrat in the White House , the President will have set that Members of Congress can simply be dismissed , and that when they are trying to do a congressional investigation need not be cooperated with , in fact , can be obstructed .
Is that the type of President that we want ?
Is that acceptable ?
It should n't be acceptable to Democrats and it should n't be acceptable to Republicans .
Does n't Congress have a right to talk to Federal prisoners .
Are these the rules of engagement ?
Is it really the rules of engagement that we want for our government that Members of Congress and the legislative branch do n't have a right to talk to Federal prisoners ?
Well , that 's apparently what the Bush administration is trying to establish as the executive authority , as executive authority , the right to deny congressional investigators access to Federal prisoners .
The danger of this should be easy to understand , both on my side of the aisle , the Republican side , and the Democratic side of the aisle .
Again , the attitude , apparent in the treatment of this request , is not an aberration or is it some sort of situation where this is not really a representative way the President has acted with his authority .
No , I am afraid that 's not the case .
This request was first made and denied when the Republicans controlled the Congress and I was the chairman of the Investigative Subcommittee .
Now Congress has a Democrat majority .
In my position as ranking member of the International Organizations , Human Rights , and Oversight Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , I have seen it time and time again .
Our subcommittee chairman , Bill Delahunt from Massachusetts , read in the newspaper that our President is negotiating a security agreement with the Iraqi Prime Minister that will govern the future relationship of our countries .
Now let me say that again .
The chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs Committee is getting the information about a hugely important foreign bilateral security agreement by reading the newspaper .
So , Chairman Delahunt conducted a hearing about the status of such an agreement and invited the administration to send a witness to testify before Congress .
How did the administration respond ?
They ignored the request .
So the hearing was held with a private panel of witnesses , and , yes , the public has a right and an obligation to fully understand such commitments that are being made by the President in our name .
In a democratic society , policy is made after having an open dialogue .
George Bush was elected President , not king .
In another attempt last month , our subcommittee held another hearing on the Iraqi security agreement and , again , our panel invited and pleaded with the administration to provide a witness .
Their response ?
Silence .
Our subcommittee held another , a third hearing on this topic .
Again , our subcommittee invited the administration to attend and explain to Congress what kind of commitment our government has agreed to with the government of Iraq .
Even our full committee chairman wrote letters asking for the administration to participate in the subcommittee hearing .
All the requests to the administration by our committee and by the superiors in the full committee were ignored , except for one , and , in one instance , where the contact was made , and I am sad to say that once again this administration was less than honest on a matter of national importance , Chairman Dela - hunt 's subcommittee was told by a White House staffer that the administration 's unwillingness to participate in hearings was because ``There is nothing to talk about because we have n't put pen to paper ' ' on security , because they have n't put the pen to paper on the security agreement , supposedly .
Well , when confronted with the fact that the New York Times had written a story saying that a 17 - page agreement was being passed around , this White House staffer backtracked and quibbled .
This is unacceptable , it 's dishonest , and it 's typical .
It 's like saying there is an ongoing investigation ; do n't discuss anything anymore with me .
There is nothing going on here .
Now , there is something going on , just as , instead of talking and trying to negotiate about what type of spokesman we could have at a hearing , instead , what we get is an undermining of the congressional right to oversee for the foreign policy decisions of this administration .
This stonewalling prevailed until a few weeks ago , when Condoleezza Rice , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , a person and a leader who I deeply admire , testified at a hearing of the full International Relations Committee .
When asked about this issue , about witnesses not showing up from the State Department and this administration to explain to us in public and to discuss in public these very important agreements that are being negotiated with Iraq , she pledged at that time that there would be future witnesses dealing with this Iraqi agreement .
At least Condoleezza Rice , the Secretary of State , feels secure enough in this administration to do what 's right and to talk directly to Congress and to send her people over to talk to us .
Unfortunately , we had to go all the way to the Secretary of State before we could get anybody in this administration to participate .
Let me note , I am a supporter of the President 's Iraqi policies .
I have been a supporter since day one .
I supported the surge , and I am not in favor of some of the propositions made by my friends on the other side of the aisle , which I consider would be a precipitous leaving of Iraq and would cause damage , I believe .
But that 's not the point .
The point is , Congress has a legitimate oversight responsibility and that the President of the United States should be discussing in public so that the public could understand why policy is being made rather than trying to secretly arrange a policy agreement and then surprise everybody , you know , as a done deal .
Sadly , this administration 's antipathy to the constitutional responsibilities of the legislative branch of government does not stop and end with my efforts and those of my subcommittee on investigations .
In October of last year , 22 of my colleagues and I wrote to the Acting Attorney General , Peter Keisler , regarding the pending lie detector test for former National Security Advisor Sandy Berger .
Madam Speaker , I submit for the Record , a copy of a letter concerning making that request of Acting Attorney General Peter Keisler .
Washington , DC , October 10 , 2007 .
Mr. Peter D. Keisler , Acting Attorney General , Department of Justice , Washington , DC .
Dear Acting Attorney General Keisler : In 2005 , former Clinton National Security Advisor Sandy Berger pled guilty to the mishandling and destruction of classified documents .
He admitted to entering the National Archives and unlawfully removing , then subsequently destroying , classified documents dealing with terrorist related issues .
He removed the documents by stuffing them down his pants and in his suit jacket , presumably with the intention of getting rid of any damning evidence showing his involvement in the failure of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to prevent the Sept.
11th attacks prior to his testimony before the 911 Commission .
These documents have never been recovered .
As part of a plea deal , Mr. Berger agreed to take a polygraph test to be administered by the Department of Justice .
It has been two years since that agreement and Mr. Berger has yet to fulfill his obligation .
We are writing to officially request that as Attorney General you direct the Department of Justice without any further delay to administer a lie detector test to Mr. Berger and determine what documents were stolen and how our National Security was compromised .
The Congress , and the American people , deserve to know the facts of this crime and what Mr. Berger was covering up .
Therefore we respectfully request a directive be issued by your office ordering Mr. Berger to surrender to the Justice Department immediately and that a polygraph test be administered forthwith .
Sincerely , Dana Rohrabacher , Member of Congress .
In 2005 , Sandy Berger pled guilty to the mishandling and destruction of [ [ Page H1068 ] ] classified documents .
He admitted that he unlawfully removed and subsequently destroyed classified documents from the National Archives .
These documents dealt with the failure of our intelligence agencies during the Clinton administration to prevent the horrendous attacks on 9/11 .
As part of his plea , Mr. Berger agreed to a lie detector test which was given by the Department of Justice .
This would determine what documents had been stolen by Mr. Berger .
We are still waiting for that test to be administered .
As a member , as a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , I was and still am rightfully concerned about the length of time between his crime and the administration of his lie detector test .
So on October 10 , 2007 , I sent a letter , that letter signed by 22 of my colleagues , asking the Department of Justice why the test had not been administered .
On October 22 , 2007 , my office received a form letter acknowledging the DOJ 's receipt of our inquiry .
It was signed with an illegible signature .
We have no idea who signed it .
All we know is that he or she penned it ``for '' next to a printed name Brian Benczkowski .
Principally , he is the principal Deputy Assistant Secretary General .
{time} 1730
We were also given a tracking number so we could track any future correspondence .
In spite of that fact , we received a computer - generated response and a tracking number to an official congressional inquiry , okay , signed by 23 Members of Congress .
We had hoped that we would actually have an answer to our request and that there would actually be a human being rather than a tracking number that we could look to .
Well , we got our wish and we got a letter back .
On January 24 , 2008 , 94 days after the letter , we received a response , and I submit the response for the Record .
Department of Justice , Office of Legislative Affairs , Washington , DC , January 24 , 2008 .
Hon. Dana Rohrbacher , House of Representatives , Washington , DC .
Dear Congressman Rohrbacher :
This is in response to your letter , dated October 10 , 2007 , in which you requested that the Department of Justice administer a polygraph examination to Mr. Samuel Berger , who pleaded guilty in April 2005 , to violations of federal law relating to the removal of copies of classified documents from the National Archives .
We appreciate your interest and have enclosed a copy of our letter , dated February 16 , 2007 , to the Honorable Henry A. Waxman , Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , advising him of our views regarding the Minority Staff Report that was issued regarding this matter .
As stated in our response to Chairman Waxman , we believe that there are no facts that would justify a polygraph of Mr. Berger at this time .
We are sending an identical response to the other Members who joined in your letter to us .
Please do not hesitate to contact this office if you would like additional assistance regarding this or any other matter .
Sincerely , Brian A. Benczkowski , Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General .
The letter was dismissive and said that the DOJ found no reason to issue a polygraph test to Sandy Berger , and attached was an old letter the DOJ had sent to Chairman Waxman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee almost a year before our correspondence .
The letter this time was signed by Brian Benczkowski .
Madam Speaker , I have been a Member of Congress for 19 years .
I have never seen such a pattern of blatant disregard and outright disdain for Members of Congress .
If Sandy Berger is not to be polygraphed to verify the documents that were stolen from the Archives , we need to know why such verification is not being done .
This administration would n't even give a respectable answer to the rightful inquiry of Members of Congress of why we are not verifying through a polygraph test what documents were stolen from the National Archives by the former National Security Adviser .
On the one hand , this President believes he has a right to make demands on us .
The President said in his State of the Union address that Congress must act on certain issues .
We must do as he wishes .
We must pass legislation he deems necessary .
Yet while 23 Members of Congress write his Justice Department a serious letter of inquiry about a national security issue , we get a computer - generated form letter and a copy of an old response to a different inquiry .
The bad attitude I am detailing is pervasive .
The handling of a proposed totalization agreement with Mexico is again yet another example .
The totalization agreements , and totalization agreements are not necessarily a bad thing , they can serve a useful function .
Large corporations both in the United States and abroad often assign people to work in an overseas office for several years .
During these years , employers are double taxed .
They pay both Social Security and the equivalent tax in their native countries .
Allowing the Social Security Administration and foreign agencies to give credit under one system towards retirement makes sense if there are a limited number of people involved and the people who are involved in this are working here legally and temporarily .
The concept itself is not alarming .
However , this is emphatically not the case with Mexico .
We have millions of Mexican citizens living illegally in the United States .
This is not a limited number of Swedish or Japanese executives who will only work here for a number of years and then go home .
Not only are Mexicans not going to return to Mexico ; the Mexican Government encourages them to stay in the United States .
After all , if the U.S. is going to pay for their health care , their education and now their retirement , why should Mexico be bothered .
Knowing the volatility of the American people on both the Social Security and illegal immigration issues , the totalization negotiations with Mexico were kept totally under wraps .
Now remember , these negotiations with Mexico started in 2002 with a Republican - controlled Congress .
One would think that a Republican administration would at the very least advise Congress , perhaps giving a status report , concerning such diplomatic efforts as the totalization negotiations with Mexico .
Well , Congress did not know the details until it hit the press .
Worse , these press releases on the agreement , put out by the administration , were misleading and it appears that Congress was being misled as to just what the administration had agreed to concerning Social Security benefits for Mexican nationals illegally working in the United States .
Now , I have proposed legislation to ensure that no work done while someone is in this country illegally should be counted towards a Social Security benefit .
The administration apparently agreed in the totalization agreement negotiations that illegal aliens from Mexico will be eligible for the same treatment under Social Security as U.S. citizens without ever becoming a legal resident or citizen .
It took a long , drawn - out legal battle in the form of a Freedom of Information lawsuit to get the details of this agreement from the administration .
Again , stonewalling and concealment , whether it deals with Iraq or whether it deals with a totalization agreement dealing with Social Security rights for the people from Mexico who come to our country illegally .
In both cases , regardless of how you feel about the Iraq policies or Social Security for illegal immigrants into our country , the point is we should not be keeping this debate secret .
Congress has a right to oversee such agreements , and we should have a public dialogue about these types of decisions .
This administration has , as I am pointing out , a history of concealment and in some cases of distorting and actually not telling us the truth about what is going on with these negotiations and agreements that are happening behind closed doors .
Once Congress and the public found out about the agreement in the totalization agreement , a fire storm broke out not just about giving illegals Social Security but about keeping it secret from Congress .
Yes , as I said , Congress , as well as America 's seniors , have every right to know if the President of the United States is in the process of signing an agreement to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants .
It is something we should discuss .
It is not something where the [ [ Page H1069 ] ]
President should try to make an agreement behind closed doors .
In this case the administration is undermining the public 's right to know and the Congress is being left in the dark .
And please remember , the danger from this agreement is not past .
Due to the public outrage , it has been put on the back burner , but the President at any time can submit this agreement to Congress even if he has not detailed it for us now so we can discuss it .
What I am describing is a pattern of arrogance and contempt , and that is especially true not just with Social Security but with broader issues relating to illegal immigration and on issues dealing with Mexico .
The tragic case of wrongly imprisoned Border Patrol agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean exemplifies the worst aspects of this administration 's attitude problem , and will forever leave a black mark on this administration .
President Bush has himself made decisions that directly led to the ongoing tragedy which sees these two Border Patrol agents languishing in solitary confinement ; and that 's where they are today , in solitary confinement , being treated worse than we treat the terrorists in Guantanamo .
That is where we are now .
That is what they have had to endure in that solitary confinement for over a year .
Now , this is clearly a questionable case , but President Bush has deliberately dug in his heels to protect his good friend and young protege , the prosecutor , U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton .
Rather than entertain the probability that a terrible injustice was in progress and instruct the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security to cooperate so Congress could get to the bottom of this nightmare , this President has thumbed his nose at the congressional concerns and initiated a policy of obstruction and denial in terms of Ramos and Compean .
Since the Ramos and Compean case was brought to my attention in September 2006 , I have written over a dozen letters to this administration requesting various documents regarding the harsh prosecution of Ramos and Compean .
I have been joined by several other Members of Congress in this effort , including Congressmen Poe , Culberson , and McCaul .
These three Members of Congress , in fact , attended a briefing on Ramos and Compean 's prosecution by the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General 's Office on September 26 , 2006 .
In that briefing , serious questions were raised by these three Members about the fundamental justification for this prosecution to begin with .
The President and his lap - dog prosecutors would like us to believe that they have no discretion , but these Members of Congress who have long histories in the law and in prosecution , they know .
They could see there was something wrong because we know that the actual charges being brought against Ramos and Compean , and they were fully aware of this because these Members of Congress , as I said , have a big background in law , they knew that what charges were being brought were totally at the discretion of the prosecutors .
The prosecution 's hands were not tied .
What were the grounds for charging these men with crimes like attempted murder , assault with a deadly weapon , the unlawful discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence , and a Federal civil rights violation ?
These charges that could have put Ramos and Compean in prison for 10 - 20 years were totally at the discretion of the prosecution .
Did this fit the crime ?
If there was any crime at all that was committed , why would they be charged with this overwhelming attack by the prosecution knowing that by making these charges these men are going to end up being put away for one or two decades of their life .
These two Border Patrol agents had wounded a fleeing illegal alien drug smuggler who was escaping after assaulting one of the officers who had intercepted the drug dealer during an attempt to bring $ 1 million worth of drugs into this country .
Although they were never intended by Congress to be applied in this way , the gun laws which were applied by the prosecution , the gun law of mandatory prison sentence , was applied to the law enforcement officers in this case , and these law enforcement officers had made a split - second decision to discharge their weapons .
Is that right ?
Is n't there some question about that , considering they threw the book at these guys ?
The prosecutors knew that it was not the intent of Congress that they should be charging law enforcement officers with split - second decisions in the discharge of a weapon ; but they threw the book at the agents , including the charges that required tens of years of mandatory imprisonment .
Again , it was at their discretion that they made these charges .
When Congressmen Poe , Culberson , and McCaul asked why the most serious charges that could be leveled at the Border Patrol agents were initiated by the prosecutors , and why the prosecutors took the word of the drug dealer that he had no weapon rather than the word of the law enforcement officers , the DHS officials , briefing these Congressmen , assured them that this was a legitimate and righteous prosecution .
These were , according to the DHS briefing given to these Members of Congress , these were rogue cops .
Ramos and Compean were rogue cops , and the Congressmen were told they actually confessed that they knew that the drug smuggler was unarmed and that the agents did n't really feel threatened .
And the biggest lie of all , the Department of Homeland Security briefer insisted that Ramos and Compean had told fellow officers the day of the incident that they ``wanted to shoot a Mexican '' that day .
That charge raised eyebrows considering that the accused , Ignacio Ramos and Jose Compean , are themselves Mexican Americans married to Mexican American wives with Mexican American children .
Sure , they just go out and intentionally shoot some Mexicans that day .
Sure .
This is what Members of Congress were told in an official briefing .
Asking for proof , the three Congressmen who were being briefed were told that the charges were documented in the reports of the investigative officers .
The Department of Homeland Security briefer promised to provide this proof that Ramos and Compean had actually intended that day to go out and ``kill a Mexican . ''
Of course , the proof never came .
The Congressmen kept asking .
Calls were n't returned .
The Department of Homeland Security stalled for 5 months .
Members asked for copies of the completed report of investigation which should have backed up the alleged facts that were told to Members during the September 26 briefing to the Members of Congress .
Months passed , and nothing more .
Just months passed .
Nothing from the Department of Homeland Security .
Several letters and public pressure arose , and the Department of Homeland Security finally released a redacted version of the official report of investigation in February 2007 .
And surprise , surprise , the alleged confession of Ramos and Compean was nowhere to be found in that document .
The documentation of the charge that they had brazenly proclaimed their intent to kill a Mexican was not there .
But that charge was repeated over and over again .
How could this be ?
How could the Department of Homeland Security officials , how could they assure Members this was a solid prosecution and that evidence existed that Ramos and Compean were guilty and they wanted to shoot a Mexican ?
These were flat out lies told to Members of Congress who were being officially briefed by this administration .
During a Department of Homeland Security subcommittee hearing on February 6 , 2007 , DHS Inspector General Richard Skinner was questioned by Congressman Culberson about this issue .
Under oath Skinner acknowledged the information given to the Texas Congressman was in fact false , but he smugly justified his blatant and willful lying by calling it ``mischaracterization unfortunately repeated at the briefing . '' {time} 1745 No , Mr. Skinner , it was a lie , no matter how colorful the euphemism .
Ollie North was prosecuted on a charge far less egregious than what we 're talking about now .
Ollie North gave , or so it was alleged , misinformation to congressional staffers who were not part of an official briefing of Members of Congress ; yet , he was prosecuted .
[ [ Page H1070 ] ]
This administration ends up lying in a briefing to Congress and shrugs it off .
To this day , absolutely nothing has been done about this crime .
And yes , lying to Congress , especially about an issue of this magnitude , is a crime .
Administration officials deliberately misled Members of Congress in order to discourage them from pursuing the Ramos and Compean case , and no one has been held accountable for this crime .
The Ramos and Compean case has stunk since day one .
The President , instead of looking into the matter , which he should have done , has dug in his heels , permitting his appointees to slander these two agents .
Even worse , the President has personally made decisions that have resulted in these two agents languishing in solitary confinement .
They are in solitary confinement because of decisions made directly by the President of the United States .
U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton publicly labeled Ramos and Compean as corrupt ; yet , again , when asked for some sort of justification on this , what corruption charges were brought against these people , there were no charges of corruption .
To say that this is a mean - spirited and vindictive prosecution is to put it mildly .
This case demonstrates why hearings are an integral part of the check - and - balance system created by our Founding Fathers .
It is in this venue that the executive branch is held accountable for their actions .
Under oath , it was only when an administration official was under oath that the lies about Ramos and Compean were admitted .
But this administration has decided to thumb its nose at that obligation and has decided not to make its case under oath at a public hearing and , instead , has actually said things , as I say , calling Ramos and Compean corrupt in radio interviews and such .
Chairman William Delahunt graciously approved my request to hold hearings on the Ramos and Compean case .
In doing so , an official subcommittee investigation into the case in preparation for the hearing was authorized .
During the course of this investigation , the resistance from the Department of Justice , Homeland Security , and State was consistent with the arrogance and obfuscation that flows through this administration from the top down .
Our hearing had to be postponed for months because of the administration 's refusal to provide documents or to send the necessary witnesses to testify before the subcommittee , citing that the committee did not have proper jurisdiction ; therefore , the U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton , the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Skinner , or any of his other investigators need not appear .
That decision was clearly made by the White House .
Our Government provided a flawed immunity agreement , free health care , unconditional border crossing cards to an illegal alien criminal drug smuggler in exchange for his testimony that sent Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean to prison .
Our Government kept secrets from the jury that the drug dealer intercepted by Ramos and Compean had hauled another shipment of drugs across the border , this , while on a Government - issued border crossing pass .
Clearly , this is well within the jurisdiction of an oversight investigative committee responsible for overseeing relations with other countries , including Mexico , and including international drug smuggling .
Clearly , the public has a right to know about these things .
This administration apparently believes there is no obligation to answer questions in public and under oath about the actions or policies of the administration .
And in preparation for that hearing , we made a request , and request after request , countless phone calls , and even a freedom of information lawsuit by a watchdog group , Judicial Watch , and the administration still refuses to release copies of the border crossing cards that were issued to the drug smuggler in this case .
Of course , they are claiming , when we make this request about these cards issued to the drug smuggler that permitted him to freely go across the border , they say that the drug smuggler is protected under , get this , ``the privacy act . ''
This is what the Justice Department tells us .
I was instructed by the Justice Department to obtain a privacy waiver in order that that information be released , a privacy waiver for an illegal alien criminal .
This is absurd and just another example of the condescending and dismissive attitude .
This type of obstructionism , however , is the rule , not the exception , of this administration .
By the way , due to a bureaucratic fluke , the border crossing cards , we actually got a hold of them , and this is how we have learned that this person that was involved with the Ramos and Compean event actually took a second shipment of drugs .
I submit for the Record the letters and copies of these exchanges with the administration .
Congress of the United States , House of Representatives , Washington , DC , September 12 , 2006 .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , Department of Justice , Washington , DC .
Dear Attorney General Gonzales :
We are writing to you as members of Congress with deep concern over the Justice Department 's wrongheaded prosecution of two U.S. Border Patrol agents who were simply doing their jobs to protect our homeland .
Agents Ignacio Ramos and Jose Alonso Compean should have been commended by our government for their actions last year in attempting to apprehend a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border .
But because of an incomprehensible prosecution by the U.S. Attorney 's Office -- including granting full immunity to the smuggler so he could testify against our agents -- these men may soon receive 20 - year prison sentences for firing shots at the fleeing smuggler , who they believed carried a gun .
The smuggler -- who received complete medical care at William Beaumont Army Medical Center in El Paso , Texas -- is now suing the Border Patrol for $ 5 million for violating his civil rights !
The Justice Department 's unjust prosecution does nothing but tie the hands of our Border Patrol and prevent them from securing America against a flood of illegal immigrants , drugs , counterfeit goods and quite possibly , terrorists .
This demoralizing prosecution puts the rights of illegal alien drug smugglers ahead of our homeland security and undermines the critical mission of better enforcing our immigration laws .
The convictions against these agents demand oversight .
Due to significant concerns over the circumstances surrounding the prosecution of Agents Ramos and Compean , the House Judiciary Committee has already recognized the need for a thorough review of this case by calling for Congressional hearings and an investigation of the Department of Homeland Security , Office of the Inspector General , U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and the U.S. Attorney 's Office .
Mr. Gonzales , we strongly urge the Department of Justice to postpone the sentencing of Agents Ramos and Compean , and to reopen their case for a fuller investigation of the facts .
Sincerely , Walter B. Jones , Tom Tancredo , Ted Poe , Charlie Norwood , Ernest Istook , Dana Rohrabacher , Sue Myrick , Virginia Foxx , John Duncan , Barbara Cubin , Jim Ryun , Virgil Goode , Ginny Brown - Waite , Gary G. Miller , Kenny Marchant , Ed Whitfield , Ed Rover , Dan Burton , Robin Hayes , Henry Brown , John Campbell , Michael Bilirakis , Members of Congress .
____ Department of Justice , Office of Legislative Affairs , Washington , DC , February 16 , 2007 .
Hon. Henry A. Waxman , Chairman , Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , House of Representatives , Washington , DC .
Dear Chairman Waxman :
This letter responds to concerns expressed in the January 9 , 2006 , Minority Staff Report , ``Sandy Berger 's Theft of Classified Documents : Unanswered Questions '' ( `` the Report ' ' ) .
The Report alleges failures in the Department 's handling of the Berger investigation .
We have reviewed the Report and respectfully disagree with its characterization of the Department 's investigation .
The Department 's investigation began when we were first advised of Berger 's actions by the National Archives and Records Administration Inspector General ( IG ) on October 15 , 2003 , almost two weeks after Archives staff and agents of the IG had begun their own investigation of the incident .
The Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) devoted significant resources to the task , including prosecutors and FBI Special Agents trained in the investigation of national security cases .
The FBI conducted over 50 interviews , made inspections of the Archives facilities , and reviewed thousands of pages of documents , in addition to other law enforcement efforts .
We examined Mr. Berger 's conduct during all four of his visits to the Archives .
The Report suggests that the Department did not inquire about Mr. Berger 's first two visits to the Archives , citing the IG 's recollection that the Department had informed the IG in April 2004 that the Department had not questioned Mr. Berger about his May 2002 and July 2003 visits .
This suggestion appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the sequence of the Department 's investigation .
As of April 2004 , the Department had [ [ Page H1071 ] ] not yet asked Mr. Berger any questions , as he had not yet agreed to an interview .
When the Department did subsequently interview Mr. Berger , the Department questioned him regarding all of his visits .
Furthermore , the Department questioned every witness with knowledge of Mr. Berger 's visits about all of his visits .
Neither Mr. Berger nor any other witness provided the Department with evidence that Mr. Berger had taken any documents beyond the five referenced in the plea agreement .
In this , as in all criminal investigations , the Department 's obligation was to gather the available testimonial and documentary evidence and then rigorously put that evidence to the test -- often pitting the memory of witnesses against the written record supplied by the documents -- in order to determine as accurate a picture as possible of what transpired .
In this case , as in others , some of the initial allegations did not withstand further analysis .
For example , the Report suggests that the Department did not give sufficient weight to the accounts of Mr. Berger 's activities provided by Archives staff , most notably the e- mail sent on September 2 , 2003 , from Official A to Senior Official 1 .
In this e-mail , Official A described an encounter with Mr. Berger that day in which he saw Mr. Berger ``fiddling with something white which looked to be a piece of paper or multiple pieces of paper '' down by his ankle .
The Department was fully aware of this e-mail , and knew that Berger had in fact removed his notes and a document on the visit of September 2 , 2003 .
The e-mail was a significant piece of information that the Department appropriately investigated .
The account described in the e-mail was evaluated in conjunction with Official A's interview with the IG 's agents on October 15 , 2003 , conducted before the Department was involved in the case .
The recording and transcript of the interview with the IG's Agents were reviewed in full in the course of our investigation .
According to the IG 's recorded interview , Official A repeatedly stated that the interaction was ``very quick ' ' and he could not be certain what he saw .
Further , Official A told the IG's Agents , ``I could not , um , you know , swear that what I saw was documents , but it certainly unnerved me enough . ''
Later , Official A was asked by the IG 's agents how he was feeling and he responded , ``very unsettled .
I mean , it 's , it 's unsettled but at the same time I mean , not , not unsettled in the way that I 'm a hundred percent sure of what I 've seen and , and I 'm sick , just like , did I see what , what I , you know possibly could . . .
There was a certain grey area in my mind and whether this was actually a document , a piece of paper . ''
When Official A was interviewed later by the FBI on October 17 , 2003 , he once again expressed uncertainty about what he saw , diminishing further the probative value of his e-mail .
The e-mail , and Official A's interviews with the IG 's agents and the FBI , had to be further weighed against the evidence that after the e-mail was sent and after Official A discussed with Senior Official 1 what he saw , Senior Official 1 contacted a supervisor , but the Archives staff did not confront Mr. Berger , did not search him , and did not contact any security or law enforcement officials .
In light of these additional facts , the Report 's suggestion that the Department somehow failed to consider the full import of the e-mail and related information is unfounded .
The Department 's analysis of the other documentary and testimonial evidence in this case was similarly thorough .
And at the conclusion of its extensive investigation , the Department secured a guilty plea from Mr. Berger , pursuant to which he admitted to ``conceal [ing ] and remov[ing ] '' five copies of classified documents from the Archives , concealing them at his office , and ``cut[ ting ] three of the documents into small pieces and discard[ing ] them '' - - all in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1924 .
April 1 , 2005 Factual Basis for Plea at 2 .
The Department stands by its investigation and believes that this resolution was the best one possible in light of the available evidence , The Report also suggests that , as a result of Mr. Berger 's conduct , the 9 - 11 Commission may have been deprived of the information necessary to render its final report .
The Department , however , has no evidence indicating that this suggestion is accurate .
In the course of its investigation , the Department interviewed numerous witnesses who might have had knowledge of any missing items .
None of these witnesses , however , provided the Department with evidence that Mr. Berger 's conduct deprived the 9 - 11 Commission of information or documents .
Nor has the IG ever advised us -- either at the time of our investigation or at any time since -- of any evidence that Mr. Berger had taken any documents other than the five referenced in the plea agreement .
Thus , not the Department , the FBI , or the Archives IG has found any evidence that Mr. Berger took any documents other than the five referenced in the plea agreement .
The Department 's public statements made after Mr. Berger 's April 1 , 2005 , guilty plea reflected the results of its extensive investigation into this matter , and were based solely on the evidence gathered in that investigation and contained in the detailed factual statement -- the contents of which Mr. Berger admitted as a condition of his plea agreement .
Under the terms of his plea agreement , Mr. Berger must cooperate with the Archives IG and make himself available for any cooperation with the government .
Indeed , on July 8 , 2005 , after the plea and prior to sentencing , the IG , along with Department attorneys and FBI agents , also questioned Mr. Berger .
At this meeting , Mr. Berger was again questioned about all of his visits to the Archives , including those that occurred in May 2002 and July 2003 .
Again , Mr. Berger 's answers in this session were evaluated and compared to his previous answers and the vast amount of evidence collected in the investigation .
In light of Mr. Berger 's disclosures during an extensive interview in March 2005 and his acceptance , as part of his guilty plea , of a detailed factual basis for the charges against him , the judgment of the Department and the FBI was not to administer a polygraph examination to Mr. Berger .
The Department is aware of no new facts regarding the law enforcement aspects of this investigation to suggest that it should revisit that judgment .
In closing , I would like to emphasize that the Department 's silence with respect to certain other factual assertions and conclusions in the Report should not be mistaken for agreement .
Indeed , to cite but one additional example , the Department disagrees with both the manner in which certain of its employees were interviewed and the manner in which their statements to Committee staff were presented in the Report .
We nevertheless hope that this letter provides you assurance that the Department takes investigations regarding the mishandling of classified information and documents very seriously , and vigorously investigates and prosecutes those who endanger our national security .
We appreciate your attention to this matter .
Sincerely , Richard A. Heating , Acting Assistant Attorney General .
This is plea after plea from Members of Congress , I might add that even a majority of Members of Congress have voted for and supported on both sides of the aisle .
Chairman Delahunt of our Investigative Subcommittee knows that there 's something wrong with this case .
As I say , it stinks and has stunk from the beginning .
We have asked for the President to intervene on behalf of Ramos and Compean personally , either by pardoning or commuting their sentences .
These requests have been ignored over and over again .
And last year , I personally reached out to the President to take the pressure and confrontation out of this issue .
I suggested that the President direct the Department of Justice to request that Ramos and Compean be permitted to remain free on bond pending their appeal .
Even common criminals in our society are able to stay out pending appeal of a decision .
And what was the response ?
The White House released a press release the next day , it was issued the very next day , proclaiming that the administration opposes letting Ramos and Compean out pending appeal and that no special consideration would be granted to anyone .
Now , that 's a lot of holier than thou rhetoric , okay ?
So no special consideration was going to be given to anyone , much less these two Border Patrol agents .
Now , that sounds righteous , a position of not making any exceptions , except , of course , for the fact that a short time later , White House Aide Scooter Libby had his sentence commuted by the President in a heartbeat .
For the record , I found out , and let me just note , I believe that commuting Scooter Libby 's sentence was justified .
But it 's totally inconsistent with what we had been told of why Ramos and Compean could n't even be considered to let them out , even waiting , pending appeal .
Yeah , Scooter Libby got a raw deal .
But the fact is that what 's happening , what we see is only members of the President 's personal clique get such consideration .
It 's clear , that 's evident , and it 's disgraceful .
It is truly with a heavy heart , Madam Speaker , that I stand here reciting example after example of the maliciousness and condescending attitude exhibited by this administration .
It is a problem that 's flowing from the top .
When I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle accusing this administration of stonewalling , of coverups , or thwarting investigations , I sadly must concur with them .
Even though I may disagree with what the policy issue of the day is , I have to agree that Congress is not being treated with respect and that the President is engaged in obfuscating and in stonewalling of rightful requests by this body .
This White House exemplifies needless hostility , turf jealousy , and obstructionism .
The American people should know it and should know that these charges come not from a partisan [ [ Page H1072 ] ]
Democrat , but from a lifelong conservative Republican .
I have worked in the White House .
I worked for 7 years as a special assistant to President Ronald Reagan .
Ronald Reagan , as much as people can disagree or agree with the policies that he espoused , was a person who never acted arrogantly towards others .
He never , when he was giving State of the Union messages , never used the word ``must , '' never made demands .
And I think that President Reagan would not feel comfortable with the type of attitude that is exemplified in this administration .
He , instead , wanted to reach out to people and cooperate .
This administration seems to want to just bulldoze whoever gets in their way and does not have the human concern for other people , especially for people like Ramos and Compean , the little guys , that we saw in Ronald Reagan , which made him so popular and successful .
I would ask that the rest of my remarks be put into the Record .
Thank you very much for permitting me this hour .
And to the American people , I say , carefully consider who our leaders are going to be and carefully consider the issue of the day .
We have a wonderful democratic society .
There 's a balance of power here set up by our Founding Fathers .
And it 's important , whether you 're Republican or Democrat , that we maintain this balance of an authority , the legislative , executive , and judicial in this country , and we should not be setting precedents that the President of the United States has the lion 's share of the power in this great democracy of ours .
The power is rested in these three branches and in the people themselves .

Maybe Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton can sum up their policy differences in 30 seconds or less on Wednesday night .
They will have to if they are going to get their points across well on networks other than ABC , which is sponsoring the hotly anticipated Democratic debate that evening .
According to the usage guidelines circulated by ABC , other news organizations are only allowed to excerpt half a minute from the broadcast .
That means choosing only one 30 - second clip to use on television and the Web between 11 p.m. Wednesday and 5 a.m. Thursday .
ABC defends the restrictions as being “ very reasonable . ”
After all , ABC is footing the bill to stage the debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia .
“ We have an obligation to our West Coast affiliates to not make chunks of the debate available until their viewers have had a chance to see them , ” an ABC spokesman said .
By tape - delaying the debate for its West Coast television stations , the network seems to be treating the debate as a television show rather than as a live news event .
When cable news channels sponsor debates , they telecast the forums live across all time zones .
Indeed , the cable news channels may make it their business to skirt ABC ’s rules .
Fox News , CNN and MSNBC can be expected to use “ fair use ” justifications to show more clips from the debate , especially if the two candidates have a newsworthy exchange .

LAS VEGAS , Nevada ( CNN ) --
Officers who found the deadly poison ricin in a Las Vegas , Nevada , extended - stay hotel room also discovered firearms and an " anarchist - type textbook " with an entry about ricin bookmarked , police said Friday .
The deadly poison ricin and an " anarchist - type textbook " were found in a room in this Las Vegas hotel .
Two tests had confirmed the substance found was ricin , and that a man who was staying there has been hospitalized for more than two weeks and is in critical condition , police said Friday .
The 57 - year - old man , whose name was not released , summoned authorities February 14 and asked to be transported to a hospital because of difficulty breathing , Kathy Suey , deputy chief of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department , told reporters .
But police were not aware of the ricin's existence until Thursday , when a second man , who identified himself as a relative of the victim , went to the Extended Stay America room to clear the victim 's possessions out and found the substance .
That man brought the poison , which was in vials in a plastic bag , to the manager 's office , and police were notified .
" He felt it was something that required police attention , " said Las Vegas police Capt .
Joe Lombardo .
" He brought it to the management and said that ' I 'm not comfortable with whatever this item is . ' "
Watch how ricin can be used to kill »
Lombardo said police first were called to the room on Tuesday after weapons were discovered there .
He said officers discovered " general firearms , " which have been impounded , and an " anarchist - type textbook " marked at an entry on ricin .
The room was tested for ricin at that time but none was found , Lombardo said .
When officers returned Thursday , they found the ricin , but a test of the room showed it was not contaminated .

Can be inhaled , swallowed or injected

No antidote

Although seven people were checked as a precaution Thursday , all have been released , Suey said , and none is showing signs of ricin exposure .
Suey said police do not know if the man staying in the room manufactured the ricin , as he has been unable to speak to investigators .
" We do n't know an awful lot " about the victim , Suey said .
" For the last 12 hours , our efforts have been on the containment and cleanup of the area and areas where there could have been exposure .
...
We are now going forward with an investigation . "
A report from the Washington Regional Threat and Analysis Center said the FBI considers the discovery " criminal in nature with no nexus to terrorism . "
The report was sent to law enforcement agencies and was obtained by CNN .
Two Las Vegas labs confirmed the substance is ricin , Suey said .
However , the hotel room and other areas tested negative for the poison , police said in a statement issued by the Threat and Analysis Center .
Lombardo said a room at The Excalibur hotel was tested " as a precautionary measure " and found to be safe .

" At this point we feel extremely positive we have all the ricin involved and there is no terrorist threat , " Lombardo said .
Pets were also in the hotel room , Suey said .
Two of the animals were fine ; the third , an ailing dog , was euthanized after having been without food and water in the room for a week , she said .
Ricin is a toxin extracted from castor beans .
Several of the beans were also found in the room , Suey told reporters .
As little as 500 micrograms of ricin -- an amount the size of the head of a pin -- can kill an adult in three to five days , according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The poison can come in the form of a mist or a pellet and can be dissolved in water or weak acid , according to the CDC .
It has limited medical uses -- it can be used to kill cancer cells and destroy bone marrow cells .
The discovery of ricin typically alarms law enforcement agencies because authorities in several countries have investigated links between suspected extremists and ricin .
But Lombardo agreed with the assessment that the discovery is not considered a terror incident " at this point . "
He said ricin is not illegal to own , but is illegal if processed to be used for poisoning .
" This is a continuing investigation , " he told reporters Friday .
" We do n't know if the guy manufactured the ricin or not .
That 's our concern . "
CNN 's chief medical correspondent , Dr. Sanjay Gupta , said although a small amount can kill somebody if injected , tons of the substance would be needed to make it a mass terrorism tool .
He said there are three ways someone might be exposed to ricin : inhalation , ingestion and injection .
If it is inhaled , a person may develop fever , a cough , nausea , fluid in the lungs and organ failure .
There is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed , Gupta said .

The Wall Street Journal is to cut 50 journalist posts in a restructure to centralise the editing of the paper in print and online , its managing editor , Robert Thomson , has revealed in a memo to staff .
Most of the editorial cuts will come from the WSJ 's office in South Brunswick , New Jersey , which was set up following the September 11 terrorist attacks near the newspaper 's Manhattan headquarters .
However , Thomson said the WSJ and the newswire service of parent company Dow Jones , which was bought by News Corporation in December , were expanding their online and international operations .
This would create 95 new journalist jobs in the coming months .
" With the Journal 's new leadership team in place , we are reforming our editing structure and changing fundamentally the way in which we produce the Wall Street Journal in its manifold forms , " Thomson said , in a memo sent to staff in the US yesterday .
From the beginning of next month the " news hub " in the WSJ 's main New York office will be responsible for editing copy and producing pages for the print edition , the website and mobile platform .
" The reasons for these changes are strategic , even if some of the benefits are economic , " Thomson said .
He added that new editing desk jobs would be created so not all 50 staff affected are expected to leave .
" Staffers with the highest skill levels and the enthusiasm to acquire new skills will have a distinct advantage in the selection process , " Thomson said , adding that the restructure should be put in its " contemporary context " .
" In recent months , we have invested in a significantly larger newshole [ content output ] , contrary to the industry trend , and filled long - vacant reporting positions in many bureaux , " said Thomson .
" Our new budgets include an ambitious expansion to our web and international operations , both for the Journal and for newswires , where we are adding 95 journalists over the coming months , " he added .
He said there was " good reason for optimism " at Dow Jones " amidst the pessimism prevailing in our industry " .
Steven Yount , the president of the Independent Association of Publishers ' Employees , said the union has " serious questions " about whether the WSJ job cuts breach its contract with Dow Jones , according to a report in today 's Wall Street Journal Europe .
Thomson began a restructure of WSJ 's editorial management last month following the departure of deputy managing editor Laurie Hays to Bloomberg after 23 years .
The former editor of the Times joined the WSJ as publisher in December after News Corp successfully completed the $ 5.2bn ( £ 2.6 bn ) acquisition of parent company Dow Jones .
He was made the WSJ managing editor in May , taking over from Marcus Brauchli , who resigned in April .
Thomson is also editor - in - chief of Dow Jones ' newswires service .
Les Hinton , the former boss of News Corp 's UK newspaper subsidiary News International , is now chief executive of Dow Jones and publisher of the WSJ .
Separately , US newspaper the Atlanta Journal - Constitution yesterday announced that it will cut its work force by about 8 % , or 189 jobs , and eliminate all of its geographically targeted news sections as part of a cost - cutting plan .
AJC is owned by US media company Cox Enterprises , which has 83,000 employees and 2007 revenues of $ 15 bn ( £ 7.5 bn ) .
Cox claims that its newspaper operation is one of the 10 largest in the US consisting of 17 daily and 26 non -daily newspaper titles .
The company also owns 15 TV stations and 86 radio stations .

The title of this AP story is " Wife Pokes McCain In The Back "
Cindy McCain 's jab to her husband 's back came a second too late Tuesday to keep him from making a wisecrack about the health impact of Iran 's main import from the United States : cigarettes .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain was asked about an Associated Press report that $ 158 million in cigarettes have been shipped to Iran during George W. Bush 's presidency despite restrictions on U.S. exports to that country .
" Maybe that 's a way of killing them , " McCain told reporters , smiling as he waited for a cheesesteak sandwich at the Primanti Brothers restaurant .
His wife , sitting next to him at the counter , poked his back without looking up .

With the American housing market in its worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s , President Bush is authorising new legislation to pave the way for massive new government intervention designed to slow the slide .
Banks in the US could end up owning ever more houses
The intervention would come as a little known quirk of US law threatens to drive down house prices even faster .
Faced with seemingly never - ending falls in the value of their properties , some American home - owners are taking radical action ; they are choosing to walk away from homes and their mortgages .
In May 2006 , at the height of the housing boom , Karen Trainer bought a $ 500,000 apartment in California - with money borrowed from her bank .
By this year , Karen still owed $ 500,000 on her mortgage , but her apartment was worth $ 200,000 less .
So she was deep in negative equity and , to make matters worse , the interest rate on her loan was about to increase .
" I thought ' this is crazy ' , " Ms Trainer says .
" It just does not make financial sense . "
Take the hit Is the bank going to pay for my retirement because I was a good girl and paid my mortgage
Karen Trainer
City of debt shows US housing woe
As a successful professional , Karen could comfortably have managed the higher mortgage payments her bank demanded .
Instead , she decided to stop her mortgage payments altogether and let her bank repossess her apartment .
Her credit record will be badly damaged by the decision , but Ms Trainer expects this to recover soon .
" Generally speaking , within 5 years you are about back where you were , so my husband and I decided we 'll take the hit and live with it . "
Over to the bank In California and much of the rest of America , there is a powerful incentive for homeowners such as Ms Trainer to walk away from their mortgage obligations .
The dangers are extraordinary
Professor Susan Wachter , Wharton School of Business
US home foreclosures on the rise
Though banks can repossess and sell the homes of borrowers who stop paying their mortgages , under a legal quirk originating in the Great Depression of the 1930s , banks cannot easily pursue borrowers for any balance outstanding on the main mortgage on their homes .
Consequently , by walking away from her apartment , Ms Trainer has also walked away from the loss on her property .
Her bank gets stuck with that .
Unthinkable option Traditionally in America there is a social stigma attached to those who default on their debts , which should be a deterrent to walking away from your home .
The housing market has become a headache for President Bush But according to Susan Wachter , professor of real estate and finance at Wharton School of Business , in the depth of this crisis the social attitudes to such actions are changing .
" This is the kind of conversation that 's going on at cocktail parties , at swimming pools , " Professor Wachter says .
" And suddenly this option which was truly unthinkable in the past becomes thinkable . "
Worrying development Ms Trainer says she feels no moral obligation to go on paying a loan on a property that is going to go on losing her money .
She says her friends support her decision .
It 's a business decision for their family that the smartest thing they can do is walk away from their home
Kevin Morgan , estate agent " I think people are taking a more cold - hearted look at it , " she says .
" Is the bank going to pay for my retirement because I was a good girl and paid my mortgage , even though legally I did n't have to ? "
Professor Wachter believes that , to date , most people have had their homes repossessed because they could not manage the repayments .
The trend of people now positively choosing to walk away because it makes financial sense to do so is a worrying new development .
" The dangers are extraordinary , " Professor Wachter says .
" If all that is needed is that the house value is less than the mortgage value , there is a large number of homeowners in the United States who are in that situation " .
No renegotiation
In the city of Stockton - the foreclosure , or repossession , capital of the US for 2007 - estate agent Kevin Morgan sells repossessed houses on behalf of the banks that now own them .
This is becoming a tsunami of voluntary defaults
Professor Nouriel Roubini , New York University
According to him , walking away has become commonplace .
" I would say it 's probably 70 % of the volume of our foreclosures right now , " he says .
" It 's a business decision for their family that the smartest thing they can do is walk away from their home . "
As a sign of the changing times , some 60 % of borrowers do not even bother to contact their banks to attempt a renegotiation of their loan , Mr Moran explains .
" They stop paying and they stop talking , " he says .
" They just plain walk away . "
Total disaster
It is impossible to know for sure how many of the people who are now walking away from their homes could have gone on paying their mortgages .
But Professor Nouriel Roubini of New York University , one of the first economists to warn of the dangers of the American house price boom , believes the number of people positively choosing to walk away is growing rapidly .
" This is becoming a tsunami of voluntary defaults , " Professor Roubini says .
" The losses for the financial system from people walking away could be of the order of one trillion dollars when the entire capital of the US banking system is only $ 1.3 trillion .
" You could have most of the US banking system wiped out , so this is a total disaster . "
Which is why it is not just US policymakers who are hoping America 's new , multi-billion dollar initiative to stabilise the housing market will succeed in its aims and thus make walking away less attractive .
Because if it fails , the economic fallout could be felt far beyond America 's shores .

What are these ?
Andrew : but there was a way for NBs to vote that there was not enough time for them , etc .
It is the normal vote .
A more - than - absolute majority of NBs participating decided that there * was * enough time , and so on .
They voted yes .
At the end of the day , a lot of the objections come down to some NBs having a different opinion on the standard ( and the particular process ) than other NBs .
* That happens all the time * though usually without the publicity machine and end - of - the - world grandiosity .
People are playing this as ISO Secretariat against the world , but the world voted , in the glare of publicity : now it may be that SA , China , India and Ven did not have enough time to figure out what was going on and what to vote ( and they insiste that therefore no other NB could have either ) or they think their arguments are so compelling that any lack of agreement by other NBs shows that the NBs were somehow duped or shielded from the opposing view , but that is simply not their call to make .
NBs decide , and the Secretariat has no right to overturn the NBs clear vote : they have to server the NBs .
Remember that ISO voting rules are some of the strongest on any standards body : not simple majority , not absolute majority , but stronger than that with accept and reject quotas .
If you do n't like the idea of there being a forum where each National Body has the same vote and there should be more consideration enfranchising based on economic size , or non-NB stakeholders , then JTC1 is not the body for you .
( In fact , the person who has most seriously argued that smaller economies should have less votes and that primary stakeholders should have more involvement is Jan van der Belt , who is actually a lovely man : I disagree with him quite strongly on this . )
Actually , ISO has being trying to position itself in recent years as more like a Senate : a house of review which looks at standards from angles different from the stakeholder - driven consortia and committees who originate the standards .
For example , you might decide to have population - based voting , for example an extra vote for every 100 million population .
Or GDP - based voting .
That would then encourage the formation of voting blocks and proxies .
It sounds like a step sideways , at best , and probably a step backwards .
I believe it is really important for there to be an international standards body where ultimate voting does not allow direct voting by stakeholders : all the systems where there is direct voting by stakeholders are suspect and deficient w.r.t. susceptibility to collusion and domination just on procedural grounds .
I do n't know if you know the term " Pilgerism " .
It was coined about a journalist John Pilger , a fellow Australian , and it is defined as " presenting information in the most sensational way in support of a pre-dedetermined position " .
That is what I see a lot of .
People start off with the position " Oh , of course it is impossible for OOXML to become a standard " .
And " It is impossible for any changes to be made " .
And it is impossible for MS to do anything without it therefore being bad .
And so with many other impossibilities .
Then when the impossible happens , rather than saying " oh. we were wrong by a mile " and " gosh the echo chamber was so strong we only heard our own voice repeated " , we get " Oh , there must be corruption and folly , it is the only explanation . "
But the simpler explanation is that there was a vigorous exchange of views , changes were made , and enough NBs were convinced .
( However , as I have said before , I do think there should have been more NBs abstaining on both sides , based on their reasons .
For example , if a NB loses confidence with its technical committee for having biased views , or if an NB considers it did not have enough time to satisfactorily review , both those should have resulted in abstentions IMHO . )

Following a quiet word down at the Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) , Google has been given regulatory approval to publish photographs taken by the fleet of camera - carrying black Opels currently surveying Britain .
The ICO says it was persuaded by Google 's assurances that it will blur the faces of people captured by one of the Opels .
Likewise the firm has satisfied data watchdogs that number plates will be scrambled , and that anyone who complains about a Street View image can have it binned .
The ICO released this statement today :
We are satisfied that Google is putting in place adequate safeguards to avoid any risk to the privacy or safety of individuals , including the blurring of vehicle registration marks and the faces of anyone included in Streetview images .
Although it is possible that in certain limited circumstances an image may allow the identification of an individual , it is clear that Google are keen to capture images of streets and not individuals .
Further there is an easy mechanism by which individuals can report an image that causes them concern to Google and request that it is removed .
Images are not ' real time ' and there is a delay between taking an image and its publication so that it could not be used to make decisions about an individual 's current whereabouts .
The ICO 's statement makes no mention of what Google itself might do with the reams of data it is collecting .
Not everyone 's concerned by Street View has had the pleasure of Google 's soothing words .
Privacy International , the London - based privacy pressure group was among the first to raise public concerns about the image mapping project hitting the UK , and wrote to Google with a series of questions .
It has been ignored by the firm .
Privacy International spokesman Simon Davies said Street View 's lack of transparency is its fundamental problem .
" We 've asked for details of the [ blurring ] technology and Google will not yield it ...
Google is claiming commercial secrecy , but they wo n't even show us how effective it is , " he said .
" The ICO is of course entitled to form its opinion but we 'll continue to press Google . "
Privacy International also asked the firm to explain if and how it consulted with the UK public on its plans , but has again been stonewalled . ®
Car patrol eliminated the neighborhood police officer .
Police were pulled off neighborhood beats to fill cars .
But motorized patrol — the cornerstone of urban policing — has no effect on crime rates , victimization , or public satisfaction .
Lawrence Sherman was an early critic of telephone dispatch and motorized patrol , noted , " The rise of telephone dispatch transformed both the method and purpose of patrol .
Instead of watching to prevent crime , motorized police patrol became a process of merely waiting to respond to crime . "
The jar was said to be the type that holds sweets or popcorn
US wildlife officials who tried to capture a bear that had a jar stuck on its head , have shot the animal after it wandered into a busy Minnesota town .
The bear , a male about two years old , was killed by police after six days of failed efforts to catch it alive .
" When it got into town , our main concern was public safety , " said Rob Naplin , a local wildlife supervisor .
The wild black bear could breathe but could not eat or drink , and was probably hungry and dehydrated .
' Tough condition '
" With all the people around ... you 're never sure what the outcome is going to be , " Mr Naplin told the Minneapolis Star Tribune newspaper .
Mr Naplin said efforts had been made to capture the bear alive as it moved through areas near the town of Lake George , where it was first spotted on 21 July .
Efforts to tranquilise the animal failed because the bear " stayed in forested areas " , he said .
Mr Naplin said the bear was " in pretty tough condition " after being unable to eat or drink for several days because of the 2.5 - gallon ( 9.5 - litre ) plastic jar on its head .
He said the jar was the type that holds sweets or popcorn , and had probably become lodged on its head as the bear was foraging for food .
BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraqi Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr threatened on Tuesday to lift a ceasefire of his Mehdi Army militia while indefinitely postponing a mass anti-U.S. demonstration .
Despite the ceasefire which Sadr called last August , his followers have clashed with Iraqi government troops and U.S. forces in the south of the country and Baghdad in recent weeks , leading to Iraq ’s worst violence since the first half of 2007 .
“ If it is required to lift the freeze ( ceasefire ) in order to carry out our goals , objectives , doctrines and religious principles and patriotism , we will do that later and in a separate statement , ” he said in a statement on his Web site .
He postponed indefinitely a “ million - strong march ” called for Wednesday to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the fall of Baghdad , which had raised the prospect of unrest coinciding with testimony in Congress by the top U.S. officials in Iraq .
“ I call those beloved Iraqi people who wish to demonstrate against the occupation to postpone their march , out of my fear for them and my concern to spare their blood , ” Sadr said .
“ I fear that Iraqi hands will be lifted against you , although I would be honored if the Americans were to lift their hands against you , ” he said .
No matter what you think of blogging , Internet - based citizen journalism is a real threat , not just to traditional media business models but to totalitarian governments .
How do we know that bloggers are drawing blood ?
Because some governments are hitting back harder and harder ; last year saw a tripling in the number of bloggers arrested around the world compared to 2006 , according to a report from the University of Washington .
" Last year , 2007 , was a record year for blogger arrests , with three times as many as in 2006 .
Egypt , Iran and China are the most dangerous places to blog about political life , accounting for more than half of all arrests since blogging became big , " said Assistant Professor Phil Howard , lead author of the World Information Access Report .
Howard also suggests that the real number of arrests may be much higher , as not every arrest makes it into the media .
The report separates the reason for arrests into six categories : violation of cultural norms , blogging involved with social protest , blogging about public policy , blogging about political figures , exposing corruption or human rights violations , and finally " other . "
In addition to Iran , Egypt and China , Middle Eastern regimes in Syria and Saudi Arabia , and South East Asian nations such as Singapore , Malaysia , and Thailand also figure in the report .
2007 saw 36 bloggers arrested around the world , and since 2003 at least 64 have been arrested , with a total of 940 months of prison time served .
Even liberal democracies are not immune ; France , Canada , the USA , and UK have all arrested people following their blogging activity since 2004 .
However , some of these cases might not seem so egregious ; last year a blogger was arrested in Los Angeles following his postings about his attraction to young girls , and the beginning of 2008 saw an arrest in the UK after one Gavin Best used his blog to threaten a police officer 's family following his arrest for a large number of thefts .
Another troubling trend has been the complicity of western Internet firms such as Yahoo and Google , both of whom have handed over details of bloggers to the Chinese government , despite publicly condemning such policies .
The Internet is n't just landing people in prison ; occasionally it helps get them out too .
Earlier this year there was the widely publicized case in Egypt where US blogger James Buck used Twitter , the microblogging platform , to alert his friends and colleagues to the fact that he'd been arrested following his efforts to cover an anti-government protest .
Meanwhile , the worldwide blogging community shows no signs of going away , although fear of persecution may drive more of them to do so anonymously .
But long may they continue to show that the pen ( or , in this case , the keyboard ) is mightier than the sword .
The former Bosnian Serb leader , who was appearing at a UN tribunal at the Hague for the first time , claimed that the former United States Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke had granted him immunity from war crimes on the condition of his withdrawal from public life as part of a wider Bosnia peace deal agreed in 1995 .
Mr. Elwood , citing a 1980s precedent , said there was nothing new or unusual about such a view .
Senator Sheldon Whitehouse , Democrat of Rhode Island , challenged Mr. Elwood , saying the administration ’s legal stance would let it secretly operate programs that are at odds with public executive orders that to all appearance remain in force .
The hearing , of a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee , was called by Senator Russ Feingold , Democrat of Wisconsin .
Mr. Feingold accused the administration of a “ sinister trend ” of promoting “ secret law . ”
He referred to the refusal by the Justice Department to release opinions on interrogation and domestic surveillance from the Office of Legal Counsel , whose interpretations are binding on the executive branch .
“ It is a basic tenet of democracy that the people have a right to know the law , ” Mr. Feingold said .
Mr. Elwood , deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel , disputed that declining to make legal opinions public created improper “ secret law . ”
He said some legal opinions had to be kept from public release , at least for a time , because they deal with classified programs or to ensure that government lawyers can give confidential legal advice .
J. William Leonard , the top official overseeing document classification from 2002 until January , challenged the classifying of legal analyses .
Referring to a Justice Department opinion in March 2003 on interrogation that was released this year , Mr. Leonard said that it should not have been classified and that marking it “ secret ” showed “ either profound ignorance of or deep contempt for ” classification rules .
Even with the release of the memorandum , several major legal opinions on interrogation remain secret .
Though the Justice Department is offering to show those opinions to the Intelligence Committees , officials gave no indication that any of the opinions would be made public .

A commenter named Nick left a thoughtful response to my post about my “ Multilanguage Programming ” column .
Rather than respond to it with another comment , I thought I ’d turn my response into a full posting , as I think Nick ’s feedback is representative of how many people feel about the topic .
Nick said :
I would say that instead of spending a lot of time on a conceptually different language it could be more beneficial to study , say , distributed algorithms or software / system architecture principles or your business domain .
There is so much knowledge in this world that learning how to code the same thing in , roughly speaking , one more syntax seems like a waste of time .
Even paying real attention to what is going on in the cloud computing can easily consume most of one ’s spare time .
I think there are assumptions here that are not necessarily true .
Specifically , you ’re not necessarily learning how to code the same thing in multiple languages ; rather , the idea is that by choosing the best language for the task , coding is “ just right ” for the problem at hand .
For example , I know from significant first - hand experience that if you want to write a set of distributed services that support replication , failover , and fault tolerance , the code you ’d write to do that in C++ will be extremely different from the code you ’d write in Erlang to achieve the same thing ( well , actually , you ’d be able to achieve far more in Erlang , in far fewer lines of code ) .
This is about much more than syntax .
It ’s about facilities , semantics , and trade - offs .
If it were just syntax , then that would imply that all languages are equal in terms of expressiveness and capability , which we already know and accept to be untrue .
The cloud computing topic actually provides a good example of why knowing multiple languages can be useful .
To use the Google App Engine , for example , you need to develop your applications in Python .
What if you do n’t know Python ?
Too bad for you .
From a real life perspective , it takes years or working on nontrivial software to master a language .
For example , some people still manage to have only a vague idea of util.concurent — and this is just a small enough ( and well explained in the literature ) part of Java .
How realistic is it to expect that the majority of developers will be able to master multiple languages concurrently ?
I disagree that it takes years to master a language .
One of the best OO developers I ever worked with was a mechanical engineer who taught himself programming .
One of my current coworkers — a relatively young guy — started programming in Erlang only a few months ago , and he ’s already writing some fairly sophisticated production - quality code .
In 1988 , I started using C++ ; by 1989 , I was starting to help guys like Stan Lippman , Jim Coplien , and others correct coding mistakes in their excellent books .
I have a BSEE , no formal computer science training whatsoever , and am completely self - taught as far as programming languages go .
( The only class I ever had in any computer language was a BASIC class I had to take in 1981 . )
Two other coworkers started with Python just a few months ago and they do quite well with it at this point .
I can cite numerous such examples from throughout my career .
I do n’t think any of us are super - programmers or anything like that , so if we can do it , I do n’t see why it would be a problem for anyone else .
Perhaps you ’re falling trap to the “ huge language ” problem I mentioned in my column .
It certainly can take some people many years to master enormous languages like Java and C++ , but most languages are simply nowhere near that big .
And who wants to maintain a code base written in widely different languages ?
Which most likely means multiple IDEs , unit testing frameworks , build systems ( hey , not everyone is using even Maven yet ) , innumerable frameworks etc .
And most of the interpreted languages among those are not even likely to run in the same VM .
Not to mention the number of jobs asking for non-C++/ Java skills .
I use a number of languages daily and I really have no trouble maintaining the code regardless of which language any particular piece happens to be written in , or whether I wrote the code or one of my teammates did .
Once you know a language , you know it ; switching to it is no more difficult than using your one and only language if you ’re a monolingual developer .
You also mention the “ multiple IDE ” problem .
The first draft of my column contained some fairly direct language describing my dislike of IDEs , or more accurately , my dislike of the IDE culture , but Doug Lea suggested I take it out , so I did .
The problem is that some folks let the tool drive their solutions , rather than using the tool as a means to developing solutions .
I ’ve had numerous people tell me they wo n’t consider using a language unless their IDE fully supports it with Java - or Smalltalk - like refactoring .
To me , that ’s completely backwards .
I ’d rather use an extensible editor that can handle pretty much any language , thus letting me develop optimal solutions using the right languages , rather than having a mere editing tool severely limit my choice of possible solutions .
But there are language mavens and there are tool mavens , and they typically disagree .
Follow that link and read , as the posting there is incredibly insightful .
I am definitely a language maven ; languages are my tools .
I suspect , though , that Nick and others who raise similar questions to the ones quoted here lean more toward being tool mavens .
I ’m not passing judgment on either ; I ’m only pointing out the different camps to help pinpoint sources of disagreement .
As far as unit test frameworks , build systems , and frameworks go , I have n’t ever found any big issues in those areas when using multiple languages .
The reason , not surprisingly , is that knowing multiple languages gives you multiple weapons for testing and integration .
Ultimately , when you ’re used to using multiple languages , you ’re used to these kinds of issues and thus they do n’t really present any formidable barriers .
And as far as jobs go , the best developers I ’ve known throughout my career have been fluent in a number of programming languages , and each of them could work virtually wherever they wanted to .
I do n’t believe this correlation is mere coincidence .
Curiously enough , this argumentation is hardly ever mentioned .
Authors tend to assume that developers are lazy or have nothing else to learn .
I do n’t assume developers are lazy .
Rather , I think our industry generally has a bad habit of continually seeking homogeneity in platforms , in languages , in tools , in frameworks , etc. , and we really , really ought to know better by now .
Once you learn to accept the fact that heterogeneity in computing is inevitable — since nothing can do it all , right ? — you find yourself able to use that heterogeneity to your advantage , rather than continually battling against it and losing .
Personally , I am planning to look at Scala and probably Erlang but even judging from the number of books on those it ’s clear to me that they represent merely a niche market .
Today ’s niche market is tomorrow ’s mainstream market .
Regardless of whether either of those languages continues to grow , learning one or both will make you a better developer than you are today .
Consider the final question I ask in my column :
After all , do any of us really believe we ’ve already learned the last programming language we ’ll ever need ?
I suspect the vast majority of developers would answer “ no ” to this question .
Assuming that ’s the case , then if you do n’t regularly practice learning new languages , how do you know when you really need to start learning a new one , and how capable will you be of learning that next language when the need arises ?
The longer you stay with one language , the more isolated you become , typically without even realizing it .
Shifting gears gets harder and harder .
Then one day you look up and all the interesting work is elsewhere , out of your reach .
Is that a position you want to put yourself in ?
近況
新刊が多く慌しい . 谷川史子の " 草の上星の下 " , 岩本ナオの " 町でうわさの天狗の子 " , あとは Google の " Protocol Buffers " .
谷川史子の洗練を綴るには余白が狭過ぎる. かわりに Protocol Buffers の話をすこし .
Protocol Buffers
Protocol Buffers ( 以下 protobuf ) は Google 製のオブジェクトシリアライザ .
名前からは RPC を連想しそうだけれど , RPC そのものではない .
もっともオブジェクトを直列化して送受信するのが
RPC だから , あとは送受信だけあればいい .
実装は含まれないものの , protobuf にも RPC を前提としたインターフェイスがいくつか含まれている .
...といった細かい話は ドキュメント や インタビュー を見ればわかる .
今日はコードを見てみることに .
なお , 例の Style Guide から 想像できるとおり , protobuf は特段モダン な C++ ではない. boost が好みの先鋭 的 C++ 愛好家には物足りないだろう .
主題もオブジェクトのシリアライザという再発明の親玉なので , 食傷気味の人は多いとおもう . ( ほんとに ... ) とはいえ少しは面白いところもあったので紹介してみたい.
概観
まず行数から .
omo@contentiss:~/src/protobuf-2.0.0beta$
lines.rb -d src/ 6006 / google/protobuf/compiler/cpp 923 /google/protobuf /compiler / python 3690 /google/protobuf/compiler / java 16312 /google/protobuf / compiler 6534 /google /protobuf /io 496 /google/protobuf/testing 3940 /google/protobuf/stubs 55766 /google/protobuf 55766 / google 1814 /gtest/ internal 10125 /gtest 65891
6.5 万行くらいある . これは C++ の部分だけで , python や java のランタイムは含まない .
compiler 以下は . proto ファイルのコンパイラ .
stubs 以下は Google 社内のツリーから抜粋したと思しき細かなユーティリティ. io 以下は stream の実装 .
testing は単体テストのヘルパ .
残りがランタイムになる .
テストやら何やらを除いたランタイム本体は , およそ 2 万行くらいの感触 .
ランタイムのコードの多くは C++ のオブジェクトに対するリフレクションの実装に割かれている.
protobuf の生成するオブジェクトは , このランタイムによって reflective に操作できるようになる .
みどころ
オブジェクトのシリアライザや RPC には , 実装を特徴づける設計上の意思決定がある .
コード本体を眺める前にいくつか列挙しておく.
こういうのを気にしながら読んでます , という参考まで .
直列化の自己記述度 : 直列化の書式がどれだけ自己記述的か.
バイト列を見ただけで何のデータかわかるデータは自己記述的だ.
HTML や XML は自己記述的なデータの代表例. 構造体を memcpy ( ) しだけのデータは , ふつう中身をみてもさっぱりわからない.
自己記述的でない .
各種画像フォーマットはその間くらい.
フォーマットを知らなければさっぱり読めないけれど , フォーマットがわかれば画像のサイズやピクセル幅 , そのほか各種メタデータをとりだすことができる.
Java オブジェクトの直列化書式もそれなりに自己記述的で , たとえばクラス名やバージョン , プロパティのデータ型などがひとそろい入っている .
自己記述度が高いほど空間効率や速度は下がる.
バージョニングへの対処 : 古いデータを新しいコードで読みこめるか. 逆に新しいデータを古いコードで読めるか. 素朴な memcpy ( ) データはまったくバージョニングされていない.
定義が変わると使えなくなる . そもそもバージョン違いを検出できるかも怪しい.
HTML はかなり堅牢 .
昔のブラウザで最新のページを見ても , いちおう文章くらいは拾える. 上位互換はほぼ完璧 .
Java のオブジェクトもそこそこ頑張っており , プロパティが追加されたくらいならスルーしてくれる .
オブジェクトグラフの自由度 : 直列化するオブジェクトが他のオブジェクトを参照しているときどうするか.
特に , 参照の循環や合流がおきたらどうなるか .
合流がコピーになり , 循環を許さない実装がある一方で , そうした複雑なオブジェクトグラフを保存できる実装もある.
Java は後者 ( だったはず ... )
オブジェクトモデルの自己記述度 : C++ 固有の話題として , 独自実装したリフレクションの表現能力やオーバーヘッドが気になる.
フィールドを取得するにはどうするのか.
メソッドは呼べるのか. アクセス制限 , 継承関係は再現されるのか .
リフレクションを実現するために個々のオブジェクトが消費するオーバーヘッドはどれだけか.
シリアライザを作るだけならリフレクションいらなくね？ など. C++ 以外の言語 ( protobuf なら Java や Python ) はふつう言語レベルから reflective なので , こういう悩みは少ない .
言語機能を使えば済む .
ランタイムとコード生成の役割分担 : 各種高級言語のシリアライザがを見ればわかるとおり , オブジェクトが reflective ならシリアライザにコード生成は必要ない .
けれど性能上の理由で自動生成を使うことはある.
こうしたトレードオフの線引きが個性になる
Message : オブジェクトモデル
protobuf のコンパイラ protoc で生成されるクラスは , すべて Message インターフェイ ス( 状態をもたない抽象クラス ) を実装している .
// message.h class LIBPROTOBUF_EXPORT
Message { public : .... virtual Message * New ( ) const = 0 ; ... virtual void MergeFrom( const Message& from ) ; ... virtual bool MergePartialFromCodedStream( io:: CodedInputStream* input ) ; ... virtual bool SerializeWithCachedSizes( io:: CodedOutputStream* output ) const ; virtual int GetCachedSize ( ) const = 0 ; ... virtual const Descriptor * GetDescriptor ( ) const = 0 ; ... virtual const Reflection * GetReflection ( ) const = 0 ; ... } ;
まず多態を実現する最低限の仕組みとして , コンストラクタに相当する New ( ) と Clone ( ) の亜種 MergeFrom ( ) がある. ファクトリでなくオブジェクト自身に New ( ) があるたりは設計に prototype 指向のノリが混じっている .
リフレクションは GetReflection ( ) や GetDescriptor ( ) でとりだしたオブジェクトを介して行う .
Descriptor オブジェクトが Java の Class オブジェクトに相当し , メタクラスを記述する .
Reflection オブジェクトは Message オブジェクトごとにインスタンス化され , リフレクションで使うオブジェクト単位の状態を保持する.
ちょっとややこしい .
肝心の直列化は SerializeWithCachedSizes ( ) が , 復元は MergePartialFromCodedStream ( ) が受け持つ .
この二つが純粋仮想関数でないのは面白い.
( 低級言語だと典型的なシリアライザはこの部分のコードを生成するよね. )
実装ではリフレクションを使い直列化を行う.
// message.cc bool Message::MergePartialFromCodedStream(io::CodedInputStream* input ) { return WireFormat::ParseAndMergePartial( // WireFormat はいわゆるヘルパクラス GetDescriptor ( ) , input , GetReflection ( ) ) ; } ... bool Message : : SerializeWithCachedSizes( io:: CodedOutputStream* output ) const { return WireFormat:: SerializeWithCachedSizes ( GetDescriptor ( ) , GetReflection ( ) , GetCachedSize ( ) , output ) ; }
Message には様々なユーティリティメソッドが定義されており , ファイルや配列への直列化を行うこともできる .
こうしたユーティリティはどれも 最終的に上の二つの仮想関数を呼びだす.
// Message class ... //
Serialize the message and store it in the given byte array .
All required // fields must be set .
bool SerializeToArray ( void* data , int size ) const ; //
Serialize the message and write it to the given file descriptor .
All // required fields must be set . bool SerializeToFileDescriptor ( int file_descriptor ) const ; ...
Reflection : リフレクションのインターフェイス
Message オブジェクトに対する reflective な操作は , Reflection インターフェイスに分離されている .
class LIBPROTOBUF_EXPORT
Message :: Reflection { public : ... virtual const UnknownFieldSet& GetUnknownFields ( ) const = 0 ; ... virtual bool HasField ( const FieldDescriptor* field ) const = 0 ; ... virtual void ListFields ( vector < const FieldDescriptor *>* output ) const = 0 ; ... virtual int32 GetInt32 ( const FieldDescriptor* field ) const = 0 ; ... virtual string GetString ( const FieldDescriptor* field ) const = 0 ; ... virtual const Message& GetMessage ( const FieldDescriptor* field ) const = 0 ; ... virtual void SetInt32 ( const FieldDescriptor * field , int32 value ) = 0 ; ... virtual int32 GetRepeatedInt32 ( const FieldDescriptor * field , int index ) const = 0 ; ... virtual void SetRepeatedInt32 ( const FieldDescriptor * field , int index , int32 value ) = 0 ; ... virtual void AddInt32 ( const FieldDescriptor * field , int32 value ) = 0 ; ... private : GOOGLE_DISALLOW_EVIL_CONSTRUCTORS( Reflection ) ; } ;
FieldDescriptor が Java でいう Field クラス. SetXxx ( ) や GetXxx ( ) で該当フィールドの値を操作する .
repepated field :
SetRepeatedInt32 ( ) などの repeated メソッドは , 要するに配列 .
" 配列 " というオブジェクトを用意するかわりに , " repepated field " という概念を持ち込んでいる .
ださい気はするけど効率はいいかも . ちなみに連想配列は用意されていない.
optional field :
protobuf には optional フィールドという概念があり , 特定のフィールドを空にしておくことができる .
空のフィールドは直列化されない. この仕組みと MergeFrom ( ) を使ったオブジェクトの上書きによって , プログラマの利便性を損ねずに空間効率の高い直列化を実現できる.
たとえば差分の保存や送信がやりやすい. HasField ( ) は , そ の( オプション ) フィールドがセットされているかを確認する .
unknown field :
protobuf には " unknown field " という概念があり , バージョニングや互換性の扱いを支援している .
直列化されたデータを読み込む際に定義にないフィールドがみつかると , Message は " unknown field " としてそれを保存しておく .
再び直列化するときは , unknown field も書き出される .
そのため , 古いバージョンのプログラムが新しいデータを読み書きしても内容が損われることはない.
GeneratedMessageReflection : リフレクションの実装
Reflection インターフェイスを実装しているのは GeneratedMessageReflection クラス .
class LIBPROTOBUF_EXPORT
GeneratedMessageReflection : public Message :: Reflection { ... // メソッド定義がずらずら const Descriptor * descriptor_ ; void* base_ ; const void * default_base_ ; const int* offsets_ ; ... uint32 * has_bits_ ; ExtensionSet * extensions_ ; ... UnknownFieldSet unknown_fields_ ; .... } ;
void* を見て嫌な予感がしている人は正しい.
たとえば base_ は対応す る
Message インスタンスの this を指している .
offsets_ は this の中にある各フィールドへのオフセット配列 .
GetInt32 ( ) などの reflective な操作は , 巡り巡っ て GeneratedMessageReflection :: GetField ( ) メソッドを呼ぶ . ( const なしの MutableField ( ) メソッドもある .
実装は同じ . )
//
These simple template accessors obtain pointers ( or references ) to // the given field .
template < typename Type > inline const Type& GeneratedMessageReflection :: GetRaw ( const FieldDescriptor* field ) const { const void* ptr = reinterpret_cast < const uint8 *>( base_ ) + offsets_[ field ->index ( ) ] ; return * reinterpret_cast < const Type *>( ptr ) ; } ;
だいたい想像どおりだったと思う... まあ言語の上でバイト列に構造を与えようとすれば , こうなるのは仕方ない .
MySQL のレコードなんかも大枠では似たようなかんじだった , はず .
offset_ 配列の値は生成されたコードが静的に計算し , 外側から GeneratedMessageReflection に与えられる . あと unknown_fields_ は Message ( のサブクラス ) じゃなくてこっちに持たせておくんだね .
Descriptor : メタクラス
既に述べたように , Descriptor は Java の Class クラスに相当する .
同様のクラスとして FileDescriptor , EnumDescriptor , FieldDescriptor , EnumDescriptor などが 用意されている .
それぞれが . proto ファイルにあらわれる construct に対応している .
これらのクラスはコンパイラでも使われる.
だからメタクラスと見てもいいし , . proto ファイルの抽象構文木だと思ってもいい.
データ中心の立場からスキーマとみなすこともできる.
各 descriptor クラスには , 対応する protobuf メッセージが用意されている .
( descriptor.proto 参照 ) たとえば Descriptor には DescriptorProto メッセージクラスがある .
// descriptor.proto ... //
Describes a message type .
message DescriptorProto { optional string name = 1 ; repeated FieldDescriptorProto field = 2 ; repeated FieldDescriptorProto extension = 6 ; ... } ...
これらのメッセージを使って各 descriptor を永続化することができる .
// descriptor.h class LIBPROTOBUF_EXPORT
Descriptor { ... void CopyTo( DescriptorProto* proto ) const ; } ;
メッセージからの復元は DescriptorBuilder が行う .
// descriptor.cc class DescriptorBuilder { ... // FileDescriptor は java の package に相当. 自身の内包する各 descriptor を持つ. const FileDescriptor * BuildFile ( const FileDescriptorProto& proto ) ; ... } ;
Message のメタクラス自身が Message になれる再帰性がちょっと面白い .
オブジェクトモデルの醍醐味 .
面白いだけでなく使い道もある.
後でみるように , protobuf の直列化書式は効率重視で注釈が乏しい .
しかし直列化したメッセージに直列化した
Descriptor を添付すれば , アプリケーションレベルで自己記述的なデータを作ることができる.
DescriptorPool :
descriptor は DescriptorPool に登録する ... というよりは , DescriptorPool が Descriptor の ファクトリになっている .
Java の類比でいくと ClassLoader みたいなもの .
特殊なインスタンスとして , protoc で生成したクラスを登録する generated_pool ( ) というシングルトンがあるようす .
class LIBPROTOBUF_EXPORT
DescriptorPool { ... static const DescriptorPool* generated_pool ( ) ; ... const FileDescriptor * FindFileByName( const string& name ) const ; ... const FileDescriptor * BuildFile ( const FileDescriptorProto& proto ) ; ... scoped_ptr < Tables > tables_ ; ... } ;
生成されたコー ド
ランタイムをざっと眺めたのはいいけれど , 生成されたコードはランタイムをどう使うのだろう.
examples に入っている addressbook .
proto をコンパイルし , 生成され た addressbook.pb.h と addresssbook.pb.cc を見てみる .
コンパイルするのはこんなの :
// addressbook .
proto message Person { required string name = 1 ; required int32 id = 2 ; // Unique ID number for this person .
optional string email = 3 ; ... } ... message AddressBook { repeated Person person = 1 ; }
クラスの概観を眺め , descriptor の構築方法と直列化ルーチンの実装を覗けば 生成されたコードがどんなものかわかるだろう .
というわけで , まず概観を求めヘッダファイルから :
// addressbook.pb.h class Person : public :: google :: protobuf :: Message { //
Message の subclass ... inline static const Person& default_instance ( ) { // プロトタイプの根っこ. return default_instance_ ; } // メソッドの宣言がずらずらと... // フィールドのアクセサ // required string name = 1 ; inline bool has_name ( ) const ; inline void clear_name ( ) ; inline const ::std::string& name ( ) const ; inline void set_name ( const ::std::string& value ) ; inline void set_name ( const char* value ) ; inline ::std::string* mutable_name( ) ; .... private : :: google :: protobuf :: internal:: GeneratedMessageReflection _reflection_ ; mutable int _cached_size_ ; // シリアライズ時のサイズ. // フィールドの実体. ::std::string* name_ ; static const ::std::string _default_name_ ; ::google::protobuf::int32 id_ ; ::std::string* email_ ; static const ::std::string _default_email_ ; ::google::protobuf::RepeatedPtrField< ::tutorial::Person_PhoneNumber > phone_ ; ... static const Person default_instance_ ; static const int _offsets _ [ 4 ] ; // reflection で使うフィールドへのオフセット .
::google::protobuf::uint32 _has_bits _[ ( 4 + 31 ) / 32 ] ; // optional を実現するフラグ .... }
Message インターフェイスを実装するメソッドの他 , フィールドへのアクセサやいくつかの static method が生成されている .
フィールド本体以外にも , has_bits_ など Message インターフェイスの規定するオブジェクトモデルを 実現するための値がいくつかある .
Descriptor のインスタンス化 :
次に descriptor の構築方法を調べよう . とりあえず GetDescriptor ( ) から追いかけていく .
// addressbook.pb.cc const ::google::protobuf::Descriptor* Person_PhoneNumber:: GetDescriptor ( ) const { return descriptor ( ) ; }
はいはい ...
.... const :: google:: protobuf::Descriptor* Person_PhoneNumber :: descriptor ( ) { if ( Person_PhoneNumber_descriptor_ == NULL ) proto_BuildDescriptors_addressbook_2eproto( ) ; return Person_PhoneNumber_descriptor_ ; }
はいはい ...
... void proto_BuildDescriptors_addressbook_2eproto( ) { ... const ::google::protobuf::FileDescriptor* file = pool-> InternalBuildGeneratedFile ( "
\021addressbook.proto\022\010tutorial \ " \332\001
\ 006 Person " " \022\014
\ 004name\030\001 \002 ( \t\022

\024com.example.tutor " " ialB\021AddressBookProtos " , 342 ) ; Person_descriptor_ = file -> message_type(0 ) ; Person_PhoneNumber_descriptor_ = Person_descriptor_->nested_type(0 ) ; :: google :: protobuf::MessageFactory :: InternalRegisterGeneratedMessage( Person_PhoneNumber_descriptor_ , & Person_PhoneNumber:: default_instance ( ) ) ; .... }
はて. これは何をしているのだろう .
// descriptor.cc const FileDescriptor * DescriptorPool :: InternalBuildGenerated File ( const void* data , int size ) { ... FileDescriptorProto proto ; GOOGLE_CHECK( proto.ParseFromArray( data , size ) ) ; const FileDescriptor * result = BuildFile ( proto ) ; GOOGLE_CHECK ( result != NULL ) ; return result ; }
なるほど .
コンパイラは直列化した FileDescriptorProto をコードに埋め込んでおき , 実行時にはそれを解釈して FileDescriptor を作っている .
FileDescriptor を構築する " コード " 自体は出力しないんだね .
ちょっと面白い .
コンパイラも内部モデルに descriptor を使っているから , 簡単に descriptor の直列化バイト列を生成できる .
このへんはうまい設計だと思う .
ところでシングルトンの初期化がスレッドセーフじゃないのが気になった人もいるとおもう.
// addressbook.pb.cc // Force BuildDescriptors ( ) to be called at static initialization time .
struct StaticDescriptorInitializer_addressbook_2eproto { StaticDescriptorInitializer_addressbook_2eproto( ) { proto_BuildDescriptors_addressbook_2eproto( ) ; } } static_descriptor_initializer_addressbook_2eproto_ ;
グローバル変数のコンストラクタを使ったイディオムを使って初期化時に登録を済ませている.
各種組込み機器への移植を考えていた人は残念でした...
オフセットの計算 :
よりみちで , Reflection が参照していたオフセットの計算方法も覗いておく .
// addressbook.pb.cc const int Person:: _offsets _ [ 4 ] = { GOOGLE_PROTOBUF_GENERATED_MESSAGE_FIELD_OFFSET( Person , name_ ) , GOOGLE_PROTOBUF_GENERATED_MESSAGE_FIELD_OFFSET( Person , id_ ) , GOOGLE_PROTOBUF_GENERATED_MESSAGE_FIELD_OFFSET( Person , email_ ) , GOOGLE_PROTOBUF_GENERATED_MESSAGE_FIELD_OFFSET( Person , phone_ ) , } ;
// generated_messagere_flection.h # define GOOGLE_PROTOBUF_GENERATED_MESSAGE_FIELD_OFFSET(
TYPE , FIELD ) \ ( reinterpret_cast < const char * >( \ &reinterpret_cast < const TYPE *>( 16 ) -> FIELD ) - \ reinterpret_cast < const char *>( 16 ) )
コメントによれば , 0 を使うと gcc が NULL だと怒るから 16 らしい. あとは align してないとダメだとか .
直列化 :
いよいよ直列化のコードをみよう...と思ったけれど直列化より復元の方が面白そうなので , そっちを覗くことにした . ( 直列化はだいたいこの逆になる . )
bool Person_PhoneNumber::MergePartialFromCodedStream ( ::google::protobuf::io::CodedInputStream* input ) { # define DO_( EXPRESSION ) if ( !( EXPRESSION ) ) return false :: google :: protobuf ::uint32 tag ; while ( ( tag = input-> ReadTag ( ) ) !=
0 ) { switch ( :: google:: protobuf : : internal : : WireFormat:: GetTagFieldNumber( tag ) ) { // required string number = 1 ; case 1 : { if ( :: google:: protobuf : : internal : : WireFormat:: GetTagWireType(tag ) != :: google :: protobuf :: internal :: WireFormat:: WIRETYPE_LENGTH_DELIMITED ) { goto handle_uninterpreted ; } DO_ (:: google :: protobuf :: internal :: WireFormat:: ReadString ( input , mutable_number ( ) ) ) ; if ( input -> ExpectTag ( 16 ) ) goto parse_type ; break ; } // optional .tutorial .
Person .
PhoneType type = 2 [ default = HOME ] ; case 2 : { if ( :: google:: protobuf : : internal : : WireFormat:: GetTagWireType(tag ) != :: google :: protobuf :: internal :: WireFormat:: WIRETYPE_VARINT ) { goto handle_uninterpreted ; } parse_type : int value ; DO_ (:: google :: protobuf :: internal :: WireFormat:: ReadEnum ( input , &value ) ) ; if ( ::tutorial : : Person_PhoneType_IsValid( value ) ) { set_type( static_cast < ::tutorial ::Person_PhoneType >( value ) ) ; } else { mutable_unknown_fields ( )-> AddField(2 )->add_varint( value ) ; } if ( input -> ExpectAtEnd ( ) ) return true ; break ; } ...
基本的にはフィールド ID で switch し , 各 case の中ではフィールドの型に対応した WireFormat:: ReadXxx ( ) を呼びだしている .
エラーの処理は unknown field に戻ったり false を返したり色々 .
未知の ID をもつフィールドは WireFormat :: SkipField ( ) で unknown field によけておく .
default : { handle_uninterpreted : if ( :: google:: protobuf : : internal : : WireFormat:: GetTagWireType(tag ) == :: google:: protobuf ::internal :: WireFormat:: WIRETYPE_END_GROUP ) { return true ; } DO_ (:: google :: protobuf :: internal :: WireFormat:: SkipField ( input , tag , mutable_unknown_fields ( ) ) ) ; break ; } } } return true ; #undef DO_ }
未知のフィールドは一見すると型がわからない . どうやって値を解釈するのだろう. SkipField ( ) は...
// wire_format.cc bool WireFormat:: SkipField( io:: CodedInputStream * input , uint32 tag , UnknownFieldSet* unknown_fields ) { UnknownField * field = ( unknown_fields == NULL ) ?
NULL : unknown_fields -> AddField( GetTagFieldNumber(tag ) ) ; switch ( GetTagWireType(tag ) ) { ... case WIRETYPE_FIXED64 : { uint64 value ; if ( !input-> ReadLittleEndian64( &value ) ) return false ; if ( field != NULL ) field -> add_fixed64 ( value ) ; return true ; } ... } ... }
んー ...
// wire_format.h inline WireFormat :: WireType WireFormat:: GetTagWireType(uint32 tag ) { return static_cast < WireType >( tag & kTagTypeMask ) ; }
なるほど. tag の値に型が埋めこんであるんだね. よくみると GetTagFieldNumber ( ) も似た処理をしていた .
// wire_format.h inline int WireFormat:: GetTagFieldNumber( uint32 tag ) { return static_cast < int >( tag >> kTagTypeBits ) ; }
tag の32 bit 整数にはフィールドの ID と型 ID の両方が入っていたわけか .
さて , デフォルト設定のままだと上のような直列化/復元のコードは生成されない.
先に登場した , リフレクションを使う実装の Message:: MergePartialFromCodedStream ( ) などが使われる .
専用の復元コードを出力するには , . proto に以下の行を追加する .
option optimize_for = SPEED ;
生成コードとランタイムのトレードオフはユーザが指定するというわけ.
CodedOutputStream , CodedInputStream : 直列化プリミティブの実装
生成されたコードの中では WireFormat:: ReadXxx ( ) が呼ばれていた .
この呼び出しは CodedInputStream に移譲される .
inline bool WireFormat :: ReadInt32 ( io:: CodedInputStream * input , in t32 * value ) { uint32 temp ; if ( !input -> ReadVarint32( &temp ) ) return false ; * value = static_cast < int32 >( temp ) ; return true ; }
CodedInputStream はバイト列のストリームである ZeroCopyInputStream から構造化データを読み出すアダプタ .
Java でいうと InputStream に対する Reader みたいな関係にある .
地味なクラスだけれど , 読み込み処理ループの中心で呼ばれるだけあってちまちまとした高速化がしてある.
代表例として ReadVarint32 ( ) を見てみよう .
( varint は utf8 のような可変長の整数符号化方式で , 実際の値が小さいほど必要なバイト数が小さくなる.
亜種はよく使われている . たとえば swf とか abc でも使っていた気がする . )
さて , 色々な場合わけを追いかけていこう .
// coded_stream.h inline bool CodedInputStream :: ReadVarint32( uint32 * value ) { if ( buffer_size_ != 0 && * buffer_ < 0x80 ) { * value = * buffer_ ; Advance ( 1 ) ; return true ; } else { return ReadVarint32 Fallback ( value ) ; } }
まず符号化結果が 1 バイトに収まるケースを特別扱いし , インライン関数に置いている .
ここから先も芸が細かい .
bool CodedInputStream :: ReadVarint32 Fallback ( uint32 * value ) { if ( buffer_size_ >= kMaxVarintBytes || ... ( buffer_size_ != 0 && !( buffer_[buffer_size_ -1 ] & 0x80 ) ) ) { // ( 訳 ) // 高速なパス : バッファに十分なバイト数があり , 終端をまたないことが保証されているなら // そのチェックを省略する const uint8 * ptr = buffer_ ; uint32 b ; uint32 result ; // 可変長ってかんじだ ... b = *( ptr++ ) ; result = ( b & 0x7 F ) ; if ( ! ( b & 0x80 ) ) goto done ; b = *( ptr ++ ) ; result |= ( b & 0x7 F ) << 7 ; if ( ! ( b & 0x80 ) ) goto done ; b = *( ptr ++ ) ; result |= ( b & 0x7 F ) << 14 ; if ( ! ( b & 0x80 ) ) goto done ; b = *( ptr ++ ) ; result |= ( b & 0x7 F ) << 21 ; if ( ! ( b & 0x80 ) ) goto done ; b = *( ptr ++ ) ; result |= b << 28 ; if ( ! ( b & 0x80 ) ) goto done ; // ( 訳 ) // もし入力が 32 ビット以上なら , 上位ビットはすべて読み出して捨てる for ( int i = 0 ; i < kMaxVarintBytes - kMaxVarint32Bytes ; i++) { b = *( ptr++ ) ; if ( ! ( b & 0x80 ) ) goto done ; } // ( 訳 ) // サイズが最大値( 10 バイト ) を越えている .
データが壊れているとみなす .
return false ; done : Advance ( ptr - buffer_ ) ; * value = result ; return true ; } else { ... while ( buffer_size_ == 0 ) { // ( 訳) Refresh ( ) を呼ばないとバイト数の限界に届いてしまう場合を検出する if (// ( 訳 ) 届いているなら , buffer_size_after_limit_ は非ゼロのはず buffer_size_after_limit_ > 0 && // ( 訳 ) 届いてしまう限界 が total_bytes_limit_ でないことを確認する. // その場合も Refresh ( ) を読んでエラーを出力する必要はある. total_bytes_read_ - buffer_size_after_limit_ < total_bytes_limit_ ) { // バイト数の限界に届いた legitimate_message_end_
= true ; return false ; } // Call refresh . if (! Refresh ( ) ) { // ... 細かなエラー状況の確認色々 return false ; } } //
Slow path : Just do a 64 - bit read .
uint64 result ; if ( ! ReadVarint64 ( &result ) ) return false ; * value = ( uint32 ) result ; return true ; } }
ポイントは , バッファの残量によって処理をわけているところ.
ストリームのバッファをコピーしないポリシー( zero copy ) でコードが書かれているため , 値がバッファの終端をまたく場合に備えて面倒な処理が必要になる .
そこで終端をまたがないケースを特別扱いして高速化している.
大半はこっちに入りそうだよね.
CodedInputStream や CodedOutputStream には こんなかんじの細々したコードが入っている . でも長いのでつづきは割愛 .
DynamicMessage
ここまでのコードで , 自分が生成した Message クラスを読み書きする仕組みはおおよそわかったと思う .
さて , 素朴なシリアライザでは , 直列化したオブジェクトは元のクラスの定義がないと復元できない.
protobuf にはクラス定義のないデータを操作するために DynamicMessage というオブジェクトが用意されている .
DynamicMessage を使うと , C++ としての定義を持たない
Message も descriptor さえあれば復元することができる .
復元した Message はリフレクションごしに操作する .
この仕組みを使うことで , たとえばデータのビューアのような汎用データ操作プログラムや , 異なるバージョン間のフォーマットコンバータのようなクラスベースだとやりにくいコードを書くことができる.
DynamicMessage クラスは dynamic_message.cc で定義され , クライアントには公開されていない. クライアントは DynamicMessageFactory を通じてこのインスタンスを取り出す .
// dynamic_message.h class LIBPROTOBUF_EXPORT
DynamicMessageFactory : public MessageFactory { public : ... const Message * GetPrototype( const Descriptor * type ) ; ... }
リフレクションに必要な Descriptor は DescriptorProto から構築できたのを思いだそう .
さて , 肝心の DynamicMessage はどんなクラスなのだろうか .
// dynamic_message.cc class DynamicMessage : public Message { public : ... // 一連のメソッド定義 ... private : ... const Descriptor * descriptor_ ; const DescriptorPool * descriptor_pool_ ; DynamicMessageFactory * factory_ ; scoped_ptr<ExtensionSet > extensions_ ; GeneratedMessageReflection reflection_ ; uint8 * base_ ; const uint8 * prototype_base_ ; const int* offsets_ ; int size_ ; mutable int cached_byte_size_ ; } ;
reflection には通常のメッセージ同様 GeneratedMessageReflection を使いそうだ .
それはさておき , base_ , prototype_base_ , size_ あたりがあやしい .
コンストラクタに進もう .
DynamicMessage :: DynamicMessage( const Descriptor * descriptor , uint8 * base , const uint8 * prototype_base , int size , const int offsets [ ] , const DescriptorPool * pool , DynamicMessageFactory * factory ) : descriptor_( descriptor ) , descriptor_pool_ ( ( pool == NULL ) ? descriptor -> file ( ) -> pool ( ) : pool ) , factory _( factory ) , extensions_( descriptor->extension_range_count ( ) >
0 ? new ExtensionSet ( descriptor , descriptor_pool_ , factory_ ) : NULL ) , reflection_ ( descriptor , base , prototype_base , offsets , // has_bits reinterpret_cast < uint32*>( base + size ) - DivideRoundingUp( descriptor->field_count ( ) , bitsizeof ( uint32 ) ) , extensions_.get ( ) ) , base_ ( base ) , prototype_base_( prototype_base ) , offsets_( offsets ) , size_ ( size ) , cached_byte_size_ ( 0 ) { // ( 訳 ) 各フィールドのコンストラクタを手動で呼び出し , あるならデフォルト値をセットする. // placement new について聞いたことがないなら , 今すぐググるとよい . // 一貫性のため , コンストラクタを持たないプリミティブ型についても placement new を呼ぶ .
// ( 理論上は , 型なしのメモリを型ありのメモリにする時はいつも placement new を使うべきだ .
// しかし実際はコンストラクタの無い型についてそう厳密である必要はない. ) for ( int i = 0 ; i < descriptor -> field_count ( ) ; i++) { const FieldDescriptor * field = descriptor -> field ( i ) ; void * field_ptr = base + offsets [i ] ; switch ( field -> cpp_type ( ) ) { # define HANDLE_TYPE( CPPTYPE , TYPE ) \ case FieldDescriptor :: CPPTYPE_##CPPTYPE : \ if ( !field->is_repeated ( ) ) { \ new ( field_ptr ) TYPE ( field->default_value_##TYPE ( ) ) ; \ } else { \ new ( field_ptr ) RepeatedField < TYPE >( ) ; \ } \ break ; HANDLE_TYPE ( INT32 , int32 ) ; HANDLE_TYPE ( INT64 , int64 ) ; HANDLE_TYPE ( UINT32 , uint32 ) ; HANDLE_TYPE ( UINT64 , uint64 ) ; HANDLE_TYPE ( DOUBLE , double ) ; HANDLE_TYPE ( FLOAT , float ) ; HANDLE_TYPE ( BOOL , bool ) ; #undef HANDLE_TYPE case FieldDescriptor :: CPPTYPE_ENUM : .... case FieldDescriptor :: CPPTYPE_STRING : .... case FieldDescriptor :: CPPTYPE_MESSAGE : { // ( 訳 ) オブジェクトがプロトタイプなら , CPPTYPE_MESSAGE
フィールドは初期化を // あとまわしにしなければならない. CrossLinkPrototypes ( ) を使う. だからここでは初期化しない. if ( !is_prototype ( ) ) { if ( ! field->is_repeated ( ) ) { new ( field_ptr ) Message *( NULL ) ; } else { ... } } break ; } } } }
コメントが丁寧なので特に申しあげることはございません...
base_ など , いくつかのフィールドがコンストラクタの外側から与えられているのは気になる.
呼び出し元を見てみよう .
Message * DynamicMessage :: New ( ) const { uint8 * new_base = reinterpret_cast < uint8 *>( operator new ( size_ ) ) ; memset ( new_base , 0 , size_ ) ; return new DynamicMessage ( GetDescriptor ( ) , new_base , prototype_base_ , size_ , offsets_ , descriptor_pool_ , factory_ ) ; }
base_ は動的に確保し , 他は自分自身からコピーしている .
最初のインスタンス( プロトタイプ ) を作るところを探そう .
const Message * DynamicMessageFactory :: GetPrototype(const Descriptor * type ) { const Message ** target = & prototypes_ -> map_[type ] ; if ( * target != NULL ) { //
Already exists .
return * target ; } // ( 訳 ) // GeneratedMessageReflection のコンストラクタに渡す構造をすべて作る必要がある. // - メッセージのフィールドを含むメモリブロック
// - そのメモリブロック内のフィールドのオフセットをあらわす整数値の配列
// - フィールドがセットされているかどうかをあらわしたビットを保持する大きなビットフィールド // // Compute size and offsets .
int* offsets = new int[ type->field_count ( ) ] ; // ( 訳 ) // メッセージのフィールドをサイズの降順にソートする. // その順序ならフィールドをタイトに詰め込めるし , 全てのフィールドが正しく整列( align ) される. // フィールドは 2 の階乗か , システムのワードサイズの倍数をもつからだ. scoped_array < const FieldDescriptor*> ordered_fields ( new const FieldDescriptor *[ type->field_count ( ) ] ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < type->field_count ( ) ; i++) { ordered_fields [ i ] = type -> field ( i ) ; } stable_sort ( &ordered_fields [0 ] , &ordered_fields[type->field_count ( ) ] , DescendingFieldSizeOrder ( ) ) ; //
Decide all field offsets by packing in order .
int current_offset = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < type->field_count ( ) ; i++) { offsets[ ordered_fields [i]-> index ( ) ] = current_offset ; current_offset += FieldSpaceUsed(ordered_fields[i ] ) ; } // ( 訳 ) 全てのフィールドと has_bits ぶんのメモリを確保する .
has_bits は終端にくっつける .
int size = current_offset + DivideRoundingUp(type->field_count( ) , bitsizeof ( uint32 ) ) * sizeof ( uint32 ) ; // ( 訳 ) // サイズを 64 ビット境界まで繰り上げる .
こうすることで , どんな賢いアロケータも // アラインメントについて気にしなくてよくなる. // これによって has_bits も整列する .
has_bits は常に構造体の末尾にくっつけるため. size = DivideRoundingUp( size , sizeof ( uint64 ) ) * sizeof ( uint64 ) ; uint8 * base = reinterpret_cast < uint8 *>( operator new ( size ) ) ; memset ( base , 0 , size ) ; // Construct message .
DynamicMessage * result = new DynamicMessage ( type , base , base , size , offsets , pool_ , this ) ; * target = result ; result -> CrossLinkPrototypes( this ) ; return result ; }
コメントが丁寧なので特に申しあげることはございません... CrossLinkPrototypes ( ) は色々やってるけど割愛 .
DynamicMessage はコンパイラばりに自らのフィールドを初期化し , reflective な操作を実現している .
これに関数ポインタテーブルを追加すれば , ほとんど言語処理系のオブジェクトモデルと変わらないような気がする.
( GC はないけど ...)
コンパイ ラ
これでランタイムは一通り眺めた . 残るはコンパイラ .
疲れてきたのでささっと済ませます .
コンパイラの作りはおおよそ次のようになっている : フロントエンド(? ) が . proto ファイルを読み込み , descriptor オブジェクトを構築する .
descriptor はバックエンド ( ? ) のコード生成器に渡される .
コード生成器は指定された descriptor を解釈す る Message 実装のソースコードを生成する .
コード生成器は C++ , Java , Python と言語毎に用意されている .
中間モデルに descriptor を使い回している作りのため , コンパイラ自身の仕事ほとんど文字列を読んだり書いたりするだけ.
あまり面白くない .
ただ .proto から Descriptor を作る部分はツールとして使えると便利そう. 実際 , 該当機能は Importer クラスとして公開されている .
//importer.h class LIBPROTOBUF_EXPORT
Importer { public : Importer ( SourceTree * source_tree , MultiFileErrorCollector* error_collector ) ; ... const FileDescriptor * Import ( const string& filename ) ; ... } ;
Importer は内部で Parser を利用する .
Parser の実装は手書きの再帰下降方式 . 面倒なので割愛 .
みどころ再訪と個人的な印象
そんなわけでコードを一通り眺めた .
以上をふまえて冒頭に書いた見所を再確認してみる.
直列化の自己記述度 : データは基本的にタグと値の列でしかなく , 自己記述度は低い . ( そのぶん空間効率は良い . ) タグには型の ID が入っているので , オブジェクトは復元できないまでも , 不明な要素を読み飛ばすことはできる .
またメタデータである descriptor も直列化できるため , アプリケーションレベルで自己記述度の高いデータを設計するのは難しくない .
バージョニングへの対処 : バージョン情報そのものはない .
古いプログラムが新しいデータを復元するときは , 新しい追加フィールドを " unknown field " として保持する .
unknown field は直列化時に書き戻されるため , データが失われることはない .
古いデータを新しいプログラムが読むときは , 新しい追加フィールドが必須のものでない限りエラーにならない.
フィールドは空のままになる.
データ内のフィールドは ID だけで識別されているため , . proto のフィールド宣言で ID を変更すると互換性は失われる .
ID が同じで型を変更したフィールドは " unknown field " として扱われる .
クラスのないオブジェクトを扱う DynamicMessage の仕組みがあり , 非互換な変更の行われたデータを手動で変換することができる.
やりたくないけど .
またメッセージの定義を変更せず付加データを与える extension という仕組みもある . ( 読んでない . )
オブジェクトグラフの自由度 : 複雑なオブジェクトグラフは想定されていない.
合流や循環は保存されない. ( データを再帰的に読みつつインスタンス化するだけ.)
オブジェクトモデルの自己記述度 : 自己記述度は高い . . proto の記述内容は descriptor オブジェクトを通して実行時にも参照できる .
reflective な操作もできる .
DynamicMessage や Importer など , 実行時に型を構築する仕組みがある . ただ , . proto 自体はそれほど表現能力が高くない .
IDL のような継承やらメソッドやらはない .
ランタイムとコード生成の役割分担 : 直列化のコードは , リフレクションとランタイムを使ったコンパクトな実装が標準で用意されている.
オプションで専用の直列化コードを生成することもできる.
生成されたリフレクション情報 ( descriptor ) は永続化されたバイナリ形式でソースコードに埋め込まれ , 実行時に復元される .
...
こうしてみると , C++ で reflective なオブジェクトモデルを作るという宿命的負け戦を適当にしのぎつつ , そこそこ高速で堅牢なデータ定義を実現しているのがわかる.
内製ツールという利点もあるのだろう .
売り物にしようとしたらもっと色々な機能や高級なオブジェクトモデルが求められ , 複雑さを割けるのは難しくなるだろうから.
統一された寿命管理の仕組みがない点は少し気になった .
オブジェクトは静的に確保するものもあるし , 動的にヒープへ確保するものもある. 動的なオブジェクトには , 呼び出し側が delete しなければいけないものがある一方 , prototype や descriptor など delete してはいけないオブジェクトもある .
おそらく色々イディオムがあるのだろう.
真似をするコードがある中の人はいいけれど , 外野がスクラッチで protobuf を使おうとしたら , それなりに苦労するかもしれない .
特に非同期や RPC では寿命管理が面倒だからね ...
おまけ
//common.h ... namespace google { namespace protobuf { using namespace std ; //
Do n't do this at home , kids .

In the wake of the recent flooding in Iowa , the state 's attorney general has announced that Iowa 's rules against price gouging are now in effect .
These rules prohibit businesses from " substantially raising the prices for needed goods or services without justification " in the wake of a natural disaster .
According to a June 23 press release from the Iowa attorney general 's office , the rule covers not only the time during which the disaster is declared but also a " ' subsequent recovery period ' up to six months . "
Missouri 's attorney general is also encouraging Missourians to report " price gouging on necessary supplies like water , ice , storage units , and generators . "
Enforcing these restrictions will have predictable effects : shortages of needed supplies , long lines , delayed repairs , and , perhaps , increased incivility .
Like other forms of price control , price - gouging statutes will hurt precisely the people they are intended to help .
There are several channels through which this happens .
First , price controls create shortages because they eliminate the market 's way of telling people to conserve scarce resources .
After a disaster like a flood , a hurricane , or a tornado , demand for some goods increases while the supply of some goods decreases .
If prices are not allowed to adjust , people will want more " water , ice , storage units , and generators " than the market is prepared to supply at the controlled price .
As Michael Munger , chairman of Duke University 's political science department , has pointed out , this means that the effective price of a good for which the price has been controlled is infinite : beyond the amount that the market will supply at the controlled price , nothing can be done to call more goods into existence .
Instead of relying on prices , governments that institute price controls must rely instead on moral suasion .
This will help in some cases , but it is unlikely to be as effective as a price increase .
One might be tempted to respond that the government should be able to make up for the shortage , but the government 's performance in similar cases , such as FEMA 's ham - fisted response to Hurricane Katrina , provides us with grounds to be skeptical of this claim .
Restricting the price mechanism also means that recovery will be delayed .
If prices are allowed to fluctuate freely , resources will be directed to where they are most desperately needed .
Someone who wishes to build a new deck in San Antonio will have to think twice if lumber prices increase because people in Iowa are struggling to rebuild their houses .
If lumber prices are not allowed to change , our deck - builder in San Antonio lacks the signal he needs to learn that the lumber he would otherwise use to build a deck might be better used rebuilding houses in Iowa .
In addition to these restrictions , many states also restrict who can participate in the market for home repair after a natural disaster .
It is indeed true that some people are taken advantage of by the unscrupulous during a desperate hour , but restrictions on who can provide home - repair services and at what price after a natural disaster also keep many an honest business person out of the market .
Some people are protected from predators and scammers , but as a result , many more are unable to secure the services they want at a low price .
This may also have an undesirable unintended consequence with respect to home safety .
After Hurricane Katrina , I remember reading a short newspaper article about do - it - yourself roof repair because of the shortage of roofing services after the disaster .
Should disaster strike I am by no means qualified to repair my own roof , foundation , walls , etc. ; however , restrictions on who can and cannot supply these services in the market means that I might be faced with the choice of doing the job myself or leaving it undone .
Anyone who has ever seen me swing a hammer knows that if I were to do the job myself it would be at best a marginal improvement over leaving the job undone .
I am blessed with friends who are pretty good at that sort of thing , but I would guess that there are many others who are not so fortunate .
People 's time is also valuable .
A computer programmer who has to fix his own roof does so at the cost of time spent programming .
The law of comparative advantage tells us that if he were able to devote his time to computer programming and use the income he earns to pay a professional to fix his roof , society will have more of both computer programming and roof repair .
Restricting who can and cannot trade roofing services for money eliminates this option for many .
The unintended consequence of restrictions on who can participate in the market is straightforward and ironic : restrictions aimed at ensuring access to high - quality repairs at low prices are more likely to mean low - quality repairs at high prices for many storm victims .
Price controls can also be bad for social fabric , though as far as I know this remains an untested proposition .
Price controls mean that some businesses will close when they otherwise would have remained open after a disaster .
The sight of a business closing up shop during a disaster victim 's hour of need might breed ill will .
In addition , long gas lines filled with disaster victims nursing frayed nerves can be fairly volatile environments .
In a recent EconTalk podcast , Russ Roberts and Richard McKenzie discussed fistfights in long gas lines during the gas price controls of the early 1970s .
Massive price increases create social tension ( see the food riots that have erupted around the world , for example ) , but price controls also pit neighbor against neighbor for scarce resources .
Finally , enforcing price controls also requires resources .
For the government , people who are engaged in identifying and prosecuting " price gougers " are necessarily diverted from maintaining law and order .
For firms , the possibility of prosecution introduces additional uncertainties into their calculations and diverts them from their core business of delivering goods and services to the customer .
Over the long run , this makes us poorer and therefore less well equipped to deal with future disasters .
Economic critiques of price controls are well worn .
Nonetheless , these simple points bear repeating over and over again because price controls after natural disasters are so popular .
The economic critique is more than an academic exercise or an attempt to apologize for the unscrupulous , as some critics maintain .
Price controls have very real human costs .
Some of these costs are quite apparent and some are harder to see .
To the extent that they are attributable to price controls , though , they are avoidable .
The original NMOS version of the MOS 6502 , used in computers like the Commodore 64 , the Apple II and the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) , is well - known for its illegal opcodes :
Out of 256 possible opcodes , 151 are defined by the architecture , but many of the remaining 105 undefined opcodes do useful things .
Many articles have been written to test and document these , but I am not aware of any article that tries to explain where exactly they come from .
I ’ll do this here .
The Block Diagram
Every 6502 data sheet comes with a block diagram , but these are of no use , because they are oversimplified , partially incorrect , and do n’t explain how instruction decoding works .
The following more detailed diagram is a lot more useful :
( Original from Apple II things )
The Decode ROM ( PLA )
There is no need to understand the whole diagram .
The important part is on the left :
The instruction register , which holds the opcode , and the current clock cycle within the instruction ( T0 to T6 ) get fed into a 130 ×21 bit decode ROM , i.e. a ROM with 130 lines of 21 bits each .
On the die shot , this is the green area on the bottom .
( Original from Molecular Expressions )
While other CPUs from the same era used microcode to interpret the instruction , the 6502 had this 130×21 bit PLA .
All lines of the PLA compare the instruction and the current clock cycle , and if they match , the line fires .
A little simplified , every line looks like this :
ON bits OFF bits timing 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 T6 T5 T4 T3 T2 T1
( See the diagrams at http://impulzus.sch.bme.hu/6502/ for details ; partial English translation of the website here ) .
“ ON bits ” specifies , which bits need to be set for this line to fire .
specifies , which bits need to be for this line to fire .
“ OFF bits ” specifies , which bits need to be clear for this line to fire .
The opcode table of the 6502 is laid out in a way that you can find easy rules to generalize the effects of similar opcodes .
For example , the branch opcodes are encoded like this :
%aab10000
where “ aa ” is the condition ( 00=N , 01=V , 10=C , 11=Z ) and “ b ” decides whether the branch is taken on a set or a clear flag .
So the following line would fire on the first cycle of any branch :
ON bits OFF bits timing 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 T6 T5 T4 T3 T2 T1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1
From now on , let ’s write it differently , so that it ’s more readable :
mask cycle description XXX10000 T1 T1 of Bcc : fetch branch offset
If a line fires , it outputs a “ 1 ” .
The “ Random Control Logic ” that can seen in the diagram then AND / OR - combines some lines and feeds the result into various components of the CPU :
In the case of a branch , this would result in fetching the branch offset , for example .
One line can fire for several opcodes that are similar in their encoding and thus their behavior :
For example , “ LDA abs ” , “ ORA abs ” and “ AND abs ” all do the same thing ( fetch the low byte of the address ) in T1 , so there can be a line that matches all these opcodes and causes a memory fetch and a PC increment .
Also , multiple lines can fire at the same time for any given cycle within an instruction , which will have the combined effect of the single lines .
LDA and LDX becomes LAX
Now there are many undefined opcodes .
The designers of the 6502 have not created any specific PLA lines for them , but since their opcodes are similar to well - defined opcodes , there might be lines that fire nevertheless .
Let ’s take opcode $ AF for example , which is “ LAX absolute ” .
It loads a value from an absolute address in memory and stores it in A and X at the same time .
This is somewhat the combination of opcodes $ AD ( LDA abs ) and $ AE ( LDX abs ) .
The instructions “ LDA / LDX / LDY abs ” ( $ AC / $ AD / $ AE ) consist of four cycles :
The first cycle fetches the low byte of the address .
The second cycle fetches the hgh byte of the address .
The third cycle fetches the address from memory and stores it in A / X/Y .
The fourth cycle fetches the next instruction .
Cycles T1 , T2 and T4 are identical for all three of them , and they are encoded smilarly , so the following three PLA lines can be used to detect these instructions and signal the rest of the CPU to carry out the specific tasks :
mask cycle description 101011XX T1 T1 of $ AC / $AD / $AE : fetch addr /lo 101011XX T2 T2 of $ AC / $AD / $ AE : fetch addr / lo 101011XX T4 T4 of $ AC / $AD / $ AE : fetch next opcode
The mask % 101011XX does n’t only fire for $ AC / $ AD / $ AE , but also for the undefined opcode $ AF : So $ AF ( LAX ) behaves the same as LDA / LDX / LDY in T1/T2 / T4 , i.e. it fetches a 16 bit address and in the end fetches the next opcode .
T3 differs in all three cases , so it has to be handled by one separate line per case :
mask cycle description 10101100 T3 T3 of $ AC : read into Y 101011X1 T3 T3 of $ AD : read into A 1010111X T3 T3 of $ AE : read into X
( Actually , the lines in the actual PLA might be less specific , i.e. contain more X bits , since there are similar instructions like “ ORA absolute ” that might share this line . )
The line for $ AC is only true for the exact value of $ AC , but the $ AD and $ AE lines have one “ do n’t care ” bit each .
The bitfield of $ AF , which is % 10101111 , is true for both masks , so in T3 of $ AF , both the $ AD and the $ AE lines fire .
In T3 , LDA / LDX / LDY have in common that they all read from memory and put the result onto the internal “ SB ” bus .
“ LDA ” also sets the “ SB - > AC ” control line to “ 1 ” , which will make the accumulator read its value from SB .
Likewise , LDX causes “ SB - > X ” to be “ 1 ” and makes X to read from the SB bus , and LDY reads SB into the Y register .
Since both the LDA and the LDX lines fire , both the accumulator and the X register will be sent the command to load their values from the SB bus , so $ AF is effectively an LAX : Load Accumulator and X .
The KIL Opcodes
There are many “ KIL ” opcodes , i.e. opcodes that stop the CPU , so that it can only recover using a RESET , and not even an IRQ or an NMI .
In order to understand this , let ’s look at the different states an instruction can be in .
After the instruction fetch , the CPU is in cycle T1 .
It will feed the opcode and the cycle number into the PLA and cause the rest of the CPU to carry out whatever has to be done in this cycle , according to the PLA .
Then it will shift the T bitfield left by one , so the T2 line will be “ 1 ” , then line T3 and so on .
There are seven T lines total , T1 to T7 .
At the end of each instruction , the PLA causes the T bitfield to reset , so that the next instruction starts with T1=1 again .
But what happens if T does not get reset ?
This can happen if in all seven states of T , no line fires that actually belongs to an instruction that ends at this cycle .
T gets shifted left until state T7 , in which another shift left will just shift the 1 bit out of T – all bits of T will be zero then , so no PLA line can fire any more .
All interrupt and NMI requests are always delayed until the current instruction is finished , i.e. until T gets reset .
But since T never gets reset , all interrupts and NMIs are effectively disabled .
What ’s next ?
There are many illegal opcodes , some with very weird behavior , and some that have been documented as unstable .
Studying all these can reveal many interesting details about the internal design of the 6502 .

Police in London are on the lookout for £ 200 frozen - gas knives designed to kill bears and sharks , according to the never - inflammatory Daily Mail .
The manufacturer describes [ the Wasp Knife ] as perfect for downed pilots , soldiers and security guards and boasts that it will " drop many of the world 's largest land predators " .
It can snap - freeze all tissue and organs in the area surrounding the blast .
A source close to West Midlands Police said : " The Met is obviously concerned about this and that is why they have circulated the information .
" This knife will almost certainly kill and the Met must have intelligence that they are in circulation .
" I think it is only a matter of time before one of these is used because the internet makes it much easier to find and buy weapons like this . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government ’s campaign against television indecency was dealt a blow on Monday when a court overturned a $ 550,000 fine against CBS Corp television stations for airing a glimpse of pop singer Janet Jackson ’s breast during the 2004 Super Bowl broadcast .
Janet Jackson ( L ) reacts after fellow singer Justin Timberlake ripped off one of her chest plates at the end of their half time performance at Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston , February 1 , 2004 .
REUTERS / Win McNamee
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said the Federal Communications Commission had “ arbitrarily and capriciously departed from its prior policy ” that exempted fleeting broadcast material from actionable indecency violations .
Jackson ’s right breast was exposed to almost 90 million TV viewers for a fraction of a second during the live 2004 Super Bowl football halftime show in what fellow pop singer Justin Timberlake later called a “ wardrobe malfunction . ”
Timberlake ripped off part of Jackson ’s bustier exposing Jackson ’s breast during the show .
Despite the brevity , lawmakers and regulators were outraged and vowed a crackdown on broadcast indecency .
The judges rejected the FCC ’s argument that the “ fleeting ” policy had only applied to words , not images .
“ Like any agency , the FCC may change its policies without judicial second - guessing .
But it cannot change a well - established course of action without supplying notice of and a reasoned explanation for its policy departure , ” Chief Judge Anthony Scirica wrote for the three - judge panel that heard the case .
CBS said in a statement that it hoped the decision by the Philadelphia - based court “ will lead the FCC to return to the policy of restrained indecency enforcement it followed for decades . ”
“ This is an important win for the entire broadcasting industry because it recognizes that there are rare instances , particularly during live programming , when it may not be possible to block unfortunate fleeting material , despite best efforts , ” CBS said in its statement .
The decision drew a sharp rebuke from the Parents Television Council , an indecency watchdog group .
It said the ruling “ borders on judicial stupidity ” and urged lawmakers in Congress to pass a bill to strengthen anti-indecency enforcement .
“ If a striptease during the Super Bowl in front of 90 million people , including millions of children , does n’t fit the parameters of broadcast indecency , then what does ? ” the group asked .
There was no immediate comment from the FCC on Monday ’s ruling .
Under the administration of President George W. Bush , the agency has embarked on a crackdown of indecent content on broadcast TV and radio .
The FCC could seek a review of Monday ’s decision by the full appeals court .
It also could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal .
In that case , it would have 90 days to file a petition with the high court .
The Supreme Court is scheduled to decide another case on FCC indecency enforcement during the upcoming term , which begins in October .
That case stemmed from an FCC ruling in March 2006 in which the agency found News Corp ’s
Fox television network violated decency rules when singer Cher blurted “ fuck ” during the 2002 Billboard Music Awards broadcast , and actress Nicole Richie used a variation of that word and “ shit ” during the 2003 awards .
U.S. television and radio broadcasters are barred from airing obscene material and are limited from broadcasting indecent materials between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. , when children are likely to be watching .
The restrictions do not apply to cable or satellite services .
CBS and cable music network MTV , which produced the Super Bowl halftime show , insisted they did not know in advance about the wardrobe stunt .
CBS apologized and paid the fine , $ 27,500 for each of the 20 stations it owns , and later instituted a five - second delay on most of its live events .
The appeals court said CBS could not be held responsible for the incident .
“ Moreover , the FCC cannot impose liability on CBS for the acts of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake , independent contractors hired for the limited purposes of the Halftime Show ... , ” Scirica wrote .

JUST under half of the young adults aged 18 to 24 have never left home , mainly because they can't afford to .
The Bureau of Statistics has released a survey revealing the latest trends on family households , based on the responses of more than 30,000 Australians .
A smaller sample of 12,200 were asked more detailed questions about their expectations about marriage , whether their parents had divorced or separated during their childhood and whether they had left home .
It found almost half ( 47 % ) of the young adults aged 18 to 24 had never left home , falling to 14 % for those aged 25 to 34 .
Although 44 % cited money as the main reason for living at home , 33 % said they stayed because of the " convenience or enjoyment " of living with their parents .
The survey also asked women aged 18 to 49 about whether they expected to have children , with many saying they or their partner were too old .
And you will hear wars and rumors of wars .
See that you are not troubled ; for all these things must come to pass , but the end is not yet .
For nation will raise against nation , and Kingdom against kingdom .
And there will be famines , pestilences , and earthquakes in various places .
And also there will be MOUNTAIN DEW FLAVORED DORITOS :
So the bag says " The Quest : Guessing the Flavor is Just the Beginning " but I 'll save you some time .
Initial research indicated the flavor was " lime " like those " Tostitos with Lime , " but further lunch - time research via the crappy Flash apps at " Snack Strong Productions " reveals the chips are supposed to taste like : Mountain Dew soda .
Truly , these are the end times .
Gather your loved ones and bring them north to the caves .
At the mouth of the cave , tell the oldest to enter and wait for two flares .
Until the time when it will be safe to emerge , it will be your job to protect them , teach them , remind them every so often about the flares , but most importantly warn them -- about why they should never , ever put Mountain Dew - flavored tortilla chips in their mouth .

Index of / tests / evil / acid/004
Acid4 will be primarily a visual test , not especially scripted .
It will likely focus on the following specifications and areas : * http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-multicol/
* http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-background/
It may also include subpixel positioning ; will likely be partially or entirely in rtl mode and may contain non-ASCII Unicode characters with special formatting requirements , e.g. U+200B ; and may contain empty inline boxes that are styled .
The test itself will not be developed in public , but a list of features tested will be compiled and distributed before the test is announced to ensure there is broad agreement on the set of features tested .
Before it is announced , browser vendors will be asked to suggest the best six - month window for release in the next 12 months .
LESSONS FROM ACID3 ========================================================================
- do n't include minor bugs - do n't ask for specific tests , write the tests yourself - request feedback from early on ( t=0 ) in the cycle , both publically and directly to specific people - ask for feedback about what things to test - do n't actually show the test early in the cycle , to prevent people from targetting it while people are discussing what to test - no performance stuff as part of the test ( though as a separate competition is ok if you get everyone to sign off on the test being fair ) - make it have a pretty picture - ask browsers for advice on timing the announcment of the test ========================================================================
ROUGH NOTES ========================================================================

Am I missing something ?
Opera 9 has bugs in how it handles right - to - left sections ( used for Arabic , Hebrew , etc. ) .
In particular it reverses right and left padding on boxes , which is wrong .
It would be a very valuable addition to Acid3 to put either < tag dir=rtl > or .class {direction : rtl} on the page to verify that table and box rendering is correct in that mode .

Test implicit calls of function overrides ======= var org = String.prototype.toString ; // backup original function String.prototype.toString = function ( ) { return " xyz " ; } var idx = " abc" .indexOf ( "y " ) ; String.prototype.toString = org ; // avoid side effects if ( idx != 1 ) throw " toString ( ) override not in effect " ; return 5 ; ============================================================
Reasoning based on the ECMAScript Edition 3 spec : the lookup of the " indexOf " property will be done after the primitive string value is promoted with ToObject ( ) ( 11.21.1 Property Accessors ) .
This will result in a String object .
The String.prototype.indexOf ( ) function found by the " indexOf " lookup is defined to call ToString on the " this " value ( 15.5.4.7 ) .
Section 9.8 says that ToString will first call ToPrimitive ( ) and then ToString ( ) on the result .
ToPrimitive ( ) will call the internal [ [ DefaultValue ] ] function ( 9.1 ) .
Section 8.6.2.6 defines [ [ DefaultValue ] ] to execute a toString ( ) function should it exist .
And that 's the point where a custom function set by the JS programmer should be respected .

Washington is teeing up " the rich " for a big tax hike next year , as a way to make them " pay their fair share . "
Well , the latest IRS data have arrived on who paid what share of income taxes in 2006 , and it 's going to be hard for the rich to pay any more than they already do .
The data show that the 2003 Bush tax cuts caused what may be the biggest increase in tax payments by the rich in American history .
The nearby chart shows that the top 1 % of taxpayers , those who earn above $ 388,806 , paid 40 % of all income taxes in 2006 , ...

WASHINGTON  Congressional investigators said Tuesday that Medicare had paid tens of millions of dollars to suppliers improperly using identification numbers of doctors who died years ago .
The government has no reliable way to spot claims linked to dead doctors , many of whom are still listed as active Medicare providers though they died 10 or 15 years ago , the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said .
Medicare covers wheelchairs , walkers , home oxygen equipment and many other types of medical equipment .
When suppliers file claims for equipment provided to a Medicare beneficiary , they normally must list an identification number for the doctor who prescribed or ordered it .
“ From 2000 to 2007 , Medicare paid 478,500 claims containing identification numbers that were assigned to deceased physicians , ” the subcommittee said in a new report .
“ The total amount paid for these claims is estimated to be between $ 60 million and $ 92 million .
These claims contained identification numbers for an estimated 16,548 to 18,240 deceased physicians . ”

Following the much - reported problems that PlayStation 3 gamers have experienced with Rockstar ’s Grand Theft Auto IV , the latest news is that the game is also causing significant problems for gamers on Xbox 360 .
Reports from a number of 360 sites are that the Xbox 360 version of GTA IV has been causing freezing issues and ‘ bricking ’ some consoles with the dreaded ' Red Ring of Death ' problem , the ongoing PR disaster which continues to haunt Microsoft ’s Xbox division .
RAM strain
" If you guys actually read and check Rockstar 's official GTA IV forums , you 'll find out that they are aware of the freezing problems for PS3 and 360 .
Their current workaround is : " Delete your saved game , and start over . " " claimed one forum post on Xbox.com
Others report that , due to the fact that it has been designed to have no loading delays within the game , GTA IV overloads the cache , causing the Xbox 360 to freeze , with calls for Rockstar to release a patch that limits the strain on the Xbox 360 ’s RAM .
TechRadar has contacted Microsoft and Rockstar today for further clarity on this issue , so stay tuned for updates .
A written review and a video review from Gamespot , they state most of the same points that the other reviews have cited , but they give the game a much lowe ...
The United States must do everything possible to prevent Texas from executing five Mexican nationals on death row in the state while their cases are being considered by the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , judges in the Netherlands - based tribunal ruled Wednesday .
Mexico contends that dozens of its citizens facing execution in U.S. jails have been denied their right to consular access after their arrests on capital crimes charges .
A series of ICJ rulings have gone in Mexico ’s favour since 2004 , when the court ordered the U.S. to review the cases of 51 Mexicans facing the death penalty in U.S. jails .
President George W. Bush complied with that order and asked Texas to postpone executions of Mexican convicts , but Texas got a U.S. Supreme Court ruling the following year that said Bush had overstepped his authority .
The state pressed ahead with plans to execute Jose Medellin and has set Aug.
5 as the date he will die by lethal injection .
Medellin was convicted of the rape and murder of two teenage girls in 1993 .
His lawyers say he was denied his right to see Mexican Embassy officials during his incarceration , but prosecutors said he did n't ask for that right until he had been sentenced to death .
Four other Mexican citizens face imminent execution in Texas .
ICJ has no jurisdiction , U.S. argues
Wednesday ’s ICJ ruling says Bush and the U.S. government must try to stop the state from carrying out those death sentences .
" The court indicates that the United States of America shall take all measures necessary to ensure that five Mexican nationals are not executed , pending its final judgment , " Judge Rosalyn Higgins said .
The ICJ exists to settle disputes between UN member states , and though its rulings are seen as binding , there is no enforcement mechanism .
U.S. State Department lawyer John Bellinger argued that the ICJ did not have jurisdiction because Bush agreed with Mexico and there was no dispute .
" It almost never happens that the federal government enters [ into ] state court proceedings , " he said , calling the Bush 's intervention " highly unusual . "
Mexico's chief advocate , Juan Manuel Gomez - Robledo , told the court the U.S. was nonetheless " in breach of its international obligations . "
He said international law applies not only to nations , but to their component states .
He asked the court to clarify its earlier ruling and in the meantime intercede with U.S. authorities to halt the schedule of executions .
Mexico abolished capital punishment in 2005 and objects in principle to the U.S. and other countries sentencing its citizens to die .
The ICJ acknowledged that the U.S. federal government " has been taking many diverse and insistent measures " to persuade Texas not to carry out executions of any of the Mexicans covered by the original 2004 ruling .
Bellinger said that the international court has limited powers over U.S. states or federal authorities in Washington .
" It does not have technical legal effect in the United States that would … have a direct impact either on the United States or on Texas itself , " he said .
Federal authorities were still discussing the case " constructively " with Texas , Bellinger said , and " Texas does take this all very seriously . "
Mexico's ambassador to the Netherlands , Jorge Lomonaco Tonda , said he was satisfied with Wednesday ’s ruling and did n’t expect any executions to take place before a final court decision .
There has been no comment from the Texas authorities on the court order .
The actress Tatum O’Neal was arrested recently on charges of buying crack cocaine from a man on the street near her New York City home .
She is a 44 - year - old mother of three .
She has spent years in and out of drug abuse treatment ( which she chronicled in her 2004 memoir ) , and according to her publicist she will continue to “ attend meetings ” for drug and alcohol abuse .
Ms. O’Neal illustrates a disturbing trend among those being admitted to substance abuse treatment services : a growing percentage of older women are being treated for harder drugs .
Data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration revealed that the total number of admissions to treatment services from 1996 to 2005 ( the last year for which detailed data are available ) stayed about the same among people under 40 , but jumped 52 percent among those 40 and older .
Of the 40 and older group , the rise in admissions among men was 44 percent .
Among women , it was 82 percent .
( During the same span , the population in the United States age 40 and older grew by only 19 percent . )
Iran is already under UN sanctions for its nuclear activities
Iran has responded to an incentives offer for halting uranium enrichment , Iranian and EU officials say .
They say the response was delivered to EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana , without giving any further details .
The incentives package from China , the EU , France , Russia , the UK and US was offered to Iran by Mr Solana in June .
He also asked Iran to accept a six - week freeze on further developments on its controversial programme , in return for a similar freeze on new UN sanctions .
The UN Security Council approved a third round of sanctions against Iran over the issue in March 2008 .
Separately , the EU also imposed new sanctions on Iran in June .
Tehran denies Western claims that it is seeking to build a nuclear weapon , saying its programme is peaceful .
It has repeatedly rejected demands to halt enriching uranium , which can be used as fuel for power plants or material for weapons if refined to a greater degree .
Incentives
Tehran 's response was delivered to Mr Solana by Iran 's ambassador in Belgium , Iran 's official Irna news agency said , quoting an unnamed Iranian official .
The official said the response was signed by Iranian Foreign Minister Manoucher Mottaki .
A spokeswoman for Mr Solana later confirmed that the office had received Tehran 's reply .
Iran 's state TV also said that Iran 's top nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili had a telephone conversation with Mr Solana on Friday .
The incentives package builds on a previous offer of 2006 and says that if Iran suspends uranium enrichment , then talks can start about a long - term agreement .
On offer is recognition of Iran 's right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and the treatment of Iran in " the same manner " as other states under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Iran would get help with developing nuclear power stations and be guaranteed fuel for them .
It would also be offered trade concessions , including the possible lifting of US sanctions preventing it from buying new civilian aircraft and parts .
Allen F occasionally feels out of place .
As a software developer in a large , scientific research lab , he 's one of the few people not running around in a lab coat , mumbling about things like how to stabilize the latest batch of tretonin , or how only an idiot would name it isoprovalyn instead of hydrozapam .
In fact , Allen does n't even get to wear a lab coat .
Despite not being one of the PhD 'd researchers , Allen 's work is pretty important .
He 's the one that develops simulation programs that the biologists and chemists use to save countless weeks of research time .
Of course , just as Allen is unsure of exactly how the researches use the data his programs generate , the researchers really have no idea what it takes to write the programs .
As Allen quickly learned , developing simulations programs is more tedious than difficult .
Because they 'll run for days on a cluster of very expensive computers , and especially because the derived data will be used in future simulations and tests , it 's fairly critical that the simulation programs are error - free .
This means that Allen has to spend a significant amount of time debugging and re-debugging the code on his workstation .
And that 's where the tedious parts come in .
To crunch numbers as fast as possible , the simulation programs are designed to grab every byte of available memory and peg every core on the CPU at 100 % .
Obviously , that does n't leave much computing power for anything else , which means that Allen can do little more than watch his as his computer labors away for the five , ten , or thirty minutes that it takes to run his program locally .
After realizing that almost half of his day was spent staring at his screen , Allen requested a second workstation so that he could focus on email , requirements analysis , and other tasks while his computer slaved away .
He figured that , with $ 200,000 spent each year on lab coats alone , surely he'd be granted a second computer .
Surely , Allen was wrong : his request for second computer was denied .
After all , his productivity was more than adequate , as the researchers were always raving about his hard work .
Allen was n't quite sure what to make of that , but got back to work nonetheless .
Or at least , watching his computer work .
He did , however , start paying more attention to the researcher 's compliments .
" Those cordrazine simulations worked out perfectly , " a researcher said later that week , " always impressed by how you can read that code . "
The following day , a PhD stopped over as Allen blankly stared at his screen .
" Err , I hate to break your concentration , " he remarked , " but how 's the metazine - 8 program coming along ? "
" Hey , " a chemist said as he walked by , " how come our simulation does n't have those cool visualizations ! ? "
A day later , another PhD popped - in , interrupting another staring session .
" I 've always wondered , " he said inquisitively , " does it look like that when it runs on the cluster ?
It 's almost like something out of the Matrix or something ! "
And then it dawned on him .
Allen had recently switched his XScreenSaver to XMatrix , which displayed animated green glyphs from the Matrix movie .
Prior to that , he had been running Coral , CloudLife , and other screen savers that " organically " drew different dots over the screen .
" Yep , " Allen replied jokingly , " and once you get used to looking at it , you can see the woman in the red dress . "
Eventually , Allen purchased a computer with his own money and set it up as his second workstation .
Not only did it improve his actual productivity , but his perceived productivity shot up through the roof .
With him actually typing away as the green glyphs scrolled down the screen , many were convinced that he was actually developing the Matrix .
America 's political system is coming apart .
Cities are once again burning because of the plight of what an older class of liberals used ...
Are Pot Users Criminals ?
The Tragic Case of Rachel Hoffman Rachel had to choose between going to prison or working as an informant .
July 24 , 2008  --
After being caught twice with a " baggie " of marijuana , 23 - year old Rachel Hoffman was reportedly told by police in Tallahassee , Florida that she would go to prison for four years unless she became an undercover informant .
The young woman , a recent graduate of Florida State University , was murdered during a botched sting operation two months ago .
Her case will be profiled Friday on 20/20 .
" The idea of waging a war on drugs is to protect people and here it seems like we 're putting people in harm 's way , " said Lance Block , a lawyer hired by Rachel 's parents .
The Florida Attorney General 's office says it is reviewing the procedures and protocol of the Tallahassee police .
Rachel 's case also has raised new questions about state and federal laws related to marijuana possession .
" I 'm calling her a criminal , " Tallahassee police chief Dennis Jones told 20 / 20 , who maintains that both drug dealers and drug users are considered criminals to his department .
Under Florida law , possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana is a felony .
Rachel was also found in possession of two ecstasy pills , a felony under Florida law no matter the quantity because it " has a high potential for abuse and has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States . "
The Tallahassee police chief says Rachel was suspected of selling drugs and she was rightly treated as a criminal .
" That 's my job as a police chief to find these criminals in our community and take them off the street , to make the proper arrests , " Jones told 20/20 .
Rachel 's case also is raising questions about how police recruit and use informants in undercover operations .
" There need to be some safeguards here , " said Block , the Hoffman family lawyer .
The young woman received no training before being sent to an undercover meeting to buy a large amount of drugs and a handgun from two suspects .
Police says Rachel was killed by the very handgun she was supposed to buy .
" I do n't think she understood the risk or danger that she was in , " said Block .
Rachel was in a drug court diversion program when she became an informant .

Not so - it was actually Pete with his sister Hilary .
Of course , after looking more closely at the picture , the nose looks more like Ashlee 's before she had her nose job .
The Fall Out Boy star 's vehicle got pulled over in Hollywood today .
His sister was driving but because the car belonged to the singer , he had to show the officer his license too .
It was then that Wentz learned that his drivers license had expired .
He was instructed to visit the DMV to get his paperwork in order before he gets behind the wheel again .
So tell us what you think .
Do Ashlee and her sister - in - law look like they could be twins , or sisters at the very least ?

Second was we need a holistic , cradle - to - grave approach , whatever that is . "
Turner , Manchester 9 . " Until recently I had to suffer working for a manager who used phrases such as the idiotic I 've got you in my radar in her speech , letters and e-mails .

Andy , Herts 20 . " ' Going forward ' is only half the phrase that gets up my nose - all politicians seem to use the phrase go forward together .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Dozens of partygoers at an outdoor rave near Moscow last week have lost partial vision after a laser light show burned their retinas , Russian health officials said on Monday .
Moscow city health department officials confirmed 12 cases of laser - blindness at the Central Ophthalmological Clinic , and daily newspaper Kommersant said another 17 were registered at City Hospital 32 in the centre of the capital .
Attendees at the July 5 Aquamarine Open Air Festival in Kirzhach , 80 km ( 50 miles ) northeast of Moscow , began seeking medical help days after the show , complaining of eye and vision problems , health officials told Reuters .
“ They all have retinal burns , scarring is visible on them .
Loss of vision in individual cases is as high as 80 percent , and regaining it is already impossible , ” Kommersant quoted a treating ophthalmologist as saying .
Attendees said heavy rains forced organizers to erect massive tents for the all - night dance party , and lasers that normally illuminate upwards into the sky were instead partially refracted into the ravers ’ eyes .
“ I immediately had a spot like when you stare into the sun , ” rave - attendee Dmitry told Kommersant .
“ After three days I decided to go to the hospital .
They examined me , asked if I had been at Open Air , and then put me straight in the hospital .
I did n’t even get to go home and get my stuff , ” he said .
Cosmic Connection , promoters of the Aquamarine rave , were unreachable and did not list contact numbers on their Web site .
Industry Web site www.laserfx.com said focused laser light can cause eye damage almost instantly .
The owner of a Moscow laser rental company told Reuters the accidental blindings were due to “ illiteracy on the part of technicians . ”
“ It was partly the rain , but also partly the size of the laser .
Somebody set up an extremely powerful laser for such a small space , ” said Valentin Vasiliev , who said his company did not provide the Aquamarine lasers .
Washington D.C. , June 13 , 2008 - Recently declassified documents show that the U.S. military has long sought an agreement with Baghdad that gives American forces virtually unfettered freedom of action , casting into doubt the Bush administration 's current claims that their demands are more limited in scope .
News reports have indicated that the Bush administration is exerting pressure on the government of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki to accept a U.S. - Iraq security plan by the end of July 2008 .
According to these accounts , the plan would give the U.S. more than 50 military bases in Iraq , provide complete freedom of action to conduct military operations , allow complete freedom to arrest and detain Iraqis , and grant U.S. forces and contractors total immunity from Iraqi law .
Growing awareness of the implications of the pact have fueled opposition by the Iraqi public – to the extent that Prime Minister al - Maliki announced today that discussions had deadlocked .
Documents obtained by the National Security Archive under the Freedom of Information Act indicate that the U.S. started drafting the agreement in November 2003 .
While information available in the heavily redacted copies that were provided does not specifically address such hot - button , present - day issues as the number and location of bases , or control of airspace , these preliminary planning documents show that from the outset U.S. aspirations for conducting military operations based in Iraq were essentially without limit .
The Bush administration had initially hoped to see the security pact accepted by an interim Iraqi Governing Council that it itself had appointed .
The documents outline a number of " red lines " that the Defense Department and the Central Command considered crucial during the early planning , including unlimited authority to conduct military operations ; the " absolute " prerogative to detain , interrogate and intern Iraqis ; the right to establish its own rules of engagement ; complete freedom of movement entering , departing , and within Iraq ; full immunity for U.S. forces and contractors ; immunity from international tribunals ; and exemption from inspections , taxes , and duties .
" When it developed its initial plans for a security pact , the U.S. wanted virtually unlimited freedom of action for its forces – including private contractors , " said Archive analyst Joyce Battle .
" In addition to freedom to wage military operations as it saw fit – and to arrest , detain , and interrogate Iraqis at will – U.S. demands even extended to priority use of public utilities .
This was after the invasion had led to the collapse of Iraq 's already fragile infrastructure and Iraqi civilians – old and young , healthy , sick , and disabled – were getting by with a few hours of electricity a day – if they were lucky . "
Looks Like San Remo All Over Again - The U.S. Status of Force Agreement for Iraq , 2008
Recently declassified documents show that the U.S. military has long sought an agreement with Baghdad that gives American forces virtually unfettered freedom of action in – and possibly around – Iraq .
This new information appears to run counter to Bush administration claims that U.S. intentions have been more limited in scope .
According to recent news accounts , the Bush administration is exerting pressure on Iraq to accede to a military agreement – before a U.N. resolution authorizing the U.S. occupation lapses , and before the end of President Bush 's tenure – on terms highly favorable to the United States .
Information reported by Patrick Cockburn of the Independent indicates that the deal under discussion calls for :
Indefinite perpetuation of the U.S. military occupation of Iraq , whether a Republican or a Democrat is in the White House
More than 50 permanent U.S. bases in Iraq
U.S. carte blanche to conduct military operations and to arrest Iraqis and anyone else in Iraq without consulting the Iraqi government
Immunity from Iraqi law for U.S. forces and private contractors
Control of Iraq 's airspace below 29,000 feet
Unlimited freedom to pursue the " war on terror " through operations in Iraq .

Documents recently obtained by the National Security Archive through the Freedom of Information Act indicate that the Bush administration began codifying its demands for a long - term U.S. - Iraq Security Agreement in late 2003 .
Popular protest at the time and an increasingly violent armed resistance had forced the administration to seek both an " Iraqi face " for the occupation , and a mechanism intended to legitimate a long - term military presence .
Perhaps reflecting sensitivity to Iraqi and U.S. public opposition , the heavily redacted documents do not reveal much of the detail of what U.S. military and government entities hoped to obtain in terms of Iraqi acquiescence .
At the same time , there is little in the available text to indicate U.S. forces were initially willing to grant any significant limits to their ability to conduct operations in and around Iraq .
It is unlikely , of course , that all details of the 2003 planning have carried over to the 2008 discussions , and news accounts indicate that the U.S. continues to revise its demands in response to exploding Iraqi opposition as knowledge of the plan grows .
However , the available evidence indicates that U.S. expectations then and now are similar in intent and ambition .
The U.S. sought in 2003 and seeks in 2008 the prerogative to use Iraqi land and facilities , unconditional immunity for Coalition military forces and contractors , and virtually unlimited freedom of action .
The administration wanted the Security Agreement to be approved by the U.S. - appointed Iraqi Governing Council by March 31 , 2004 , before establishment of an interim Iraqi government in late June 2004 and the election of a Transitional National Assembly in January 2005 .
The 2003 Documents
The Pentagon
PowerPoint briefing slides ( heavily redacted ) , dated November 27 , 2003 , probably created by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy , introduce the discussion .
The purpose of a Security Agreement , from the Pentagon 's perspective , was to establish a legal framework for U.S. military operations , allow a role for Iraq 's transitional administration , and " maintain coalition operational flexibility and ability to pursue GWOT [ U.S. " Global War on Terrorism " ] objectives .
( The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy ( OUSDP ) was headed by Douglas Feith , one of the principal instigators of the U.S. invasion of Iraq . )
According to the slides , U.S. requirements for Iraq included :
Use of Iraqi facilities
Pre-positioning of supplies
Contracting
Respect for Law
Entry and Exit of forces
Vehicle licensing and registration
Bearing of Arms
Taxation
Import and Export
Claims
Movement of Aircraft and Vehicles
Use of land and facilities
Security requirements and support
Internal discussions over the next month expanded on these points .
The CPA , the State Department , and the NSC
According to a November 28 , 2003 email from U.S. Central Command - Iraq headquarters ( in Qatar ) , the CentCom commander , General John Abizaid , wanted further clarification of plans for " CENTCOM equities . "
What was being contemplated , the email 's writer asked : a U.S. - Iraq Status of Forces Agreement , a Military Technical Agreement as part of a Security Framework , or " All of the above and more " ?
The general counsel for the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) , Edwin S. ( " Scott " )
Castle , replied that he had prepared a draft agreement , under the direction of the OUSDP .
With further guidance from the office of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , the CPA would set up a working group to develop the plans .
Members of the group would include CentCom and Coalition Joint Task Force Seven ( CJTF - 7 ) , the unit of CentCom in control of Coalition forces in Iraq .
Emails dated November 30 from Frederick Smith , a CPA senior security advisor , and Castle confirm that the CPA , CentCom , and CJTF - 7 were to work on the agreement , with guidance from Washington .
Smith advised keeping other Coalition members involved .
The emails indicate that Paul Bremer , proconsul of Iraq at the time as head of the CPA , expected a briefing from staff on the matter on December 4 .
In early December Rumsfeld 's office , the Joint Staff , and CentCom were to send a team from the U.S. to join the discussions .
Castle was to travel to Washington for additional consultations on December 15 .
A note of caution was raised in the correspondence : the U.S. did not know " how much we should expect from the Iraqi side .
The GC members will be running for elections and will not want to appear to be appeasing the Coalition on tough issues such as jurisdiction . "
( The U.S. - appointed Governing Council ( GC ) had been set up in July 2003 to create the impression that sovereignty would soon be restored to Iraq . )
On December 3 State Department lawyers disseminated an information memo on the agreement , to be used the next day for Bremer 's briefing .
It outlined " CPA 's own current strategic vision for Iraq 's transition to full sovereignty , " utilizing three " basic documents " : the " Fundamental Law , " " Treaty Restoring Sovereignty " , and " Security Agreement " , the last comprising a military technical assistance agreement , an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement , and a status of forces agreement ( SOFA ) .
Bremer , on December 5 , wrote in a cable to the State Department and the National Security Council ( NSC ) that since " Coalition forces will need to remain in Iraq after the CPA dissolves , the Coalition must negotiate international agreements to provide for its role in the security of Iraq after the transitional Iraqi administration assumes full sovereignty , as planned for June 30 , 2004 . "
He wrote that the agreement of November 15 , 2003 , a timeline supposedly leading to restoration of Iraq 's sovereignty , called for arrangements concerning the status of coalition forces " giving wide latitude to provide for the safety and security of the Iraqi people . "
The cable then outlines points requiring additional attention .
Text concerning one issue , " use of facilities " is redacted in its entirety .
A section on " military / security operations , " though partially redacted , includes several points , e.g. :
" U.S. must be authorized to detain , intern , and interrogate anti-coalition and security risk personnel "
" U.S. must be authorized to retain custody of current POWs / detainees / internees … "
" U.S. must be authorized to seize and retain intelligence - related documents "
" Coalition forces must have unlimited authority to conduct military operations they deem necessary and proper under the circumstances . "
On the " bearing of arms , uniforms , flags & markings , " the cable says :
" U.S. forces must be authorized to bear arms and wear uniforms "
" Designated U.S. contractor personnel must be authorized to bear arms . "
On " utilities and communications " :
" U.S. forces must have access to utilities and enjoy priority in use " ( Note 2 )
" U.S. forces must be authorized to use all necessary radio spectrums without charge . "
Information in the cable on " postal and recreational facilities " was redacted in its entirety .
As to " privileges and immunities , " according to Bremer 's cable ,
" U.S. personnel must be accorded status equivalent to that accorded to administrative and technical ( A&T ) personnel ( full criminal immunity and immunity from civil process for official acts ) "
" Contractors and Iraqis employed by the coalition must be immune from legal process for acts performed in official capacity "
" U.S. personnel and contractor employees must not be surrendered to international tribunals or any other states or entities without approval of U.S. government . "
On " entry and exit " into and from Iraq :
" U.S. personnel must be allowed to enter Iraq with ID cards and orders "
" Iraq must not use visa issuance as a way of imposing limits on contractor personnel . "
Regarding " movement of vehicles , vessels , and aircraft " :
" U.S. vehicles , vessels , and aircraft must be able to freely enter , exit , and transit Iraq "
" U.S. vehicles , vessels , and aircraft must not be subject to taxes , fees , tolls , charges , regulation , registration , inspection , etc . "
" Iraq must accept U.S. driving licenses and permits as valid . "
On " importation and exportation " :
" U.S. must be able to import and export equipment , supplies , and materials without inspection , restrictions , taxes , customs , duties , etc . "
In regard to " contracting " , CPA headquarters wrote :
" U.S. must be free to contract for goods , services , and construction without restriction "
" U.S. must be able to contract using its own rules "
On taxation :
" U.S. forces must be exempt from all Iraqi taxes "
" Iraq may not tax income of U.S. personnel and certain contractors received from U.S. government or sources outside Iraq . "
All discussion of " claims " was withheld from disclosure .
CPA headquarters sent a cable on December 10 to the Defense Department , State Department , and NSC indicating that the drafting and approval of Iraq 's " fundamental law , " by the CPA and the Governing Council , were to be completed by February 28 , 2004 .
Security agreements were to be approved by March 31 , 2004 .
( Note 3 ) A highly redacted section of the cable touches on elements of the security plan -- those not withheld from disclosure are references to acquisition and servicing arrangements , nonproliferation , and " Protection of U.S. forces from the International Criminal Court . "
The CPA , CJTF - 7 , and CentCom
On December 11 , 2003 , prior to CPA lawyer Castle 's planned visit to Washington , he received a memo from CJTF - 7 , conveying its " requirements for what we would like to see reflected in the final agreement . "
Attached were PowerPoint slides from CentCom listing its objectives , key provisions , and " redlines " ( elements that in its opinion had to be , or could not be , in the agreement . )
The first of the CJTF - 7 requirements was " authority for the Coalition Force , without interference or permission " , to , in order : " fight the GWOT , fight anti-coalition forces " and " ensure a safe and secure environment in Iraq . "
Other requirements in CJTF - 7's list included a defined status for Coalition forces under international and Iraqi law ; command authority ; detention and interrogation rights ; their own definition of the rules of engagement ; complete freedom of movement ; exemption from passport and visa requirements ; exclusive criminal jurisdiction ; use of public utilities ; exemption from taxes and duties , and full diplomatic immunity for both Coalition personnel and contractors .
According to its PowerPoint slides , the Central Command 's objectives and " Key Provisions " were similar to those of CJTF - 7 , including unlimited authority to conduct military operations ; exclusive use of facilities at no cost ; freedom of movement over land and through air , space , and territorial waters ; immunity for contractors from legal process ; and exemption for contractors from visa requirements , vehicle and aircraft registration , and income taxes .
Central Command 's " red lines " included immunity for both U.S. personnel and contractors from international tribunals and foreign courts ; priority use of public utilities ; and exemption of U.S. contracts for goods , services , and construction from Iraqi jurisdiction .
CPA head Bremer met weekly with the Governing Council .
At the end of December he was advised to raise the issue of the Security Agreement at the next meeting , since " the GC has not yet focused on this issue and will likely take some time to organize itself for these negotiations . "
In a subsequent memo to the Council he indicated that he would provide a briefing on his recent trip to Washington – which was to have included discussion of the Agreement – but he did not mention it specifically as part of the agenda .
The Governing Council 's then - president , Adnan Pachachi , said in late January 2004 that the GC was " still waiting for a draft . "
( Note 4 )
The Current Plan
It is not yet known whether the government of Iraq will sign on to this agreement .
Cockburn 's reporting has indicated that this is likely .
( Note 5 ) Resistance to the pact in Iraq is growing , though opposition from some politicians could be a façade intended to defuse public anger .
( Note 6 ) On June 13 , 2008 , Prime Minister al - Maliki announced that negotiations had been suspended because of concerns about the plan 's implications for Iraq 's sovereignty , ( Note 7 ) but this is unlikely to be the end of the story .
If Iraq does acquiesce , one probable reason would be its weakness – the government of a divided society with limited popular support may rely on a foreign patron for its survival , rather than aim for accommodations with political rivals that could ultimately improve chances for peace and national reconciliation .
The Bush administration intends to bypass the U.S. Congress in striking this deal , ( Note 8 ) and , if news reports are correct , is using strong - arm tactics – including opening Iraqi assets on deposit in New York to judicial seizure – to coerce the Iraqis to comply .
( Note 9 ) If the SOFA is adopted on terms that appear non-responsive to public opinion , there can be little doubt that many will give credence to charges by Iran -- which opposes the pact -- that U.S. strategy included bribery on a grand scale .
( Note 10 )
Likely Fallout
When modern Iraq was created after World War I and the breakup of the Ottoman empire , there was widespread expectation among its people that independence and self - government would follow .
Instead the League of Nations ( predecessor to the United Nations ) granted administrative control to the British , who imposed a client monarchy and , for the next four decades , attempted to retain military bases in Iraq , exercise the unrestricted right to transport their troops across the country , and control Iraq 's oil .
( Note 11 ) It took a revolution in 1958 to overthrow the British - installed monarchy , though political reconciliation in Iraq did not follow .
For Iraqis of all persuasions and most political inclinations , acquiescence to a SOFA imposed by a foreign power would seem like a throwback to the colonial era .
( Note 12 )
According to Cockburn 's reporting , " President Bush wants to push [ the security pact ] through by the end of next month [ July 2008 ] so he can declare a military victory and claim his 2003 invasion has been vindicated . "
( Note 13 ) A prime beneficiary of the acceptance of a military agreement that the Iraqi people do not believe respects their rights or serves their interests would probably be the vast , privatized U.S. military / intelligence complex , positioned to profit from repressing the resistance sure to follow .
If the Bush administration 's goal is achieved through secret deals and pressure tactics it would only confirm the widespread view that its commitment to democracy is primarily self - serving .
In Iraq as elsewhere there are many who would welcome a genuine American commitment to liberty and human rights but believe that U.S. actions contradict its rhetoric .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) -
While most people know that smoking can cause lung cancer , a new study shows that few know that it is a major risk factor for bladder cancer -- even among people who have the disease .
In a research review published in the Journal of Urology , investigators found that in one recent study , just over one third of adults knew that smoking raises the risk of bladder cancer .
In contrast , 98 percent correctly identified the habit as a risk factor for lung cancer .
What ’s more , a study of patients with early - stage bladder cancer found that just 22 percent knew that smoking contributes to the disease .
All of this points to a serious shortcoming in patient education , according to Drs. Seth A. Strope and James E. Montie of the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor .
“ A big gap exists between patient knowledge and their actual risk , ” Strope said in a written statement .
Smoking is believed to be responsible for half of bladder cancer cases , the researchers note , so quitting could substantially reduce a smoker ’s risk of the disease .
And for people who ’ve been successfully treated for early bladder cancer , quitting can reduce the chances of a recurrence .
One study Strope and Montie reviewed found that when smokers with bladder cancer quit after their diagnosis , they reduced their risk of recurrence by about 30 percent compared with patients who continued to smoke .
Despite this , the researchers found that many smokers -- even those with bladder cancer -- say their doctor never advised them to quit .
In a government study of U.S. adults , only half of smokers with a physician said they had received advice to quit .
And a UK study of bladder cancer patients found that only 7 percent said their urologist had told them to quit smoking .
“ Our study suggests that physicians must do a much better job of communicating the risk to our patients , and directing them toward smoking cessation programs , ” Strope said .

Rep. Carl Wimmer , R - Herriman , opened a bill file this week and said he will introduce legislation in January that would enforce criminal penalties on teachers who deviate from state law governing sex education , which requires that it focus on physical and emotional development of adolescents , healthy relationships and the threat and prevention of diseases .
The law prohibits promoting or encouraging sexual behavior .
His bill also would create a registry to record the names of teachers who violate the law .
__1943 : __ Brothers László and Georg Bíró , Hungarian refugees living in Argentina , patent the ballpoint pen .
A half - century - old idea is coming to commercial fruition .
Lewis Waterman 's invention of a practical fountain pen , patented in 1884 , had solved the problem of portability .
You no longer had to carry around an inkwell to be able to write when and where you wanted .
But the ink still took a while to dry and was subject to running and smudging .
American banker John L. Loud patented a ballpoint pen in 1888 .
It used a ball - and - socket to deliver sticky , quick - drying ink .
Too sticky :
The ink was so coarse , it did n't really work well on paper .
( It was a good idea on paper , except literally . )
It did find industrial uses for writing on leather and cloth .
László Bíró was a Hungarian journalist who saw an idea in the quick - drying inks newspapers use .
His brother Georg , a chemist , helped him with technical aspects .
They used a tiny – and precisely ground – ball bearing to serve two functions .
It distributed ink evenly from the cartridge to the paper for writing , and it contained the rest of the ink inside the cartridge .
The Bíró brothers made progress on improving the ballpoint to the point , so to speak , that it could write as smoothly as a fountain pen .
But the situation in their homeland was deteriorating .
When World War II started , they fled from Budapest to Paris , then to Madrid and finally to Buenos Aires , Argentina .
There , they applied for a patent and sought financial backing .
One of their contacts , an English accountant named Harry Martin , realized that the ballpoint solved a problem faced by Britain 's Royal Air Force : Conventional pens were unsuitable for writing aircraft logs , because they leaked , were too sensitive to changes in atmospheric pressure , and would n't let you write on a vertical or overhead surface .
Martin eventually flew to Washington and London , convincing both the U.S. Air Force and the RAF to adopt the new technology .
By the time the Allies won the war , the ballpoint shared the luster of victory .
When the pens went into commercial production in 1945 , they were a sensation .
In the United States , the Reynolds Pen sold for $ 12.50 ( about $ 150 in today 's money ) .
Yet people swarmed a New York department store to buy 8,000 of them on the first day of sale .
What ?
People lining up to be the first to buy new technology ?
Where have we heard that before ?
You mean , it happened in the old days , too ?
Some of the earliest versions of commercial ballpoints leaked and smudged , but manufacturers eventually worked the bugs out .
What ?
A technology brought to market before it 's quite ready ?
How could that be ?
Today , the ballpoint is what most people mean when they say just pen .
And in much of the world , the generic name for a ballpoint pen is biro .
In Argentina , by the way , it 's a birome .

GROUP WANTS POT IN AIRPORT LOUNGES
Marijuana proponents want to know why federal officials continue to allow people to use alcohol on airplanes , but wo n't allow pot smoking in the lounges at Denver International Airport .
" Does it make sense to allow adults to use a drug that causes problems on airplanes and not allow them to use one that does not cause problems on airplanes ? " asked Mason Tvert , executive director of Safer Alternatives For Enjoyable Recreation .
SAFER held a press conference on Tuesday outside the offices of the Federal Aviation Administration in Denver to propose a solution to the rash of in - flight disturbances on airplanes over the last year .

A Vincent van Gogh portrait of a peasant woman that was painted over by the artist has been revealed in extraordinary detail through use of an x-ray technique that has never before been applied to a painting .
Research had previously disclosed the vague outline of a head behind the painting , entitled Patch of Grass , but the face of the woman emerged from the centre of the work only after the picture was subjected to x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy .
Often Van Gogh painted over his earlier works ; experts estimate that about a third of his early pictures conceal other compositions .
Patch of Grass was completed in Paris in 1887 and is owned by the Kroller - Muller museum in the Netherlands .
Scientists scanned the picture over two days with a pencil - thin beam of " energetic " x-rays generated by a synchrotron , a machine that accelerates sub-atomic particles .
The atoms in the layers of paint released " fluorescent " x-rays , which were used to map the picture 's chemicals .
Elements from specific paint pigments - deriving , for instance , from mercury and antimony - allowed a " colour photo " of the concealed work to be produced .
The team , led by Joris Dik , from Delft University of Technology , in the Netherlands , and Koen Janssens , from the University of Antwerp , in Belgium , then reconstructed the hidden picture .
The portrait may have been one of a series of heads painted by Van Gogh , between 1884 - 85 , while he stayed in the Dutch village of Nuenen .

The C64 barely has 32 K of RAM free after it boots up , and just making TCP / IP work on a C64 ( if that is what they are using ) in addition to a video game is fairly impressive .
It is nice to see the " best selling computer of all time " is still alive and kicking .
President George Bush signed off with a defiant farewell over his refusal to accept global climate change targets at his last G8 summit .
As he prepared to fly out from Japan , he told his fellow leaders : " Goodbye from the world 's biggest polluter . "
President Bush made the private joke in the summit's closing session , senior sources said yesterday .
His remarks were taken as a two - fingered salute from the President from Texas who is wedded to the oil industry .
He had given some ground at the summit by saying he would " seriously consider " a 50 per cent cut in carbon emissions by 2050 .

But green groups had protested that the meeting was a missed opportunity to secure the radical reductions in carbon emissions that were needed to reduce global warming .
China and India , who were among the emerging economies invited to the summit , refused to sign up to binding agreements without firmer commitments from the US and the other industrialised nations to cut their CO2 emissions .
However , there was progress towards a deal on the world trade talks in Geneva .
On the final day of their three - day summit , the G8 countries agreed to instruct their negotiators to make every effort to secure a deal when talks resume on 21 July .
Although a similar call by the G8 summit two years ago failed to break the deadlock in the seven - year trade talks , officials are more confident that this month 's negotiations will be successful .
They say there is a growing recognition that it will be much harder to secure a deal after a new US President takes office next January because of pressures to protect American farmers during this year 's election campaign – and that a new global trade framework may never be struck .
Mr Bush gave his strongest support for an immediate agreement to his fellow G8 leaders .
" We were looking for a signal from Bush and we got one , " one British source said .
" It 's not in the bag but there is now a real push for a deal . "
The talks will involve a complicated set of trade - offs between Europe , America , Latin America and India over farming and industrial subsidies and tariffs .
Brazil , a possible stumbling block to a deal , raised the prospects of a breakthrough after its President , Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , met Gordon Brown yesterday on the margins of the summit .
They issued a joint statement saying that the " window of opportunity " for an agreement is closing .
They added : " The time for technical negotiations is drawing to an end .
The key decisions now are political ones .
We must act decisively now .
If we do n't , we will be failing the world 's poor and destroying the best basis for continued economic growth in the future .
The cost of failure is simply too great . "
Brazil 's willingness to ease restrictions on imports of goods such as cars and chemicals from richer nations could hold the key to a successful deal if European nations accept cuts in support for their farmers in return .
Mr Brown told a press conference that a trade agreement could save the average British household £ 200 a year by bringing down food prices and would also bring greater benefits to the world 's poorest countries , notably in Africa .
He suggested that another potential obstacle to a deal – Nicolas Sarkozy – appeared to have been removed during the G8 meeting , when the French President rejected protectionist moves despite his criticism of Peter Mandelson , the EU 's trade commissioner and negotiator in the talks .
The Prime Minister described the Geneva talks as " make or break " , adding : " If we fail this month to secure a trade agreement , it will not be easy to resume negotiations ...
We are at one minute to midnight . "
The final day of the summit saw tensions over climate change between the G8 and eight other major economies invited to Japan to discuss a new global agreement .
The other eight nations , including China and India , failed to sign up to the G8's pledge to cut its carbon emissions by at least 50 per cent by 2050 .
Dow AgroSciences suggests we avoid eating the deformed food
June 29 , 2008 by twitterpaters
by twit
From the Guardian on June 29 , 2008 :
The Dow website says : ‘ As a general rule , we suggest damaged produce ( however this is caused ) should not be consumed . ’
This is an example photo of a deformed tomato plant , via the Guardian :
Example of unhealthy tomato leaves curling inwards , affected by contaminated manure .
Photograph : Katherine Rose
Dow AgroSciences would prefer that we avoid eating deformed food , especially if their pesticide got into the manure used to fertilize the garden …
The Royal Horticultural Society ( RHS ) has been inundated with calls from concerned gardeners who have seen potatoes , beans , peas , carrots and salad vegetables wither or become grossly deformed .
The society admitted that it had no idea of the extent of the problem , but said it appeared ‘ significant ’ .
The affected gardens and allotments have been contaminated by manure originating from farms where the hormone - based herbicide aminopyralid has been sprayed on fields .
…
Guy Barter , the RHS head of horticultural advisory services , said they were receiving more than 20 calls a week .
‘ Our advice is not to eat the vegetables because no one seems to have any idea whether it is safe to eat them and we ca n’t give any assurances , ’ he said .
‘ It is happening all over the country .
A lot of cases we are seeing is where people have got manure from stables and the stable have bought their hay from a merchant , and the merchant might have bought hay from many farmers , possibly from different parts of the country .
So they have no idea where the hay came from .
So finding someone to blame is quite difficult . ’
Maybe hold off on milk and meat for awhile , too ?
Shirley Murray , 53 , a retired management consultant with an allotment near Bushy Park in Hampton , south - west London , said several of her allotment neighbours had used the same manure bought from a stables and all were affected .
‘ I am absolutely incensed at what has happened and find it scandalous that a weedkiller sprayed more than one year ago , that has passed through an animal ’s gut , was kicked around on a stable floor , stored in a muck heap in a field , then on an allotment site and was finally dug into or mulched on to beds last winter is still killing “ sensitive ” crops and will continue to do so for the next year , ’ she said .
[ emphasis added ]
Although , it does n’t seem clear that the animals producing the manure are themselves contaminated by the herbicide .
We may learn more when the next batch of farm animal offspring are born , but it does seem more likely that the herbicide got into the ‘ muck heaps ’ than into the animals themselves .
Although , it takes a wretched amount of stupidity to get this far along with the contamination of gardens , so the twit ’s not holding her breath …
update : From the Royal Horticultural Society , another photo of a deformed tomato plant and a warning about contaminated manure , with emphasis added to highlight the point about the apparent origin of contamination :
Farmyard manure contaminated with weedkiller residue is causing abnormal growth of vegetable crops throughout the country .
It is believed that the manure has been inadvertently contaminated with aminopyralid .
This selective , hormone - type herbicide is used on pastures to control weeds .
Manure from animals fed on treated pastures contains chemical residues sufficient to damage susceptible crops .
Gardeners buying this manure to apply to vegetable crops and gardens are coming across abnormal growth particularly on tomatoes , potatoes and legumes , although ornamental plants such as delphinium , phlox and roses may also be susceptible .
Symptoms of damage include distorted foliage , with cupping of leaves and fern - like growth .
There are no remedies once damage has occurred and there is no assurance that affected produce will be safe to consume .
[ emphasis added ]
and this seems nice of them to say :
However , as this weed killer can be grazed by livestock soon after application there is no reason to believe that children , pets , gardeners or wildlife are at risk .
even if it does n’t make much sense in the context of the origin of contamination potentially being blamed on the hay consumed by farm animals .
It is a chemical that is destroying gardens across Britain , so the idea that there is “ no reason ” to be concerned about the possibility of more widespread contamination seems a bit optimistic at this point .
update : Via the Guardian on July 28 , 2008 :
Targeted ads might be a brass ring for the online marketers , but consumers just are n't buying it .
According to a recent Harris Interactive survey , 59 percent of Americans take exception to Microsoft , Google , and Yahoo tracking their online activities for marketing purposes .
The nationwide survey was conducted with the help of Dr. Alan F. Westin , Professor of Public Law and Government Emeritus at Columbia .
Westin argues that the distrust stems from consumers disbelief of the value proposition offered by marketers .
" Websites pursuing customized or behavioral marketing maintain that the benefits to online users that advertising revenues make possible – such as free emails or free searches and potential lessening of irrelevant ads – should persuade most online users that this is a good tradeoff , said Westin .
He added , " Though our question flagged this position , 59 percent of current online users clearly do not accept it . "
The trick to winning over younger consumers ?
Transparency .
After four privacy policies were shown to respondents , a majority claimed that they were more comfortable with the sharing of their data for advertising purposes .
Westin offers a couple explanations as to why the older crowd remain skeptical :
The failure of a larger percentage of respondents to express comfort after four privacy policies were specified may have two bases - concerns that web companies would actually follow voluntary guidelines , even if they espoused them , and the absence of any regulatory or enforcement mechanism in the privacy policy steps outlined in the question .

SAN ANTONIO , Texas ( CNN ) --
Last week in an operating room in Texas , a wounded American soldier underwent a history - making procedure that could help him regrow the finger that was lost to a bomb attack in Baghdad , Iraq , last year .
Army Sgt. Shiloh Harris is wheeled into surgery for the experimental treatment to regrow what 's left of his finger .
Army Sgt. Shiloh Harris ' doctors applied specially formulated powder to what 's left of the finger in an effort to do for wounded soldiers what salamanders can do naturally : replace missing body parts .
If it sounds like science fiction , the lead surgeon agreed .
" It is .
But science fiction eventually becomes true , does n't it ? " asked Dr. Steven Wolf of Brooke Army Medical Center .
Harris ' surgery is part of a major medical study of " regenerative medicine " being pursued by the Pentagon and several of the nation 's top medical facilities , including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the Cleveland Clinic .
Nearly $ 250 million has been dedicated to the research .
Air Force Tech .
Sgt. Israel Del
Toro is one of the wounded vets who might one day benefit from this research .
He was injured by a bomb in Afghanistan .
Both his hands were badly burned .
On his left hand , what was left of his fingers fused together .
" You know , in the beginning , when I first got hurt , I told them , just cut it off .
So I can get some function , " Del Toro said .
His doctors did not cut off his injured left arm .
And since that injury , advancements in burn and amputation treatment mean he may one day be able to use his fingers again .
Watch more on regenerative medicine »
A key to the research dedicated to regrowing fingers and other body parts is a powder , nicknamed " pixie dust " by some of the people at Brooke .
It 's made from tissue extracted from pigs .
The pixie dust powder itself does n't regrow the missing tissue ; it tricks the patient 's body into doing that itself .
All bodies have stem cells .
As we are developing in our mothers ' wombs , those stem cells grow our fingers , toes , organs -- essentially , our whole body .
The stem cells stop doing that around birth , but they do n't go away .
The researchers believe that the " pixie dust " can put those stem cells back to work growing new body parts .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
The powder forms a microscopic " scaffold " that attracts stem cells and convinces them to grow into the tissue that used to be there .
" If it is next to the skin , it will start making skin .
If it 's next to a tendon , it will start making a tendon , and so that 's the hope , at least in this particular project , that we can grow a finger , " Wolf said .
It has worked in earlier experiments .
" They have taken a uterus out of a dog , made one in the lab , put it back in and had puppies , " Wolf said .
Researchers have also regrown a human bladder and implanted it in a person , and it is working as nature intended .
Although the technique has incredible promise , doctors will be watching for unexpected side effects as they follow Harris ' recovery .
" It could grow a cancer , " Wolf said .
" We will be closely monitoring for that to make sure that does n't happen . "
If the military 's most badly wounded start benefiting , so will civilians .
" If we can pull this off in missing parts the next step is , OK , can we grow a pancreas ?
Can we grow and replace that in a diabetic ?
And can we do the same thing with a kidney and can we do the same thing with a heart ? "
One day , he hopes , people with heart trouble will be told , " That 's OK .
We will just grow you another one . "
" That is something that is real science fiction . "
CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr contributed to this report .
He instructed his followers to “ to wage open war against the Americans ” but forbade them from “ raising a hand against another Iraqi citizen . ”
He also urged the Iraqi Army and Iraqi police to stop cooperating with the Americans , and he asked the government to purge the militias within the ranks of the police and the army .
He said he would oppose any American military bases in Iraq .
He also issued a “ final warning ” to the Iraqi government to end its crackdown or face an “ open war until liberation . ”
But he quickly softened the threat , saying , “ If we have threatened with an open war until liberation , we have meant by it a war against the occupier . ”
The very public effort to calm the situation follows nearly a month of open fighting in Sadr City , Basra and several provinces in southern Iraq .
It appeared to reflect an effort by Mr. Sadr to ensure that his movement is able to compete effectively in local elections scheduled for October .

Mr. Sadr and his allies have a strong following in Basra and could be expected to fare well in the elections .
They have accused Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , who is allied with rival Shiite factions , of staging the Basra attack as a way to marginalize them before the vote .
Decades of white flight transformed America 's cities .
That era is drawing to a close .
In Washington , a historically black church is trying to attract white members to survive .
Atlanta 's next mayoral race is expected to feature the first competitive white candidate since the 1980s .
San Francisco has lost so many African - Americans that Mayor Gavin Newsom created an " African - American Out- Migration Task Force and Advisory Committee " to help retain black residents .
" The city is experiencing growth , yet we 're losing African - American families disproportionately , " Mr. Newsom says .
When that happens , " we lose part of our soul . "
For much of the 20th century , the proportion of whites shrank in most U.S. cities .
In recent years the decline has slowed considerably -- and in some significant cases has reversed .
Between 2000 and 2006 , eight of the 50 largest cities , including Boston , Seattle and San Francisco , saw the proportion of whites increase , according to Census figures .
The previous decade , only three cities saw increases .
The changing racial mix is stirring up quarrels over class and culture .
Beloved institutions in traditionally black communities -- minority - owned restaurants , book stores -- are losing the customers who supported them for decades .
As neighborhoods grow more multicultural , conflicts over home prices , taxes and education are opening a new chapter in American race relations .
ALBANY – Warning of an approaching economic calamity , Gov. Paterson yesterday called an emergency session of the state Legislature – and raised the specter that New York may have to sell off roads , bridges and tunnels to close a massive budget deficit .
In a rare televised address , the Democratic governor cited “ private - public partnerships ” involving the sale of state assets – widely condemned by critics as fiscal gimmickry – as one way to stem a tide of red ink brought on by the sagging economy and woes on Wall Street .
DICKER : Grim Dave Seems All Talk But No Action
EDITORIAL : The Gov’s Fine Talk
“ We ca n’t wait and hope that this problem will resolve itself , ” Paterson said .
“ These times call for action , and today I promise you there will be action . ”
Profit - tax collections from the state ’s 16 biggest banks , which were at $ 173 million in June 2007 , fell to $ 5 million last month , Paterson noted .
That ’s a shocking 97 percent plunge .
But the governor ’s five - minute speech offered few specific solutions to a three - year budget deficit .
The gap has ballooned to $ 26.2 billion from $ 21.5 billion – a whopping 22 percent increase – in just 90 days .
Next year alone , the state expects to face a budget deficit of $ 6.4 billion , up from a projection in March of $ 5 billion .
Paterson promised to examine ways to trim the state work force and consider deeper budget cuts beyond the 3.3 percent he ordered after taking office this spring .
“ We ’re going to end the legislators ’ vacations and bring them back to Albany to reprioritize the way we manage New York state ’s finances , ” he said .
Paterson said he would ask lawmakers during the session on Aug. 19 to take up his proposal to cap school property taxes at 4 percent a year .
In a nod to the tax cap ’s chief opponent , Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver ( D - Manhattan ) , the governor also promised action on Silver ’s pet proposal to increase home - heating subsidies .
But Silver reacted coolly .
“ If it is our intention to ask working families to shoulder the burden of these cuts , we must ensure that our most affluent citizens share that burden , ” he said .
Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos ( R - LI ) cautioned Paterson that any cuts to school funding were off the table .
The “ sale ” of state assets has been tried in the past during difficult economic times and has been met with condemnation from budget watchdogs .
The most famous – or infamous – example : former Gov. Mario Cuomo ’s sale of Attica prison to a semi- independent state agency in 1991 to raise $ 200 million .
Many critics noted that the bond sale cost the state hundreds of millions extra over the next few years .
“ One gets a little concerned when ‘ selling off state assets ’ and ‘ budget deficits ’ get mentioned in the same sentence , ” said Elizabeth Lynam , a state policy expert with the Citizens Budget Commission .
“ If it ’s used to close a budget gap , it ’s a one - shot .
It ’s does n’t help you in the long run .
It ’s a fiscal gimmick . ”
Mayor Bloomberg last night praised Paterson ’s effort “ to tackle the serious problems we face ” this year .
“ The governor demonstrated that he is ready to stand up to the interest groups that will no doubt protest before the State House , just as they took to the steps of City Hall earlier this year , ” Bloomberg said .

The average US tax rate for most goods is 7.07 percent , but the taxman has a special affinity for wireless phone and data services , which are taxed at a whopping 15.9 percent when you combine state , local , and federal taxes .
This high number may be a relic from the time when a cell phone was a luxury , but those days are far behind us ; cell phones are the choice of many low - income individuals , especially those who move frequently .
Now , two senators want to put the kibosh on any future tax raises for five years .
Already a fierce supporter of network neutrality , Senator Ron Wyden ( D - OR ) has decided to tackle rising taxes on wireless service .
" Americans are being hit hard with rising costs for gas , health care , and food for the dinner table .
Americans need to know that their cell phone bills wo n’t be the next cost to spiral out of control , ” he said in a statement announcing the " Mobile Wireless Tax Fairness Act of 2008 . ”
Ron Wyden
The bill is co-sponsored by Senator Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) , who has previously partnered with Senator Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) on network neutrality legislation .
Snowe wants an end to " these excessive and discriminatory taxes " that discourage wireless use , particularly for " low - income individuals and families " who rely on their cell phones .
“ By banning these taxes , we can equalize the taxation of the wireless industry with that of other goods and services and protect the wireless consumer from the weight of fees , surcharges , and general business taxes . ”
According to a copy of the bill seen by Ars Technica , " No State or local jurisdiction shall impose a new discriminatory tax on or with respect to mobile services , mobile service providers , or mobile service property , during the 5 - year period beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act . "
Local tax raises are fine , but they can not single out wireless service .
Should the bill pass — and it 's unlikely to do so during this session of Congress — it would do nothing to lower existing tax rates , simply prevent discriminatory increases in the future .
State and local governments watching the issue will no doubt take away one main lesson : if we 're going to jack up wireless access taxes even higher , we 'd better get jacking !
PARIS  Radovan Karadzic , one of the world ’s most wanted war criminals for his part in the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995 , was arrested Monday in a raid in Serbia that ended a 13 - year hunt .
Serge Brammertz , the prosecutor of the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague , hailed the arrest as an important step in bringing to justice one of the architects of Europe ’s worst massacre since World War II .
He said Mr. Karadzic , 63 , the Bosnian Serb president during the war there between 1992 and 1995 , would be transferred to The Hague in “ due course . ”
“ This is a very important day for the victims who have waited for this arrest for over a decade , ” Mr. Brammertz said .
“ It is also an important day for international justice because it clearly demonstrates that nobody is beyond the reach of the law and that sooner or later all fugitives will be brought to justice . ”
Mr. Karadzic ’s exact place of arrest was not announced , but Serbian government officials said he was arrested by the Serbian secret police not far from Belgrade , the capital .
Officials from President Boris Tadic ’s office said Mr. Karadzic had appeared before an investigative judge at Serbia ’s war crimes court , a prerequisite for his extradition to The Hague .
I note with interest today , John McCain ’s new tactic of associating Barack Obama with oversexed and / or promiscuous young white women .
( See today ’s new ad and this from yesterday . )
Presumably , a la Harold Ford 2006 , this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded .
But what I ’m most interested in today is the new meme the McCain campaign has been pushing for the last few weeks that Obama is presumptuous , arrogant and well … just a bit uppity .
Ron Fournier picked the ball up early in his reporting for the AP .
And John King was pushing it over the weekend on CNN .
Is it arrogant or above Obama ’s station for him to meet with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve ?
If I ’m not mistaken he is a sitting United States senator and also the presidential candidate of the Democratic party .
Such meetings are actually the norm .
Now , I note that the Post , which has generally been in McCain ’s camp , has a front page story today that comes about as close as they feel able to confirming that McCain campaign and McCain personally have spent most of the last week peddling what they knew was a lie about Obama ’s called - off trip to the US military hospital in Landstuhl , Germany .
And there ’s also this piece in today ’s Times noting ‘ concern ’ among some Republicans over McCain ’s increasing use of personal attacks on Obama with what are often demonstrably false claims .
How many demonstrable lies does the McCain campaign have to push before it colors the portrayal of his campaign ?
As I alluded to at the top of this post , it is the norm that obvious campaign tactics that are treated as obvious after a campaign is over are nonetheless treated by most reporters as ambiguous or unclear during a campaign .
But in this case it would be nice if that were not the case .
Because here we have a candidate , John McCain , who is running on a record of straight talk and honorable campaigning running a campaign made up mainly of charges reporters are now more or less acknowledging are lies .
But there ’s precious little drawing together of the contradiction .
What ’s more , as everyone will acknowledge after the campaign , the McCain campaign is now pushing the caricature of Obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women .
So please keep an eye out for references to Obama ’s presumptuousness , arrogance , etc. , from John King and other reporters .
Let us know when you see them and send us in examples — in text or video .
McCain gets to run the campaign he wants .
Remember , he hired the operative who put together the Ford / Bimbo ad .
But I want to keep tabs on which reporters are helping him retail the message .
Wishful Thinking , Speculation and Oil ( May 30 , 2008 )
Everyone and their sister seems to have jumped on the " oil prices are being driven by speculation " bandwagon , but perhaps that is nothing but wishful thinking .
From the very beginning of futures trading -- back in the 1600s when traders in Antwerp would buy and sell contracts on the cargo coming from the East Indies -- the easiest game in town has been to blame speculators for price movements .
If the price of a commodity is rising , then the villains are speculators .
If the price is dropping , it 's the short sellers ' fault .
Speculators are active wherever and whenever speculation is allowed .
It 's wishful thinking to expect oil will fall from $ 130 / barrel back to $ 70 / barrel if only those darned speculators would leave the market alone .
Note to hand - wringing , finger - pointing pundits : those darned speculators are the market .
As Harun points out in the chart below , Large Trader Open Interest ( in futures contracts ) is not out of line with the recent past .
We also have to keep in mind that commercial traders play both long and short to hedge their gains .
If you 're long oil , then you also buy short positions to lock in your gains on the long side .
That is , your short positions will gain in value if oil drops , offsetting your losses on the long side .
That 's the basic idea of hedging , and the major players have to hedge to protect themselves from huge losses on either side of the trade .
Thus it is tricky to draw hard - and - fast conclusions from open interest .
Yes , momentum traders will jump on a trend up or down ; that 's the nature of markets and trading .
But the key metric is always supply and demand .
The evidence is rather clear : demand is not being destroyed as oil climbs in price , and supplies are dwindling as major oil fields slip into the depletion phase of Hubbert 's Peak .
What many of the " it 's all speculators ' fault " commentators seem not to understand is that hundreds of millions of consumers are still paying low prices for gasoline .
Many governments subsidize the cost of fuels , artificially suppressing prices to consumers , who then respond like all consumers do when a commodity is inexpensive : they use it profligately .
Let 's turn to frequent contributors Harun I. and U. Doran for more : Harun made these points : Shedding some perspective on the speculation debate .
Is there speculation ?
Of course , that is how the futures markets are designed .
Does this mean that speculators are driving price up or down .
This argument has been around for centuries , it was inane then , it is just as inane today .
Is there a bubble ?
The change in trajectory of price indicates a change in psychology .
Trend - following funds are are going to increase positions as their models dictate .
When we see the smartest guys in the room ( commercials ) become buyers ( relatively ) then we will probably see a shift in price activity .
Spot market and futures as of today are equivalent and the market is no longer inverted , this also is a change .
Technical indicators on the charts indicate subtle changes .
Anything that goes straight up is unsustainable .
The percent increases price are clearly unsustainable .
People will change their behavior .
High prices are the answer to high prices and low prices are the answer to low prices .
The problem is that many nations are subsidizing their citizens ' oil prices , so hundreds of millions of consumers are not paying higher prices .
U. Doran submitted a telling article by " Sir Charts Alot " Gary Dorsch , who made these key points about supply and demand : ( Is Crude Oil a " Bubble " Ready to Burst ? )
China , India , Russia and the Middle East combined are now consuming more crude oil than the US , burning 20.7 million barrels a day , up 4 % from a year ago according to the IEA .
The emerging economies are picking - up the slack in the oil market , more than offsetting a - 1.3 % contraction in US oil demand to 20.3 million barrels this year .
Thus , a mild recession in the Western economies and Japan might not weaken global demand for oil .
Economies of big oil - exporters in Russia , Mexico , and OPEC itself are growing so fast that their need for energy within their own borders will limit how much they can sell abroad .
Internal oil demand in Saudi Arabia , Russia , Norway , Iran and the United Arab Emirates grew 6 % last year , and their exports declined 3 percent .
Mexicos oil output fell - 9 % in the first four months of 2008 , from the same period a year earlier .
If these trends continue , global crude exports could fall by 2.5 million barrels a day by the end of 2010 , adding new strains to the global oil market .
Oil production is shrinking in 54 of the worlds top - 60 oil producing nations , including Britains North Sea , where output peaked in 1999 and has already plunged by half .
The UK began importing liquid gas for the first time in history in July 2005 , and its North Sea oil reserve is dwindling at an - 8.5 % annual rate .
The curtain might fall on North Sea Brent by 2012 if enough is nt done to maintain development and exploration , according to the UK Offshore Oil Industry .
The basic laws of supply - and - demand dont work in an economy where the government intervenes with price controls .
In China , gasoline prices havent gone up since last November , even though crude oil prices have gone up 35 % since then .
Beijing controls gasoline prices to limit their effect on inflation and prevents refiners from passing on higher oil import costs to consumers .
Without the price controls on energy distillates , Chinese inflation would already be in the double - digits .
India is Asias third - biggest oil consumer , and imports 70 % of its petroleum needs .
Although crude oil has doubled from a year ago , and the Indian rupee has lost 5.5 % against the dollar this year , New Delhi has only permitted just one increase in retail fuel prices in 20 - months .
The list of oil - producing nations with extremely cheap fuel ( in some cases under $ 1/ gallon ) includes major exporters Iran , Venezuela , Indonesia and Nigeria .
Toss in China and India , and you have hundreds of millions of consumers who are being protected from the true cost of fuels by their governments ' massive subsidies .
Traffic jams in Lagos are legendary , as fuel is cheap and the infrastructure has n't kept pace with the population growth .
The same is true in oil - producing nations ' cities around the globe .
Bottom line : fuel subsidies in oil - producing nations is driving demand up so rapidly that these nations will soon be unable to export any oil at all .
Like all subsidies , the unintended consequence is tremendous inefficiency , economic distortion and waste .
Efficiency and conservation do n't pay when fuel is subsidized , just as nobody in the U.S. with gold - plated medical insurance thinks twice about going to the doctor -- hey , it 's " free , " why not ?
What are the chances these governments will eliminate their fuel subsidies ?
Zero , zip , nada .
Yes , they will inch them up , and suffer the riots and protests of their poorer citizenry ; but to eliminate all price controls and expose their populace to market rate fuels would be political suicide for the oligarchs and elites holding power in these nations .
So they will " suck it up " and keep prices low , regardless of how high oil climbs in price .
If speculation is at such fever pitch , why is the volume of contract trading slowing down ?
As Harun notes on this chart , " The velocity at which contracts are trading hands has decelerated significantly during rapid price appreciation . "
It seems the trading was fast and furious as the price formed a bottom and began its steady rise from $ 55 / barrel .
Blaming the growing imbalance of oil supply and demand on speculation is a canard .
My prediction for oil prices is a continuation of base trends , i.e. modest demand destruction and continuing declines in production / supply .
As for the " solutions " to supply : 1 . The Iranians have 20 supertankers filled with oil floating around somewhere .
Nice , but it 's heavy crude , and the few refineries able to process it are already running flat out .
Also , 20 supertankers is a drop in the bucket of global demand .
2 . Deep abiotic oil is abundant .
The Russian have the technology .
If the Russians have the technology , why is their production declining so rapidly ?
Where are the pipelines from their deep wells ?
3 . It 's all the weak dollar .
Once the dollar starts rising , the bubble in oil prices will pop .
Then how come oil is rising in all currencies and even when priced in gold ?
4 . Canada and the U.S. have nearly unlimited supplies of shale oil and tar sands .
Great , but real - world production will top out at 2.5 million barrels a day , about 10 % of North America 's consumption , and the process uses vast quantities of natural gas .
5 . If only the tree - huggers would let us drill in the Alaska Wilderness .
The U.S. consumes 22 million barrels a day or 8 billion barrels a year .
The Alaskan North Slope everyone talks about contains about a billion barrels - - a whopping 45 days ' supply for the U.S. Whoopie .
In other words - - it 's all wishful thinking , folks : that it 's all the speculators ' fault , that new supplies will magically come on line and save us -- there is simply no credible evidence for either supposition .
It 's supply and demand .
Prices are set on the margin , and as a result a shortfall of a few percent has an amazing leverage on price .
Go ahead and ban speculation , and see what happens then .
Prices will not drop , they will simply become more disorderly / chaotic .
As for demand destruction -- let me know when China , India , Indonesia , Iran , Venezuela , Nigeria , Mexico et al. stop subsidizing the price of fossil fuels for their hundreds of millions of consumers .
And as for supply , let me know when global production of oil from any source exceeds 90 million barrels and day and keeps climbing as producers take advantage of the high prices .

( Newser ) – Russia and China today threw out a UN resolution to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe for its violent presidential election , Reuters reports .
Nine countries supported the US - backed sanctions , which would levied an arms embargo and restricted the travel and finances of officials , including President Mugabe .
But five nations voted against it , calling the resolution unworthy of the UN Security Council .
Veto -holding Russia and China and their three voting partners — South Africa , Libya , and Vietnam — argued that Zimbabwe falls outside the council 's purview of keeping international peace .
In a heated exchange , U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said Russia 's vote " raises doubts about its reliability as a G8 partner . "
But Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin countered that the resolution is " illegitimate and dangerous . "

In - depth : McCain news , photos , video , timeline , more ... John McCain on the campaign issues : Iraq | Immigration | Health care | Education | Abortion | Gay civil rights CREATE A SCENARIO FOR 2008 CREATE A SCENARIO FOR 2008 USA TODAY 's interactive electoral vote tracker lets you build election scenarios , share them with friends and study past election outcomes .
CAMPAIGN ISSUES : 2008 CAMPAIGN ISSUES : 2008 Click on the titles to learn more about where the presidential candidates stand on the issues :
WAR IN IRAQ
The war in Iraq is the dominant issue in the 2008 race for the White House .
The early primary votes will be cast as the conflict completes its fifth year .
The next president will be the first to take the oath of office during an ongoing war since Richard Nixon in 1969 .
IMMIGRATION
Immigration is a highly divisive issue , as concerns about terrorism amplify the debate about border security .
Congress has failed to enact immigration legislation because of differences between supporters of tougher enforcement to limit illegal entry into the country and advocates of amnesty for illegal immigrants .
HEALTH CARE
Polls indicate that health care is one of the most important issues to voters heading into the 2008 presidential elections .
The rising cost of health insurance and the growing number of uninsured give the issue added urgency .
Several candidates have called for universal health care ; others have said these plans amount to socialized medicine .
EDUCATION
White House hopefuls are divided on the federal government 's role in education as Congress considers changes to President Bush 's signature schools law , the No Child Left Behind Act , and how to make college affordable .
ABORTION
In 1973 , the U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion in the landmark case Roe v. Wade and the ruling has been the subject of heated political debate ever since .
Presidential candidates over the years have weighed in on a variety of abortion - related topics .
GAY CIVIL RIGHTS
The issue of civil rights for gay men and lesbians -- including the definition of marriage , service in the military and protection against hate crimes -- has long divided the two major political parties .
It 's not as simple as saying Democrats are for them , and Republicans are against them .
McCain adviser 's work as lobbyist comes to light
This story is part of USA TODAY 's series , " The Price of Power , " which tracks the political and business relationships between public officials and donors .
WASHINGTON — John McCain 's top foreign policy adviser lobbied the Arizona senator 's staff on behalf of the republic of Georgia while he was working for the campaign , public records show .
Randy Scheunemann , founder of Orion Strategies , represented the governments of Macedonia , Georgia and Taiwan between 2003 and March 1 , according to the firm 's filings with the Justice Department .
In its latest semiannual report , the firm disclosed that Scheunemann had a phone conversation in November about Georgia with Richard Fontaine , an aide in McCain 's Senate office .
Orion Strategies earned $ 540,000 from its foreign clients over the year ending on Dec. 1 , reports show .
Scheunemann also received $ 56,250 last year from March to July from McCain , according to campaign finance records .
The campaign consulting fees ended at a time when McCain was under financial pressure to cut costs , but Scheunemann remained the campaign 's top foreign policy adviser .
He represented McCain throughout last fall — including an appearance at a Republican Jewish Coalition event during the same week he lobbied McCain 's Senate office .
While not illegal or a breach of Senate ethics rules , Scheunemann 's lobbying of McCain 's staff as he was advising the campaign comes to light a week after McCain announced a new policy to avoid such conflicts .
The new conflict - of - interest policy prohibits campaign workers from being registered lobbyists or foreign agents and bans part - time volunteers from policy discussions on issues involving their clients .
Campaign spokesman Jill Hazelbaker said the ethics policy is not retroactive .
She declined to answer any questions about Scheunemann .
" This campaign has a policy ; it 's the most stringent of any presidential campaign in history , and everyone will have to comply or resign , but we 're not going to discuss any individual staff members and their individual decisions , " she said in an e-mail .
Scheunemann did not respond to messages left at his firm and at the campaign Monday and Tuesday .
Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama does not allow registered lobbyists to work for his campaign but has some lobbyists as informal advisers .
Lobbyist Broderick Johnson , for example , is an informal adviser who represents such clients as Verizon , Microsoft , Shell Oil and the Ford Motor Co. Obama 's main rival , Hillary Rodham Clinton , does not have a conflict - of - interest policy regarding lobbyists .
However , she replaced top strategist Mark Penn earlier this year after he acknowledged meeting with the Colombian ambassador to discuss building support for a free - trade deal that Clinton opposes .
Colombia was a client of Penn 's employer , Burson - Marsteller .
Melanie Sloan of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a liberal - leaning watchdog group , said Scheunemann still has a conflict of interest because his small firm continues to represent foreign clients .
The records that show Scheunemann ceased representing foreign countries as of March 1 also show his partner , Michael Mitchell , remains registered to represent the three nations .
Mitchell said Tuesday that Scheunemann no longer has any role with Orion Strategies but declined to say whether Scheunemann still is receiving income or profits from the firm .
" I can see why the firm would n't want to give up the income , " Sloan said .
" But you can either work for a presidential campaign or be a lobbyist , but not both . "
Scheunemann , who was McCain 's foreign policy adviser during the 2000 presidential campaign , serves as McCain 's spokesman on international issues , including those involving his former clients .
For example , Scheunemann gave an interview in April to U.S. government - funded Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty about Georgia .
" The Georgian example has inspired Americans and American leaders in their dedication to democracy . …
It 's really about shared values , and it 's something that Sen.
McCain feels particularly deeply , " Scheunemann said .
Georgia paid Orion Strategies $ 240,000 in the year ending Dec. 1 , reports show .
Five staffers and advisers have left McCain 's campaign in recent weeks because of the new conflict - of - interest policy .
Democrats have pounced on the departures , saying they show McCain has been surrounded by lobbyists while decrying their influence in Washington .
" The fact is , John McCain 's campaign is being run by Washington lobbyists and paid for with their money , " Obama said Monday in Billings , Mont .
Hazelbaker suggested Obama was being disingenuous because he does not restrict the lobbying activities of his advisers .
Obama 's campaign co-chairman , former South Carolina governor Jim Hodges , was a registered lobbyist from June 2007 until March for Chicago - based financial services firm Hillenbrand Partners .
" The McCain campaign has put forward the most stringent policy of any presidential campaign in history , and it will be instructive to see if Obama meets the standard set by McCain , " Hazelbaker said in an e-mail .
Foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann , left , chats with John McCain aboard the candidate 's chartered plane last week .

California 's ruling is expected to have an impact on the nationwide debate
California 's top court has ruled that a state law banning marriage between same - sex couples is unconstitutional .
The state 's Supreme Court said the " right to form a family relationship " applied to all Californians regardless of sexuality .
The ban was approved by voters in 2000 but challenged by gay rights activists and the city of San Francisco .
The state legislature twice passed laws to legalise gay marriage , but Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed them .
He said California 's court system should rule on the matter .
The seven - judge panel voted 4 - 3 in favour of the plaintiffs who argued that the 2000 law was discriminatory .
" Limiting the designation of marriage to a union ' between a man and a woman ' is unconstitutional and must be stricken from the statute , " California Chief Justice Ron George said in the written opinion .
' Historic '
The decision was met outside the courthouse by cheers from gay marriage supporters .
" I 'm profoundly grateful .
This is a historic day , " said San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera , who argued the city 's case to the court .
" Everybody being entitled to equal protection under the law probably carried the day , " he said .
The ruling paves the way for California to become only the second US state , after Massachusetts , to allow same - sex marriage .
The decision is expected to re-invigorate the fight for same - sex marriage rights nationwide , say gay activists and legal experts .
California 's Supreme Court has a history of landmark rulings that are later picked nationally .
The state currently offers same - sex couples who register as domestic partners the same legal rights and responsibilities as married men and women .
Other states , such as Vermont and New Jersey , have similar civil union provisions .
Californian voters approved the ban against same - sex marriages in a 2000 referendum .
The law stated that " only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognised in California " .
In early 2004 , San Francisco became the first place in the US where gay couples were able to marry after the city 's Mayor Gavin Newsom authorised same - sex marriage licences , claiming the state legislation was discriminatory .
In August of that year , California 's Supreme Court ruled the mayor had overstepped his authority and nullified the hundreds of marriages .
Gay rights group Equality California was joined by nearly two dozen gay couples and the city of San Francisco in bringing the case to the Supreme Court .
The good folks at Evil Mad Scientist Labs have unveiled their fantastic HOWTO for recreating a 1958 , oscilloscope - based proto - video - game called " Tennis for Two , " created by a physicist named William Higinbotham " to improve what was an otherwise lackluster visitors ' day at the lab . "
Before we start , let 's be clear that this is not a tutorial in how to build an oscilloscope .
Tennis for
Two is supposed to display on a ' scope , so beg , borrow , or buy one if you do n't have one handy .
Older low - end analog scopes like mine ( a Hameg ! ) usually go for $ 50 - $ 150 , and if nothing else , you can always make a Scope Clock out of it later .
There are three parts to the electronics that we 're building .
First , there is the AVR microcontroller– the brains of the outfit .
The specific variety that we 're using is the ATmega168 , the same chip used in ( for example ) the Arduino platform .
Secondly , there are two handheld controllers that connect to the ATmega168 microcontroller .
Each handheld controller has a knob and a button .
Third , there is the digital to analog converter that takes the output from the AVR and uses it to drive the scope .

A solitary chunk of granite , small enough to heft in one hand , is key evidence that Australia and parts of Antarctica were once attached to North America , a new study suggests .
The Earth 's continents are thought to have collided to become supercontinents and broken apart again several times in Earth 's 4.5 billion year history .
The most recent supercontinent was Pangaea , which began to break apart about 200 million years ago ; the landmasses that comprised Pangaea eventually wandered into the current configuration of continents .
Several supercontinents predating Pangaea have been proposed by geologists , including one dubbed Rodinia that existed about 1.1 billion years ago .
For several decades , researchers have theorized that part of the ancient supercontinent Rodinia broke away from what is now the southwestern United States around 800 million to 600 million years ago , eventually drifting southward to become eastern Antarctica and Australia .
The idea is known as the southwestern United States to East Antarctica ( SWEAT ) hypothesis .
But there was little physical evidence that could tie the southernmost continent to the long - disappeared Rodinia .
Until scientists stumbled upon this rock , that is .
Granite rock belt John Goodge of the University of Minnesota - Duluth and his team were searching in Antarctica 's Transantarctic Mountains for rocks carried along by ice rivers that could provide clues to the composition of the underlying crust of Antarctica , which in most places is buried under 2 miles of ice .
One rock , found atop the so - called Nimrod Glacier , was later determined to be a very specific form of granite with what Goodge describes as having " a particular type of coarse - grained texture . "
Chemical tests run on the rock later revealed that it has a chemistry " very similar to a unique belt of igneous rocks in North America " that stretch from California through New Mexico to Kansas , Illinois and eventually New Brunswick and Newfoundland in Canada , Goodge said .
This belt of rock was a part of what is called Laurentia , thought by some geologists to be the core of Rodinia .
The belt stops suddenly at its western margin , leading geologists to suspect that some piece of crust had rifted away from what is now the West Coast of the United States .
" It just ends right where that ancient rift margin is , " Goodge said .
" And these rocks are basically not found in any other part of the world . "
That a small chunk of this rock should turn up on a glacier high in the mountains of Antarctica is strong evidence in support of the SWEAT model , the researchers say .
" There 's no other explanation for how it got where we found it , " Goodge said .
Biological change
At the time that this rift occurred , a massive change in Earth 's biota , the Cambrian explosion , was also happening .
" During the Cambrian explosion about 520 million years ago we started seeing this huge expansion in the diversity of life forms , " Goodge said .
Piecing together Rodinia helps provide a geological context in which this diversification occurred .
The shifting configuration of landmasses , collisions between them , as well as erosion and the influx of chemicals into the seas may have provided the nutrients for that expanding diversity of lifeforms .
" Something helped trigger that big radiation in life , " Goodge said .
The study , detailed in the July 11 issue of the journal Science , was funded by the National Science Foundation .

101 Amazing Earth Facts
The dead zone that grows and shrinks in the Gulf of Mexico , at the outlet of the Mississippi River , has long been on my radar .
Hurricanes too , have long been on my agenda , for fear that global warming is increasing their intensity and frequency .
However I never thought that I would report on both in the same article , especially in this way .
According to Nancy Rabalais , head of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium , the recent hurricane that swept through the Gulf of Mexico , Hurricane Dolly , managed to keep in check the growth of the dead zone .
“ If it were not for Hurricane Dolly , the size of the Dead Zone would have been substantially larger , ” she said in a news release sent from the consortium ’s research vessel , the Pelica , as it returned from its annual mapping cruise , carrying Rabalais out at the same time each year to measure the area .
The current record for size of this particular dead zone is 8,006 square miles , recorded in 2001 .
Many experts feared that the level of flood runoff would bring so much fertilizer along the Mississippi and in to the Gulf that it would increase the lack of oxygen in the waters , and the size of the dead zone to a record of between 8,300 and 8,800 square miles .
A dead zone is formed when fertilizers and chemicals make their way to the ocean , feeding microscopic plants that reside at the surface , which in turn kills them .
Falling to the bottom , they begin to decompose , using up the salt waters oxygen .
Add to that the fact that , when the fresh water of the Mississippi mixes with the salt water of the Gulf , it creates layers , keeping oxygen trapped at the bottom .
The resulting deoxygenated water becomes impossible to live in for almost all forms of life .
But due to Hurricane Dolly ’s fierce and forceful mixing of the waters , the spread has stopped , especially along the western and shoreward areas , Rabalais said .
Sadly , it may not last .
Steven F. DiMarco , an associate professor in the oceanography department at Texas A&M who also studies the dead zone says that “ I expect that pulse to be making its way out in a few weeks .
It could extend this year ’s hypoxic zone or dead zone further into the summer – maybe even in September . ”

The Wall Street Journal ran an article last week ( subscription req 'd ) that Bush was using an investigation into a 1994 terrorist attack on a Jewish Community Center in Argentina as a way to continue to strain and maintain pressure on Iran .
The only problem ?
There 's no real evidence that Iran was involved in the bombing :
( I ) t is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the case against Iran over the AMIA bombing has been driven from the beginning by US enmity toward Iran , not by a desire to find the real perpetrators .
Evidence ?
We do n't need no stinkin ' evidence .
Nobody could anticipate the president initiating a pre-emptive war against a sovereign nation on trumped up evidence , could they ?
Oh ... wait ...
Climate change and its effects on ecosystems is the No. 1 crisis facing the world , according to Cornell faculty -- but it is a phenomenon not easily reversed .
The most important problem that is more easily solved ?
Insufficient education in science , critical thinking and environmental issues .
That is according to a new study that surveyed Cornell 's academic staff on the world 's leading crises .
The new study is published online in Frontiers e-View and will be published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment .
How Cornell faculty rate the world 's most important and the most solvable problems
On a 5 - point scale , Cornell faculty members rated the most important issues of the day ( their average rating is first number in the parentheses ) and issues that are the most solvable ( average rating for solvability is the second number in the parentheses ) .
10 most important problems
• Climate change and its effects on ecosystems ( 4.39 , 2.63 )
• Corporations have too much influence in governing ( 4.24 , 3.35 )
• Lack of long - term perspective in political , environmental and social actions ( 4.23 , 2.69 )
• Humans are unsustainably exploiting the environment ( 4.13 , 2.79 )
• Maintaining the health of the planet ( 4.1 , 2.67 )
• Lack of global responsibility on the part of corporations , governments and individuals ( 4.03 , 2.97 )
• Global poverty and its effects ( 3.98 , 2.48 )
• Inequitable distribution of wealth among people ( 3.97 , 2.32 )
• Unsuitable growth in energy use ( 3.96 , 2.95 )
• Shortage of potable and clean water ( 3.94 , 3.59 )
10 most easily solved problems
• Lack of sufficient education in science , critical thinking and environmental issues ( 3.8 , 3.87 )
• The epidemic of preventable illnesses in the third world ( 3.44 , 3.81 )
• Inequitable access to health care ( 3.86 , 3.77 )
• Loss of civil liberties in the U.S. under the guise of fighting terrorism ( 4.02 , 3.75 )
• Shortage of potable and clean water ( 3.94 , 3.59 )
• Death of children due to preventable causes ( 3.38 , 3.35 )
• Women 's reproductive health , education , control and options are dictated by others ( 3.85 , 3.34 )
• People and governments are paying less attention to basic science research ( 3.74 , 3 )
• Growing obesity that impacts health by increasing the risk of chronic diseases ( 3.59 , 2.89 )
• Children 's activities are too structured and do not engage them in community ( 3.78 , 2.64 )
" The purpose of our study was to get interdisciplinary understanding of what a wide range of faculty members thought were the greatest crises we face and how solvable they are , " said Cornell visiting fellow Derek Cabrera , Ph.D. ' 07 , lead author of the paper and a former postdoctoral researcher in the College of Human Ecology 's Department of Policy Analysis and Management .
According to the study , almost 300 Cornell faculty members identified the three most important world problems as climate change , corporations having too much influence in governing and a lack of long - term perspective in political , environmental and social actions .
The most solvable critical problems ?
After insufficient education in science , critical thinking and environmental issues , the Cornell faculty rated the epidemic of preventable illnesses in the Third World and inequitable access to health care as most solvable .
" These results should provide useful practical information for setting interdisciplinary research and policy agendas to address these global crises , " said Cabrera , who is CEO of the Ithaca - based company ThinkWorks .
" The world 's problems do n't adhere to disciplinary boundaries , so it is important to understand how scientists from different disciplines view these problems because we will need interdisciplinary teams to solve them . "
The study used " concept mapping " -- developed at Cornell in the late 1980s by Cornell professor of policy analysis and management William Trochim -- that uses brainstorming , multidimensional sorting and rating to summarize how a group conceptualizes a topic .
Co-authors James Mandel , Jason Andras and Marie Nydam are doctoral students in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology .
They teamed up with Cabrera after they had helped organize the course the State of the Planet ( BioNB 321 ) , under the mentorship of faculty members Tom Eisner and Mary Lou Zeeman .
The course , which was offered at Cornell the past two springs , is an interdisciplinary approach to studying the status of the Earth and the crises it faces .
The survey is part of an ongoing follow - up ( described at http://www.whatisthecrisis.org/) to the course .

DETAIL : FLY
The fly is a standard , large housefly .
The server chip is implanted via the underside of the body , with 3 thin wires exiting the underside of the fly .
These wires can act as a support for the fly , and hold it mid-air in the installation space .
DETAIL : WEB CONTENT
Upon visiting the server chip , the online user automatically activates a blink in one of the LEDs .
When at the website content within the chip inside of the fly body , the website user has a facility to turn the user controlled LED on and off .
DETAIL : LEDs
The web server chip is connected to two Light Emitting Diodes ( " LEDs " ) .
Both LEDs are green ( this detail may be modified before installation date ) .
One light is triggered when an individual accesses the webserver ( the " hit " LED ) , and another light is triggered by choice of the visitor to the website ( the " user controlled " LED ) .
The position of the LEDs within / on the fly body are to be finalized , although the hit LED will likely be inserted into the fly body , and the user controlled LED will likely be implanted into the head .
DETAIL : WEBCAM
A webcam is installed in the installation space with a macro view of the fly .
VIEWERS : DIGITAL ( PARTICIPANTS )
The server chip ( a " ACE1101VMT8 " ) will have a simple webpage on it that viewers will see when visiting each part of the fly .
The exact content on each server is to be determined , although each will include a hit counter and a method to contract the user - controlled LED within the fly .
A non-ACE1101VMT8 ( " external " ) website will include some general documentation about the project , the webcam images , and selected texts .
THE Pentagon has announced that it will seek charges that carry the death penalty against a Saudi Arabian accused of plotting the terrorist attack on USS Cole in 2000 that killed 17 sailors .
Abd al - Rahim al - Nashiri , allegedly the al - Qaeda chief for the Arabian peninsula before his capture in 2002 , faces charges of murder , conspiracy , treachery and five other terrorist - related acts if the proposed case is approved by the civilian head of the Guantanamo war crimes tribunal .
Nashiri was one of three suspects interrogated through the controversial technique known as waterboarding while secretly held abroad by the CIA , the agency 's director , Michael Hayden , told the US Congress in February .
The procedure simulates drowning and has been deemed torture by human rights advocates and US allies .
Military interrogators and FBI agents have renounced its use .
Could you make love to your husband every day for a year ?
When Charla Muller told her friends what she was giving her husband Brad for his 40th birthday , she was met with a variety of responses - none remotely positive .
One thought she might have been going through a mid-life crisis of her own when she came up with the idea .
Another questioned her sanity , and yet another asked bluntly : ' Were you drunk when you thought of this ? '
What on earth could the gift have been ?
A particularly hideous pair of cufflinks that light up in the dark ?
A speedboat so expensive that it required selling the house ?
A session with a lapdancer ?
No , it was worse .
Life begins at 40 : Charla Muller and her husband Brad
On the eve of Brad 's birthday , Charla told him that his present was going to be sex with her every day for a year .
She had wracked her brains to think of a gift that was original , intimate and - most importantly - memorable .
' I never wanted him to look back and ask himself : " Now , what was it Charla bought me for my 40th ? " ' she says .
' When I came up with the idea of daily sex for a year , I thought I 'd hit the jackpot .
What man would n't think that was the best present ever ?'
What a pity not everyone - actually , not anyone , if we are being truthful - agreed .
' To be honest , I did n't tell my friends what I 'd got him until halfway through the year , ' says Charla .
' When I did , they were just incredulous , with most thinking that I was quite mad .
' One girlfriend said I must never , ever tell her husband what I was doing in case he got any ideas .
' What they took issue with most was the timescale .
Some could see the merits in offering their husband daily sex for a week , perhaps a month .
But a year ?
It was unthinkable . '
More disappointingly for Charla , the mother of two young children , even Brad thought the idea was a bit , well , unrealistic .
She had been expecting whoops of delight and much punching of the ceiling when she told him of his gift .
Instead , she got sheer bafflement .
' Then , to my horror , he declined the whole thing , saying that he did n't want me to feel that I had to have sex with him - like it was some sort of duty , ' says Charla .
' He actually walked away from me , saying we would discuss it later .
I was quite deflated .'
Gosh , it is hard being a wife sometimes .
All that effort and no one appreciates it .
Still , Charla was n't that easily dissuaded .
She eventually convinced the skeptical Brad that her offer was bona fide , and in July 2006 they embarked on what she would eventually dub the Dance Of The Daily Deed .
Unfortunately , the first night of Brad 's gift coincided with a family holiday to her parents ' home , which meant a house full of squawking babies , demanding toddlers and organised games ( always a passionkiller ) .
' It was hardly conducive to that sort of thing , ' she says .
' I did think : " What on earth am I doing ? "
And it was n't the last time I would think that during the year .
' But I was pleased with myself for seeing it through .
We 'd never have considered doing something like that before , but once we did , we realised it 's not that difficult . '
And so it would continue for an entire year .
So successful was the venture - the couple do n't claim a 100 per cent success rate but say they had sex roughly 28 days a month for 12 months - that Charla , a feisty American from North Carolina , was persuaded to write a book on the subject , 365 Nights : A Memoir Of Intimacy .
Coincidentally , it is not the only one on the subject .
Another book recently published , Just Do It by Douglas Brown , chronicles his quest to have sex with his wife for 101 days .
Compared to Charla 's longer challenge he got off lightly , but both books ( available on Amazon in the UK ) have caused a publishing phenomenon in the U.S. , causing armies of married women to examine their own sex lives , or lack thereof .
What 's interesting - and compelling - is that Charla is the most unlikely sex guru .
Church - going and cookie - baking , she exudes wholesomeness .
Physically , she admits to being ' sturdily built ' and is on the wrong side of 40 .
' I'm hardly a sex kitten , ' she says .
' But then , how many people are ?
That is the point . '
In fact , most of her book is n't about sex at all , but about all the stuff that gets in the way of it for married couples - loading the dishwasher , work , night - time TV , body image , bouts of depression and the fact you need to shave your legs , but really can't be bothered .
Whether you regard it as a funny book or a tragic one will probably pend on your domestic status .
A newly - married woman who always finds time for waxing might read it and laugh , declaring she will never become one of those sad souls who has to schedule sex in the way she schedules PTA meetings .
But one who has been wed for ten , 15 , or 20 years and who has spent more than her fair share of 3ams consoling a sick child is more likely weep in recognition of her own experiences .
And even if offering her husband sex every day for a year was a flippant gesture - which she says it was n't - it made Charla re-examine every aspect of a marriage she had believed was solid .
As she puts it : ' By doing this I really questioned everything I had assumed about my marriage and asked myself : " Was it really that good before ? "
' The answer was that it could n't have been , because the sex side of things had slipped into oblivion - and I had been guilty of allowing that to happen .
' I am not the only woman I know who somehow made a career of dodging sex with my nice husband .
The trouble is that I did n't even admit that to myself until we were well into this process .
' The big challenge then was if we could put things right . '
When they married ten years before the audacious birthday gift , it was all a little different .
She talks movingly of the early months of her marriage when she and Brad watched long married couples in restaurants - people with nothing to say to each other and clearly lacking in intimacy - and sneered at them .
' We did that old thing of saying we would never be like them .
Intimacy was what our whole relationship was built on .
How could it ever not be the foundation stone ?'
And yet that is exactly what happened .
Sex - once all - important - slid down the priority scale once their first child came along .
Eventually , it would languish right at the bottom - ' Somewhere below taking out the rubbish and unloading the dishwasher ' .
Charla traces her ambivalence to sex back to being in the maternity ward after the birth of her first child when a fellow patient advised her to get the doctor to add a few weeks on to the ' no sex ' recommendation on her discharge notes .
' That will buy you time , ' the other woman advised .
So began her ' career of dodging sex ' .
' I ca n't say I hated sex with Brad , ' says Charla .
' Actually , when we did it , it was mostly very nice .
But it was just that I never felt compelled to do it very often .
Something else would always get in the way .
' Obviously it 's normal for women to lose their sex drive for a bit after children are born , but it was more than that .
I did n't even have the desire to get it back .
Worse , I did n't even see that we had a serious problem . '
When she went back to work - she was a high - flying PR executive - she tried desperately to have it all .
' I bought the myth , ' she says .
' I thought I could have the hot marriage , great children and a rewarding job .
Only now do I say to young women : " Maybe go for two of those , and see how far you get . "
' I was naive .
But most of us are .
I was being pulled in so many directions : trying to impress at work , getting home to put a good meal on the table , helping the children with their homework , then getting round to the household chores once they were in bed .
I found it exhausting and I was losing control . '
The final straw came when she returned to the corporate car park one night after work to discover that she had not only left her car keys in the ignition that morning , but left the engine running , too .
' I decided I could n't go on and took a foot off that career ladder .
I started to work just two days a week , which was a huge sacrifice for me .
It meant giving up my prized corner office and training my replacement , which was a huge wrench .
' However , I knew that I could n't continue as I had been doing .'
But what she did n't reflect on then - and , with hindsight , says she should have done - was that her sex life with her husband had become non-existent .
' There were times when the children were little that Brad and I did the deed only very occasionally .
The year after my daughter was born you could count the occasions on two hands .
Maybe one .
' I did n't see it as a problem , though , and I thought my husband agreed with me .
I knew he would have preferred more sex , but he'd resigned himself to the " quality , not quantity " thing .
Or so I thought . '
It was n't until they were having regular sex that Brad confessed he had been deeply hurt by her constant rejections .
' He said he hated feeling that he was pleading for sex .
I never thought of my rejecting that intimacy as rejecting him but , of course , it must have felt like that to Brad .
Why did n't I see that then ?
' I had always thought my marriage was so safe , so solid .
I 'd certainly never considered that Brad might stray , but he did confess to me that he understood why men would .
' That was a bit of a wake - up call for me .
I thought : " How inconsiderate have I been here ? " '
Mercifully , her book does n't linger on what went on in the bedroom - ' I am quite prudish about being public about things like that ' - but what comes across clearly is that it was a logistical nightmare .
' We did have to sit down with the wall planner going : " Well , we have that PTA meeting on Wednesday and you are away for business on Thursday , so we 'll have to have sex on Monday evening and Tuesday morning . "
' Brad was appalled at first .
His view of sex was that it had to be spontaneous and of the moment .
' I always thought that was rubbish .
How can it be spontaneous in the middle of family life ?
So we had to compromise a bit .
As it went on , I scheduled it , but tried not to make him aware of how much I was scheduling it . '
Sometimes , making time for ' it ' was straightforward .
' Some nights it was as simple as turning off the TV , ' she says .
' Like so many couples , we 'd fallen into the habit of watching some TV before bedtime .
By the time we actually went to bed , we were shattered .
' When I started looking at this , though , I realised there was ample time for sex ; we were just putting everything else first .
' I can't say that it was easy making all the effort .
Sometimes it was awful .
But I reasoned with myself that it was important .
How many things do we do in a day that we do n't necessarily want to - from going to work to washing the kitchen floor ?
' I do n't mean that I saw sex with my husband as a chore ( although maybe I did some days ) , but I knew that it could n't possibly always be the candle - scented , blissful experience we read about in magazines . '
That Charla and Brad stuck to his 40th birthday present for the year seems the biggest miracle of all .
At one point she talks hilariously of wanting to multi-task while having sex - ' I actually wanted to talk to him while we were doing it .
I did n't see anything wrong with discussing the babysitter ' - but Brad was n't having any of it .
Other than that , the sex itself was n't a disaster and did n't become jaded because of the frequency .
' Far from it , ' says Charla .
' Because we were having sex so often , it actually took the pressure off , which was really liberating .'
Liberating ?
Some would say that Charla 's offbeat project is the exact opposite .
Does n't it smack of the advice meted out in Fifties manuals about being a good wife by meeting your husband 's needs and to hell with your own ?
She disagrees .
' I gained just as much from this as Brad and , if I 'm honest , it was as much for me in the first place .
I needed the boost in confidence it gave me .
' One of the saddest moments when I was thinking about my marriage was when I realised that sex with Brad was the only thing we shared that was unique to us .
' It was what made us more than roommates , and yet I was denying our marriage that aspect . '
But did it change their marriage for the better ?
' It changed completely , ' says Charla .
' We started being more attentive to each other , not just in bed , but about the trivial little things .
Brad would offer to do some chore or run an errand , and I would n't be thinking he was doing it to gain sex points .
' We became so much closer .
You can't have that sort of regular intimacy in bed without it spilling over into the rest of life .
' There was a lot less narking and sniping .
You just can't do that all day then want to get into bed with the person at night .
' My self - confidence was greatly improved , too .
I 'd always been one of those women who told herself she would want sex more if she just lost 10 lb and felt a bit more sexy .
' Now , I realise feeling sexy is n't about being thin or gorgeous .
My husband desired me as I was - it was just a case of accepting that . '
What of the couple and their incredible sex life now the year has ended ?
She cites one of her husband 's observations as the best way to sum it all up .
' It was Brad who said that sex every day was n't sustainable in a marriage , but nor was no sex at all .
Now , I just say that we 've got a balance in the middle .
' When my girlfriends ask if it 's healthy to do it once a week , three times a week or whatever , I just tell them to do it twice as often as they are doing it at the moment .
' Their husbands will love them for it , and they might just find that they love themselves that little bit more , too .
If they let themselves . '

No matter what type of business you have , it needs a website – and with the way the landscape is changing , a “ cookie cutter ” website is no longer acceptable to search engines or consumers .
Today , the mandate is for websites to be engaging , informative and user friendly , all of which discreetly encourage users to navigate through the pages and take action .
Moreover , they must be chalk full of interesting , sharable content .
In addition to the standard design and programming protocol , these are the elements that optimize a website for conversion – the point at which visitors to the site become paying customers .
Search Engine Optimization ( SEO )
Another essential part of making your website work for you is to enhance it with search engine optimization , or SEO .
Without SEO implementation , a site is virtually guaranteed to rank low in search engines , which means that it is not seen by consumers .
Likewise , the onset of Google Panda and Google Penguin ensures that low quality websites with poorly written content are no longer ranking well either .
The only reliable way to get your website higher in search engine results is to work alongside a SEO firm that knows how to do it right .
Crest Media is a Los Angeles SEO firm that knows how to get your website in front of the consumers you want to target ; we can design and implement an SEO campaign that boosts your search engine rankings and attracts the people you want to convert to be your customers .
We do this by carefully researching keywords ( words that users search with to find a business like yours ) , and strategically implementing them into your Web content over time .
We also program your Web content with meta descriptions and keyword tags , which are essential in order for the major search engines ( Google , Yahoo and Bing ) to index your pages .
Every time your content is crawled by search engine spiders , your website ranks higher on the search engine results pages of users who search for those keywords .
That is the foundation of good SEO ; but yes , we offer even more .

With these services , the content we write for your site can help you get more links from authoritative sites , which leads to better search rankings – a process currently known as " content marketing . "
Quality content marketing services can help your website ’s SEO , as well as help your brand become better recognized by your target audience .
All of this is part of what our Los Angeles SEO firm offers .
Social Media
Yesterday , social media was a fun way to interact with others .
Today , it is the # 1 way to shape your brand , market the content you create and improve the SEO of your website .
The power of social media is something the Crest Media team has understood from the beginning ; that is why we established ourselves as a Los Angeles social media agency years ago .
Others have jumped on the bandwagon since then , but we have helped businesses of all types build a large , lasting social media presence from the onset – and we have done it more effectively .
Some businesses attempt to manage social media on their own .
This is commendable , but difficult and less likely to be successful .
Think about it :
While you may already know how to administrate a Facebook profile , Google + account or Twitter page , do you know how build an audience of consumers on those channels , or how to create content that people want to share ?
Those are the keys to using social media to your advantage , and our Los Angeles social media agency understands them .
When we tap into the “ secrets ” of social media , your business reaps all the benefits .

Whether your social media accounts have been in place for a while or you are just now starting from scratch , Crest Media can build your audience and manage each page on a regularly scheduled basis .

When you are a social media client of Crest Media , we write the content for the About pages on your profiles , post regular status updates and photos on all your social media channels , and even incorporate your blog posts so that they are promoted on social media every week .
In fact , our Los Angeles social media team can even write and manage your company blog .
We market you on social media , so you can attend to your business .
Pay - Per-Click ( PPC )
Organic search results should always be a top priority , but it is also important to use supplemental ads that are tailored to the preferences of pre-qualified prospects .
The way to do this is with pay per click ( PPC ) marketing .
PPC marketing allows you to purchase ads on Google that will appear when a user searches for the keywords you are using in your campaign .
It filters out the users who visit your website , because those who click on your ad are more likely to be people who are actively seeking you out ; and because it only advertises to those who are searching with your keywords , it is highly cost - efficient .

Plus , our pay per click management services allow you to receive regular reporting on the effectiveness of your campaign .
If your experience with a past pay per click company has left you wondering if it is worth it to use PPC marketing , it may be time to give Crest Media PPC services a try .
We offer our pay per click management clients routine , through reporting , with strategy sessions and adjustments to the campaign whenever they are necessary .
This is why our pay per click company can confidently attest to the increased conversion rates of our clients .
Mobile Web Development
There is data on the mobile market that shows us the differences between mobile and desktop browsing ; for example , one study reported that 70 % of mobile tasks occur in just one hour or less .
That tells us that consumers have a greater intent to act when using a mobile browser , as opposed to when they are browsing on a desktop computer .
Crest Media offers Los Angeles mobile
Web design services that capitalize on this revelation .
It starts with constructing a W3C compliant mobile website , using responsive Web design principles ; that means that we uphold the highest standards in mobile Web design .

( Here 's an email Carl de Marcken of ITA Software sent to a friend , describing their experiences using Lisp in one of the software industry 's most demanding applications . )
Date : Fri , 12 Jan 2001 15:42:34 - 0500
From : Carl de Marcken
Geoffrey ,
Here are some tidbits ...
1. Right now Sabre , Galileo , Amadeus and Worldspan operate many millions of dollars of IBM and Unisys mainframes each to answer the vast majority of queries done by airline phone agents , airport desk agents , travel agents , and travel web sites ( other than our own and our customers ' ) .
Their computers are housed in bomb - proof , fire - walled ( literally ) complexes in Kansas City , Denver , Germany and Atlanta , and mostly run assembly language code for performance reasons .
From what we can discern , their algorithms are basic : until we pointed it out to them I do n't think they had any understanding of how hard the problem they 're trying to solve is , or how far their solutions are from optimal .
2. ITA Software is slowly replacing the industry 's hardware and software with Common Lisp code running on Linux PCs , that uses relatively involved algorithms that show off our academic CS background .
The easiest place to see the code in action is on our web site , www.itasoftware.com.
3 . The vast majority of our " thinking " code is in Common Lisp .
We run both CMUCL and Franz , under Linux / Intel , HPUX / PA , and NT / Intel , and have about 200,000 lines of Lisp in our base search engine .
Our web site page generation code is also largely written in Common Lisp , though there 's also fair bit of Java there .
4 . Because we have about 2 gigs of static data we need rapid access to , we use C++ code to memory - map huge files containing pointerless C structs ( of flights , fares , etc ) , and then access these from Common Lisp using foreign data accesses .
A struct field access compiles into two or three instructions , so there 's not really any performance .
penalty for accessing C rather than Lisp objects .
By doing this , we keep the Lisp garbage collector from seeing the data ( to Lisp , each pointer to a C object is just a fixnum , though we do often temporarily wrap these pointers in Lisp objects to improve debuggability ) .
Our Lisp images are therefore only about 250 megs of " working " data structures and code .
5 . Every query that hits our site gets sent via tcpip to a Lisp process running on an dual 800 mhz x86 Linux box with 2g of ram ( $ 3000 , vs about $ 1,000,000 for a similarly capable mainframe ) , and the process devotes between 5 and 15 seconds of CPU time to it .
One of our customers will have 200 such boxes , each running 2 or 3 Lisp processes .
We save on ram by putting multiple processes on one box , since the virtual memory system automatically shares our read - only memory - mapped files between processes .
6 . If you want to do a simple round - trip from BOS to LAX in two weeks , coming back in three , willing to entertain a 24 hour departure window for both parts , then limiting to " reasonable " routes ( at most 3 flights and at most 10 hours or so ) you have about 5,000 ways to get there and 5,000 ways to get back .
Listing them is a mostly trivial graph - search ( there are a few minor complications , but not many ) , that anybody could do in a fraction of a second .
7 . The real challenge is that a single fixed itinerary ( a fixed set of flights from BOS to LAX and a fixed set back ) with only two flights in each direction may have more than 10,000 possible combinations of applicable " fares " , each fare with complex restrictions that must be checked against the flights and the other fares .
That means that the search space for this simple trip is of the order 5000 x 5000 x 10000 , and a naive program would need to do a _lot_ of computation just to validate each of these possibilities .
Suitably formalized , its not even clear that the problem of finding the cheapest flight is NP - complete , since it is difficult to put a bound on the size of the solution that will result in the cheapest price .
If you 're willing to dispense with restrictions on the energy in the universe , then it is actually possible to formalize the cheapest - price problem in a not - too - unreasonable way that leads to a proof of undecidability by reduction to the Post correspondance problem :-) .
8. Our Lisp code is running very clever algorithms that let us produce in a reasonable time a data structure we call the " pricing - graph " from which we can very efficiently answer a query of the form " give me the k - th best solution ( a validated set of flights and fares ) , ordered according to the function f " , assuming of course certain restrictions on f , where the number of answers represented by the pricing - graph is 10^20 - 10^30 depending on the type of trip .
In this way , we can reasonably claim that in 10 seconds we can produce 10^30 answers , even if we could not possibly enumerate the list of such answers .
9 . We can do 10 seconds of Lisp computation on a 800 mhz box and cons less than 5 k of data .
This is because we pre-allocate all data structures we need and die on queries that exceed them .
This may make many Lisp programmers cringe , but with a 250 meg image and real - time constraints , we can't afford to generate garbage .
For example , rather than using cons , we use " cons ! " , which grabs cells from an array of 10,000,000 cells we 've preallocated and which gets reset every query .
10 .
A lot of our Lisp is designed to compile into very efficient assembly .
We make a lot of use of Lisp 's macro capabilities , but shy away from many other Lisp features like closures , generic functions , complex sequence functions and garbage collection .
We 're doing an incredible amount of computation - getting 10 seconds on a modern machine is an incredible gift - but if we 're sloppy at all 10 seconds can turn into ten minutes , not adequate for a travel agent or web site .
We disassemble most every Lisp function looking for inefficiencies and have had both CMUCL and Franz enhanced to compile our code better .
11 . Occasionally we 've had to move code from Lisp to C++ , usually because of data loading issues ( Lisp garbage collectors just can't deal with gigs of data , and there 's no way to rapidly load gigs of data into a Lisp ) .
Our experience has been a 10 to 1 code expansion ; I do n't think there are any programmers in our company that regret the choice of Common Lisp .
12 . We 've had very little trouble getting non-Lisp programmers to read and understand and extend our Lisp code .
The only real problem is that the training most programmers have in Lisp has taught them to code very inefficiently , without paying any attention to the compiler .
Of course , with things like STL and Java , I think programmers of other languages are also becoming pretty ignorant .

From : Carl de Marcken
Paul ,
I do n't have any problems with it going up on a site , but please make a note that this message is old and the world is constantly changing : we now have thousands of CPUs running our code , and various airlines and major web sites ( Orbitz , e.g. ) depending on it .
The mainframes are disappearing as our stuff replaces it .
