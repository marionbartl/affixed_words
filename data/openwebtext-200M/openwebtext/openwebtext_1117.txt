The Independent has launched a Newzdog widget for news and sport delivered directly to your desktop .
Download the Newzdog widget here
The widget is a simple and easy to use desktop alert notification system enabling you to receive news and information that is only relevant to you .
It enables users to log searches on their favourite topics so that when news on that topic is published by The Independent , they are instantly notified .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
To use the widget , an Independent reader instals the widget and searches for topics of interest , and saves those topics if they are interested in receiving further updates .
Once installed , the user can minimise it so it sits in the system tray as a yellow star .
When a story is published of relevance to the search , a small pop -up window will alert the user , and the star turns red .
To read the story , the user simply clicks on the star and the story emerges in a Newzdog page – with all links and video fully functional .
Users can add as many alerts as they like , effectively designing their own news service , so if a user wants to know about diverse subjects such as Harry Potter , Manchester United and Barack Obama , they can set up news alerts for all three and be alerted the instant articles are published
Welcoming the new service , Jimmy Leach , editorial director for digital at the Independent said : “ This is a great way for users to make sure they know what ’s going on in their areas of interest .
Users often have topics they want or need to be kept in the loop about quickly , so this will be an excellent way of them creating their own mini-news service ”
Steve Morris of Newzdog added : " We see the Independent Newzdog widget as a way of getting your own personal online version of the Independent where you only receive news stories on subjects you are interested in and be alerted to these news stories as soon as they break . "
The most extraordinary of Vietnam films , and by far the craziest version of a Conrad novel ever conceived , Coppola ’s Oscar - winning modernisation of Heart of Darkness is without compare .
Its hallucinatory feel and dystopian view of American soldiering was achieved only after a shoot so beset with disaster that Coppola compared it to Vietnam itself .
Politics
The Honorable Joe Wilson
So president called unnamed " prominent politicians " liars in his health care speech in a most calculated and misleading way .
That was clearly dishonorable .
The Congressman from South Carolina shouted out " liar " in a most uncalculating and passionate way at a pretty appropriate time .
That was , in a way , dishonorable ; the president should be treated with respect in public .
On the other hand , it 's characteristic of a man of honor to say what 's on his mind openly , fearlessly , and without calculation .
That Rep. Wilson did .
And then he apologized -- with genuine regret -- in a most manly way -- mainly on FOX , which was honorable enough to give him an appropriate venue .
He went on to explain in a more respectful way why he was basically right -- that his excessively impetuous passion was in the service of truth .
So no one has displayed more honor of late than the southern man from South Carolina .
Margaret , I have n’t laughed so hard since Katie Couric interviewed Sarah Palin .
A few thousand white folks called in sick to work last week so they could parade around the nation ’s capital on Saturday and Fox News declares a revolution is underway .
My goodness .
I do n’t know which is more sad – the fact that they could n’t spell half the words written on their illegible signs or that they all left their white hoods at home .
Bring the hippies back .
Their protests were much more entertaining .
Just to give you some perspective :
1925 – Ku Klux Klan – 35,000 KKK members marched on Washington
1963 – March for Freedom with Martin Luther King – 250,000 marched
1969 – March to end the Vietnam War – 600,000 marched
1993 – Gay and Lesbian Rights – 800,000 marched
1995 – Million Man March – 600,000 marched
2004 – March for Women ’s Lives ( Pro-Choice ) – over 1 million marched
2009 – Obama Inauguration – over 1 million celebrate
September 12 , 2009 – Tea Party Hillbilly Rally – 78,000 marched but only 3 seemed to know what they were marching about .
I ’ll tell you what Margaret .
You would never know by watching Fox News that 78,000 racists marching on the nation ’s capital was cause for concern .
You would think we were finally winning the war against the British .
Of course , according to Harold ’s television set , larger crowds gathered at dozens of football games that day so what the hell do I care .
Let me just say something about the 9 - 12 Project .
On September 12 , 2001 everyone was an American .
There were no Blue States and no Red States .
There were no Black Americans and no White Americans .
There were no Europeans , no Asians , no Hispanics , no Africans …
The world was standing with America against the evil that is terrorism .
The globe was united like never before .
And what did our President do when given that moment ?
He told us all to go shopping while he and his buddies planned a war .
And 8 years later the 9 - 12 project has been reduced to a movement of no Blacks , no Hispanics , no Asians … just 78,000 white people who ca n’t spell .
But it ’s not really these 78,000 marchers that worry me .
It ’s the media that gives them so much attention .
Did anyone else notice that when a million Pro-Choice women marched on Washington and 50 nut - jobs stood on the corner mis-quoting the bible , it was the bible thumping nut - jobs getting more coverage on the evening news ?
I mean 5 KKK members march down Main Street and the news crews out number the marchers 10 to 1 .
69 million people voted for Barack Obama knowing full well that Universal Healthcare was a major issue in his campaign .
78,000 people marched on Washington claiming that America has been stolen .
Now I am not an expert , but I have to believe that fancy CNN map of John King ’s should be able to figure out that math .
The biggest problem facing America today is n’t the war , the economy , healthcare or even racism .
The biggest threat to America is the lack of news coverage in our newscasts .
Honestly I do n’t give a damn what LaToya Jackson thinks , what Paris Hilton ate , what Hillary Clinton is wearing or who Brad Pitt is dating .
And I especially do n’t give a rat ’s ass what 78,000 peckerwoods with too much time on their hands think about something as complicated as Universal Healthcare .
You know what would have been a good news story ?
How many of those yahoos marching last weekend actually have health insurance much less a full set of teeth ?
Did anyone bother to ask that question ?
It ’s not news .
It ’s nonsense .
Really .
I mean it .
Previous | Next High-rise Fridge Delivery Posted at : 2009-07-06 09:51:49 Original ad :
I bought this GE refrigerator a few years ago , but just got a new one for my kitchen and no longer need it .
It still works perfectly and is very large , perfect as your main fridge for a kitchen .
I 'm asking $ 300 for it .
I am located in Brooklyn , but will be willing to deliver it up to 25 miles for a small fee .
From Mike Partlow to ************@**********.org
Hello ,
I am very interested in your fridge .
Is it still available ?
If so , how much would you charge to deliver it to my place in the city ?
Mike
From marty ******* to Me
Yes mike it is still available .
I will deliver it for an extra $ 50 .
where is your place located ?
From Mike Partlow to marty *******
I want it delivered to my office on the 67th floor of the *********
Building on **rd st and **********.
Now I am pretty sure that the fridge wo n't fit in the elevator , and if it does , it would exceed the weight capacity , so you will have to carry it up the stairs .
I hope this wo n't be a problem .
When can you deliver it ?
I work Monday - Friday 9 - 5 and can be there any time .
I do need it sooner rather than later , however .
Mike
From marty ******* to Me
that is absurd .
Im not going to heave this very heavy fridge up 67 flights of stairs .
Dosent your building have a cargo / utility elevator ?
From Mike Partlow to marty *******
Marty , you do n't have to lug it up 67 flights of stairs .
There is a loading bay around back that starts on the 2nd floor , and I 'm pretty sure this building does not count the 13th floor .
So you are really only carrying it up 65 flights of stairs .
There was a cargo elevator , but building management has told me that I am never allowed to use it again after I attempted to bring my motorcycle up to my office .
They do n't let just anyone use it anymore , so that is n't an option .
From marty ******* to Me
absolutely not .
do you have any idea how heavy this thing is ?
why do you even need a full size fridge in your office ?
just buy one of those small mini fridges .
From Mike Partlow to marty *******
Marty ,
You are obviously not a very good salesman if you are trying to suggest I buy something else instead of your product .
How is that working out for you ?
Do you make a lot of money that way ?
Not that it is any of your business , but I cannot afford rent in my apartment anymore and am slowly trying to move into my office so I can live out of there .
I plan on disguising the fridge as a filing cabinet so my company will not get suspicious .
If anyone asks you what you are doing when you are moving it into my office , just tell them that you are delivering my new filing cabinet .
Try to tuck the power cord under the fridge so they do n't realize that it is actually a fridge .
How does next Tuesday work ?
I am free all day .
Mike
From marty ******* to Me
mike I do n't think you understood me .
I am NOT delivering the fridge to your office .
it 's way too big and heavy , and I doubt you will find anyone willing to carry it up to the 67th floor .
From Mike Partlow to marty *******
Marty ,
I 'm sorry , I must have misread your ad .
I could have sworn it said " will be willing to deliver it up to 25 miles for a small fee . "
Am I crazy , or did your ad say that ?
I do n't recall it saying " will be willing to deliver it as long as your building is n't too big and scary for my weak little body to carry it . "
From marty ******* to Me
Hey listen asshole .
You are a Fuckin idiot if you honestly think somebody will do this .
It has nothing to do with strength it is just an insane request .
the only way you will get a fucking fridge up there is with an elevator .
fuck off .
From Mike Partlow to marty *******
Marty , I get what you are saying .
It does n't have anything to do with strength , because even my 120 lb ex-wife could carry this thing up .
It is clearly a lack of motivation .
You need to be in the right mindset to be able to do this .
Tell you what , I 'll stand behind you as you carry it up , and shout encouraging motivational words at you to keep you going .
I 'll say things like " c'mon Marty , you can do it !
You 're almost there ! " and " do n't give up ! "
I 'll even bring a few bottles of Gatorade in case you get thirsty .
What flavor do you want ?
I have frost and orange , but I really do n't recommend orange because it does n't even taste like Gatorade .
So see you Tuesday ?
Mike
From marty ******* to Me
shut the fuck up .

Last week , Congressional Representatives Ed Markey and Anna Eshoo introduced the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009 .
Public Knowledge provides a great rundown of the net neutrality bill .
While some have suggested that the bill merely allows the U.S. to catch up to Canada , a closer look reveals that the bill would move the U.S. far beyond Canada in dealing with net neutrality issues as it directly addresses many of the issues raised during the CRTC network management hearing .
In particular :
1. Traffic management guidelines .
It establishes reasonable network management traffic management guidelines similar to those proposed by the OIC and CIPPIC .
The bill states :
a network management practice is a reasonable practice only if it furthers a critically important interest , is narrowly tailored to further that interest , and is the means of furthering that interest that is the least restrictive , least discriminatory , and least constricting of consumer choice available .
This is not current Canadian law , though the CRTC has been asked to adopt something very similar .
2. Transparency .
The bill requires full public disclosure of traffic management practices , something opposed by some ISPs at the traffic management proceeding .
The bill states :
each Internet access service provider shall provide to consumers and make publicly available detailed information about such services , including information about the speed , nature , and limitations of such services .
Each Internet access service provider must publicly disclose , at a minimum , network management practices that affect communications between a user and a content , application , or service provider in the ordinary , routine use of such broadband service .
This bill would provide far greater mandated transparency than that found in Canada .
3. Unbundling .
The bill ensures that broadband providers do n't force consumers into buying additional services if all they want is Internet access .
The bill states :
rules to ensure that an Internet access service provider does not require a consumer , as a condition on the purchase of any Internet access service offered by such provider , to purchase any other service or offering .
The Commission shall adopt any other rules it determines necessary to make such requirement effective and meaningful for consumers .
4 . Net neutrality conditions .
The bill includes a whole series of net neutrality conditions , some of which are much more specific than those found under Canadian law .
PK notes that they include that Internet access providers :
Must not block , interfere with , discriminate against , or degrade the ability of a user to engage in lawful activity on the Internet
May not charge users additional fees for accessing specific Internet content or services
Must allow a user to connect any lawful application or device to the network , so long as that application or device does not harm the network
May not provide or sell any technology that prioritizes any one party 's traffic over that of another party
Michael Geist is a law professor and the Canada Research Chair in Internet and e-commerce law at the University of Ottawa .
Nothing makes the Republicans happier than making sure regular people like us have as few rights as possible , and their obsession with " tort reform " is part of that campaign .
Remember , I used to investigate incompetent and crooked docs for a living .
There are more of them out there than most people will ever know , and they cause real damage to people 's lives - and it's often expensive damage .
So the same Republicans who want to take away your legal right to sue to cover your care do n't even pretend they want you to get the needed medical treatment , either .
And if Olympia Snowe has her way , the Democrats will roll over your legal rights in their eagerness to get a bipartisan deal on the healthcare reform bill .
ABC News ' Jonathan Karl reports : Republicans have long pushed for limits on malpractice lawsuits – what advocates call malpractice reform .
It ’s a central element of any Republican health care plan .
But to Democrats and their trial lawyer supporters , the idea has been a non-starter .
Now , it seems , malpractice reform may be back in play .
The reason : Olympia Snowe , the sole Republican Senator who seems inclined to support Democrats on health care reform , wants it .
Snowe told me today she likes the proposal put forward by Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus .
“ There ’s a lot of promising elements in it , ” she said .
“ It ’s a work in progress . ”
When I asked what she wants changed , she said she ’d like to see it include malpractice reform , which she called critical to controlling health care costs .
To Democrats malpractice reform may be too a steep price to pay , but Snowe right now may be the only way Democrats get the 60 votes they need in the Senate .
More Republican hypocrisy , of course .
Just look at the states that have instituted the Republican version of tort reform , like Texas .
Health care costs ( and malpractice premiums ) went up , not down .
Queen Olympia knows this - she 's just holding all the cards in this bipartisan poker game .
And they 're playing with our lives .
Just another example of Her Royal Attitude :
On Wednesday afternoon , Olympia Snowe told MSNBC 's David Shuster and Tamron Hall that she has personally asked President Obama to remove any mentions of the public option from his speech to Congress .
Snowe said she wanted the president to take the public option " off the table " because doing so " would allay the concerns of so many of whether or not there 's a government takeover . "
Snowe added , " The point is , I do n't support a public option , and none of my Republican colleagues do . "
And you know what ?
I 'll bet you she gets her way .
( But hoping to be proved wrong ! )

Dogbert and Dilbert sit at a table .
Dogbert asks , " How do you like your new book - ' The History of Glue ? ' "
Dilbert replies , " I could n't put it down . "
Dilbert and Dogbert look at each other .
DALLAS ( Reuters ) - Liberal religious groups announced on Monday they are teaming up with President Barack Obama in a national campaign to counter the surprisingly vehement conservative opposition to his plan for overhaul of the U.S. healthcare industry this year .
A woman holds a cross as she prays in Midtown Manhattan , April 10 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Stephen Chernin
Organized by liberal - leaning evangelicals , some mainline Protestant clergy , and some Catholic groups , it will include Obama participating in a call - in program with religious leaders streamed on the Internet on August 19 , prayer meetings and nationwide television ads .
“ As a pastor I believe access to healthcare is a profoundly moral issue , ” Rev. Stevie Wakes of Olivet Institutional Baptist in Kansas City , said in a news teleconference announcing the “ 40 days for Health Reform ” campaign .
Protestors have confronted members of Congress across the country in town hall meetings held to take the public pulse on the various healthcare overhaul plans being written in Congress .
What lawmakers found was anger fueled in part by Christian and conservative radio that healthcare would lead to taxpayer funded abortion and even euthanasia for the old , have incited much of the loudest and most dramatic reaction .
Conservative Catholics often side with Republican - leaning evangelicals in opposition to abortion rights but the biblical call to help the sick and the poor is also an important part of the faith .
Obama ’s healthcare agenda includes extending health insurance to the roughly 46 million uninsured Americans .
Some of the opposition is being fueled by leaders of the “ religious right , ” the conservative Christian movement that remains a key base for the opposition Republican Party .
Religion often plays a huge role in politics in America , where church attendance is high .
Obama tapped into this sentiment during his White House race , often talking openly about his own Christian faith .
This counterpunch by what has been called the religious left will also feature events with members of Congress in states such as Colorado and Florida .
Conservative Democratic members of Congress in several states are regarded as key by both sides to the success or failure of health reform .
Analysts say it remains to be seen if it will pay off with some political dividends at this crucial juncture for the healthcare plan .
Lawmakers have said they are working to pass the legislation this year to avoid embroiling healthcare reform in next year ’s congressional election politics .
“ I think that the Democrats were surprised by the strength of the religious right and the insurance companies and those opposed to healthcare reform when they got their grass roots efforts going , ” said Cal Jillson , a political scientist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas .
“ So it took awhile for the Religious Left to get their national campaign going and we ’ll see whether or not it has the same emotion and intensity , ” he said .
The groups behind the effort include Faith in Public Life , Faithful America and Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good .
All right , so what is “ polyamory ” ?
The word polyamory is based on the Greek and Latin for “ many loves ” ( literally , poly many + amor love ) .
A polyamorous person is someone who has or is open to having more than one romantic relationship at a time , with the knowledge and consent of all their partners .
A polyamorous relationship is a romantic relationship where the people in the relationship agree that it ’s okay for everyone to be open to or have other romantic partners .
Polyamory is the idea or practice of being polyamorous or having polyamorous relationships .
So polyamory is like swinging ?
Not exactly .
Swinging has a different focus .
Swingers focus on recreational sex , though friendships and deeper bonds may develop .
With polyamory , deep relationships are the focus , though the sex is often fun .
Oh , I gotcha .
So , like , you have a girlfriend on the side .
No .
That is something different as well .
The technical term for that is “ cheating . ”
Six of one , half a dozen of the other .
No .
The thing that defines a polyamorous relationship is that everyone involved knows about , and agrees to , everyone else ’s involvement .
If you are married , and you have a girlfriend that your wife does n’t know about , or that your wife suspects but is n’t sure about , or that your wife knows about but is n’t happy with , you ’re not poly , you ’re cheating .
Similarly , if you ’re banging the milkman while your husband is out of town , you ’re not poly , you ’re cheating .
Polyamory is defined by informed consent of all the participants .
Without it , it ai n’t poly .
If you ca n’t invite your lover over to Thanksgiving dinner with the rest of your family because you do n’t want anyone to know what you ’re doing , it probably ai n’t poly .
Poly , schmolly .
It ’s just a polite way of saying your partner lets you cheat .
No .
Cheating is breaking the rules .
If you are n’t breaking the rules of your relationship , you are not cheating , by definition .
The rules need not be explicit ; even breaking the tacit rules of a relationship is cheating .
If you do anything you cannot feel comfortable telling your mate about , or if you do anything that you know would make your mate unhappy if he or she knew about it , you are quite likely cheating , plain and simple .
Polyamory is a completely different way to define your relationship .
Polyamory is an acknowledgment of the simple fact that relationships do not come in “ one size fits all . ”
In a poly relationship —
Okay , okay , I understand .
Poly is for people who ca n’t commit !
No , no , no .
Just the opposite , in fact ; people who ca n’t commit to one person sure as hell ca n’t make a lasting commitment to two !
It ’s been my experience that many monogamous people actually practice “ serial monogamy ” — jumping from lover to lover to lover — while claiming to be “ monogamous ” with each one .
While no reasonable person expects every relationship to last , it seems that many “ serial monogamists ” see their partners as expendable , or more often , stay with one partner only until someone “ better ” comes along .
Polyamory is more ethical than serial monogamy as it is sometimes practiced ; polyamorists do not discard their lovers when the next interesting person walks down the road .
This flavor of serial monogamy is , I think , the essence of people who ca n’t commit !
But if you love someone , you should n’t want anyone else .
That ’s a common idea , but it does n’t really hold up in practice .
Many people believe that a person who has multiple loves can’t give their “ whole heart ” to any person .
The belief goes that if you love one person , you can express your love wholeheartedly , but if you love multiple people , your love is divided up and is therefore not as deep .
This is based on the “ starvation model ” of love — that is , you only have a limited amount of love , and if you give your love to one person , there is none left to give to anyone else — so if you fall in love with another person , you have to “ pay ” for it by withdrawing your love from the first person .
Love is not the same thing as money .
With money , you have only a limited amount to spend , and when you give it to one person you have less left to give to another .
But love behaves in wonderful and unpredictable and counterintuitive ways .
When you love more than one person , you soon realize that the more love you give away , the more love you have to give .
Yes , you CAN give your whole heart to more than one person , and when you do , you realize it ’s the most beautiful feeling in all the world .
Do n’t think of the contents of your heart the way you think of the contents of your wallet ; it does n’t work like that .
Some people also seem to feel that it is not possible to love more than one person at a time , so if you ’re in a position where you ’re in a relationship with one person and you happen to fall for someone else , this “ proves ” you do n’t really love the person you ’re with , right ?
After all , the feeling goes , we are put here on this earth to love only one other person , our one true soulmate in a world of six billion people … the single person who is right for us , and who by some quite astounding coincidence happens to go to the same school , or work at the same place .
This is the “ scarcity model ” of love — the notion that love is rare , that we can only have one true love , and that once we meet that one true love , the part of our brains that take notice of other people suddenly and mysteriously shut off .
Anyway , as I was saying , in a poly relationship , it is vital — perhaps even more vital than in a monogamous relationship — for everyone involved to know and understand the rules of the relationship , and abide by them .
A successful poly relationship absolutely requires trust and security from everyone involved .
If you cannot abide by the relationship ’s rules , you cannot expect to make a polyamorous relationship work .
Rules ?
What rules ?
You want to sleep with someone else , you do , right ?
It does n’t work that way .
There are , of course , as many different varieties of polyamory as there are people ; there ’s no one right way to create a polyamorous relationship , though ethical polyamorous relationships do involve honesty , respect , and compassion .
But being polyamorous does not give you license to make like a bunny in heat .
A polyamorous relationship is n’t about sex ; it ’s about building a romantic relationship with more than one person at a time .
And yes , there are rules .
Yeah ?
Like what kind of rules ?
Depends on the relationship .
Some poly relationships , called “ polyfidelity ” relationships , have rules not much different from a traditional monogamous relationship , only there are more than two people involved .
A polyfidelitous triad , for example , may have three people involved , with one person sexually active with the other two , or even with all three people sexually involved with one another .
However , nobody in the relationship may take an “ outside ” lover , just as neither partner in a monogamous relationship is allowed to have an outside lover ; if you do , it ’s cheating .
Cheating , if anything , is a more serious offense in a polyfidelity relationship than in a monogamous relationship — because if you cheat , you are betraying more than one person ’s trust .
Other polyamorous relationships may permit the people involved to have “ outside ” lovers under certain circumstances — often , for example , only if the outside lover is approved beforehand by everyone involved , and only if the outside lover knows the nature of the relationship .
The individual relationships within a polyamorous group may be very complex , as well .
In many cases , there may be one “ primary ” couple — a husband and wife , for example .
Either or both of those people may have outside lovers , but those relationships are “ secondary ” in the sense that they involve less involvement in the partners ’ day - to - day lives than , say , a marriage does .
Note :
This does not mean that these relationships are of secondary importance , or that the people involved in such “ secondary ” relationships contribute less or are less valued !
It simply means that these relationships have different goals or parameters than the “ primary ” relationship .
Or , the polyamorous relationship may be such that each individual relationship is as important as all the others , and no single couple is “ primary . ”
Uh-huh .
Says who ?
Who makes these rules , anyway ?
Everyone involved .
Polyamory is not about “ I want to go shag that person over there , and if you do n’t like it , tough . ”
It ’s reasonable for everyone involved to expect to have some kind of input on the relationships that go on .
It ’s reasonable to want to set limits , and it ’s necessary and reasonable to want to establish a framework that protects both your feelings and the feelings of everyone else involved in the relationships , directly or indirectly .
You do this by negotiating a clear , explicit , and unambiguous set of conditions that guides the manner in which your relationships form , and establishes that framework that helps to make sure everyone ’s needs are being met and nobody ’s feelings are disregarded .
It is also important to understand that any breach of these terms is a very , very serious matter — just as serious as cheating in a conventional monogamous relationships !
This framework , and the willingness of everyone involved to abide by the terms you set together , are what creates the foundation of trust that a polyamorous relationship requires .
Without that trust , it ’s reasonable to expect that you or someone you care about will end up miserable .
Did n’t this whole “ free love ” thing die out in the ’60s ?
It never really existed , even back then .
But that ’s irrelevant .
Polyamory is n’t free love .
All these different flavors of polyamory have their own dynamic , but ultimately , they are all about building relationships , not about sex .
Okay , so they are about sex as well .
After all , most romantic relationships do involve sex , and poly is about romantic relationships .
( Not for everybody , of course .
There are folks who have romantic relationships without sex .
But often , for many of us , romance does include some element of sex . )
But the point is , it is n’t just the sex .
And the idea of polyamory predates the ’60s , anyway .
In fact , it ’s at least as old as human history .
Examples of non-monogamous relationships can be found in many places at any time throughout history .
Is n’t this all some sexist , misogynistic , male - dominated Fundamentalist Mormon thing , like on that HBO show “ Big Love ” ?
No .
The image that many people have in their heads , of one man with many women as in the HBO series , is technically “ polygyny . ”
Polygyny ( from the Greek poly many + gynos woman ) is the form of polygamy where a man can have more than one female partner , but women are not allowed to have more than one male partner .
In societies where polygyny is practiced , women are usually seen as little more than property .
Since people have this mistaken notion of polyamory , it ’s easy to understand why they think “ polyamory ” means “ disrespect of women . ”
But polyamory is not polygyny .
Polyamory applies equally to everybody .
In an ethical polyamorous relationship , the same opportunities are afforded to everyone , regardless of their sex .
Polyamory is not about collecting a bunch of women for your harem .
Polyamory is about sharing some part of your life and sharing your love with more than one other person — and your lovers sharing some part of THEIR lives and some part of THEIR love with more than one other person .
Polyamory is not about “ owning ” your lovers and hiring an army of eunuchs to make sure they do n’t stray .
Let ’s get back to this sex thing .
How do you decide who sleeps with whom ?
Depends on the nature of the relationship .
If there is a primary couple and secondary relationships , typically the primary couple will determine a set of ground rules for who is boinking whom , and when .
In a polyfidelity group , the people work out their interpersonal dynamics themselves .
And , of course , if you have a king - sized bed , who knows ?
Maybe you ’ll find that you like an extra pair of feet in your bed !
But the “ who is sleeping with whom ” question is n’t necessarily the most interesting thing about a poly relationship .
Remember , with polyamory , we ’re talking about more than one romantic relationship , not just more than one sex partner .
The social dynamic can be very complex , and goes way beyond who ’s having sex with whom .
I ’ll bet .
Like , how do you keep from being jealous ?
Ah , now that is a real question !
In fact , that question has its own page .
But if someone feels jealous , is n’t that their problem ?
No , it ’s everyone ’s problem , and successful resolution of the problem requires you to find out why they feel jealous .
If you treat your lovers as though they are interchangeable , they ’ll be jealous .
If you do n’t take care to make your lovers feel wanted or needed , they ’ll be jealous .
If you are n’t careful to make it clear to all of your partners that you value them , you wo n’t keep any of them for long .
Sometimes , it ’s easy , especially when you take a new partner , to forget your existing partner in the rush and excitement of exploring a new lover .
In fact , some people even have a name for that giddy , infatuated stage of a new relationship ; they call it “ New Relationship Energy , ” or “ NRE . ”
That ’s when everyone involved is particularly prone to jealousy .
There are n’t any cure - alls to ensure that your partners never feel jealous , of course , but it helps to make a point to pay attention to everyone , to include everyone in the majority of your activities — you know , to be considerate .
If you were raised with the idea that if your partner is looking at someone else , it ’s because you are n’t enough , then you probably wo n’t be happy in a polyamorous relationship until and unless you can unlearn that idea and understand why it is n’t true .
People do have the capacity to love more than one other person ; there is n’t a magical switch inside our brains that says once you love one person , the switch has been flipped and you ca n’t love somebody else .
Any parent who has more than one child knows that it is possible to love more than one person .
But that does n’t mean that those people are expendable or interchangeable .
People with more than one child also know that their love for each child is unique and irreplaceable .
Similarly , people in a healthy polyamorous relationship know that their love for each person in that relationship is unique and irreplaceable — and knowing that drives away jealousy .
Riiiight .
Just like that , huh ?
But why would my lover want to shag someone else if I was adequate , hmm , smart boy ?
It ’s not about adequacy .
Many people are brought up to believe that if you ’re interested in sleeping with someone else , it ’s because your partner is n’t enough for you .
It ’s a myth that ’s as common and enduring — and as false — as the idea of Santa Claus .
Human beings do n’t work that way .
When we fall in love , the part of our brain that makes us attracted to other people does not magically shut off .
Someone once asked me , “ How can you stand knowing your lover is with someone else ?
Do n’t you feel like maybe they ’re better in bed than you are ? ”
The long answer to that question is very complex .
The short answer is simple :
It does n’t matter .
It ’s not a contest .
There are a lot of people in this world .
If you look far enough , you will find someone who is better than you are at everything .
You ’ll find people who are better at cooking , better at sex , better at reading and writing and driving and every other thing you can think of .
You ca n’t be the best person in the world at everything .
Deal with it .
You know what ?
It does n’t matter .
If you really believe that your lover is going to dump you as soon as they find someone better in the sack than you are , well , perhaps you should n’t try non-monogamy — but then again , perhaps you ’ll want to rethink your romantic relationship while you ’re at it .
It does n’t matter for the same reason that it does n’t matter if your lover finds a person who is a better cook than you are .
If your lover goes out to a restaurant , do you think , “ My God , what if the restaurant food is better than mine ? ”
Do you agonize over whether your cooking may seem substandard by comparison ?
Not if you ’re psychologically healthy , you do n’t .
With sex , it ’s the same deal .
Sex is a learned skill .
Who knows … perhaps if your lover discovers something that you did n’t think of , then they might bring that new discovery into your relationship , and hey !
You ’re better in bed for it !
But it ’s not a contest .
It ’s not like you have to spend your life trying to rank your skills in the bedroom against everyone else ’s .
That way madness lies .
It is n’t really about sex at all — it ’s about opening yourself to the possibility of more than one romantic relationship .
And maybe it ’s YOUR new lover who will teach you a thing or two !
So , why ?
What do you get out of this ?
Besides shagging a bunch of people , I mean .
For starters , being polyamorous does n’t mean you ’re shagging a bunch of people .
It may mean that you only have one other partner .
But that ’s beside the point .
The answer to this question actually addresses who we are as human beings .
Why do people get involved in interpersonal relationships at all ?
Why become romantically attached to anyone ?
The answer , of course , will vary from person to person , but at the end of the day we ’re all social animals .
People are happier when they ’re romantically involved with someone than when they ’re not .
Intimacy adds to the quality of your life .
Fine .
But why is n’t one person enough ?
What would you say if you had a child , and you decided you wanted a second child , and your first child said , “ But why am I not enough ? ”
The question itself does n’t really make sense , once you understand that it is n’t about what ’s “ enough . ”
Let ’s start with the fact that the majority of people are not intimate with one person .
They ’re intimate with one person at a time … at least in theory .
And with statistics from the General Social Survey suggesting that as many as 34 percent of men between the ages of 50 to 64 will admit to having cheated at least once , evidence suggests that even the theory is n’t too widely practiced .
But that ’s different .
That ’s cheating .
Precisely .
If you want more than one lover — which most people do , in spite of the romantic myth you ’ve probably been brought up to believe — then integrity and decency demands that you be honest and up - front about it .
I ’ve been approached and propositioned by women who have asked me , point - blank , “ So , would you ever cheat ? ”
When I say , “ I am open to having other lovers , but I would never cheat — we can become lovers as long as my partner approves , ” they usually freak out .
“ Oh , that ’s just too weird ! ”
So apparently there are a lot of people who are perfectly fine with lying and deception , who wo n’t hesitate to betray their spouse and think nothing of it — but who ca n’t accept the idea of integrity and honesty .
Those people are n’t my lovers .
Anyone who can betray their spouse can betray me as well , and I do n’t want people like that in my life .
So you ’re saying that everyone is either poly or cheating ?
No .
Some people seem wired for monogamy .
They can stay in a monogamous relationship , and be happy , and never even look at another person .
That ’s cool .
But not everybody is like that ; in fact , evidence suggests that most people are not .
Even that is n’t what matters , though .
In the end , it ’s not about what is “ enough . ”
Some poly people could be monogamous , if they really wanted to ; in fact , people who can sustain successful polyamorous relationships tend to be better at obeying the rules of a relationship , and not cheating , than average people .
But poly people do n’t want monogamous relationships .
What ’s wrong with monogamy ?
Nothing .
So why do n’t you want it ?
For those whose relationship inclinations lean toward polyamory , a poly relationship offers more .
When you have more than two people involved in your relationship , it offers you resources and perspectives that you do n’t have in a monogamous relationship .
If one person is feeling down , or has a problem , that person has two , or more , people to turn to for support .
With more eyes on a relationship problem or a problem at work or whatever , sometimes the solution is easier to find .
And it ’s great for your sex life .
I ’m creative in bed .
On my better days , I like to think I ’m very creative in bed .
But the fact is , no human being has seen or done it all ; in fact , no human being can even begin to scratch the surface of Cool Things To Do In Bed .
We have six billion people on the planet right now , and 30,000 years of recorded human history behind us .
Someone , somewhere , has thought of something that you would absolutely love , but you ’ll never think of yourself .
I ’ve learned a lot of things from each of my lovers , both in and out of the bedroom , that I have been able to take with me into my other relationships .
Not even just new techniques , but sometimes new ways of looking at things .
These things have enriched all my relationships , and my life .
It may not even be what you ’re thinking .
Not all poly people are into group sex .
There are polyamorous individuals who ’ve never had a threesome .
Being poly does n’t necessarily make you kinky .
Nor does it mean that you ’re into orgies , or that you ’re promiscuous , or that you want to boink everyone you meet .
For polyfidelitous people , being poly really is n’t that much different from being monogamous .
Polyamory also does n’t make you bisexual ; in a polyamorous relationship , all the people involved are not necessarily sleeping with everyone else involved .
( The idea of being a guy in the middle of hot girl - on - girl action is a cliche as old as time , but do n’t think polyamory is automatically going to get you there . )
Okay , so what ’s the downside ?
The downside is that you have more than two people involved in your relationship .
That is both a blessing and a source of stress .
Romantic relationships come with a certain amount of tension built in ; I ’ve never known anybody , anywhere , who ’s never had even a single argument with their lover .
Add another person to the mix , and your potential for disagreements and arguments and tension goes up .
A lot .
Add two more people to the mix , it goes up even further .
The more people you have involved in a romantic relationship , the greater the potential for problems .
It ’s not necessarily all bad .
Sometimes , having people who you can turn to when you have problems is a big blessing .
On the whole , however , managing more than one romantic relationship is , not to put too fine a point on it , harder than managing only one .
It is incumbent on any people in a polyamorous relationship to take care that they follow the rules , and make sure everyone ’s needs are met .
Without that , the relationship will fail — just as a monogamous relationship will .
The other downside is that being poly is emotionally riskier .
The more people you open your heart to , the more likely it is that you ’ll have your heart broken .
The people down the street from me tried an “ open relationship , ” and it all fell apart .
This kind of thing never lasts .
The people down the street from me tried a monogamous relationship , but they just ended up getting a divorce .
Does that prove that monogamy never lasts ?
Some relationships work out ; some do n’t .
Nature of the beast .
Some polyamorous relationships work ; some do n’t .
Some monogamous relationships work ; some do n’t .
Yet because monogamy is the accepted social norm , when a marriage fails , people do not blame the institution of marriage … but when a poly relationship fails , people blame polyamory .
A relationship succeeds or fails because of the people involved .
One could argue that most relationships in general do n’t last ; how many people actually spend their entire lives with the very first person they were ever romantically involved with ?
A few , but not many .
There are many reason why a relationship might not last , and most of those reasons have nothing to do with the relationship model .
It ’s tempting to look at a non-traditional relationship and assume that every problem the people in that relationship have is due to the form of the relationship , but it does n’t actually work that way .
And not all relationships that do n’t last are “ failures . ”
It ’s common to believe they are , but it is n’t necessarily so ; any relationship that teaches you more about yourself or those around you is in some measure a success .
What about disease ?
If you have several lovers , do n’t you worry about STDs ?
One of the great advantages of practicing open , honest non-monogamy with partners you are not lying to is that it makes communication about STD boundaries and STD status so much easier .
The folks I know in the poly community tend to be very conscientious about issues like STD risk — more so , in fact , than most of the monogamous folks I know .
Many monogamous people do not talk to their lovers about their sexual history , often for fear of causing jealousy ; and likewise , many monogamous people do n’t insist on things like STD testing before they have sexual contact .
Now , I ’m certainly not saying this is true of all people in traditional monogamous relationships .
Do n’t get me wrong , there are many folks engaged in monogamous relationships who are very careful and conscientious about sexual health !
Nor am I saying that all poly folks are automatically safe .
But in my experience , this is not the norm .
I do not often see the same level of awareness and care about sexual health among those in traditional relationships as I do among people in polyamorous relationships .
This is particularly true among folks who practice serial monogamy , and even more true still among folks who are nominally “ monogamous ” but who cheat .
A person who is having an affair may expose his or her partner non-consensually to STD risks that the partner is n’t even aware of , and that kind of behavior is almost universally condemned in the poly community .
Wait !
Mixing Latin and Greek roots ?
Is n’t that a linguistic atrocity ?
Not at all !
Telephone , homosexual , automobile , heterosexual , television …tons of words mix Latin and Greek roots .
And nominally “ pure ” Latin roots are often mixed themselves ; the Romans gleefully borrowed from other languages with abandon .
Let ’s assume I buy all this .
How do I make it work ?
It ’s easier to answer the question “ How can you make polyamory NOT work ? ”
Which is , in fact , a question I ’ve addressedhere .
And in a handy how - to guide in PDF formathere , revised and updated in October 2014 !
As with any relationship , making it succeed is more complicated than making it fail .
One of the surest ways to make it fail is to lie .
If you ca n’t be honest with your partner , and I mean about everything , then polyamory is n’t for you .
If you ca n’t abide by the rules of a monogamous relationship , then poly is n’t for you .
If you cheat , then poly is n’t for you .
Another good way not to make a poly relationship work is to browbeat your partner , or coerce your partner into accepting it .
Poly relationships do n’t work if one of the people involved only grudgingly accepts it ; it has to be for the benefit of everyone .
I ’m with you so far .
No lying , no bullying ; check .
Now what ?
Depends on you , and on the person you ’re involved with .
When in doubt , if you ’re considering trying a polyamorous relationship , it ’s best to go slowly .
Make sure you and your partner feel secure in what you ’re doing .
Make sure you do n’t get so carried away that you forget about your partner ’s needs .
This is a very easy mistake to make , even if you ’re watching out for it !
Also , if you are already in a relationship , it is vitally important to make sure that relationship is solid and stable before you go experimenting with non-monogamy .
A relationship that is not healthy to begin with will further erode if you try to change the foundation on which it is built .
So : No lying , no bullying .
Remember to consider the feelings of your partners — ALL of them .
Do n’t forget that everyone has to be happy , or you can bet that nobody will be !
Pay attention to your lovers .
Do n’t get distracted .
Get over the idea that polyamory gives you license to be promiscuous .
It does n’t .
Being poly does not mean you sleep with anyone you want .
It does n’t mean that your life is an endless vista of wild orgies .
Put aside those ideas before you even start ; that is not what it ’s about .
A poly relationship works only if everyone involved is happy .
While you ca n’t expect someone to be everything for you , all the time ( even in a monogamous relationship ) , there is absolutely no dishonor in telling your lover point - blank , “ Look , I do n’t think you ’re spending enough time with me .
You need to pay more attention to me . ”
And , of course , some common - sense rules are always good .
If you have more than one lover , then for God ’s sake , play safe .
You already know the whole safe - sex spiel .
Well , do it .
But how do I know if I ’m even poly at all ?
How can I tell if this will work for me ?
That ’s something you have to find out yourself .
If you can imagine sharing your lover , and be happy with that , then that at least suggests that you can be happy in a poly relationship .
No guarantee , of course , but at least it ’s possible .
Generally speaking , polyamory is not something I recommend people just dive into .
You need to be secure in your relationship before you think about opening it up to other people !
I ’ve always been poly , my whole life ; I even took two dates to my senior prom back in high school .
I have had an 18 - year relationship with a partner who had a very conservative Catholic background .
The subject of polyamory did n’t even come up for the first two years of our relationship , because I thought it was more important to establish a good foundation with her first .
Even when it did come up , it was over a year before anything happened — and it was her , not me , who took an outside lover first .
This was important , because it let her see firsthand that she could have another lover and it would not hurt our relationship .
One thing that does help enormously , if you are in a relationship and you ’re considering polyamory , is to get your ducks in a row before you start .
Do n’t go into polyamory thinking that it can fix whatever is wrong with your existing relationship ; the “ relationship broken , add more people ” approach does n’t work very well , but it does put someone else in the middle of whatever problems you may have , and that ’s not cool .
Building healthy polyamorous relationships starts with making sure your existing relationship is healthy .
How do you get started in a polyamorous relationship ?
If you ’re approaching polyamory for the first time , remember that you have to be willing to work at it .
You must listen to your partner , without pressuring that person .
You must be willing to concentrate on what ’s important , and on making sure your foundation with that person is stable and secure .
Of course , some people find themselves in a poly relationship without really considering it first .
It ’s easy if that happens to feel overwhelmed , insecure , jealous , angry …
Take a step back .
Look at the situation rationally , with a cool head .
What ’s happening ?
Is your partner rejecting you ?
Is your partner losing interest in you ?
If the answer is “ no , ” then you should think very carefully before you allow yourself to become angry or jealous .
What ’s really going on ?
How much of an investment in your relationship are you prepared to make ?
What assumptions are you making about the way your relationship “ should ” be , and are those assumptions valid ?
Yeah , I know , it ’s tough .
Assuming you are willing to give it a go , though , here are some things I ’d recommend :
Make sure , and I mean sure , everyone on the same page .
What are you all looking for ?
Under what circumstances is it OK for you or your partners to take another lover ?
Do you have a say in your partner ’s partners ?
If so , what kind of say ?
Be compassionate — both to your partners AND to your partner ’s partners .
This is especially important if you ’re already in a relationship .
Often , a couple looking to explore polyamory will be so concerned about preserving that core couple that they will forget the other people involved are human beings , too .
An ethical framework should treat everyone involved with respect and compassion .
If you can , I highly recommend finding a local poly group .
When I first started non-monogamous relationships , nearly 25 years ago , I did n’t have the benefit of such a group , and I rather wish I had .
It ’s really , really helpful to have access to the collective wisdom and experience of people who have made all the mistakes already .
Do n’t rush .
Take your time .
There ’s no reason to rush in to the first poly relationship that comes your way .
Develop good communication and conflict - resolution skills .
As sure as night follows day , there will be a time when you need them .
( Of course , this is true of a traditional , monogamous relationship as well … )
So where would I even find poly people , anyway ?
Where do you find anyone ?
The world is full of people .
It ’s hard to walk out your door without running into them .
That is n’t intended to be flippant .
My point is , you ca n’t just go to a certain place and expect to meet people who are poly , or look for a certain sign to tell you when people are poly .
It ’s like anything else .
Where do you meet people in general ?
I ’ve met poly people at conventions , at work , at clubs — you know , the same places you meet anyone else .
And just because someone does n’t advertise that he or she is poly does n’t necessarily mean that person is closed to the idea .
Many people are open to new ways of looking at relationships ; it ’s quite often that people will surprise you .
One helpful technique when you ’re looking for a partner is not to try to make a grocery list —
“ I want a red - haired , bisexual woman who listens to Elvis and reads Kurt Vonnegut ” — and leave yourself open to the possibilities around you .
So the rest is kind of up to you .
I ca n’t give you a magical Guide to Making It Work , and I ca n’t tell you where to go to find people who are polyamorous .
But I can tell you that , difficulties aside , it can be an incredibly rewarding and fulfilling way to extend and expand your romantic life .

It 's been over two years since Hogwarts fans got their theatrical fix from the 2007 Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix film .
But in just two days , the fervor will reach an all - time high with the release of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince .
It 's been an on - and - off top trending topic on Twitter for weeks , but that 's not enough for Potter 's most hardcore fans .
Thus ,
The Harry Potter Alliance website has launched a new campaign in honor of the Hogwarts headmaster : What Would Dumbledore Do? ( WWDD ) , a set of challenges to honor the teachings of Dumbledore and dominate the social media realm by taking over Twitter with the hashtag #dumbledore .
The fan site is divided into three main parts - the WWDD doctrine , the Dumbledore Twitter challenge , and the Dumbledore Movie Theater Challenge .
The Doctrine is essentially applying the lessons of Harry Potter towards real - life issues , such as " No One Need Live In the Closet " and " Family is not constricted to blood ties . "
The Theater Challenge asks you to go to the Half - Blood Prince with a name tag that has one thing Dumbledore taught you .
Perhaps those two WWDD projects are a little too nerdy for you .
Well , how about adding the #dumbledore hashtag to all of your tweets ?
That 's what the Dumbledore Twitter Challenge proposes .
From the website :
Beyond that , every time you tweet ANY THING , include # Dumbledore – and when you do it , no matter what you ’re tweeting about , try and remember that the value of love that Dumbledore taught is what we need in our lives and this world right now .
And try to mention the words “ Harry Potter ” in there too ( it will help increase our chances of taking over Twitter for one day ! ) .
While I love Potter , I 'm probably not going to be thinking about what Dumbledore has taught me as much as I 'm going to think about how awesome it will be to see my favorite Potter book recreated in the theater .
However , we 're pretty certain that Harry Potter will dominate Twitter this week , and that you will see # Dumbledore live on through social media .
There are four types of instrument commonly used .
They are the soprano , the concert , the tenor and the baritone ukulele .
I would recommend you begin with a soprano , as it is the most common and seems to have the most available associated literature .
It is May Day .
There are lots of songs pertinent to this .
One is The Padstow May Song , Unite and Unite .
The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain recorded a version of it .
Find out more about the history of the song and listen to the UOGB version .
We are delighted to announce the release of our newest album .
The follow up album to ' The Only Album by the Ukulele Orchestra That You ’ll Ever Need Volume 3 ' , ' Volume 9 ' brings you even more newly recorded but classic tracks by the orchestra recorded in the studio .
In 2020 , unable to meet each other owing to the Covid - 19 , Coronavirus restrictions , the performers of the Ukulele Orchestra contributed individual clips to group videos .
These were posted online every Sunday .
Fans demanded that they be made available on DVD .
Here they are .
The Ukes
The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain is a group of all - singing , all - strumming Ukulele players , using instruments bought with loose change , which believes that all genres of music are available for reinterpretation , as long as they are played on the Ukulele .
A concert by the Ukulele Orchestra is a funny , virtuosic , twanging , awesome , foot - stomping obituary of rock - n- roll and melodious light entertainment featuring only the “ bonsai guitar ” and a menagerie of voices in a collision of post - punk performance and toe - tapping oldies .
There are no drums , pianos , backing tracks or banjos , no pitch shifters or electronic trickery .
Only an astonishing revelation of the rich palette of orchestration afforded by ukuleles and singing ( and a bit of whistling ) .
Audiences have a good time with the Ukulele Orchestra .
Going from Tchaikovsky to Nirvana via Otis Redding and Spaghetti Western soundtracks , the Orchestra takes us on “ a world tour with only hand luggage ” and gives the listener “ One Plucking Thing After Another ” .
Using instruments small and large , in high and low registers , whether playing intricate melodies , simple tunes , or complex chords , and sitting in chamber group format dressed in formal evening wear , the Orchestra uses the limitations of the instrument to create a musical freedom as it reveals unsuspected musical insights .
Both the beauty and vacuity of popular and highbrow music are highlighted , the pompous and the trivial , the moving and the amusing .
Sometimes a foolish song can touch an audience more than high art ; sometimes music which takes itself too seriously is revealed to be hilarious .

English accents
and their implications for spelling reform
J.C. Wells , University College London
This is an edited version of a talk given to the Simplified Spelling Society on 25 January 1986 .
— John Wells , 2003 .
1. SOME BASIC PROBLEMS
1.1 The alphabet
An ideal spelling system , we all know , will have one symbol for one sound , one grapheme for one phoneme .
But this principle throws up certain difficulties in practice .
If we confine ourselves to consideration of the Latin alphabet , one major difficulty is that it is an arbitrary list of 26 letters which do not necessarily correspond to the sound systems of the languages which have to use it .
In particular , they do not correspond to the sound system of English .
On the one hand , the Latin alphabet provides us with no unambiguous way of spelling English sounds that Latin lacked ( e.g. the sound we often spell sh , the two sounds we spell th , and many of our vowels and diphthongs ) ; on the other , it contains at least two letters , q and x , that were unnecessary even from the point of view of Latin .
In this article , however , I am concerned not so much with the deficiencies of the alphabet and how we might remedy them ( the ‘ grapheme ’ part ) as with the problems arising from the fact that we English speakers do not all pronounce our language in the same way ( the ‘ phoneme ’ part ) .
As my eminent predecessor Daniel Jones pointed out in his article about phonetics and spelling reform ( 1944 ) ,
people in different parts of the country speak differently [... ;] what is a phonetic representation of a word for one person is not necessarily phonetic for another .
In raising these problems I do not want to detract from the fact that there are large numbers of words in our language where they do not arise .
All speakers of English , no matter where they come from , pronounce friend so that it rhymes with bend , send , tend .
So a reformed spelling frend ought to be uncontroversial .
Everyone pronounces sight , site and cite identically , so it is absurd ( except for advocates of etymological spelling ) that we have to learn to spell them all differently .
Everyone distinguishes the verb to advise from the noun the advice , so we can see the justification for distinguishing them in spelling — yet we all make the same pronunciation difference between to use , to house , to excuse and the nouns the use , the house , the excuse where we make no spelling distinction .
1.2 Danger of parochialism
The sounds of any language can be viewed as a system of contrasting phonemes .
The pronunciation of any word can be specified in terms of the string of phonemes that represent it , together perhaps with information about relevant prosodic features ( in the case of English , about stress placement ) .
In designing a scheme of spelling reform , we face a certain danger of insularity or parochialism , of assuming that everybody has the same set of phonemes , and uses the same phonemes in particular words as we do ourselves .
Unfortunately this is not the case .
What seems obvious and normal to one speaker may be exotic , unusual , subtle and strange to another .
There are all sorts of little facts about how English is pronounced round the world by native speakers which may give us pause in our reforming zeal .
Here is a simple example .
The traditional spelling of the words any and many conflicts with the way most of us say them .
It may seem obvious to most of us that they rhyme with penny and so ought to be spelt in the same way , perhaps as enny and menny .
In making such an assumption , however , we are ignoring the awkward fact that many southern Irish people pronounce them to rhyme with nanny , so that they would see nothing strange about writing them with the letter a .
Maybe they would want to write anny and manny rather than any and many , but that is not my point .
I concede that in English as a whole the preferences of the southern Irish may have to give way before those of the vast majority of other English speakers — but we should be aware of what our proposals imply .
2. CONSONANT VARIATIONS
2.1 Spelling the past tense
Ought mist and missed to be spelt identically because they are pronounced identically ?
Or should we give the past tense a consistent spelling shape with d , even when , as in missed , it is pronounced /t/?
In deciding this issue , we should perhaps consider the Nigerians , who do not usually pronounce missed like mist .
This is because — under the influence of traditional orthography — they typically use a /d/ sound in missed , and in fact usually assimilate the /s/ sound to a /z / , so saying / mizd / , with voicing throughout .
For them kicked , likewise , tends to rhyme with rigged rather than with strict .
I am not necessarily saying that we have to let our reform proposals be determined by how Nigerians pronounce English , even though they do constitute a substantial body of users of English .
But I am saying that we should at least be aware that a reform that makes spelling more logical for one group of speakers may make it less logical for another .
2.2 Spell or omit r?
From New Spelling onwards the importance of catering for accents other than Received Pronunciation has been clear from the treatment of historical r ( Ripman and Archer , 1948 ) .
Like most English people , in my speech I do n't distinguish stork and stalk .
If spelling reform proposals do make a distinction , as they usually do , then the reason is ( a ) historical and ( b ) because they are pronounced differently from one another in other accents .
Historically , stork had /r/ , and stalk did not .
In many varieties of English ( Scottish , Irish , west of England , most American , Canadian — the rhotic accents ) the distinction in is still made in speech .
Similarly pairs such as larva - lava , rotor - rota , homophonous for English people like me , are distinct in the rhotic accents .
This justifies our keeping the distinction in spelling , even though the task oflearning which words to write with r and which without will impose some burden on those of us whose English is non-rhotic .
And those of us who pronounce intrusive /r/ , saying perhaps rotar of duties , will have to remember not to write r in some positions where we pronounce it , as well as sometimes writing it where we do not pronounce it .
Faced with this problem , spelling reform has little alternative to accommodating the rhotic speakers , even if the consequence is that we non-rhotic speakers must learn by rote when to write r and when not .
2.3 Singer and finger
A similar problem arises with ng .
Consider the pair singer : finger .
For most speakers these words do not rhyme exactly , because finger has a / g/ sound after the nasal .
It seems logical to write singer but fingger ( Ripman 1941 ) .
The trouble here is that people in the trapezium linking Birmingham - Manchester - Liverpool make these words rhyme , with / g/ in both .
So if we show a difference in spelling , some Midlanders and Northerners will have to learn an extra arbitrary distinction .
Alternatively , I suggest , it is a distinction we might well decide to ignore — so incidentally also simplifying the spelling of the comparative and superlative of long , strong , young , whose irregular pronunciation in most accents would otherwise be reflect in reformed spelling as longger , longgest etc .
3. VOWEL VARIATIONS
3.1 Greater problems with vowels
Such variations in pronunciation mean we may have to violate the principle of one sound per letter and one letter per sound in quite obvious ways , ways that probably everyone can accept .
Greater difficulties perhaps arise with vowel - sounds and sets of vowel - contrasts , where I think the danger is particularly strong of wrongly assuming that everybody makes the same contrasts .
In what follows I make use of the concept of standard lexical sets , as proposed in Wells 1982 : 2.2 .
Each keyword , shown in capitals , stands for perhaps hundreds or thousands of words containing the vowel sound in question .
The keywords are chosen so as to maximize clarity : whatever accent of English we use , they can hardly be mistaken for any other word .
3.2 The Sam - psalm contrast
New Spelling makes special provision for the words I shall refer to as the lexical set BATH — words such as pass , path , chance — by allowing either a or aa .
There is an assumption behind this permissive solution , namely that everyone distinguishes the vowel sound in gather from that in father .
However , this is not the case .
In parts of the west of England and certainly in Scotland and Northern Ireland some people have no such contrast in their phoneme system .
They use the same vowel in Sam as in psalm , so that these two words are homophones for them .
It would actually have been consistent with this fact for New Spelling to ignore the difference between these two vowel sounds .
It has very low functional load , which is to say that there are very few word - pairs that are distinguished as Sam and psalm are .
So we might prefer , in a reformed spelling scheme , to ignore the contrast that RP makes between the vowel sounds of mass and pass , and abandon the New Spelling aa entirely .
On the other hand RP speakers and others who make pass rhyme with farce must still remember the spelling difference reflecting the historical r in farce ( fars ) but not in pass ( pas ) .
By taking accent variability into account one lays oneself open to the objection that one has abandoned the principle of one letter per sound .
The southern English will protest that mass and pass differ in sound , while pass and farce do not — yet we would be proposing the same spelling for the first pair and different spellings for the second .
I do not think we can avoid this difficulty .
3.3 CLOTH , LOT , THOUGHT
Less well known is the very similar situation affecting the lexical set CLOTH , namely words such as cross , cough , lost , where even within RP in this century we had a rival pronunciation which might be respelt as clawth , crawss , cawf , lawst .
This situation has now resolved : the clawth variant is now very much aminority form , if it indeed still exists .
But the problem here is that American pronunciation really corresponds to crawss , cawf , clawth , lawst rather than to cross , cof , cloth , lost ( to the extent that Americans distinguish the two vowel sounds at all , which many do not ) .
If we follow New Spelling and keep lot as lot while changing thought to thawt , my point is that most people in England would logically not change the spelling of cloth and other words like it .
But Americans generally speaking identify the CLOTH set with the THOUGHT set , not the LOT set , and might therefore logically want to write clawth , etc .
This would also apply to words such as long ( lawng ) , since for them it too belongs with THOUGHT , not with LOT .
3.4 Ignore such contrasts ?
If pressed , I would propose the same radical solution here as with TRAP , BATH and PALM , namely to ignore the whole set of contrasts and write LOT and THOUGHT identically , probably as o .
This would also suit Scottish and Northern Irish pronunciation , many Scots having the same vowel for LOT and THOUGHT , as do also most Canadians and many Americans .
We would then have to forget the distinction we English ( and Australians , New Zealanders and South Africans ) make between cot and caught , don and dawn .
In fact those of us who make a sharp difference between these two vowels are perhaps a minority ; if we were to insist on distinguishing them in reformed spelling we would be imposing a real burden on the many people who make no such distinction and who would have to learn what for them would be an arbitrary difference in spelling .
3.5 Misconceptions about r
In this area RP speakers , and many others , would again face the same problem of r , as in stalk ( stok ) but stork ( stork ) .
In reformed spelling we should have to write kot for cot , caught , but kort for court .
Inevitably , some people would have to accept that they should write certain words identically that they pronounce differently , and other words differently that they pronounce the same .
This could lead to difficulties .
Wherever the spelling depends on what happens in other people ’s accents rather than in one ’s own , one is liable to be misled because of mistaken ideas of what happens in other accents .
We can see this in the difficulty we English people have if we try to imitate American or Scottish accents — even talented English actors or impressionists attempting American or Scottish speech quite often make mistakes .
Peter Sellers , in his spoof travelogue Balham , Gateway to the South , talking lyrically in his pseudo - American accent about morning coming , says “ and now at last we see the [ dorn ] approach ” .
But Americans do n't say an r-sound in dawn .
Its reformed spelling will have to be don , not dorn .
Clearly even for highly literate people sound in a sense dominates spelling in their mental picture of words ; so when imitating another accent they set up correspondences between sounds in their own accent and what they imagine are the equivalents in the other accent , rather than be guided to the spelling .
( After all , the presence / absence of r in traditional spelling is a pretty reliable indicator of whether rhotic speakers pronounce /r/ in a particular word . )
English actors playing Scottish parts likewise make many errors with /r/ , pronouncing words such as comma and China with final /r/ .
This is because in many words English final schwa does correspond to Scottish final /r/ , as in father ; but in many other words there is no such correspondence .
4 . Further problems with a and o
4.1 Bother and father
A difficulty with the simplification that I have just been advocating is that while I propose the reformed spelling a for PALM and o for LOT , most Americans pronounce these two lexical sets with the same vowel - sound .
Thus in a typical American pronunciation father and bother rhyme perfectly .
Americans make puns that do n't work for the British : a Saab car sounds like sob for them , and they put up posters for the painter Salvador Dali saying “ Hello Dali ” , punning on Hello Dolly , with which it is for them homophonous .
This means that the Americans , the most numerous and influential part of the English - speaking community , will be confronted with the uncertainty of how to spell words in which they use this vowel sound .
They are going to have to write it o as in lot in most words , but presumably — unless we allow both possibilities in reformed spelling — as a in a minority of cases such as father and palm .
Words like pasta will also come under this heading : Americans will have to remember to write pasta rather than the posta that might seem to them more logical .
Hey , we all have to make compromises .
4.2 NORTH and FORCE
Most of us nowadays use the same vowel sound in NORTH as in FORCE .
New Spelling , however , was inclined to allow for two distinct sounds here .
Ripman 1941 marks FORCE words , but not NORTH words , with an asterisk :
A considerable number of words written here with or are pronounced by many speakers with oer , and may be written so if desired .
( p. 6 )
This distinction is a historical one which is now mostly lost in England , North America and the southern hemisphere , though still made in Scotland and Ireland and to some extent in Wales , the West Indies , and the United States .
Speakers who have it make a difference , for example , between horse and hoarse , and do not rhyme short and sport , fork and pork .
Common sense may tell us to ignore the distinction , since only a minority now make it .
But this does mean that the Scots , etc. , would risk misspelling FORCE words , in which they use their GOAT vowel , not their THOUGHT vowel .
4.3 NORTH -FORCE and CURE
Not only have NORTH and FORCE sets merged for the English : the CURE words ( e.g. sure , poor , tour have joined them too for many speakers .
Many English people now pronounce Shaw , shore , sure as homophones , and likewise paw , pore - pour , poor .
I would suggest all the forms with r could be spelt in the same way , and that we ignore the Scottish or Irish distinction between war , shore , sure , writing them all perhaps with or .
5. SPELL TO SHOW ALL CONTRASTS ?
5.1 Maximalism and minimalist
Logically there are two extreme positions one can adopt towards phonemic contrasts .
The maximalist position would say our orthography must reflect all the contrasts that anyone makes , and the minimalist position would say we should reflect only those that everyone makes .
5.2 Problems of maximal contrast
The maximalist position would lead to very undesirable consequences , as the following examples show .
Many southern English make a longer vowel in bad than in lad and may even have minimal pairs between the name Sally and the verb to sally , or between shandy the long drink and brandy the short drink ; obviously spelling should ignore this distinction .
Likewise some Scots distinguish tide : tied .
The point here is not the quality of the vowels as such , but whether contrasts are made between vowels in different sets of words .
In fact for these Scots the difference between the diphthong in tie#d and that in tide reflects the presence of a grammatical boundary before the suffix in the first but not the second .
They make a similar distinction between the diphthong in Fife and that in five , but here it depends on the identity of the following consonant .
So this distinction is on the whole predictable , and can accordingly be ignored .
In Northern Ireland and a few other places they distinguish days and daze ; we are obviously going to have to ignore that , too , as we must the contrast between late and eight or mane and main made in various parts of Britain , for historical reasons reflected in traditional orthography .
5.3 Who needs the distinctions ?
Then there is a contrast within the lexical set NURSE , where English and Americans make no distinction ; but the Scots and Irish may distinguish pearl and curl , for example , contrasting them in the same way as perry and curry ; and they may well make a similar distinction between Hertz and hurts , or fir and fur .
That is a kind of justification for present spellings , which accurately reflect this distinction ( though sometimes writing the first vowel ear , as in pearl , sometimes er , as in defer ) .
But if , like New Spelling , we abolish that distinction , then we are ignoring that contrast , which is a real one for millions of Scots and Irish .
English or Americans will typically say these distinctions are subtleties they can't possibly cope with .
The only point I would make is that those who make the distinction are going to feel that logically it ought to be retained in a reformed spelling , and they are going to have to be convinced otherwise if we want to abolish it .
5.4 Contrasts matter , not sounds
In all of this we must remember that it does n't matter what the actual phonetic realization is ; what is important is the network of contrasts , because that is what the orthography must reflect .
If we take , say , the word soap where we all use our long - o vowel , it does n’t matter what precise quality of vowel or diphthong an individual speaker uses , provided he or she uses the same sound in rope , goat , coat and all other words in the same lexical set .
6 PROBLEMS OF MINIMAL CONTRAST
6.1 A Jamaican merger
The minimalist position , spelling only the contrasts everybody makes , has difficulties too .
One might think everybody contrasts pat and pot ( the lexical sets TRAP and LOT ) , but that is not so .
Jamaicans , for example , typically say / pat / for both .
Now people may object that there are not many Jamaicans , so they can be ignored ; but as a group they have very special problems with English spelling .
Whereas other English - speakers mainly follow their pronunciation in spelling the a - o contrast ( ignoring one or two exceptional words like wash ) , for Jamaicans it is hard to decide which spelling is right and what therefore is also the posh pronunciation .
Ordinary Jamaicans say /rat / both for the animal and for putrefaction , and have to learn which to spell rat and which rot .
A social factor is also involved : to speak educated Jamaican , they have to learn to distinguish rat and rot in pronunciation , too , as other English - speakers do .
But if we are aiming to lighten the burden of arbitrary spelling distinctions , no reform project I have ever seen solves this difficulty for an important group of West Indians .
6.2 A southern US merger
Then there is the START - NORTH distinction , exemplified in pairs such as farm and form .
It is not only the Jamaicans that tend to pronounce these identically ; many Americans speaking popular accents in the south do so too .
They have a test phrase about being born in a barn , and it is well known that some people confuse or reverse the two : country bumpkins in the southern states are ridiculed as being barn in a born , with the typical confusion of people trying to introduce a contrast into their speech that they do n’t natively have .
Again , I think on balance we must retain the spelling distinction in those sets of words .
But it will constitute a difficulty for some .
6.3 Another southern US merger
Many American Southerners , of all social classes , and including most Californians , do n’t distinguish the vowels in KIT and DRESS before nasals , and so make no difference between pin and pen ( hence the terms writing - pen and stick - pin , to make the distinction clear ) .
Listen to Jim Reeves singing Lord , give me strength , where the strength begins just like string .
It would be rather drastic , I think , to abolish this contrast and write pin and pen identically in a reformed orthography , but unless we did , it would cause many American Southerners a big spelling problem .
For them the logical reformed spelling of many might be minny rather than the menny that seems logical to the rest of us .
7. FEASIBLE MERGERS
7.1 FOOT and GOOSE
New Spelling was criticized for distinguishing the vowels of the lexical sets FOOT and GOOSE , and this distinction , I think , could indeed be dispensed with .
Consider the pair good and mood , which for most of us do not rhyme perfectly .
However in Scotland they do , and also in Ulster .
Forcing a contrast of spelling with good - muud , as New Spelling does , is therefore an arbitrary extra distinction from the point of view of the Scots and the people of Northern Ireland .
As there are very few word - pairs distinguished in this way ( only pull - pool , full - fool , look - Luke , and a few pairs involving inflected forms , such as wood - wooed , could - cooed ) , I think we would n’t suffer too seriously if we ignore the distinction .
7.2 Functional load of sh - zh
What is involved here is the important question of what is known technically as functional load , that is , the number of words that are distinguished by a given contrast .
When the functional load of a contrast is low , then the contrast can be ignored , whereas when the functional load is rather high , then presumably it ought to be reflected in the spelling .
Using this criterion , one might well decide not to distinguish the consonant sounds sh and zh , because there are very few word - pairs distinguished by this contrast .
There are indeed non-rhyming pairs like pressure - measure , mission - vision , there are no everyday words directly distinguished by this contrast .
( We can safely ignore such rarities as Aleutian - allusion , Confucian - confusion . )
Rather than impose the non-English - looking zh to furnish a consistent spelling for the voiced member of this pair of sounds , we might write sh for both .
This would have the welcome side - effect of remopving the uncertainty that would otherwise arise in words such as Asian , where some speakers use one sound and some the other .
7.3 STRUT , FOOT , GOOSE
There is another contrast with very low functional load which nobody has proposed abolishing as far as I know : that exemplified by my lexical sets STRUT and FOOT , respectively , which contains pairs like cut - put .
We really need to consider three sets here , though , STRUT , FOOT and GOOSE , because the Scots , as we have seen , do not contrast the latter two .
People from the north of England , however , do not contrast STRUT and FOOT , although they do distinguish these from GOOSE .
So we face a kind of chain , on which everybody contrasts the extreme points ( e.g. luck as against Luke ) , but not everybody contrasts both extremes and the middle ( luck - look , look - Luke .
The situation with the BATH words is parallel to this .
I suppose the logical solution is again to allow the intermediate group , in this case the FOOT words , to be written with either vowel .
So words like put , foot could be spelt either like strut , cut ( which would seem logical for people in northern England ) , or like boot , shoot , which would seem logical the Scots and northern Irish and would probably be acceptable in the south of England and everywhere else .
A factor to bear in mind here is that the lexical set FOOT is very small , containing only about 40 words ( Wells 1982 : 132 ) , although several are quite common ( good , should , foot , put ) .
So not very many words would be affected if we were to allow them to be spelt in two competing ways .
If diacritics were used in a reformed spelling , a solution might be to spell all the vowels in the STRUT - FOOT - GOOSE chain with u , but to minimize the visual differences by perhaps optional use of diacritics according to pronunciation .
7.4 Further contrasts ?
The Scots do have an extra possibility of contrast here that other accents lack , between for example brood and brewed , where they have a longer vowel in the second word to mark the stem - suffix boundary within it , brew#ed .
Distinctions like this may just have to be ignored .
Similarly , in Northern Ireland people tend to distinguish in pronunciation between a tenor and a tenner ( longer vowel because of the stem - suffix boundary ) .
Again , there are very few pairs of words involved .
Speakers who make such distinctions will have to be reconciled to the fact that most people do not .
8. SOCIAL FACTORS
8.1 Accents as social labels
A complication with the northern pronunciation which merges the vowels of cut and put is that it bears considerable sociolinguistic value .
As everyone knows ( in England ) , the vowel sounds you use in the STRUT set tend to flag your social class and to symbolize educated versus uneducated speech .
The same is true of many other pronunciation variables .
A reformed spelling that seems to buttress a low - prestige pronunciation will encounter resistance .
8.2 Hypercorrection
Aware of social prejudice , northerners not uncommonly attempt to use a southern - or RP - style vowel in STRUT words — but may do the same thing in FOOT words ( since they do not natively distinguish the STRUT and FOOT vowels ) .
Hence the phenomenon of northerners pronouncing sugar to rhyme with RP rugger , and pudding like RP budding .
Phrases like good luck are particularly problematic : northerners attempting to sound posh may easily change the first word as well as the second , or indeed sometimes the first word but not the second .
The word gas - mask gives rise to the same problem : if your basic pronunciation is with a short vowel in each word , and you later discover that it is considered better to use a long vowel in mask and grass , you might well lengthen the vowel in gas as well .
If people have these problems in hitting the intended target in pronunciation , they would obviously have similar problems in reformed spelling if it were to follow RP too slavishly .
8.3 Accent prejudice and spelling reform
Spelling reformers have to confront sociolinguistic facts of this kind .
Many ways of pronouncing are liable to be condemned as ugly and uneducated and not to be encouraged .
Though this may well depend on the unfavourable stereotyping of the social groups who pronounce in these ways , we have to recognize that such stigmatization exists .
If in a spelling reform we make provision for the such stigmatized pronunciations , we could be seen as bolstering vulgarity and ignorance .
The objective , scientific observer of course discounts these social views and refuses to make such value judgments , but a reforming movement does have to take such prejudices into account .
8.4 H- dropping
A case in point is h - dropping .
Millions of English people do not pronounce /h/ consistently : they omit it most or all of the time .
We can still understand them .
So it might seem logical to omit the letter h from our reformed spelling , and write pairs such as harm and arm identically , in line with that pronunciation .
But no !
that would go against the social attitude that it is incorrect to drop /h/ and that therefore the spelling ought to reflect its presence ; and it would shock all the Scots , Irish , and Americans who are strangers to h - dropping .
Obviously we should not continue to write h in the words honest and hour ; but it would certainly be wise to continue to write it in harm and house , to reflect the prestige pronunciation that does distinguish harm from arm — even if this is going to constitute a spelling problem for h - droppers .
8.5 Northernisms
So with some of the other phonetic variables we have considered .
These prejudices might well say that we must retain the difference between the STRUT and FOOT vowels in our reformed spelling , perhaps by writing u and oo respectively .
This is not the only vowel - sound contrast which some people do n't make , despite a widespread feeling that it would be better if they did so .
Another example is the vowel contrast between the lexical sets SQUARE and NURSE .
Liverpudlians , for example , typically have these vowel sounds merged , so that fair and fur are not distinguished , and the name Mary is pronounced to rhyme with furry .
Again , perhaps we ought to keep the distinction in a reformed orthography , despite the problems that Liverpudlians will then face in remembering the correct spelling .
That is to say , we ought to reflect the vowel - sound contrasts that everybody makes except northerners .
This is hard on the northerners , but maybe that ’s life as it is — unless we can somehow remove these prejudices about accents .
8.6
The -ing ending
Similar considerations apply to the ending - ing .
Almost everywhere where English is spoken there is a rivalry between a relatively high - status pronunciation with a velar nasal ( as in sing ) and a relatively low - status pronunciation with an alveolar nasal ( as in sin ) .
The low - status variant is reflected in our current orthographic conventions by writing n’ , thus runnin ’ rather than running .
Again , I think there would be general agreement that we have to keep the ing spelling , to reflect the prestige pronunciation .
Nevertheless there are words where it is a source of uncertainty for many people , who may produce hypercorrections like a brazing ( brazen ) hussy or indeed ( to take an authentic historical example ) a mountain lark for what was originally a poetical mounting lark .
9 OTHER PRONUNCIATION VARIABLES
9.1 Declining status of RP
I have the impression that reform proposals this century — those originating in Britain , at least — have been very firmly based upon RP , together with some nods in the direction of archaizing tendencies ( which is why historical r is reflected ) .
It is clear that in the last quarter of a century in England the position of RP has been very seriously eroded , in that RP no longer enjoys the unquestioned status that it previously did .
There are now many people who not only do n’t speak it — that was always the case — but who also do n’t aspire to it , and who would regard it as quite unrealistic to aspire towards it .
In fact I think what has changed is the perceived model of beautiful or ideal speech , which is for many people no longer RP .
This can be seen in all sorts of ways .
Teachers of English as a foreign language , for example , get increasingly dissatisfied with the transcriptions the phoneticians offer them as the models for foreigners to imitate .
This is what lies behind the change in the phonetic transcription of the final vowel in words like happy .
Until the 1980s it was identified with the vowel of bit .
But now [ 2003 ] the many people who use a final beat - like feel no longer feel it as lacking the prestige that formerly attached to using only a bit - like vowel .
Current pronouncing dictionaries ( EPD 1997 ; LPD 1990 , 2000 ) write it with a compromise symbol , to accommodate the many speakers whose vowel is more similar to that of beat .
9.2 Allophonic variation
I have yet to discuss various technical phonological questions like the phonemic principle .
It is clear that where we have allophonic differences , that is , realizational differences within a phoneme , we can ignore them .
This means that essentially where two sounds are used in such a way that we can predict from the surrounding sounds which will be used , then we can ignore any such difference .
This is why we can ignore the difference between an ordinary t- sound and a glottal stop : whichever way you say tha t is , no t only bu t also , the meaning is the same and your choice of pronunciation should not influence your choice of spelling .
Contrary to popular belief , there are certain positions in a word where a glottal stop is by now the norm , as in depar t ment or a t mosphere , and many other where it is very widely used , as in ne t work , foo t ball .
Another example is the really a rather sharp difference between the o-sound that many people use in most cases ( go , show ) and the o-sound they use before /l / ( goal , shoulder .
As long as we can set up a rule that our long o-sound has a special pronunciation before /l / , there is no problem : the two sounds are just allophonic variants of the same phoneme .
They may sound a bit different but the difference is predictable , and so it may be ignored in an orthography .
9.3 American intervocalic
t
American intervocalic t is an interesting case , because it is moving from being allophonic to involving a neutralization and therefore becoming phonemic .
As you know , in words such as city , waited , and in phrases such as right away , Americans tend to use a d - like sound .
Indeed , increasingly it is identical with their d-sound , so that atom and Adam are pronounced identically .
Or there may be a subtle distinction , perhaps more in the mind of the speaker than perceptible for the hearer .
In 1961 Webster 's Third International was the first American dictionary to transcribe these words with /d/.
For this it incurred considerable criticism : the /d/ pronunciation was said to be slovenly speech which should not be admitted to the dictionary .
Nevertheless , it is a fact ; and I have even encountered reverse spellings : I read an American novel in which somebody gave an ‘ involuntary shutter ’ , shutter and shudder for the author clearly not being distinct .
But we shall not want to admit this to a reformed spelling scheme .
Americans will have to learn by rote which words are written with t and which with d .
That would accord with their prejudices in many cases anyhow , so is not yet a problem ; but it may be so in a hundred years ’ time , particularly if this sound - change spreads , as seems likely , to all other accents of English .
Already it occurs in Australia , South Africa and England , being heard as a stylistic variant even in RP .
I do n't see a major problem , particularly since in most cases the pronunciation of related words ( wait , atomic ) will make it clear whether the spelling should be t or d .
10 . CONCLUSION
What I hope I have done is to highlight the dangers of parochialism in designing a reformed orthography for English , of being unaware of the varying patterns of contrast in different accents .
But even with this awareness , it is impossible to satisfy all of the speakers all of the time ; the best that can be hoped is that a proposed reform will satisfy most of the speakers most of the time .

Swedish indie -pop group Miike Snow ( no , that ’s not a typo ) just released the music video for their hit single “ Black and Blue . ”
Miike Snow ’s sound has been described by professional music critics as “ A - ha meets Animal Collective . ”
I personally like to think that their sound is more of an offshoot of Passion Pit’s .
The band ’s lead singer / songwriter Andrew Wyatt even sounds a bit like Passion Pit ’s Michael Angelakos .
The guys released their self - titled debut album back in May of 2009 , and on it was “ Black and Blue ” and “ Animal , ” a song that went on to catapult them to fame .
It ’s funny , because as I sit here writing this , Miike Snow is currently playing at T.T. the Bear ’s Place in Cambridge , MA , which is just a stone ’s throw away from me .
I wish I had bought tickets .
Anyway , the video for “ Black and Blue ” is one of the more captivating ones that I ’ve seen lately , and it ’s not incredibly weird .
It actually depicts an interesting story ; after the 3 minutes and 42 seconds are up , you feel for the main character .

Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz has revealed that Sun plans to launch an application store for Java software .
It will be modeled after Apple 's iPhone App Store and will allow users to download and install new software over the Internet .
The store will use Sun's Java runtime updater as a deployment mechanism , providing a distribution channel that Schwartz says will reach an audience of billions .
Aping Apple
The success of Apple 's App Store store has inspired other companies to imitate the concept and build their own application delivery systems .
Virtually all of the major mobile vendors have launched similar services .
Sun will be the latest company to jump on the bandwagon .
Its new service , codenamed Project Vector , will be fully unveiled at Sun's JavaOne event next month .
In a blog entry , Schwartz explained Sun 's strategy for cashing in on its large Java runtime install base .
Search engine companies have paid
Sun a considerable amount of money over the years for bundling search toolbars with the runtime .
According to Schwartz , Sun wanted to expand on that concept and eventually concluded that an application store was the most practical way to do so .
The model that Sun is considering at this stage is similar to that of other application stores .
Developers will be invited to submit applications and determine the price at which their software should be sold .
Sun will review the applications to determine that they are acceptable for distribution and will then make them available through the update system and take a cut of the application sale revenue .
( The company has not yet revealed how much it will take off the top . )
Sun will also let application developers bid for better positioning and broader exposure in the application storefront .
" Vector is a network service to connect companies of all sizes and types to the roughly one billion Java users all over the world , " wrote Schwartz .
" Vector ( which we 'll likely rename the Java Store ) , has the potential to deliver the world 's largest audience to developers and businesses leveraging Java and JavaFX . "
Is there a market ?
The Java runtime does have a broad install base , but it 's not clear if there 's a big market for desktop Java applications .
Java has maintained a position of strength in server environments and enjoys some popularity on mobile phone devices , but it has been almost completely displaced by Flash on the Web and is largely absent on the desktop .
Aside from Azureus and Eclipse , there are n't many popular desktop Java applications .
While contemplating the lack of high - visibility , consumer - oriented Java software , I recalled a blog entry from 2005 in which former Sun desktop CTO Hans Muller tenuously attempted to argue that Limewire was Java 's killer app on the desktop .
The fact that people struggle to identify a mainstream commercial Java application that is popular among consumers does n't bode well for Sun 's app store plan .
And Muller later abandoned Sun and went to work for Adobe on the Flex project , a move that is fairly indicative of the direction that the broader industry has gone for cross- platform desktop software development .
There are a few factors that could work in Sun 's favor .
The company 's JavaFX framework — which aims to bring richer client application development capabilities to Java — could make it a bit more competitive .
During my own tests , I 've found that JavaFX is conducive to rapid development and makes it easy to add nice aesthetic flourishes and greater interactivity to user interfaces .
The availability of a convenient distribution channel might also boost the attractiveness of Java as a development platform and give software creators a reason to use Java technology to build consumer - targeted applications .
Schwartz also hints that the system might be opened to non-Java software as well , which would obviously make it relevant to a broader developer community .
To make the app store a success , Sun will have to attract software that delivers real value for users and make it available in a convenient and non-invasive way .
Sun will also have to work hard to find more reasonable policies and practices for application review than the ones that Apple has in place today .
A properly designed Java app store might prove to be profitable ... but only if developers create Java applications that people actually want to use .
It has been 10 years since the St. Louis Rams rode a fast and furious offense that resembled pinball on cleats  the Greatest Show on Turf  to a Super Bowl title .
But that attack , which seemed to come out of nowhere along with quarterback Kurt Warner , was merely prologue to an explosion of innovation that is transforming the N.F.L.
Conjured by coaches who borrow from the wide - open college game , new - look offenses have developed into something previously imagined by video gamers in their living rooms .
Nearly every team now has a Wildcat package , the scheme that carried the Miami Dolphins to the playoffs last season by putting players in unexpected positions .
And the spread offense floods the field , with receivers stretched from sideline to sideline , to such effect that Warner and the Arizona Cardinals used it about 85 percent of the time on their stunning run to the Super Bowl last season .
On the horizon is the University of Florida ’s star quarterback , Tim Tebow , who will enter the draft next year .
He could open the door to what was once virtually unthinkable in the N.F.L. : a quarterback with the size and sturdiness of a linebacker who reads the defense and has the freedom to run as often as he passes in the college - style spread - option offense .
The recession has affected Americans in many ways , forcing people to cut back on their spending and in some cases , out of their homes .
According to a new study , it seems that more and more U.S. residents are heading online in search of solutions to their financial woes .
In the past , community leaders and social workers were relied upon by Americans looking for help during tough economic times .
However , today there 's an easier way to consult experts for assistance .
Americans Hope for Quicker Solutions Online
A recent study by the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that most Americans have ventured online to get help with their economic problems .
In fact , the study estimates an astounding 88 per cent of all American Internet users have employed the web in order to research the recession and solutions of their own financial concerns .
( Source : Internetnews.com )
Pew director and report co-author Lee Rainie believes the results reveal Americans ' desire to get the information they need to help get through this difficult period .
" People are anxious about these hard times , " said Rainie .
" They are more information - hungry than in normal times . " ( Source : reuters.com )
Web Used as Multi-Purpose Tool
The unemployment rate continued to grow last month , hitting 9.5 per cent across the U.S.
With more people out of work , the Internet has received increased traffic with people both searching for solutions and creating their own blogs to help resolve the problem .
However , the web is n't just being used to search for jobs or financial advice .
Many Americans are using it to research products they might have otherwise purchased more impulsively .
And that means several things : for one , there is a greater market than ever before for sites dedicated to protecting and educating the average consumer .
However , it could also mean more Americans vulnerable to Internet predators .
The challenge for security experts will be to keep the sharks at bay with more fish in the sea than ever before .
Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Kieran Walshe has refused to be drawn on media reports that a top - secret spy plane was used in the hunt for missing State Government minister Tim Holding .
Yesterday Premier John Brumby said he had expected Mr Holding to be found alive on Mt Feathertop because his torchlight and body heat had been spotted on the mountain on Monday night .
The lost bushwalker was eventually located by helicopter crews at around 10:00 am on Tuesday .
Reports today say the Monday night sighting was made by a mystery plane equipped with either infra-red or thermal imaging equipment .
Deputy Commissioner Walshe acknowledged that ' an offer ' had been made for assistance to find Mr Holding , but he would not elaborate .
" I do n't want to make any comment .
I made it very clear yesterday that an opportunity came to me which I accepted , and that activity resulted in us being able to clearly identify the area where Mr Holding was .
" I do n't want to say any more about that . "
Deputy Commissioner Walshe denied that Mr Holding , who is expected to be released from a Melbourne hospital today , was treated any differently to other hikers who have been lost in the Victorian Alps .
He told the ABC 's 774 Morning Show with Jon Faine that Mr Holding was not favoured because he is a politician .
" We used the same sort of opportunities , the same resource availability that would have been used , it does n't matter who it would have been , " he said .
" If we had any individual who was lost anywhere in the state and required assistance and required to be located and recovered , we would do exactly the same again . "
He says he decided to coordinate the search because a minister was involved .
" I took the decision that because Mr Holding does have a standing within the government of the state , that it was appropriate for me to be there to be up there to ensure that things were going the way they should have gone , " he said .
" I took that choice , because I thought it was important to do so .
" Now if it was somebody from the other parts of the state , I do n't know whether I would be there , I do n't know whether I would n't be there .
" It 's something that I would make a value judgment on at the time , as to whether I think it is appropriate for me in my role as deputy commissioner for public safety , whether it be appropriate for me to be there . "
Mr Brumby concedes that senior police only became involved in the operation because of Mr Holding 's media profile .
" Kieran Walshe was sent up there I guess because Tim is a high profile person who 's known , and you needed that level of coordination particularly with the media , " he said .
" But apart from that , in all other way , shape , form and dimensions he's had exactly the same support as would any other Victorian or Australian who is lost in the snow . "
Deputy Commissioner
Walshe says he has not costed the search , and rescue operation costs are met by the Victoria Police budget .
" From my perspective that 's not a priority for me .
The priority for me was to ensure that we conducted a search that resulted in the safe recovery of Mr Holding , " he said .
" We did that , and that 's the success of the operation .
What the cost is to me is not something I 'm going to rush into to find out . "
Victoria Police , SES and dozens of volunteer bushwalkers took part in the search for Mr Holding .
Meanwhile a State Opposition MP has labelled Mr Holding , a " super - dill " for not carrying an emergency beacon on his solo hike up Mount Feathertop .
Liberal MP Bernie Finn says Mr Holding acted foolishly .
" The ordinary Joe from the suburbs who goes walking by themselves in winter in such an area is a dill , for a minister of the Crown to do it is just super - dill - that is just ridilulous for anybody to even think about that , " he said .

The Midget Manifesto
Definition of Midget : Dwarfism , in medicine , is the condition of being undersized , or less than 127 cm ( 50 inches ) in height .
The term midget is usually applied to physically well - proportioned dwarfs .
The term pygmy is applied to people whose shortness of stature is a racial trait .
For the purpose of power , midgets will be attempted to be used , but the midgets will eventually be turned into a pygmy - like race .
Proposal : Harness the inherent power of midgets to provide clean , reliable energy , and a source of entertainment for mankind .
Implementation :
Number of Midgets Necessary : 6
3 worker midgets
1 breeding midget
2 gladiatorial midgets
Worker Midgets will be a special creation consisting of 4 legs and 2 arms .
see fig .
1
They will also be bred to have the uncommon dominant gene which causes the six - fingered mutation .
These midgets will necessarily be hardy and athletic .
Selective breeding will guarantee these traits .
The Breeding Midget must be a durable female carrying the six - fingered gene .
She must also be a pure midget having both midget genes be dominant .
When breeding occurs , the offspring is guaranteed to be a midget and have six fingers .
The Gladiatorial Midgets can be either male or female , but must be of good health and attitude .
These midgets can be of any number of fingers and other attributes .
These midgets are easily replaced .
How midgets fit in :
Worker Midgets will take turns running on a hamster wheel - type with an attached harness .
see fig .
2
The three Worker Midgets will each take eight hour shifts , one per day per midget .
The Worker Midgets during their sixteen hour off - period will be responsible for the up - keep of the midget - containment area .
see fig .
3
These will be the middle - class of the mini-midget society .
The Breeding Midget will be responsible for becoming pregnant by artificial purposes as often as possible .
Pure midget genes will be used for impregnation along with the six - fingered gene .
This is the only necessarily female midget .
She will constitute the matriarch of the society .
She will be responsible for the care of the baby midgets until they can work .
The Gladiatorial Midgets will be trained in the rudiments of hand - to - hand combat .
Each will be given two small weapons to fight with or in some instance they may have weapons grafted onto their hands .
At weekly intervals the midgets will either fight each other in mock combat or fight a small animal such as a pig or monkey to the death .
Appropriate measures will be taken so that they do not become dangerous to the master .
The gladiators represent the lower class of midget society .
The Creation of Worker Midgets : Each Worker Midget will actually be a composite of two individual midgets .
The Breeding Midget will be impregnated at regular intervals with twins so that a complete worker midget can be made from the offspring .
If it is not necessary for the creation of a worker midget at that time , they may be sold to a storage facility .
Of every pair of midgets which is born to the household , one will be cut in half .
The upper - half may be disposed of , but the lower half will be fused to the backbone and nervous system of the other midget .
The original midget will have full control over the entire body .
This configuration of limbs will enable the midget to keep better balance , run faster , and work harder .
How power is generated :
The worker midgets will run on a treadmill - like device which will power a static energy generator .
A system of bell tones and speaker commands , see fig .
4 , will communicate to the midgets what to do .
Their will also be a computer console which will enable visual contact via a two - way camera teleconference .
This will allow the midgets minimum oral feedback .
The Raising and Care of Midgets : The Breeding Midget will be responsible for the care of the younger midgets .
They will be taught how to talk as much as they need with most probably around a 250 word vocabulary .
No reading or writing instruction will be provided .
The midgets diet will consist of mainly vegetables and meat injected with vitamins .
This will insure that the midgets are operating under peak conditions .
They will be given a trough which they may eat out of at any time .
It will be refueled once per week .
As the midget - containment area is temperature controlled , , midgets need not wear clothing .
Midget Growth :
The growth of midgets from birth to a suitable age for working will be accelerated by placing them in nutrient soaking tanks .
These tanks will deprive the midgets the use of their senses , but they will receive the subliminal messages which will encompass several topics .
These messages will include the ideals of midget subjugation .
Midget Injury and Death :
In the unlikely event that a midget becomes injured the measures will depend on their class .
If a worker midget is injured they will be killed .
If a gladiatorial midget in injured , they will still compete in combat , but the chances of their death is increased .
If the breeding midget is injured she will receive medical attention .
When the midget dies , their remains will be spread on the compost nutrient heap so that the hydroponic fluid may become more enriched .
Ideal Midget Traits :
Subservience .
Subservience is the best trait for midgets to possess .
They need to understand that they are inferior and as such are subject to the will of the master .
They must learn to obey orders unquestioningly .
Strength .
Midgets to produce an acceptable amount of power , so they necessarily need to be strong .
If they are not hardy enough , the power output would not be adequate to support the household .
The four - leggedness will help to alleviate this problem , but this is only part of the solution .
Non-intelligence .
Midgets have to possess a certain amount of intelligence so as to be able to complete their tasks with some degree of competency .
They have to be ignorant , however so as not to rebel against the master .
Corporal punishment will help this to a degree , but a happy medium must be reached at some point .
Adaptability .
Midgets must be able to adapt to many conditions and be able to still work and remain productive in them .
If the Midget Containment Area becomes inhabitable , midgets must still continue work until it is stabilized .
Night Vision .
No power will be wasted by lighting the Midget Containment Area with electricity .
Therefore to be productive , midgets must have a semblance of night vision such as owls and cats have .
They must be able to disseminate heat patterns in the dark .
Farming Skills .
Midgets during their off hours will be responsible for tending their own hydroponic farm .
This farm will produce all food eaten by midgets excepting that which is vitamin - laced from the dumbwaiter .
Good farming skills will essential to their survival .
Penalty for Insurrection :
There is only one penalty for midgets : death .
Any violation of the following rules will incur this punishment .
Conspiring against the master .
The harming of another midget outside of gladiatorial combat .
The failure to produce expected power .
( This rule may be suspended at times )
Learning to read and / or write .
Destruction of property .
Possession of property .
Speaking to a human besides the master .
Other crimes which can be construed as harmful to either the midgets themselves , humanity , or necessary items and persons .
The Beginning of Enslavement : Midgets will be appropriated where ever they congregate for the greater good .
They will then be bred until numbers are sufficient .
They will then be doled out in proportional numbers to the citizens of America .
Commercial establishments may be required to purchase midgets from the government or abduct their own midgets .
Once the system is in place , all should go well .
The Appropriation of Canada :
As Canada is an entirely inferior country it will be easy to gain .
It may be as simple as asking to join and then afterwards killing all Canadians with lethal injections or other such painless means .
It may be as difficult as declaring nuclear war and bombing Canada perpetually until they are all eliminated .
Midget Storage Areas will then be built , where frozen midgets may be stacked by the million .
They will then be thawed when needed .
Government and Midgets :
The government will control all new midgets sold to businesses and private sector personnel .
The government will control the Canadian Midget Storage Areas and be responsible for stocking them .
To do this efficiently it necessitates the need for SARCOM ( Science and Research Center on Midgets ) .
SARCOM will be responsible for keeping up to date on the midget situation and providing new technology in the field .
This way there will always be new discoveries in midgets .
Numbering of Midgets : Each midget and new midget born will need to be reported to the government for a number .
This will ensure that each midget is accounted for via a remote locator fused into the head .
The government through SARCOM will be able to locate a midget at a moments notice .
Dwarf Tossing :
The popular sport of tossing dwarves for distance will be allowed during some holidays and festivals .
The frozen midgets will be the subject of this tossing .
No live midgets will be allowed to be tossed as this may cause them to violate some rules .
Drawbacks :
Midgets are mortal .
The Breeding Midget may not be able to keep up with the demand .
This can be solved by having specially founded midget holding centers .
The appropriation of Canada may be necessary for this endeavor .
Rebellion of midgets .
Midgets at some time may realize the self - futility of their existence and refuse to work .
Lethal Penalties may solve this problem
The amount of power generated may not be sufficient .
This can be solved by expanding the amount of midgets working .
It may be necessary to have two wheels running simultaneously .
The generator will be storing energy provided during times when the entirety of the power output is not being used however .
Pure midget genes may be hard to find .
This can be solved by the field of genetics and some luck .
Some midgets are guaranteed to have pure genes .
After several generations , the race should be pure .
Cruelty .
People may say that this is cruel to the midgets .
This is completely false and untrue as their standard of living will actually be increased by their subjugation .
They will not be ridiculed because of their impediment in this setting .
They will actually be valuable to society and as such will have a sense of accomplishment .
Number of Midgets .
Of necessity a great number of midgets will be had .
At the beginning of the program , midgets will be bred to the fullest extent .
Midgets will then be frozen and placed in Canada .
Canada will have to be taken for this purpose .
Humans who do n't go with the system .
Any human who exhibits pro-midget behavior and is against midget enslavement , will themselves be killed or enslaved .
This will not be a great problem as most humans will realize the benefits of the midget program .
The federal government took measures to bolster food safety this week as more potentially contaminated food was pulled off shelves .
Raw tahini , soup and packets of dried plums were recalled as a new rule required manufacturers to tell the government about any potentially contaminated product within 24 hours .
Michael Taylor , the new senior adviser to the FDA 's commissioner , said the database means that instead of waiting until people get sick , the agency will be able to act as soon as it has information about potentially contaminated food .
Also this week , the White House unveiled a new Web site that brings together information on food safety from various agencies , including the FDA , the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The site , www.foodsafety.gov, is designed to make it easier for consumers to get information about recalls , find tips on safe food handling practices and get their questions answered .
These actions are part of a campaign by President Obama to bolster America 's food safety network , which has been hit with successive outbreaks of food poisoning involving salmonella , E. coli O157:H7 and other pathogens that have tainted everything from ground beef to spinach to peanut butter and cookie dough .
At the end of July , the U.S. House passed the Food Safety Modernization
Act which would give the FDA authority to recall tainted food , examine company records and carry out more frequent inspections .
The Senate is set to consider its own version of the bill this session .
In the meantime , the recalls continue .
This week the FDA said that Premier Organics of Berkeley , Calif. , was pulling 840 cases of Artisana Raw Tahini , a sesame - seed paste , sold in 16 - oz .
glass jars , over fears they might be contaminated with salmonella .
The agency also warned consumers that tests turned up high levels of lead in Saladitos con Chile ( salted plums with chili powder ) , made by Chulada , Inc. of Burbank , Calif .
They are sold in 1/4 - oz . and 1 - oz. packages .
And the USDA said Bay Valley Foods of Pittsburgh , Pa. , was pulling 6,490 pounds of a chunky grilled steak and vegetable soup that may be undercooked .
The soup was sold in 18.6 - oz cans under the Stator Bros. brand .

On August 24th , the CARS program ( more affectionately known as ' Cash for Clunkers ' ) ended .
The program was rolled out to generate sales to the distressed North American car industry ( and the economy in general ) , while putting more efficient cars on the road .
Was it well received ?
Very much so .
Who does n't like free money * after all ?
In fact , the initial funding of a billion dollars was exhausted in a week .
A further two billion was quickly infused into the program , which allowed it to reach the one month mark before closing .
In total , the DoT reported that 690,114 deals went down , good for about 2.9 billion worth of stimulus .
Many critics of the program feared that the program merely dragged forward future sales and really did not generate anywhere near that many ' new ' sales and that a wake would be left in months following it .
The industry as a whole did indeed report growth ... over 1 % worth , with small car maker Hyundai naturally receiving the largest boost , up 47 % .
Also faring well were Ford ( +17 % ) , Honda ( +10 % ) and Toyota ( +6 % ) .
However , our own GM pulled up the rear , reporting year over year sales of 246,479 , good for - 20 % .
A look at the top selling vehicles in the CARS program gives a glimpse of part of the problem : 1. Toyota Corolla2 .
Honda Civic3 .
Toyota Camry4 .
Ford Focus5 . Hyundai Elantra6 .
Nissan Versa7 . Toyota Prius8 .
Honda Accord9 .
Honda Fit10 .
Ford EscapeYou will notice , there is not a GM vehicle to be found on that list .
Of all sales generated , only 17 % of the CFC deals went down at a GM dealership , and of those , a good bulk fell to ' dead brand ' Pontiac .
Breaking down August 's - 20 % monthly sales number at GM , we find Pontiac reported a 23.3 % sales , while survivors ( and unlikely beneficiaries ) of the CARS program Cadillac and Buick , were off 55 % and 52 % respectively .
( GMC and Chevrolet were off 45 % and 9 % ) Looking ahead , GM has a couple big issues .
For starters , Pontiac sold 30,000 odd cars last month , which leaves them with only about 15,000 left in new car inventory total before they slip quietly into automotive history .
In fact , the ' dead brands ' made up about 1 in of every 6 sales for GM last month .
GM is so concerned about the orphaned customers of these brands , or ' free agents ' if you will , they have recently set up a special task force to try and rustle those costumers back into the fold .
Even before the loss of the ' dead brands ' themselves are felt on the monthly sales , GM 's market share has plunged from 24.7 % to 19.5 % in the last 12 months .
On top of the future loss of ' free agents ' ( about 15 % of GM 's business YTD ) , they now face the vacuum the CARS program has left , which primarily benefited Japanese auto makers ( and Pontiac clear outs ) .
What did newly promoted , vice president of rose colored glasses U.S. Sales , Mark LaNeve , have to say about all of this and GM 's diminishing share ? "
Mark continues to bat a thousand with optimism on the monthly sales results and forward looking statements .
Inside the same press release , the the usual paradox between reason and the words coming out of Mark LaNeve 's mouth presents itself .
Mark announces that current production of cars for the quarter is set at 535,000 vehicles , and will be 655,000 for Q4 2009 .
Which of course means to any of us that are good at math , ( and / or own a calculator ) , if GM sells every car they make , they will still average about 40,000 less than they sold this month .
Normally your supposed to wrap these articles up with some hope , so what is the answer ?
Is it the Voltec project (s ) going to lead the charge at the ' new ' GM and turn things around ?
It might .
Unfortunately volume and profitability for this platform are a long way off , and there is n't any new products that can fill the gap in the meantime ... unless the new Equinox ( and its legion of rebadges ) are going to sell 1.5 million copies in 2010 .
GM is going to need a lot more help from you and me ( the taxpayer ) to get there , so are we in ?
Or out ?
Do we even have a choice ?
Next up ... the DoE loans .
After 30 years , Compuserve is finally , totally , mostly dead ( the email addresses still work ) .
I was always a local BBS and GEnie guy , but there 's no doubting the power and influence of Compuserve in introducing the idea of networked communications to a generation , and proving the business - case for commercial online activity :
The original CompuServe service , first offered in 1979 , was shut down this past week by its current owner , AOL .
The service , which provided its users with addresses such as 73402,3633 and was the first major online service , had seen the number of users dwindle in recent years .
At its height , the service boasted about having over half a million users simultaneously on line .
Many innovations we now take for granted , from online travel ( Eaasy Sabre ) , online shopping , online stock quotations , and global weather forecasts , just to name a few , were standard fare on CompuServe in the 1980s .
CompuServe users will be able to use their existing CompuServe Classic ( as the service was renamed ) addresses at no charge via a new e-mail system , but the software that the service was built on , along with all the features supported by that software , from forums for virtually every topic and profession known to man to members '
Ourworld Web pages , has been shut down .
Indeed , the current version of the service 's client software , CompuServe for Windows NT 4.0.2 , dates back to 1999 .
Rep. Joe Wilson's ( R - S.C. ) shout may have outdone Obama 's speech in unifying besieged Dems around health care reform .

Wilson 's rallying cry
All eyes were on President Barack Obama entering Wednesday night 's address to Congress , but a little - known South Carolina Republican may have done more than the president ’s combative speech to unify besieged Democrats around health care reform .
The night 's defining moment — which Democrats hope to transform into a turning point — came when Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) shouted " You lie ! " as Obama claimed his plan would n't offer free care to illegal immigrants .

Wilson 's boorishness — for which he quickly apologized — enraged audience members on both sides of the aisle .
It also overshadowed a speech that included some of Obama 's harshest attacks on his GOP critics to date , including a denunciation of " death panel " alarmists as liars — a veiled swipe at former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin — and a warning to Republicans who want to " kill " reform .
" What we have also seen in these last months is the same partisan spectacle that only hardens the disdain many Americans have toward their own government , " Obama said .
" Too many have used this as an opportunity to score short - term political points , even if it robs the country of our opportunity to solve a long - term challenge .
And out of this blizzard of charges and counter - charges , confusion has reigned .
" Well , the time for bickering is over .
The time for games has passed , " he added , to Democratic cheers .
The president 's combativeness , coupled with Wilson 's behavior , clearly energized Democrats — to the point where few were in a mood to criticize Obama 's lack of specifics or the fact that he offered no ironclad commitment to inserting a robust public option in the final legislation .
Sen . Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) , one of the upper - chamber Democrats most skeptical of the White House reform efforts , was impressed by Obama ’s speech .
" I think it was a bit of a game - changer , " he said .
" The speech galvanized support along the Democratic Caucus across the political spectrum , from the progressive caucus to the Blue Dogs , and everybody left determined to get something done this year , " Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( D - Md. ) , head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , told POLITICO on Wednesday night .
Republicans — some of whom expressed open contempt for Obama by scanning their BlackBerrys or holding up copies of GOP bills during the speech — saw the president ’s remarks as a Democratic call to arms that belied the president ’s oft - repeated calls for bipartisanship .
" I was incredibly disappointed in the tone of his speech , ” said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) .
” At times , I found his tone to be overly combative and believe he behaved in a manner beneath the dignity of the office .
I fear his speech tonight has made it more difficult — not less — to find common ground .
" He appeared to be angry at his critics and disappointed the American people were not buying the proposals he has been selling .
...
If the Obama administration and congressional Democrats go down this path and push a bill on the American people they do not want , it could be the beginning of the end of the Obama presidency . "
Rep. Mark Kirk ( R - Ill . ) , who is running for Obama 's old Senate seat , said , " He talked at us .
He did n't listen to us ...
It was a missed opportunity . "
Added Sen. Bob Corker ( R - Tenn . ) : " I sat there tonight wondering what the purpose of this evening was .
I was hoping to hear the president flesh out a middle ground , but instead we heard platitudes and campaign rhetoric . "
But Sen. Tom Coburn ( R - Okla . ) , one of Obama 's most consistent critics , saw some room for compromise .
" It was a good speech , the problem is that what he wants and what they 've written are two totally different things , " said Coburn , an OB - GYN .
“ I 'm willing to compromise to get things fixed .
But I 'm not willing to put the government in charge because we do n't have a good track record . "
Despite the energized tone , Obama offered cold comforts to liberals , no detailed road map for reform and an endorsement of the public option that fell far short of a guarantee .
" It is only one part of my plan , " he said of the option .
" To my progressive friends , I would remind you that for decades , the driving idea behind reform has been to end insurance company abuses and make coverage affordable for those without it .
The public option is only a means to that end — and we should remain open to other ideas that accomplish our ultimate goal . "
But the fight over the public plan was eclipsed by Wilson 's outburst halfway through Obama 's address .
Wilson was quickly shouted down by Democrats , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shot a withering glance at the GOP side of the room .
White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel demanded an apology from Wilson — as did Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) .
A chastened Wilson quickly obliged , issuing a public apology and calling Emanuel personally after the speech , according to a White House source .
" This evening , I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the president 's remarks regarding the coverage of illegal immigrants in the health care bill , " he wrote in an e-mail to reporters .
" While I disagree with the president 's statement , my comments were inappropriate and regrettable .
I extend sincere apologies to the President for this lack of civility . "
House Majority Whip James Clyburn , a South Carolina Democrat , said the remark was the latest in a long line of political attacks by Wilson .
“ Joe Wilson took our state 's reputation to a new low .
I thought [ Gov. ]
Mark Sanford had taken it as low as it could go , but this is beyond the pale , " Clyburn said .
" Joe is very confrontational , " he added .
" He held his first town hall meeting three blocks from my house at my kid's high school .
Now why would he have this town hall meeting in my congressional district , three blocks from my house in my kid's high school ?
It 's not in his district .
That 's the kind of guy Joe Wilson is .
He loves confronting people .
So he was confronting the president , just as he was confronting me . "
Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin , the second - ranking Democrat in the Senate , predicted that Wilson ’s outburst would have consequences .
" The person who said it will pay a price , ” Durbin said .
“ I think the average American thinks that the president and the office deserve respect , and that was a disrespectful comment .
They 'll pay a price in the court of public opinion . "

Accountability
It ’s almost twenty years ago that a college friend told me about when she was raped .
A man she considered a friend drove her to an out - of - the - way location , then held her down and penetrated her .
She said no , and she decided that too much physical resistance ran the risk of a beating , which was n’t a risk she wanted to run .
Afterwards , she said , what she needed more than anything was for him to admit that he raped her .
There is little research ( though there is some ) , but some kind of vast majority of men who rape find some excuse or script to tell themselves that what they did was n’t rape , was acceptable and that they are not bad people .
People ’s capacity to do that never ceases to amaze me .
I ’m just picking one example .
Before that and after that , time after time , I ’ve heard women who have been raped tell me that what they want most of all is accountability .
That ’s not all rape survivors , I ’m sure , but I ’ve heard it enough to believe that it is a powerful motivator .
Responsibility .
Vindication .
Moral victory .
An admission that what was done to them was wrong .
Andrea McNulty does not want Ben Roethlisberger ’s fucking money .
She wants an apology and a donation to charity .
The defense from the fans and apologists is always that the woman who accuses an athlete of rape is seeking a payday .
That does not ring true to me , and it is not the facts of this case .
What they want is an acknowledgement .
They said no .
They had a right to say no .
Their no has meaning .
Ignoring it is wrong .
Is that so hard ?
Yes .
For rapists , I think it probably is .
If they were capable of taking responsibility for what they do , they would n’t do it .
( About the notion that McNulty is some kind of nut : I have no idea if it is true or not .
I am not particularly moved by it , even if true .
The non-neurotypical have a right not to be raped .
If we dismiss the claims of anyone who suffers from a mental illness , or who is just wierd , when they say they were raped , then we ’re painting targets on their backs and simply telling rapists to pick the right targets .
Which … is effectively what we tell them anyway .
As a practical matter , is n’t it true that for a woman to get relief from the justice system for rape , she has to satisfy a monastic standard for personal conduct and a demographic standard of acceptability ?
But that ’s another post . )
The news that Facebook has tripled in size in the past year has grabbed headlines , but the real news was that the social network is now - in Mark Zuckerberg 's words - " free cash flow positive " .
That piece of accounting jargon indicates that , after more than five years , the site has taken the first major step towards becoming an honest - to - god profit - making company and ( perhaps ) indicates that a stock market launch could finally become a possibility .
But the news that the site has money coming in needs to be examined a little closer .
While it 's a little difficult to discern exactly what this " free cash flow " constitutes for a private company like Facebook , one spokesman told Reuters that it " does not include any cash from private investment " .
That might indicate that Facebook is now making more than enough money to cover its taxes , capital expenditure and the cost of around 700 staff - but that the money put into the company by its backers ( such as the $ 300 m recently raised from Russian group Digital Sky Technologies ) does n't count .
If all that extra money is n't being used to shore up vital day - to - day Facebook operations , that 's probably good news - but whatever the case , the site has n't hit the high notes quite yet .
However , the fact that Facebook is making any money at all might come as a surprise to some , given that many are sceptical that social networking sites have real money - making potential ( and for good reason , given the history of the dotcom bubbles and here - today , gone - tomorrow social websites ) .
However , after throwing around all kinds of ideas - some good , some not so good - Zuckerberg and company now seem to have settled on a number of ways to bring in the money :
• Self - serve advertising allows marketers to decide precisely who they want to appeal to , and buy ads to put in front of users who fit the profile .
This has already proved appealing for some big brands : right now , I can see ads from 3 Mobile and Peugeot on my Facebook homepage , for example .
• It 's not just big advertisers , either .
Almost anyone can walk up and buy space on the site if they have the cash - and that includes other Facebook users , who try to direct you to their profiles , fan pages or elsewhere in order to get you to follow their cause or buy their product .
• There are also the gifts and other virtual property that users can buy and give to each other .
This still seems like a crazy idea to some people , but it can prove a highly profitable business in the right circumstances - virtual goods prop up all kinds of online games , and nobody ever thought ringtones could be so profitable .
In addition , the company is known to be working on a micropayments system ( no doubt a money - spinner if they can pull it off ) that will almost certainly allow it to take a slice of any transaction that takes place through the site .
Whatever it is , there appears to be a business here , something even critics like Andrew Keen are now admitting .
Now , that 's not to say that Facebook can continue unabated .
Even if its products are making money today , there are few guarantees for tomorrow .
After all , at the height of its powers a couple of years ago , rival MySpace was boasting that it was making almost $ 1 m a day simply from selling adverts on its homepage .
Since then , it has struggled to keep up momentum and found itself needing to slash jobs and refocus its business .
For now , Zuckerberg and friends appear to be doing a lot of things right - but there are still plenty of lessons they need to keep in mind .
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger may possibly veto the Harvey Milk Day Bill as he did last year due to outrage and opposition from religious extremists .
Harvey Milk
Day would honor the slain gay rights hero on May 22nd of each year , but would not force schools to shut down or celebrate the day in any way .
The governor needs to hear input from people who understand the significance of teaching about the legacy of Harvey Milk .

We toss around references to different burger styles on this site all the time , but it occurred to me that we 've never really set them out all in one place for easy reference .
I 'm doing that now .
Here 's a list of all the burger styles we could think of .
If there 's something here we 're missing , chime in with a comment .
Here goes , in no particular order our guide to hamburger and cheeseburger styles ...
pub burgers
Large patties usually no smaller than 8 ounces , often 10 ounces or more .
Typically ovoid in shape rather than flat .
Most often seen in pubs ( hence the name ) , where they 're often broiled .
Until the 2000s , most of New York City 's most - loved burgers were pub burgers -- Donovan's , McHale 's ( RIP ) , Molly's , and , yes , the Corner Bistro .
[ More , -- much , much more -- after the jump . ]
fast food burgers
Do I really need to define this one for you ?
I did n't think so .
I include it only to offer a comparison to ...
fast food - style
We 've always used this term on AHT to denote burgers that seem to take their inspiration from fast food burgers but that are somehow better -- either in terms of ingredients or preparation or both .
Fast food–style burgers will be made with fresh - not - frozen beef ; use the freshest , crispest produce ; and generally come from a sole location or , at most , a small , local chain .
Burger Joint and Shake Shack in NYC ; Taylor 's Automatic Refresher in Saint Helena , California , and San Francisco ; All - American Drive - In in Massapequa , New York -- these are all fast food –style burgers if not necessarily true fast food burgers .
I 'd almost even include In - N - Out under this rubric , even though it is technically a fast - food joint .
Its philosophy and awesomeness are so far above what I normally think of as fast food that it transcends the category .
sliders
Many people think a slider is just a name for a mini burger .
Many people are wrong .
I 've already written at length on this in my post " A Mini Hamburger Is Not a Slider , " so I will just quote myself here :
People , a slider is something very specific .
It is not just a mini hamburger .
It 's a thin , thin slip of beef , cooked on a griddle with onions and pickles piled atop patty .
The steam from the onions does as much cooking as the griddle .
The buns are placed atop the onions , absorbing the pungent aroma and flavor .
A slider is at once a hamburger and , yet , something more .
( Maybe because you eat a bunch of them at one sitting . )
Speaking of which ...
mini hamburgers
Any diminutive burger that does not meet the definition of slider ( see above ) , often because it has been grilled or broiled rather than steam - griddled and almost always because it lacks the bed of pungent onions .
There was an annoying trend , roughly from 2006 to the middle of 2008 , whereby every damn chef was putting mini burgers ( often misidentifying them as " sliders " ) on his or her bar menu .
It seems to have ebbed as of late .
Steakhouse Burgers
The steakhouse burger is defined more by where it 's served than by any other unifying characteristics .
Though there are some general observations you can make , however .
Steakhouse burgers are usually made from the beef trimmings of the various steaks on hand and as such are ground from prime , aged beef .
They 're almost always massive , hearty burgers on par with pub - style burgers .
And they 're often broiled .
You'd think this all would make for some fine burgers , but you 'd likely be wrong .
Almost none of us at AHT have ever had a good steakhouse burger experience ( except for AHT LA reviewer Damon Gambuto , who had a fine one at Nick & Stef's ) .
Steakhouses seem to always miss on the cooking the burgers properly to temperature , and burgers there are mostly an afterthought rather than the main show .
You go to a steakhouse for steak , not a burger .
Even worse is when steakhouses try to put some thought into the burgers and end up with some sort of overpriced , mushy ill - conceived Kobe / Wagyu burger .
A Kobe burger is always , always a bad idea .
Which brings me to ...
Kobe / Wagyu Beef Burgers
And here I will repeat , a Kobe burger is always , always a bad idea .
When cooked rare to medium - rare , as most chefs who put these on their menus usually recommend , the texture inevitably renders as mushy .
It 's like moist cat food on a bun , with the meat oozing out the sides and back as you try to eat the burger .
Why turn a glorious piece of beef into minced meat ?
Kobe burgers are most often seen in mini- hamburger form , usually as an " appetizer " plate of three burgers , because A ) this expensive beef is more affordable in smaller , sharable portions and B ) the Kobe / Wagyu and the min-burger / " slider " trends seem to have peaked at the same time .
Thankfully , both manias seem to have abated and you do n't hear as much about these ill - conceived lil ' ditties anymore .
fancy - pants burgers
Price is a pretty good indication you 're eating a fancy - pants burger .
But since price varies from city to city , it 's difficult to set a hard - and - fast dollar border .
Let 's just say that if it costs double what a McD's QPC Value Meal does , you 're probably in fancy - pants land .
If that 's not enough of an indication , you know you 're heading into rarefied air when any one or more of the following is involved :
A big - name chef or restaurateur , or a celebrity chef
Brioche buns
" House - made " ketchup
" House - made " anything
Artisanal or farmstead cheeses
" Artisanal " anything
Aioli , remoulade , frisée , microgreens , arugula , etc .
Designer bacon
Foie gras
Dry-aging
Kobe / Wagyu beef

megaburgers
Any burger whose sole purpose is to break a record -- most often weight , but sometimes price .
Typically the result of tired publicity stunts , megaburgers have rapidly increased in number in the last few years thanks largely to social media -- it 's almost guaranteed the blogging - Twittering - Facebooking masses will blab about you and your three - ton burger that you need a forklift to flip .
( See : We took the bait yesterday . )
extreme burgers
Similar to megaburgers ( see above ) , but here the point is less about sheer size than it is caloric overkill , stuffing as much gut - fattening , artery - clogging shit on and about the hamburger sandwich as possible .
Examples include our own Hamburger Fatty Melt ; any variation on the doughnut burger , including Paula Deen 's Lady 's Brunch Burger ; or almost anything served at the Heart Attack Grill .
stacked burgers
Anything with two or more patties .
Popular examples include In - N - Out 's Double Double , Wendy 's Double , or Burger King 's Stackers .
Props to any stacked burger that uses an interstitial bun , like the Big Mac .
deep - fried burgers
Just what it sounds like , folks .
Forget the griddle , throw water on the grill .
The patties of these burgers take a dunk in hot , hot oil .
Dyer 's Burgers in Memphis is perhaps the most famous deep - fried burger emporium , thanks largely to George Motz 's Hamburger America spot on them ( above ) .
Variations exist that include entire burgers -- bun and all - - being dipped in batter and deep - fried , but they 're rare .
Tasty , but rare .
Jump on that shizz if you ever find one .
This variant could also be filed under " extreme burgers . "
Regional Burger Styles
While some form of the burgers above can be found in pretty much any small - to large - size U.S. city , there are many burger styles that represent unique local flavors or philosophies -- or that simply sprang up for one reason or another and inspired nearby but not nationwide imitation .
These are the varied and glorious regional burger styles that represent the ingenuity and brashness for which the U.S. is known .
While some form of the burgers above can be found in pretty much any small - to large - size U.S. city , there are many burger styles that represent unique local flavors or philosophies -- or that simply sprang up for one reason or another and inspired nearby but not nationwide imitation .
These are the varied and glorious regional burger styles that represent the ingenuity and brashness for which the U.S. is known .
When it comes to the documentation and glorification of these variations , we owe a standing ovation to two men and their perambulations .
They are John T. Edge and George Motz .
In Hamburgers & Fries and Hamburger America , respectively , Edge and Motz have done the Lord 's work .
Edge 's book Hamburgers & Fries documents the history of many of the following styles with humorous local color commentary .
And Motz 's Hamburger America ( there 's a film and a book of the same name ) , while treading some of the same ground , complements Edge 's earlier work with its lovingly photographed and filmed burgers and you - are - there storytelling .
OK , without further ado , let 's go ....
smashed burgers
In truth the burger style we 've taken to calling " smashed burgers " can probably found wherever greasy - spoon short - order cooks are serving up sandwiches made from fresh - ground beef cooked on a superhot griddle .
But I 've seen this technique applied most consistently in mom-and - pop lunch counters in the Midwest , so it 's classified here under " regional styles . "
This is another subject I 've written about at length , so another self - quote concerning " smashed burger technique " :
[ Cooks start with ] a four - ounce - or - so ball of fresh beef , [ let ] it cook a bit on a hot , hot griddle , and then [ give ] it a good WHACK with the back of a spatula ....
The technique leads to a crisp - crunchy crust with an artfully irregular shape , and best of all , creates more surface area for a Maillard - like reaction to occur .
Invaluable resource : Nick Kindelsperger investigated the application of the smashed burger technique to home cooking and has some great tips .
steamed burgers
Prevalent in a small part of Connecticut , the steamed cheeseburger is prepared in a microwave - size steaming chamber that holds several small trays .
Half the trays cradle the beef while the remaining trays contain a molten white cheddar mixture that is poured onto the patties post - steam .
Both Motz and John T. Edge have done extensive research on steamed cheeseburgers , with Edge going so far as to call the part of Connecticut --" the peculiar triangle of south - central Connecticut , bound roughly on the west by Meriden , on the east by Middletown , and on the south by Wallingford " - - a " cheeseburger microclimate . "
For there are a number of steamed cheeseburger joints in the area , notably Ted 's Steamed Cheeseburgers in Meriden .
They are , perhaps , an acquired taste , as our own Nick Solares did not like them , but Motz sings their praises and even has a steamed cheeseburger chest of his own .
cheese - stuffed burgers
Though it probably did n't take a genius to eventually try to stuff cheese inside a burger , the folks in Minneapolis seem to have perfected the practice .
There , at Matt 's Bar , it 's called the Jucy Lucy .
Variations of the name appear at other Twin Cities bars , like at the 5 - 8 Club , where it 's the Juicy Lucy .
But they all follow a similar formula -- American cheese stuffed between two patties , all cooked on a flat - top .
If you 've ever tried to duplicate one at home , it 's trickier than it would seem .
You 've got to seal in the cheese securely so you do n't have a blow - out , and , as the cheese melts and puffs up the patty , you 've got to prick it quickly with a toothpick right after you flip it to let the steam escape .
It 's better to leave it to the experts .
Though the concentration of cheese - stuffed burgers seems to be highest in the Twin Cities , we 've caught wind of similar burgers elsewhere , like at the Good Dog in Philadelphia ( pictured above ) .
As some bonus cheese - stuffed burger collateral , here is a video of the best three seconds in burgerdom .
Cheese oozing from a Jucy Lucy at Matt 's Bar in Minneapolis :
green chile cheeseburgers
Indigenous to New Mexico , where grows the Hatch green chile , these burgers are topped with chopped roasted peppers trapped in a gooey , oozy matrix of melted cheese -- usually white cheddar as happens to be the case at the Bobcat Bite in Santa Fe .
If you have n't been already , you may know the Bobcat Bite , once again , from George Motz 's burger biopic .
onion burgers
These are a variation on smashed burgers with a little bit of slider thrown in .
Edge points toward the Depression as the harsh inspiration for these burgers , as throwing half an onion , sliced into rings , into the mix helped make the meat go further .
The meat is placed on top of the onions and pressed down into them until they fuse .
In the process , the onions become almost caramelized as they cook on a hot , hot griddle .
El Reno , Oklahoma , seems to be the focal point of this style , with Johnnie 's Grill , Sid's Diner , Robert 's Grill , and Jobe 's Drive - In , but places like the Hamburger Inn , south of El Reno in Ardmore , do them , too .
guberburgers
Burgers with a generous dollop of melted peanut butter ladeled on .
The most famous practitioner is probably The Wheel Inn Drive - In in Sedalia , Missouri -- again , thanks to George Motz 's Hamburger America documentary and book .
Although the original Wheel Inn had been close to closing for good due to a road - widening project , a longtime employee reopened it in a new location , serving the same ol ' guberburgers .
butter burgers
It 's no surprise that butter burgers reach their apotheosis in Wisconsin , the Dairy State .
As if a juicy hunk of meat ain't enough moistness for you , folks around these parts cook the patties in butter and then slather on a hefty dose of the stuff right after it hits the bun .
Solly 's Grille in Milwaukee is a famous spot for this style .
pimento cheese burgers
If you 're not from the South , you may not even have heard of pimento cheese , much less pimento cheese burgers .
As I 've heard from all my Southern friends , pimento cheese ( a mixture of grated cheese -- usually cheddar -- pimentos , mayo , and spices ) is a sort of Southern comfort food that spans all classes and ages .
Pimento cheese tea sandwiches are often served at high - falutin ' functions -- most famously at the Masters Tournament in Augusta , Georgia .
And it 's just as often spread on celery sticks and served as an hors d'oeuvre .
It 's not hard to see how this stuff eventually found its way onto a burger :
Hey !
You got your pimento cheese on my burger !
No , you got your burger in my pimento cheese !
Two great tastes , folks .
Two great tastes .
loosemeats sandwiches ( aka Maid - Rites , aka ' taverns ' )
A lot of you purists will grumble that this is not a burger , but if it passes muster with George Motz , then it 's good enough for AHT .
I 'll let George describe it .
From Hamburger America :
For those not familiar with the popular Iowa hamburger - influenced sandwich , a loosemeats , or Maid - Rite ( and sometimes referred to as a " tavern " ) , is basically a deconstructed hamburger , or a sloppy joe without the slop .
The recipe is simple : fresh ground - on - premises beef is steamed and crumbled in a cast iron cooker .
Nothing is added but salt .
The " Maid - Rite " that George refers to is Taylor 's Maid - Rite , in Marshalltown , Iowa .
The Maid - Rite , loosemeats sandwich , or tavern is an Iowa thing .
slug burgers
Another Southern thing -- this time from a small triangle of an area in northern Alabama , northern Mississippi , and southern Tennessee .
According to Ginger of Deep Fried Kudzu , they 're called slugburgers in Moulton , Alabama ; Decatur , Alabama ; and Corinth , Mississippi ; and doughburgers in Tupelo , Mississippi .
Hamburgers & Fries also notes instances of cracker burgers and tater burgers .
What they all have in common is a frugality born of the Depression ( much like the onion burgers of Oklahoma ) , when folks in Mississippi learned to use fillers -- bread , flour , potatoes , crackers -- to extend their meat supplies .
Deep Fried Kudzu's Ginger has a great photo set on Flickr of slugburgers and the places that serve them and tells me , " I 've been telling my friend who works with the Southern Foodways Alliance that they should do a ' Slugburger Trail ' just like they have a ' Tamale Trail ' and ' Boudin Trail ' . "
I totally agree .
Get on that , SFA !
bean burgers
The bean burger -- no , the patty is not made of beans -- is native to San Antonio , Texas .
According to etymologist Barry Popik , it was supposedly invented at Sill 's Snack Shack in 1953 and consists of a beef patty topped with canned refried beans , crushed Frito's , and Cheese Whiz .
In Hamburgers & Fries , Edge mentions that Sills himself says he picked it up from a serviceman at nearby Fort Sam Houston but subbed in the Whiz for the GI 's American cheese .
OK .
I 'm sure there are more burger styles out there , but I 'm pooped .
Let us know of any we 've missed and we 'll update this glossary at that time .

The longest solar eclipse in this century is scheduled to become visible on the west coast of India at dawn on Wednesday ( NASA has images and charts showing where the eclipse will be visible and when ) .
The event is drawing scientists and eclipse enthusiasts from around the world , eager for a truly once in a lifetime experience .
But for millions of Indians , the rare astronomical event is a source of dread .
The pending eclipse has become a stage where fact and myth , modern science and Hindu mythology are competing for public acceptance .
Take this the headline in a India Today article : Rationalists out to eclipse astrologers .
For outsiders , the extent to which superstition still figures in personal decisions may be a surprise .
For many Indians of all classes , astrology is an active and vital part of everyday life .
Couples consult astrologers about auspicious days to marry .
The days deemed to be most fortuitous can sometimes seem like citywide holidays , with scores of marriages filling the city with the wail of brass bands and the thump of fireworks – both common features at Indians ' routinely elaborate wedding ceremonies .
But astrology also has a darker side .
Indian soothsayers have warned that pregnant women should cover the windows and stay indoors on Wednesday , lest the dark forces associated with the eclipse deform their unborn children .
Astrologers in India have warned of impending terrorist attacks , natural disasters , and civil wars too .
Thousands of years of mythology
Hindu mythology blames eclipses on the demon Rahu – who is variously depicted as a snake or a dragon or a disembodied head – who swallows the sun .
( The one common thread of depictions of Rahu is that they ’re all scary whether here , here or here ) .
But many Indians take their superstition to extremes , with some doctors willing to help expectant parents even delay labor to avoid birth on such a day .
To be sure , India 's critics of superstition , locally known has rationalists , have also been out in force in the nation 's press in recent days .
Amit Bhattacharya , writing in the Times of India , chides his countrymen for turning a glimpse at " the beauty that awaits us in the universe " into a day of fear .
" It ’s fear that drives us to fast during an eclipse lest the mal - influence of the sunless period is ingested with the food .
It ’s fear again that prompts thousands of expectant Indian mothers , and fathers , to make use of medical science techniques to ensure they do n’t give birth on the ‘ inauspicious ’ day of the eclipse , '' he writes .
" Three thousand years of lived tradition .
A spiritual heritage that ’s the envy of the world .
One would have thought such wisdom would enable us to assimilate and imbibe modern knowledge in a more holistic manner ... instead , we spread fear .
If Shani does n’t get you , Rahu must . "
On Wednesday , Hindu temples will be closed , and wo n't be open until after they 've been " cleansed . "
The planetariums and observatories will be open .
That sort of says it all .

One Poster with Windows 7 Desktop Design
Ten Tote Bags with Windows 7 Desktop Design for hosts and guests
Also included in USA party packs :
One package of streamers for decoration
One package of balloons for decoration
One table top centerpiece for decoration
One package of Windows 7 napkins
US residents will also be entered for a chance to win a $ 750 mini -notebook computer .
A total of 64 winners will be notified once all the parties are over ( after October 30 , 2009 ) .
The first step of the application process is simple : you have to tell Microsoft about yourself , how the company can contact you , where to send the Party Pack , and finally pick a screen name and password ( for checking the status of your application ) .
After that , you have to confirm that " by applying for a host spot , you are agreeing to conduct yourself in the spirit of House Party — sharing a product you love with the people you love , through an experience that is fun , free , and exclusive " and that you will abide to five rules :
Submit only one application per household ( per party )
Answer all questions accurately Plan and host the best party you can Share your party package with your guests , as intended Not attempt to obtain extra party packages
Once you 've agreed to all that , you have to answer six more questions ( are you really surprised there are seven in total ? ) .
One of the questions of the survey is worth noting as it asks the participant what they are willing to do for the party .
As such , it 's clear what Microsoft will ask from party hosts :
Host a party on any day between October 22 through October 29th , featuring Windows 7 Ultimate Operating System
Invite at least 10 guests to join you
Use a free party website to plan your party , invite guests , upload photos , read and post to a party blog , etc .
Fill out an online survey after the party has happened
The second last step is to confirm a legal agreement , and then bam , you 'll get a confirmation e-mail .
You must then finalize the application by clicking a link .
Now the rest is up to Microsoft and all you have left to do is frequently check the status of your application .
Microsoft has not disclosed how many hosts it plans to pick , but the website does insist that " host spaces are very limited . "
If this is the type of party you want to host , then by all means , hurry up and apply !
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer will be kicking off the official Windows 7 launch at an event in New York City on October 22 , 2009 , the day of Windows 7's general availability .
It looks like Microsoft wants to turn what is normally a single launch day , into a launch week .
Since the beginning of 2009 , the media has been praising Windows 7 , and Redmond obviously wants to keep that momentum going strong .
Update
Tech Flash reports that the number of parties will be in the thousands as Microsoft employees and Microsoft partners will also be asked to throw their own Windows 7 shindigs between October 8 and October 12 .
Researchers from the University of Tokyo have created OLED displays that have all the durability of a super ball .

Suspended in a flexible matrix of carbon nanotubes and rubber , the new OLED displays can be stretched an additional 50 % of their normal size and wrapped around complex , 3D surfaces .
No , they are n't paper - thin like other prototypes we 've seen and the graphics are currently monochrome , but these OLEDs appear to be incredibly practical for everyday use .
Plus , the displays can be manufactured through an industrial printing process that should make the technology inexpensive to boot ... you know ... some day ... or never ... or tomorrow ... or something .

In the item posted earlier this morning regarding the case against Chargers linebacker Shawne Merriman , we mentioned the Marvin Harrison situation in Philly as proof of the reality that , sometimes , prosecutors opt not to pursue charges out of fear that a conviction ca n’t be obtained , even if prosecutors subjectively believe that a person is guilty of a crime .
The mention of the Harrison case caused me to make a mental note to check on the status of the most recent twist — the July 2009 shooting of the man who claimed that Harrison shot him in April 2008 .
Coincidentally , a reader has submitted a link to the newest development .
The man who was shot seven times on July 21 , Dwight Dixon , died on Friday .
Before slipping into a coma , Dixon reportedly told police that he believes Harrison was behind the shooting , apparently because Dixon had sued Harrison as a result of the April 2008 incident involving a gun owned by Harrison .
In late July , police served a search warrant at Harrison ’s aptly - named Playmakers bar in Philly .
The search was aimed at checking footage from surveillance cameras for images of the man who can be seen in separate surveillance video captured at the scene of the shooting .
Absent compelling evidence that either has not been uncovered or disclosed , it now appears that Harrison is in the clear as to both incidents .
Experiments with parallel genetic programming in Clojure
I ’ve been experimenting with genetic programming , learning Clojure as I go .
I came to the point where I wanted to make my program parallel .
First of all , I am amazed at how readable and concise the code turns out to be .
As an example , take a look at this function :
( defn choose - reproducing - parents [ individuals ] ( take 2 ( sort - by : fitness > ( select - randomly 5 individuals ) ) ) )
It does n’t get more readable than this !
But the real joy came when I started to parallelize my code .
Normally , the process would involve extra libraries , lots of fussing around with locks , and hours spent debugging deadlocks .
So let ’s look at an example function I needed to parallelize .
Generating random code takes quite a bit of CPU time , especially if one needs to generate code for thousands of individuals .
There is a function for that :
( defn create - random - individuals [ number code - generator ] ( map create - individual - from - code ( take number ( repeatedly code- generator ) ) ) )
And here ’s the reworked parallel version :
( defn create - random - individuals [ number code - generator ] ( pmap create - individual - from - code ( take number ( repeatedly code- generator ) ) ) )
Can you spot the difference ?
Yes , that ’s it .
The little letter ‘ p ’ is all it takes for the work to be spread among all of my CPU cores .
Other functions required more work ( again , notice how concise and readable the code is ) :
( defn produce - offspring [ population number ] ( take number ( repeatedly #( reproduce ( choose - reproducing - parents population ) ) ) ) )
For those unfamiliar with Clojure , repeatedly produces a lazy sequence whose elements are produced by the function ( in this case an anonymous function ) supplied as the argument .
take simply takes the first number elements of a sequence .
And now for the parallel version :
( defn produce - offspring [ population number ] ( pmap reproduce ( take number ( repeatedly #( choose - reproducing - parents population ) ) ) ) )
Encouraged by this , I then moved on to parallelize the most time - consuming step of all GP programs : fitness evaluations .
I ’ll spare you the boring details of extended parallelization work I did on the function ( but see examples above ) .
The result was :
( defn test - generation [ population fitness - function ] ( pmap #( set - fitness % ( fitness - function % ) ) population ) )
After fitness was evaluated for all individuals , the next generation was produced and the fitness evaluations were run in parallel again .
This worked fine , but I thought there should be a better way .
pmap limits me to a single multicore machine .
This is fine for now , but in the future I plan to move to a distributed cluster , where the synchronous nature of map would be limiting .
So I tried to write an asynchronous implementation .
First , I defined my pool : a collection where individuals are gathered once their fitness is evaluated :
( def pool ( agent ( vector ) ) )
The pool is a Clojure agent .
Agents are a synchronization primitive : you can send them actions ( functions ) , which will be queued and executed in order .
As you can see , the pool initially starts as an empty vector .
So how do individuals get to the pool ?
Their fitness needs to be evaluated , and then they need to be added to the pool .
It all starts with this function :
( defn run-individuals [ individuals ] ( dorun ( map #( send % test - individual * fitness - function * ) ( map #( add - watcher ( agent % ) : send pool fitness - tested ) individuals ) ) ) )
First , we make each individual an agent , so that we can add a watcher to it .
Watchers are a cool Clojure feature — they let you watch for state changes .
Using add - watcher we add a watcher to each individual , telling it to send a fitness - tested action to the pool ( which is also an agent , remember ? ) .
Then , once we ’ve set up watching for state changes , we send a test - individual action to each individual , giving it the fitness function as a parameter .
test - individual is a really simple function , all it does is call the fitness evaluation function and return the new state of the individual .
The dorun is necessary , because we ’re dealing with lazy sequences and discarding the result ( sending agent actions is a side effect ) .
If the dorun was n’t there , the entire sequence would never get evaluated and actions would never get sent .
Let ’s see what happens once the pool is notified of a state change in an individual :
( defn fitness - tested [ watched - population individual ] ( let [ population ( conj watched - population @individual ) ] ( if ( >= ( count population ) target - population - size ) ( let [ new - population ( prune - population population ) ] ( run-individuals ( produce - offspring new - population (- target - population - size ( count new - population ) ) ) ) new - population ) population ) ) )
First , we add the new individual to the pool .
If we have n’t gathered enough individuals , we simply return the pool with the individual added — this updates the global pool .
The fun part begins when we have enough individuals to produce the next generation .
Then , we prune the population , deleting the poorest individuals and produce a new batch of individuals , letting them go using the previously described run-individuals .
If you ’ve done any parallel programming , you ’ll probably worry about multiple threads modifying ( pruning ) the population simultaneously .
Not to worry —
Clojure agents are monitors , you are guaranteed that only one action will execute at a time .
We now have a fully asynchronous parallel GP implementation .
Notice how there are n’t any queues , locks , thread pools to manage .
All we have is a single global variable and a couple of simple functions .
We do n’t need any new data structures !
The beauty of this solution is that because we ’re using agents and watchers , Clojure does the queueing for us .
Look , ma , no queues !
I am very happy with how easy and clean this solution turned out to be .
I can now see why people keep raving about Clojure .
Somebody finally did some serious thinking and implemented a new approach to parallel programming , not just a rehash of old ideas .
In less than an hour I went from a sequential implementation to a parallel asynchronous one .
I ’d say that ’s impressive .
And most importantly , the same code still runs on a single - cpu machine , with minimal performance impact .
I am very impressed .
David Sycamore was killed on the cathedral steps in November A man shot dead by police at Guildford Cathedral was unhappy and may have wanted to die , an inquest heard .
David Sycamore , 39 , who had manic depression , was shot in the chest and arm on 30 November 2008 .
Police were called after he told a member of the public he was going to " start shooting people " , but the gun fired only blanks .
His ex-girlfriend said he told her he was unhappy at home and at work .
The inquest is expected to last four days .
Mr Sycamore was seen to pull out a gun , thought to be a handgun , on the steps of the cathedral , the jury was told .
' On purpose '
The administrative assistant , who lived with his parents near the cathedral , was shot by two Surrey Police officers as he sat on the steps .
It was not discovered until his death that the 8 mm gun could only fire blanks .
Coroner Michael Burgess said a police officer visiting Mr Sycamore 's parents ' home after his death recalled his mother saying : " He 's done it on purpose .
He had been saying he was going to get himself shot . "
He was always telling me he did n't want to live any more and he wanted to die .
He was n't happy
Claire Hamilton , David Sycamore 's ex-girlfriend Mr Sycamore 's brother Mark said he could not remember that conversation , only that his mother had broken down in tears after being told her son was dead .
Mr Sycamore was taking anti-depressants and made an attempt to take his life 17 years previously , the inquest heard .
He had also told an ex-girlfriend shortly before his death that he wanted to die .
His former girlfriend Claire Hamilton described how he made a series of phone calls to her shortly before his death , saying he was unhappy in work and at home .
She said : " He said it so many times to me .
I did n't think he was going to do anything silly .
" He was always telling me he did n't want to live any more and he wanted to die .
He was n't happy . "
The inquest , at Surrey Coroner 's Court in Woking , is continuing .

by John Laughland by John Laughland Recently by John Laughland : Solzhenitsyn and the Russian Question
In recent years , a number of " revolutions " have broken out all over the world .
1. Georgia
In November 2003 , the president of Georgia Edward Shevardnadze was overthrown following demonstrations , marches and allegations that the parliamentary elections had been rigged .
2. Ukraine
In November 2004 , the " Orange Revolution " of demonstrations started in Ukraine as the same allegations were made , that elections had been rigged .
The result was that country was ripped away from its previous geopolitical role as a bridge between East and West , and put it on the path to becoming a fully - fledged member of NATO and the EU .
Considering that Kievan Rus is the first Russian state , and that Ukraine has now been turned against Russia , this is a historic achievement .
But then , as George Bush said , " You are either with us or against us . "
Although Ukraine had sent troops to Iraq , it was evidently considered too friendly to Moscow .
3. Lebanon
Shortly after the US and the UN declared that Syrian troops had to be removed from Lebanon , and following the assassination of Rafik Hariri , demonstrations in Beirut were presented as " the Cedar Revolution . "
An enormous counter - demonstration by Hezbollah , which is the largest political party in Syria , was effectively ignored while the TV replayed endlessly the image of the anti-Syrian crowd .
In one particularly egregious case of Orwellian double - think , the BBC explained to its viewers that " Hezbollah , the biggest political party in Lebanon , is so far the only dissenting voice which wants the Syrians to stay . "
How can the majority be " a dissenting voice " ?
4. Kyrgyzstan
After the " revolutions " in Georgia and Ukraine , many predicted that the same wave of " revolutions " would extend to the former Soviet states of Central Asia .
So it was to be .
Commentators seemed divided on what colour to label the uprising in Bishkek  was it a " lemon " revolution or a " tulip " revolution ?
They could not make up their minds .
But on one thing , everyone was in agreement : revolutions are cool , even when they are violent .
The Kyrgyz president , Askar Akayev , was overthrown on 24th March 2005 and protesters stormed and ransacked the presidential palace .
5. Uzbekistan
When armed rebels seized government buildings , sprung prisoners from gaol and took hostages on the night of 12th 13th May in the Uzbek city of Andijan ( located in the Ferghana Valley , where the unrest had also started in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan ) the police and army surrounded the rebels and a long standoff ensued .
Negotiations were undertaken with the rebels , who kept increasing their demands .
When government forces started to move on the rebels , the resulting fighting killed some 160 people including over 30 members of the police and army .
Yet the Western media immediately misrepresented this violent confrontation , claiming that government forces had opened fire on unarmed protesters  " the people . "
This constantly repeated myth of popular rebellion against a dictatorial government is popular on both the Left and the Right of the political spectrum .
Previously , the myth of revolution was obviously the preserve of the Left .
But when the violent putsch occurred in Kygyrzstan , The Times enthused about how the scenes in Bishkek reminded him of Eisenstein films about the Bolshevik revolution , The Daily Telegraph extolled the " power to the people , " and the Financial Times used a well - known Maoist metaphor when it praised Kyrgyzstans " long march to freedom . "
One of the key elements behind this myth is obviously that " the people " are behind the events , and that they are spontaneous .
In fact , of course , they are often very highly organised operations , often deliberately staged for the media , and usually funded and controlled by transnational networks of so - called non-governmental organisations which are in turn instruments of Western power .
1 . The literature on coups détat
The survival of the myth of spontaneous popular revolution is depressing in view of the ample literature on the coup détat , and on the main factors and tactics by which to bring one about .
It was , of course , Lenin who developed the organisational structure for overthrowing a regime which we now know as a political party .
He differed from Marx in that he did not think that historical change was the result of ineluctable anonymous forces , but that it had to be worked for .
But it was probably Curzio Malapartes Technique of a Coup détat which first gave very famous expression to these ideas .
Published in 1931 , this book presents regime change as just that  a technique .
Malaparte explicitly took issue with those who thought that regime change happened on its own .
In fact , he starts the book by recounting a discussion between diplomats in Warsaw in the summer of 1920 : Poland had been invaded by Trostkys Red Army ( Poland having itself invaded the Soviet Union , capturing Kiev in April 1920 ) and the Bolsheviks were at the gates of Warsaw .
The debate was between the British minister in Warsaw , Sir Horace Rumbold , and the Papal nuncio , Monsignor Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti  the man who was elected Pope as Pius XI two years later .
The Englishman said that the internal political situation in Poland was so chaotic that a revolution was inevitable , and that the diplomatic corps therefore should flee the capital and go to Posen ( Poznán ) .
The Papal Nuncio disagreed , insisting that a revolution was just as possible in a civilised country like England , Holland or Switzerland as in a country in a state of anarchy .
Naturally the Englishman was outraged at the idea that a revolution could ever break out in England .
" Oh never ! " he exclaimed  and was proved wrong because no revolution did break out in Poland , according to Malaparte because the revolutionary forces were simply not well organised enough .
This anecdote allows Malaparte to discuss the differences between Lenin and Trotsky , two practitioners of the coup détat / revolution .
Malaparte shows that the future Pope was right and that it was wrong to say that pre-conditions were necessary for a revolution to occur .
For Malaparte , as for Trotsky , regime change could be promoted in any country , including the stable democracies of Western Europe , providing that there was a sufficiently determined body of men determined to achieve it .
2. Manufacturing consent
This brings us onto a second body of literature , concerning the manipulation of the media .
Malaparte himself does not discuss this aspect but it is ( a ) of huge importance and ( b ) clearly a subset of the technique of a coup détat in the way regime change is practised today .
So important , indeed , is the control of the media during regime change that one of the main characteristics of these revolutions is the creation of a virtual reality .
Control of this reality is itself an instrument of power , which is why in classic coups in a banana republic the first thing that the revolutionaries seize is the radio station .
People experience a strong psychological reluctance to accept that political events today are deliberately manipulated .
This reluctance is itself a product of the ideology of the information age , which flatters peoples vanity and encourages them to believe that they have access to huge amounts of information .
In fact , the apparent multifarious nature of modern media information hides an extreme paucity of original sources , rather as a street of restaurants on a Greek waterfront can hide the reality of a single kitchen at the back .
News reports of major events very often come from a single source , usually a wire agency , and even authoritative news outlets like the BBC simply recycle information which they have received from these agencies , presenting it as their own .
BBC correspondents are often sitting in their hotel rooms when they send despatches , very often simply reading back to the studio in London information they have been given by their colleagues back home off the wire .
A second factor which explains the reluctance to believe in media manipulation is connected with the feeling of omniscience which the mass media age likes to flatter : to rubbish news reports as manipulated is to tell people that they are gullible , and this is not a pleasant message to receive .
There are many elements to media manipulation .
One of the most important is political iconography .
This is a very important instrument for promoting the legitimacy of regimes which have seized power through revolution .
One only need think of such iconic events as the storming of the Bastille on 14th July 1789 , the storming of the Winter Palace during the October revolution in 1917 , or Mussolinis March on Rome in 1922 , to see that events can be elevated into almost eternal sources of legitimacy .
However , the importance of political imagery goes far beyond the invention of a simple emblem for each revolution .
It involves a far deeper control of the media , and generally this control needs to be exercised over a long period of time , not just at the moment of regime change itself .
It is essential indeed , for the official party line to be repeated ad nauseam .
A feature of todays mass media culture which many dissidents lazily and wrongly denounce as " totalitarian " is precisely that dissenting views may be expressed and published , but this is precisely because , being mere drops in the ocean , they are never a threat to the tide of propaganda .
2a . Willi Münzenberg
One of the modern masters of such media control was the German Communist from whom Joseph Goebbels learned his trade , Willi Münzenberg .
Münzenberg was not only the inventor of spin , he was also the first person who perfected the art of creating a network of opinion - forming journalists who propagated views which were germane to the needs of the Communist Party in Germany and to the Soviet Union .
He also made a huge fortune in the process , since he amassed a considerable media empire from which he creamed off the profits .
Münzenberg was intimately involved with the Communist project from the very beginning .
He belonged to Lenins circle in Zurich , and in 1917 accompanied the future leader of the Bolshevik revolution to the Zurich Hauptbahnhof , from whence Lenin was transported in a sealed train , and with the help of the German imperial authorities , to the Finland Station in St. Petersburg .
Lenin then called on Münzenberg to combat the appalling publicity generated in 1921 when 25 million peasants in the Volga region started to suffer from the famine which swept across the newly created Soviet state .
Münzenberg , who had by then returned to Berlin , where he was later elected to the Reichstag as a Communist deputy , was charged with setting up a bogus workers  charity , the Foreign Committee for the Organisation of Worker Relief for the Hungry in Soviet Russia , whose purpose was to pretend to the world that humanitarian relief was coming from sources other than Herbert Hoovers American Relief Administration .
Lenin feared not only that Hoover would use his humanitarian aid project to send spies into the USSR ( which he did ) but also , perhaps even more importantly , that the worlds first Communist state would be fatally damaged by the negative publicity of seeing capitalist America come to its aid within a few years of the revolution .
After having cut his teeth on " selling " the death of millions of people at the hands of the Bolsheviks , Münzenberg turned his attention to more general propaganda activities .
He amassed a large media empire , known as " the Münzenberg trust , " which owned two mass circulation dailies in Germany , a mass circulation weekly , and which had interests in scores of other publications around the world .
His greatest coups were to mobilise world opinion against America over the Sacco - Vanzetti trial ( that of two anarchist Italian immigrants who were sentenced to death for murder in Massachusetts in 1921 ) and to counteract the Nazis claim in 1933 that the Reichstag fire was the result of a Communist conspiracy .
The Nazis , it will be remembered , used the fire to justify mass arrests and executions against Communists , even though it now appears that the fire genuinely was started on his own by the man arrested in the building at the time , the lone arsonist Martinus van der Lubbe .
Münzenberg actually managed to convince large sections of public opinion of the equal but opposite untruth to that peddled by the Nazis , namely that the Nazis had started the fire themselves in order to have a pretext for removing their main enemies .
The key relevance of Münzenberg for our own day is this : he understood the key importance of influencing opinion - formers .
He targeted especially intellectuals , taking the view that intellectuals were especially easy to influence because they were so vain .
His contacts included many of the great literary figures of the 1930s , a large number of whom were encouraged by him to support the Republicans in the Spanish civil war and to make that into a cause - célèbre of Communist anti-fascism .
Münzenbergs tactics are of primary importance to the manipulation of opinion in todays New World Order .
More then ever before , so - called " experts " constantly pop up on our TV screens to explain what is happening , and they are always vehicles for the official party line .
They are controlled in various ways , usually by money or by flattery .
2b . Psychology and the manipulation of opinion
There is a second body of literature , which makes a slightly different point from the specific technique which Münzenberg perfected .
This concerns the way in which people can be made to react in certain collective ways by psychological stimuli .
Perhaps the first major theoretician of this was Sigmund Freuds nephew , Edward Bernays , whose book Propaganda in 1928 said that it was entirely natural and right for governments to organise public opinion for political purposes .
The opening chapter of his book has the revealing title  " Organising chaos "  and Bernays writes ,
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organised opinions and habits of the masses is an important element in democratic society .
Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country .
[ my italics ]
( The text continues : " We are governed , our minds are moulded , our tastes formed , our ideas suggested , largely by men we have never heard of .
This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized .
Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society .
…
In almost every act of our daily lives , whether in the sphere of politics or business , in our social conduct or our ethical thinking , we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons … who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses .
It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind . " )
Bernays says that , very often , the members of this invisible government do not even know who the other members are .
Propaganda , he says , is the only way to prevent public opinion descending into dissonant chaos .
Bernays continued to work on this theme after the war , editing " Engineering consent " in 1955 , a title to which Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky alluded when they published their seminal Manufacturing Consent in 1988 .
The connection with Freud is important because , as we shall see later , psychology is an extremely important tool in influencing public opinion .
Two of the contributors to " Engineering consent " make the point that every leader must play on basic human emotions in order to manipulate public opinion .
For instance , Doris E. Fleischmann and Howard Walden Cutler write ,
Self - preservation , ambition , pride , hunger , love of family and children , patriotism , imitativeness , the desire to be a leader , love of play  these and other drives are the psychological raw materials which every leader must take into account in his endeavour to win the public to his point of view
To maintain their self - assurance , most people need to feel certain that whatever they believe about anything is true .
This was what Willi Münzenberg understood  the basic human urge for people to believe what they want to believe .
Thomas Mann alluded to it when he attributed the rise of Hitler to the collective desire of the German people for " a fairy tale " over the ugly truths of reality .
Other books worth mentioning in this regard concern not so much modern electronic propaganda but the more general psychology of crowds .
The classics in this regard are Gustave Le Bons work The Psychology of Crowds ( 1895 ) , Elias Canettis Crowds and Power ( Masse und Macht ) ( 1980 ) ; and Serge Tchakhotines
Le viol des foules par la propagande politique ( 1939 ) .
All these books draw heavily on psychology and anthropology .
There is also the magnificent oeuvre of one of my favourite writers , the anthropologist René Girard , whose writings on the logic of imitation ( mimesis ) , and on collective acts of violence , are excellent tools for understanding why it is that public opinion is so easily motivated to support war and other forms of political violence .
2 c . The technique of opinion - forming
After the war , many of the techniques perfected by the Communist Münzenberg were adopted by the Americans , as has been magnificently documented by Frances Stonor Saunders  excellent work , Who Paid the Piper ? , published in America under the title The Cultural Cold War .
In minute detail , Stonor Saunders explains how , as the Cold War started , the Americans and the British started up a massive covert operation to fund anti-communist intellectuals .
The key point is that much of their attention and activity was directed at left - wingers , in many cases Trotskyites who had abandoned their support for the Soviet Union only in 1939 , when Stalin signed his non-aggression pact with Hitler , and in many cases people who had previously worked for Münzenberg .
Many of the figures who were at this juncture between Communism and the CIA at the beginning of the cold war were future neo-conservatives luminaries , especially Irving Kristol , James Burnham , Sidney Hook and Lionel Trilling .
The left - wing and even Trotskyite origins of neo-conservatism are well - known  even if I still continue to be astonished by new details I discover , such as that Lionel and Diana Trilling were married by a rabbi for whom Felix Dzherzhinsky  the founder of the Bolshevik secret police , the Cheka ( forerunner of the KGB ) , and the Communist equivalent of Heinrich Himmler  represented a heroic paragon .
These left - wing origins are particularly relevant to the covert operations discussed by Stonor Saunders , because the CIAs goal was precisely to influence left - wing opponents of Communism , i.e. Trotskyites .
The CIAs view was simply that right - wing anti-communists did not need to be influenced , much less paid .
Stonor Saunders quotes Michael Warner when she writes ,
For the CIA , the strategy of promoting the Non-Communist Left was to become " the theoretical foundation of the Agencys political operations against Communism over the next two decades . "
This strategy was outlined in Arthur Schlesingers The Vital Center ( 1949 ) , a book which represents one of the cornerstones of what was later to become the neo-conservative movement .
Stonor Saunders writes ,
The purpose of supporting leftist groups was not to destroy or even dominate , but rather to maintain a discreet proximity to and monitor the thinking of such groups ; to provide them with a mouthpiece so that they could blow off steam ; and , in extremis , to exercise a final veto over their actions , if they ever got too " radical . "
Many and varied were the ways in which this left - wing influence was felt .
The USA was determined to fashion for itself a progressive image , in contrast to the " reactionary " Soviet Union .
In other words , it wanted to do precisely what the Soviets were doing .
In music , for instance , Nicholas Nabokov ( the cousin of the author of Lolita ) was one of the Congress main agents .
In 1954 , the CIA funded a music festival in Rome in which Stalins " authoritarian " love of composers like Rimsky - Korsakov and Tchaikovsky was " countered " by unorthodox modern music inspired by Schoenbergs twelve - tone system .
For Nabokov , there was a clear political message to be imparted by promoting music which announced itself as doing away with natural hierarchies
Support for other progressives came when Jackson Pollock , himself a former Communist , was also promoted by the CIA .
His daubs were supposed to represent the American ideology of " freedom " over the authoritarianism of socialist realist painting .
( This alliance with Communists pre-dates the Cold War : the Mexican Communist muralist , Diego Rivera , was supported by Abby Aldrich Rockefeller , but their collaboration ended abruptly when Rivera refused to remove a portrait of Lenin from a crowd scene painted on the walls of the Rockefeller Center in 1933 . )
This cross-over between culture and politics was explicitly promoted by a CIA body which went under an Orwellian name , the Psychological Strategy Board .
In 1956 , it covertly promoted a European tour by the Metropolitan Opera , the political purpose of which was to encourage multiculturalism .
Junkie Fleischmann , the organiser , said ,
We , in the United States , are a melting - pot and , by being so , we have demonstrated that peoples can get along together irrespective of race , colour or creed .
Using the " melting - pot " or some such catch phrase for a theme we might be able to use the Met as an example of how Europeans can get along together in the United States and that , therefore , some sort of European Federation is entirely practicable .
This , by the way , is exactly the same argument employed by , among other people , Ben Wattenberg , whose book The First Universal Nation argues that America has a special right to world hegemony because she embodies all the nations and races of the planet .
The same view has also been expressed by Newt Gingrich and other neo-cons .
Other themes promoted include some which are at the forefront of neo -conservative thinking today .
First among these is the eminently liberal belief in moral and political universalism .
Today , this is at the very heart of George W. Bushs own foreign policy philosophy : he has stated on numerous occasions that political values are the same all over the world , and he has used this assumption to justify US military intervention in favour of " democracy . "
Back in the early 1950s , the director of the PSB ( the Psychological Strategy Board was quickly referred to only by its initials , no doubt in order to hide its real name ) , Raymond Allen , had already arrived at this conclusion .
The principles and ideals embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are for export and are the heritage of men everywhere .
We should appeal to the fundamental urges of all men which I believe are the same for the farmer in Kansas as for the farmer in Punjab .
To be sure , it would be wrong to attribute the spread of ideas only to covert manipulation .
They have their force in large - scale cultural currents , whose causes are multiple .
But there is no doubt that the dominance of such ideas can be substantially facilitated by covert operations , especially since people in mass - information societies are curiously suggestible .
Not only do they believe what they have read in the papers , they also think they have arrived at these conclusions themselves .
The trick of manipulating public opinion , therefore , lies precisely in that which Bernays theorised , Münzenberg initiated , and which the CIA raised to a high art .
According to CIA agent Donald Jameson ,
As far as the attitudes that the Agency wanted to inspire through these activities are concerned , clearly what they would like to have been able to produce were people who , of their own reasoning and conviction , were persuaded that everything the United States government did was right .
To put it another way , what the CIA and other US agencies were doing during this period was to adopt the strategy which we associate with the Italian Marxist , Antonio Gramsci , who argued that " cultural hegemony " was essential for socialist revolution .
2d. Disinformation
Finally , there is a huge body of literature on the technique of disinformation .
I have already referred to the important fact , originally formulated by Tchakotine ( Chakotin ) , that the role of journalists and the media is key in ensuring that propaganda is constant : " Propaganda can not take time off , " he writes , thereby formulating one of the key rules of modern disinformation , which is that the required message must be repeated very frequently indeed if it is to pass .
Above all , Tchakotine ( Chakotin ) says that propaganda campaigns must be centrally directed and highly organised , something which has become the norm in the age of modern political " spin " : British Labour Members of Parliament , for instance , are not allowed to speak to the media without first asking permission from the Director of Communications in 10 , Downing Street .
Sefton Delmer was both a practician and theoretician of such " black propaganda . "
Delmer created a bogus radio station which broadcasted from Britain to Germany during the Second World War , and which created the myth that there were " good " patriotic Germans who opposed Hitler .
The fiction was sustained that the station was actually an underground German one , and was put on frequencies close to those of official stations .
Such black propaganda has now become part of the US governments armoury of spin : the New York Times revealed that the US government makes news reports favourable to its policies which are then carried on normal channels and presented as if they were the broadcast companys own reports .
There are many other such authors , some of whom I have discussed in my column , All News is Lies .
But perhaps the most relevant to todays discussion is Roger Mucchiellis book , Subversion , published in French in 1971 , which shows how disinformation had moved from being an auxiliary tactic in war to a principal one .
The strategy had developed so far , he said , that the goal was now to conquer a state without even attacking physically , especially through the use of agents of influence inside it .
This is essentially what Robert Kaplan proposed and discussed in his essay for The Atlantic Monthly in July / August 2003 , " Supremacy by Stealth . "
One of the most sinister theoreticians of the New World Order and the American empire , Robert Kaplan , explicitly advocates the use of immoral and illegal power to promote US control of the whole world .
His essay deals with the use of covert operations , military power , dirty tricks , black propaganda , hidden influence and control , opinion - forming and other things like political assassination , all subject to his overall call for " a pagan ethic , " as the means to ensuring American domination .
The other key point about Mucchielli is that he was one of the first theoreticians of the use of bogus non-governmental organisations  or " front organisations " as they used to be known  for effecting internal political change in another state .
Like Malaparte and Trotsky , Mucchielli also understood that it was not " objective " circumstances which determined the success or failure of a revolution , but instead the perception created of those circumstances by disinformation .
He also understood that historical revolutions , which invariably presented themselves as the product of mass movements , were in fact the work of a tiny number of highly organised conspirators .
In fact , again like Trotsky , Mucchielli emphasised that the silent majority must be rigorously excluded from the mechanics of political change , precisely because coups détat are the work of the few and not the many .
Public opinion was the " forum " in which subversion was practised , and Mucchielli showed the different ways in which the mass media could be used to create a collective psychosis .
Psychological factors were extremely important in this regard , he said , especially in the pursuit of important strategies such as the demoralisation of a society .
The enemy must be made to lose confidence in the rightness of his own cause , while all effort must be made to convince him that his adversary is invincible .
2e .
The role of the military
One final historical point before we move onto a discussion of the present : the role of the military in conducting covert operations and influencing political change .
This is something which some contemporary analysts are happy to admit is deployed today : Robert Kaplan writes approvingly of how the American military is and should be used to " promote democracy . "
Kaplan says deliciously that a phone call from a US general is often a better way of promoting political change in a third country than a phone call from the local US ambassador .
And he approvingly quotes an Army Special Operations officer saying , " Whoever the President of Kenya is , the same group of guys run their special forces and the President ’s bodyguards .
We ’ve trained them .
That translates into diplomatic leverage . "
The historical background to this has recently been discussed by a Swiss academic , Daniele Glaser , in his book , Natos Secret Army .
His account begins with the admission made on 3rd August 1990 by Giulio Andreotti , the then Italian Prime Minister , that a secret army had existed in his country since the end of the Second World War , known as " Gladio " ; that it had been created by the CIA and MI6 ; and that it was coordinated by the unorthodox warfare section of NATO .
He thereby confirmed one of the most long - running rumours in post - war Italy .
Many people , including investigating magistrates , had long suspected that Gladio was not only party of a network of secret armies created by the Americans across Western Europe to fight in the resistance to a putative Soviet occupation , but also that these networks had become involved in influencing the outcome of elections , even to the extent of forming sinister alliances with terrorist organisations .
Italy was a particular target because the Communist Party was so strong there .
Originally , this secret army was constructed with the aim of providing for the eventuality of an invasion .
But it seems that they soon moved to covert operations aimed at influencing the political process itself , in the absence of an invasion .
There is ample evidence that the Americans did indeed interfere massively , especially in Italian elections , in order to prevent the PCI from ever winning power .
Tens of billions of dollars were funded to the Italian Christian Democrats by the US for this very reason .
Glaser even argues that there is evidence that Gladio cells carried out terrorist attacks in order to blame Communists , and to frighten the population into demanding extra state powers to " protect " them from terrorism .
Ganser quotes the man convicted of planting one of these bombs , Vincenzo Vinciguerra , who duly explained the nature of the network of which he was a foot soldier .
He said that it was part of a strategy " to destabilise in order to stabilise . "
You had to attack civilians , the people , women , children , innocent people , unknown people far removed from any political game .
The reason was quite simple .
They were supposed to force these people , the Italian public , to turn to the state to ask for greater security .
This is the political logic which remains behind all the massacres and the bombings which remain unpunished , because the state cannot convict itself or declare itself responsible for what happened .
There is an obvious relevance to the conspiracy theories swirling around 9/11 .
Ganser presents a host of good evidence that this is indeed what Gladio did , and his arguments shed light on the intriguing possibility that there might also have been an alliance with extreme left - wing groups like the Red Brigades .
After all , when Aldo Moro was kidnapped , shortly after which he was assassinated , he was physically on the way to the Italian parliament to present a programme for a coalition government between the Socialists and the Communists  precisely the thing the Americans were determined to prevent .
3. Todays revolutionary tacticians
These historical works help us to understand what is going on today .
My colleagues and I from the British Helsinki Human Rights Group have personally witnessed how the same techniques are used today .
The main tactics were perfected in Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s .
Indeed , many of the operatives of regime change under Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr. have happily plied their trade in the former Soviet bloc under Bill Clinton and George Bush Jr. For instance , General Manuel Noriega reports in his memoirs that the two CIA - State Department operatives who were sent to negotiate and then engineer his downfall from power in Panama in 1989 were called William Walker and Michael Kozak : William Walker resurfaced in Kosovo in January 1999 when , as head of the Kosovo Verification Mission , he oversaw the artificial creation of a bogus atrocity which proved to be the casus belli for the Kosovo war , while Michael Kozak became US ambassador to Belarus , where in 2001 he mounted " Operation White Stork " designed to overthrow the incumbent president , Alexander Lukashenko .
During an exchange of letters to The Guardian in 2001 , Kozak brazenly admitted that he was doing in Belarus exactly what he had been doing in Nicaragua and Panama , namely " promoting democracy . "
There are essentially three branches to the modern technique of a coup détat .
They are non-governmental organisations , control of the media , and covert operatives .
Their activities are effectively interchangeable so I will not deal with them separately .
3a. Serbia 2000
The overthrow of Slobodan Miloevic was obviously not the first time the West used covert influence to effect regime change .
The overthrow of Sali Berisha in Albania in 1997 and of Vladimir Meciar in Slovakia in 1998 were heavily influenced by the West and , in the case of Berisha , an extremely violent uprising was presented as a spontaneous and welcome example of people power .
I personally observed how the international community , and especially the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , fiddled its election observation results in order to ensure political change .
However , the overthrow of Slobodan Miloevic in Belgrade on 5th October 2000 is important because he is such a well - known figure , and because the " revolution " which unseated him involved a very ostentatious use of " people power . "
The background to the putsch against Miloevic has been brilliantly described by Tim Marshall , a reporter for Sky TV .
His account is valuable because he writes approvingly of the events he describes ; it is also interesting because this journalist boasts of his extensive contacts with the secret services , especially those of Britain and America .
At every turn , Marshall seems to know who the main intelligence players are .
His account is thick with references to " an MI6 officer in Pritina , " " sources in Yugoslav military intelligence , " " a CIA man who was helping to put together the coup , " an " officer in US naval intelligence , " and so on .
He quotes secret surveillance reports from the Serbian secret police ; he knows who the Ministry of Defence desk officer is in London who draws up the strategy for getting rid of Miloevic ; he knows that the British Foreign Secretarys telephone conversations are being listened to ; he knows who are the Russian intelligence officers who accompany Yevgeni Primakov , the Russian prime minister , to Belgrade during the Nato bombing ; he knows which rooms are bugged in the British embassy , and where the Yugoslav spies are who listen in to the diplomats  conversations ; he knows that a staffer on the US House of Representatives International Relations Committee is , in fact , an officer in US naval intelligence ; he seems to know that secret service decisions are often taken with the very minimal ministerial approval ; he describes how the CIA physically escorted the KLA delegation from Kosovo to Paris for the pre-war talks at Rambouillet , where Nato issued Yugoslavia with an ultimatum it knew it could only reject ; and he refers to " a British journalist " acting as a go - between between London and Belgrade for hugely important high - level secret negotiations , as people sought to betray one another as Miloevics power collapsed .
( My suspicion is that he may be talking about himself at this point . )
One of the themes which inadvertently runs through his book is that there is a thin dividing line between journalists and spooks .
Early on in the book , Marshall refers casually to " the inevitable connections between officers , journalists and politicians , " saying that people in all three categories " work in the same area . "
He then goes on jokingly to say that " a combination of spooks ,  journos  and politicos , added to  the people  " were what had caused the overthrow of Slobodan Miloevic .
Marshall clings to the myth that " the people " were involved , but the rest of his book shows that in fact the overthrow of the Yugoslav president occurred only because of political strategies deliberately conceived in London and Washington to get rid of him .
Above all , Marshall makes it clear that , in 1998 , the US State Department and intelligence agencies decided to use the Kosovo Liberation Army to get rid of Slobodan Miloevic .
He quotes one source saying , " The US agenda was clear .
When the time was right they were going to use the KLA to provide the solution to the political problem "  the " problem " being , as Marshall explains earlier , Miloevics continued political survival .
This meant supporting the KLAs terrorist secessionism , and later fighting a war against Yugoslavia on its side .
Marshall quotes Mark Kirk , a US naval intelligence officer , saying that , " Eventually we opened up a huge operation against Miloevic , both secret and open . "
The secret part of the operation involved not only things like stuffing the various observer missions which were sent into Kosovo with officers from the British and American intelligence services , but also  crucially  giving military , technical , financial , logistical and political support to the KLA , which , as Marshall himself admits , " smuggled drugs , ran prostitution rackets and murdered civilians . "
The strategy began in late 1998 when " a huge CIA mission ( got ) underway in Kosovo . "
President Miloevic had allowed the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission to enter Kosovo to monitor the situation in the province .
This ad hoc group was immediately stuffed with British and American intelligence agents and special forces  men from the CIA , US naval intelligence , the British SAS and something called " 14th intelligence , " a body within the British army which operates side by side with the SAS " to provide what is known as deep surveillance . "
The immediate purpose of this operation was " Intelligence Preparation of Battlefield "  a modern version of what the Duke of Wellington used to do , riding up and down the battlefield to get the lie of the land before engaging the enemy .
So as Marshall puts it , " Officially , the KDOM was run by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe unofficially , the CIA ran ( it ) The organisation was just packed with them It was a CIA front . "
Many of the officers in fact worked for another CIA front , DynCorp , the Virginia - based company which employs mainly " members of US military elite units , or the CIA , " as Marshall says .
They used the KDOM , which later became the Kosovo Verification Mission , for espionage .
Instead of doing the monitoring tasks assigned to them , officers would go off and use their global positioning devices to locate and identify targets which would be later bombed by Nato .
Quite how the Yugoslavs could allow 2,000 highly trained secret service agents to roam around their territory is difficult to understand , especially since , as Marshall shows , they knew perfectly well what was going on .
The head of the Kosovo Verification Mission was William Walker , the man deputed to oust Manuel Noriega from power in Panama , and a former ambassador to El Salvador whose US - supported government ran death squads .
Walker " discovered " the " massacre " at Racak in January 1999 , the event which was used as a pretext for starting the process which led to the bombing which began on 24th March .
There is much evidence to suggest that Racak was staged , and that the bodies found were in fact those of KLA fighters , not civilians as was alleged .
What is certain is that Walkers role was so key that the country road in Kosovo which leads to Racak has now been renamed after him .
Marshall writes that the date for the war  spring 1999  was not only decided in late December 1998 , but also that the date was communicated to the KLA at the time .
This means that when the " massacre " occurred and when Madeleine Albright declared , " Spring has come early , " she was behaving rather like Joseph Goebbels who , on hearing the news of the Reichstag fire in 1933 , is supposed to have remarked , " What , already ? "
At any rate , when the KVM was withdrawn on the eve of the Nato bombing , Marshall says that the CIA officers in it gave all their satellite phones and GPS equipment to the KLA .
" The KLA were being trained by the Americans , partially equipped by them , and virtually given territory , " Marshall writes  even though he , like all other reporters , helped propagate the myth of systematic Serb atrocities committed against a totally passive Albanian civilian population .
The war went ahead , of course , and Yugoslavia was ferociously bombed .
But Miloevic stayed in power .
So London and Washington started what Marshall happily calls " political warfare " to remove him .
This involved giving very large sums of money , as well as technical , logistical and strategic support , and including arms , to various " democratic opposition " groups and " non-governmental organisations " in Serbia .
The Americans were by then operating principally through the International Republican Institute , which had opened offices in neighbouring Hungary for the purpose of getting rid of Slobodan Miloevic .
" It was agreed " at one of their meetings , Marshall explains , " that the ideological arguments of pro-democracy , civil rights and a humanitarian approach would be far more forceful if accompanied , if necessary , by large bags full of money . "
These , and much else besides , were duly shipped into Serbia through the diplomatic bags  in many cases of apparently neutral countries like Sweden who , by not participating formally in the NATO war , were able to maintain full embassies in Belgrade .
As Marshall helpfully adds , " Bags of money had been brought in for years . "
Indeed they had .
As he earlier explains , " independent " media outlets like the Radio Station B92 ( who is Marshalls own publisher ) were , in fact , very largely funded by the USA .
Organisations controlled by George Soros also played a crucial role , as they were later to do , in 2003 4 , in Georgia .
The so - called " democrats " were , in reality , nothing but foreign agents  just as the Yugoslav government stolidly maintained at the time .
Marshall also explains something which is now a matter of public record that it was also the Americans who conceived the strategy of pushing forward one candidate , Vojislav Kotunica , to unite the opposition .
Kotunica had the main advantage of being largely unknown by the general public .
Marshall then describes how the strategy also involved a carefully planned coup détat , which duly took place after the first round of the presidential elections .
He shows in minute detail how the principal actors in what was presented on Western TV screens as a spontaneous uprising of " the people " were , in fact , a bunch of extremely violent and very heavily armed thugs under the command of the Mayor of the town of Cacak , Velimir Ilic .
It was Ilics 22 kilometre - long convoy carrying " weapons , paratroopers and a team of kick boxers " to the federal parliament building in Belgrade .
As Marshall admits , the events of 5th October 2000 " looked more like a coup détat " than the peoples revolution of which the worlds media so navely gushed at the time .
3b. Georgia 2003
Many of the tactics perfected in Belgrade were used in Georgia in November 2003 to overthrow President Edward Shevardadze .
The same allegations were made , and repeated ad nauseam , that the elections had been rigged .
( In the Georgian case , they were parliamentary elections , in the Yugoslav case presidential . )
Western media uncritically took up these allegations , which were made long before the actual voting took place .
A propaganda war was unleashed against both presidents , in Shevardnadzes case after a long period in which he had been lionised as a great reformer and democrat .
Both " revolutions " occurred after a similar " storming of the parliament , " broadcast live on TV .
Both transfers of power were brokered by the Russian minister , Igor Ivanov , who flew to Belgrade and Tbilisi to engineer the exit from power of the incumbent president .
Last but not least , the US ambassador was the same man in both cases : Richard Miles .
The most visible similarity , however , came in the use of a student movement known as Otpor ( Resistance ) in Serbia and Kmara ( Its enough ! ) in Georgia .
Both movements had the same symbol , a black - on - white stencil of a clenched fist .
Otpor trained people from Kmara , and both were supported by the US .
And both organisations were ostensibly structured along communist lines  combining the appearance of a diffuse structure of autonomous cells with the reality of highly centralised Leninist discipline .
As in Georgia , the role played by US money and covert operations has been revealed  but only after the event .
During the events , the television was full of wall - to - wall propaganda about how " the people " rose up against Shevardnadze .
All images which counteracted the optimistic view were suppressed , or glossed over , such as the fact that the " march on Tbilisi " led by Mihkail Saakashvili started off in Gori , Stalins birthplace , beneath a statue of the former Soviet tyrant who remains a hero to many Georgians .
The media was equally unconcerned when the new president , Saakashvili , was confirmed in office by elections which awarded him the Stalinist score of 96 % .
3 c. Ukraine 2004
In the case of Ukraine , we observe the same combination of work by Western - backed non-governmental organisations , the media and the secret services .
The non-governmental organisations played a huge role in de-legitimising the elections before they occurred .
Allegations of widespread fraud were constantly repeated .
In other words , the street protests which broke out after the second round , which Yanukovich won , were based on allegations which had been flying around before the beginning of the first round .
The main NGO behind these allegations , the Committee of Ukrainian Voters , receives not one penny from Ukrainian voters , being instead fully funded by Western governments .
Its office was decorated with pictures of Madeleine Albright and indeed the National Democratic Institute was one of its main affiliates .
It pumped out constant propaganda against Yanukovich .
During the events themselves , I was able to document some of the propaganda abuses .
They involved mainly the endless repetition of electoral fraud practised by the government ; the constant cover -up of fraud practised by the opposition ; the frenetic selling of Viktor Yushchenko , one of the most boring men in the world , as a charismatic politician ; and the ridiculously unlikely story that he had been deliberately poisoned by his enemies .
( No prosecutions have been brought to date on this . )
The fullest account of the propaganda and fraud is given by the British Helsinki Human Rights Groups report , " Ukraine Clockwork Orange Revolution . "
An interesting explanation of the role played by the secret services was also given in The New York Times by C. J. Chivers who explained that the Ukrainian KGB had been working for Yushchenko all along  in collaboration with the Americans of course .
Other important articles on the same subject include Jonathan Mowats " The New Gladio in Action : Washingtons New World Order  Democratization  Template , " which details how military doctrine has been adapted to effect political change , and how various instruments , from psychology to bogus opinion polls , are used in it .
Mowat is particularly interesting on the theories of Dr. Peter Ackermann , the author of Strategic Non-Violent Conflict ( Praeger , 1994 ) and of a speech entitled " Between Hard and Soft Power : the Rise of Civilian - Based Struggle and Democratic Change , " delivered at the State Department in June 2004 .
Mowat is also excellent on the psychology of crowds and its use in these putsches : he draws attention to the role of " swarming adolescents " and " rebellious hysteria " and traces the origins of the use of this for political purposes to the Tavistock Institute in the 1960s : that institute was created by the British Army as its psychological warfare arm after World War I and its illustrious alumni include Dr. David Owen , the former British Foreign Secretary and Dr. Radovan Karadic , the former President of the Bosnian Serb Republic .
Mowat recounts how the ideas formulated there by Fred Emery were taken up by one
Dr. Howard Perlmutter , a professor of " Social Architecture ” at the Wharton School , and a follower of Dr. Emery , ( who ) stressed that " rock video in Katmandu , " was an appropriate image of how states with traditional cultures could be destabilized , thereby creating the possibility of a " global civilization . "
There are two requirements for such a transformation , he added , " building internationally committed networks of international and locally committed organizations , ” and " creating global events " through " the transformation of a local event into one having virtually instantaneous international implications through mass - media .
Conclusion .
None of this is conspiracy theory  it is conspiracy fact .
The United States considers as a matter of official policy that the promotion of democracy is an important element of its overall national security strategy .
Large sections of the State Department , the CIA , para - governmental agencies like the National Endowment for Democracy , and government - funded NGOs like the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , which publishes several works on " democracy promotion . "
All these operations have one thing in common : they involve the interference , sometimes violent , of Western powers , especially the US , in the political processes of other states , and that interference is very often used to promote the quintessential revolutionary goal , regime change .

Scientists attached collars to the bats to track their movements by satellite Scientists are urging the government of Malaysia to ban the hunting of the world 's largest fruit bat .
Researchers say the large flying fox will be wiped out on the Malaysian peninsula if the current unsustainable level of hunting continues .
Writing in the Journal of Applied Ecology they say around 22,000 of the animals are legally hunted each year and more killed illegally .
They say the species could be extinct there by as early as 2015 .
Flying foxes can have a wingspan of up to 1.5 m and are crucial for the rainforest ecosystems in this part of Asia .
Lead author , Dr Jonathan Epstein of Wildlife Trust , told BBC News : " They eat fruit and nectar and in doing so they drop seeds around and pollinate trees .
So they are critical to the propagation of rainforest plants . "
The most optimistic estimates put the population of flying foxes in peninsular Malaysia at 500,000 .
Shooting at dusk
The animals are hunted for food , medicine and sport .
Shooting takes place at dusk as the bats set out to forage overnight .
The researchers say their population models suggest that if current hunting rates continue it will take between six and 81 years for the species to be hunted to extinction .
The research team carried out abundance surveys and collected government data on hunting licences .

The scientists used a computer model to predict the fate of the species according to varying rates of kill and a range of current population estimates .
This was the first time satellite telemetry has been used to track bats in Asia .
The method is often used to track birds but is more rarely used to study mammals .
The researchers trapped individual bats and fastened collars round their necks before releasing them .
Each collar sent a satellite signal which allowed the scientists to track the animal by computer .
The team found that individual animals travelled up to 60 km a night in search of food .
Protected in Thailand Flying foxes , or Pteropus vampyrus , are protected in neighbouring Thailand but hunting is allowed in Malaysia and parts of Indonesia .
Dr Epstein said : " We think this shows there is a need for co-ordinated protection management along the countries where these bats live .
It 's clear now that they are not just Malaysian bats but they share time between Sumatra , Thailand and Malaysia . "
The Malaysian government wildlife departments were partners in the study and are looking at reviewing the hunting laws in the light of the results .
Dr Epstein and his colleagues have recommended at least a temporary ban on hunting to allow the population to recover and to give time for a more comprehensive assessment of the threats to their survival in peninsular Malaysia .

Google ’s Tetris Logo
Google Australia , China and some other places where it ’s Saturday already are displaying a special logo doodle celebrating Tetris .
The alt text reads “ Celebrating 25 Years of The Tetris Effect - courtesy of Tetris Holding , LLC ” , and the logo is linked to a search for tetris .
Wikipedia knows : “ Tetris ... is a puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Alexey Pajitnov .
It was released on June 6 , 1984 ” .
And did you know ?
One of the original makers of Tetris is now working at Google – Google Australia , specifically , on the Google Wave project .
Sydney Morning Herald reports : “ Vadim Gerasimov was just 15 when he was taken under the wing of two Russian computer engineers – Alexey Pajitnov and Dmitry Pavlovsky – at the Moscow Academy of Sciences and helped them create Tetris ...
Since around 2003 Gerasimov has lived in Australia , where he worked in complex systems research with the CSIRO [ Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization ] before joining Google about a year and a half ago . ”

Oil company in Ecuador transforms indigenous community into commercial poachers , threatening wildlife in a protected area
The documentary Crude opened this weekend in New York , while the film shows the direct impact of the oil industry on indigenous groups a new study proves that the presence of oil companies can have subtler , but still major impacts , on indigenous groups and the ecosystems in which they live .
In Ecuador ’s Yasuni National Park — comprising 982,000 hectares of what the researchers call “ one of the most species diverse forests in the world ” — the presence of an oil company has disrupted the lives of the Waorani and the Kichwa peoples , and the rich abundance of wildlife living within the forest .
By building a 149 kilometer ( 92 mile ) road through the protected forest and providing subsidies to the local tribes , the oil company Maxus Ecuador Inc. transformed some members of the tribes from semi-nomadic subsistence hunters into commercial poachers .
The collared peccary made up 7.3 percent of the hunted mammals , birds , and reptiles in the study .
It ’s close relative the white - lipped peccary made up 47.9 percent .

“ We ’ve found that a road in a forest can bring huge social changes to local groups and the ways in which they utilize wildlife resources , ” said Wildlife Conservation Society ( WCS ) researcher Esteban Suárez , lead author of the study .
“ Communities existing inside and around the park are changing their customs to a lifestyle of commercial hunting , the first stage in a potential overexploitation of wildlife . ”
According to the new study by the WCS and the IDEAS - Universidad San Francisco de Quito in Ecuador , the creation of the single road allowed tribe members to transport game to a market where it is sold illegally .
In addition , the subsidies and free access to the road , all provided by the oil company , make the transportation of the meat — and thereby the wild meat market itself — economically viable .
Although sale of wild meat and products in Ecuador is illegal , the researchers report that “ local authorities and park rangers know about the market , [ but ] they lack the resources and political will to stop the illegal trade of wildlife in Pompeya , primarily to avoid conflicts with the local indigenous population . ”

Some communities of the Waorani tribe even abandoned their traditional semi-nomadic life and built settled villages along the road for easy transport of their game .
They took up firearms ( instead of the traditional blowguns ) , which became more prevalent following the arrival of the oil company .
“ These changes , ” the authors explain , “ are amplified by patronizing relationships in which large companies buy their right to operate in the area by providing local communities with resources , money or infrastructure without consideration of the social and ecological impact of these ‘ compensation plans ' ” .
The study published in Animal Conservation found that the wild meat market appeared shortly after the road was constructed in early 1990s and free travel was given to the indigenous tribes .
Between 2005 and 2007 , 11,000 kilograms ( 24,000 pounds ) of wild meat were sold at the Pompeya market every year .
The amount of meat sold every day doubled between 2005 and 2007 , from 150 kilograms ( 330 pounds ) to 300 kilograms ( 661 pounds ) .
“ While the magnitude of the wildlife trade occurring at Pompeya is still limited , its emergence and continuous growth are symptomatic of the dramatic changes that the area is experiencing under the influence of the oil industry and the absence of effective management and control strategies , ” the authors write .

The most commonly targeted animals for the wild meat harvests were pacas , white - lipped peccaries , collared peccaries , and woolly monkeys .
These four species made up 80 percent of the mammal , bird , and reptile meat collected , while fish , primarily caught by the Kichwa , tribe made up 30 percent of all the species ’ total .
According to the researchers the availability of cheap travel for the tribes was the largest factor in creating the presence and size of the illegal market , while the demand for wild meat in restaurants spurred on the trade .
Sixty - nine percent of the meat was bought by middlemen — who consistently knocked - up the price around 60 percent .
These middlemen then transported the meat to restaurants and markets as far away as 234 kilometers ( 145 miles ) .
Consumers in the area were found to be willing to pay double for wild meat than what they would pay for domestic .
“ A simple , seemingly inoffensive road can have far - reaching effects on a landscape and its people , ” said Dr. Avecita Chicchón , Director of WCS ’s Latin America and Caribbean Program .
“ It provides hunters with more access to a wider range of forest while providing a low - cost transportation route to markets .
More importantly , it plugs communities more easily into the larger economic world while creating increased demand for numerous species of animals .
It is the road to unsustainability . ”

The dramatic revision to Australia 's population estimates will aggravate the nation 's chronic shortfall of available housing , increasing the urgency to build more homes , an industry group said today .
In a report released this week , the Treasury estimated there will be 35 million people in Australia by 2050 , 20 per cent higher than previous estimates .
That means 70,000 new homes will have to be built a year to accommodate the population growth , the Housing Industry Association said today .
" Already Australia has a substantial gap between the supply of dwellings and the underlying demand for dwellings , " said HIA deputy managing director Shane Goodwin .
" The gap is set to widen further with obvious consequences for house prices , rents and affordability . "
Before the revisions to Australia 's population estimates , HIA estimated the shortfall between underlying demand and supply of homes to hit 56,600 in 2009 .
The Lying Down Game is popular on the internet
Staff at Swindon 's Great Western Hospital face possible dismissal after posting online pictures of themselves taking part in the Lying Down Game .
Seven hospital staff have been suspended for their part in the game , played in mid August .
The game involves being pictured lying down with arms by your side and toes pointing towards the floor .
A hospital official said : " Disciplinary hearings are yet to take place and we cannot predict the outcome . "
The images , since removed , were posted on the social networking site Facebook under the title Secret Swindon Emergency Department Group .
In the spirit of the game , extra points are awarded for being pictured in unusual settings .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
It is understood staff were pictured lying down on the hospital 's resuscitation trolleys , ward floors and the Wiltshire Air Ambulance helipad .
Great Western Hospital medical director Dr Alf Troughton said : " A number of staff were suspended following allegations of unprofessional conduct while on night shift duty in the hospital during a weekend in August .
" This did not involve patients and we are satisfied that at no time was patient care compromised .
" The Great Western Hospital sets high standards for staff behaviour at all times and therefore takes any such breaches extremely seriously .
" The allegations have been thoroughly investigated and seven members of staff remain suspended pending formal disciplinary hearings . "
Is the US Congress for sale ?
That ’s the question voters are invited to assess with a new database , unveiled this week , that links lobbying and campaign contributions with member projects , or earmarks .
The new database is a collaboration between two respected Washington watchdog groups : the Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks campaign contributions and lobbying , and Taxpayers for Common Sense , which tracks earmarks .
The database documents more than 20,000 member projects worth $ 35 billion , along with $ 226.8 million in campaign contributions and lobbying expenditures for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 .
In a fiscal year with a $ 1 trillion - plus federal budget deficit , $ 35 billion for earmarks may seem like small change .
But the process opens a rare window on the exercise of power on Washington , especially potential conflicts of interest .
" At a minimum , earmarks granted to lawmakers ' friends and supporters merit scrutiny and indicate potential conflicts of interest , " said Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics , in a statement .
“ This information will help Americans decide for themselves whether their congressional representatives are beholden to the voters who elect them – or to elite interests bankrolling their campaigns , ” she added .
As expected , members serving on the House and Senate Appropriations committees , especially the defense subcommittees , are the top sponsors of earmarks .
In the Senate , Sen. Robert Byrd ( D ) of West Virginia , then chairman of the Appropriations Committee , won 95 ( solo ) earmarks , valued at $ 349.6 million for FY 2009 .
Sen. Daniel Inouye ( D ) of Hawaii , who replaced him as chair in the 111th Congress , ranked No. 2 , at 71 earmarks , worth $ 221.7 million .
In the House , Rep. John Murtha ( D ) of Pennsylvania , who chairs the defense subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee , ranked No. 1 , with 46 solo earmarks worth $ 120.5 million .
In June , Rep. Jeff Flake ( R ) of Arizona called on the House ethics panel to consider campaign contributions when evaluating if members have a financial interest in an earmark .
“ While certainly no one would assert that every member of Congress receiving a campaign contribution from an earmark recipient was doing so for the purpose of financial gain , the House of Representatives simply cannot continue to permit the appearance of impropriety associated with members providing no -bid or sole source federal contracts to campaign contributors , ” he wrote in a June 3 letter .
“ Unfortunately , we have n’t had much success yet either legislatively or convincing the committee to move ahead on its own , ” says spokesman Matthew Specht .
Watchdog groups say it ’s difficult to prove that campaign contributions are in exchange for official actions , such as earmarks .
That requires written or recorded evidence clearly establishing a quid pro quo .
But the new database will help citizens ask their own questions of elected officials .
“ These are not cases that have to be developed or tried in a court of law or in the ethics committee .
These are activities that should be judged by citizens throughout the country , ” says Ellen Miller , executive director of the Sunlight Foundation , a public - interest group that promotes transparency in government .
“ When you make the information available and accessible to the average citizen or the online citizen , you spread the level of accountability for what goes on in Washington .
Then you find out what needs to be fixed , ” she says .

Money makes some people crazy .
And no one can exploit that better than the Russians .
According to an Austrian newspaper called Wirtschaftsblatt , which I thought at first was a joke name but it 's apparently real ( they 've got Warren Buffett on the front page today ! ) , Russian luxury ocean liners are offering customers " pirate hunting cruises " .
Instead of becoming a victim of pirates , pirates become the victims .
The article was translated at Ananova.com , which says passengers are paying about $ 5,700 a day to patrol the waters off Somalia in heavily armed private yachts , hoping to attract the attention of pirates .
Then , when the bad guys get close , the badder guys open fire with grenade launchers , machine guns , and rocket launchers .
The yachts come with body guards , who are allegedly " a squad of ex special forces troops , " and , for about $ 20 a day extra , you can use an AK - 47 and 100 rounds of ammo .
" They are worse than the pirates , " the article quotes a Russian yachtsman named Vladimir Mironov .
" At least the pirates have the decency to take hostages , these people are just paying to commit murder . "
I 've got an idea !
Let 's pool our money together and rent a luxury yacht to hunt CEO's of TARP - receiving money caught vacationing on company - subsidized yachts !
We wo n't shoot them , just moon them .

While many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping - free Tour de France , the head of the French anti-doping agency AFLD , Pierre Bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance - enhancing substances or methods .
Bordry told French daily Le Monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams .
" We found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said .
After Sunday 's
Tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
Headlines appeared such as " Drugs war is being won " or " Tour chief hails clean race , " but Bordry is not convinced .
He said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as EPO , and another which increases strength and burns fat .
Bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall .
Too lax ?
Bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers .
Detection methods for new performance - enhancing drugs will be ready this fall
Bordry had accused the International Cycling Union ( UCI ) , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
He made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the Astana team in Andorra last week during an early - morning doping control .
Both tour winner Alberto Contador and Lance Armstrong , who took third place , rode for the Astana team .
" This is the Tour de France and you can't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6 am , " said Lance Armstrong after Astana was criticized over the wait .
The French anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's Tour de France in September and October , looking mainly for the banned blood - booster CERA .
" Bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
He needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said Gerry van Gerwen , head of the Milram team .
Can doping be beat ?
After the race ended on Sunday , Tour de France director Christian Prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over .
" We can't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said .
Tour winner Alberto Contador says he race a clean race
While some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the Tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat - and - mouse game of performance - enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery .
" The only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote Arnd Festering in the German daily Frankfurter Rundschau .
" That 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance - enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was . "

Brain Areas Critical To Human Time Sense Identified
Now researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Albuquerque have identified areas in the brain responsible for perceiving the passage of time in order to carry out critical everyday functions .
Their study is the first to demonstrate that the basal ganglia located deep within the base of the brain , and the parietal lobe located on the surface of the right side of the brain , are critical areas for this time - keeping system .
Their results are published in the current issue of Nature Neuroscience .
Importantly , the study calls into question a long - standing and widely held belief in the scientific community that the cerebellum is the critical structure involved in time perception .
" We are excited that our findings can also have application to better understand some neurological disorders , " says Stephen M. Rao , Ph.D. , professor of neurology at the Medical College and principal investigator .
" By identifying the area in the brain responsible for governing our sense of time , scientists can now study defective time perception , which has been observed in patients with Parkinson 's disease and Attention - Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , two maladies commonly thought to have abnormal function within the basal ganglia . "
Making accurate decisions regarding the duration of brief intervals of time from 300 milliseconds to 10 seconds is critical to most aspects of human behavior .
Contemporary theories of short interval timing assume the existence of a timekeeper system within the brain , yet identifying these brain systems has been elusive and controversial .
Using a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) technique that tracks second - by - second changes in brain activity , investigators identified regions within the brain that are critical for this timekeeping system .
Seventeen healthy , young men and women volunteers were imaged while being asked to perceive the duration of time between the presentations of two consecutive tones .
One second later , two more tones were presented and subjects were asked to make a judgment as to whether the duration between the tones was shorter or longer than the first two tones .
To make sure that the brain systems associated with time perception were clearly identified , two control tasks were given which involved listening to tones or estimating their pitch , but not making judgments about their duration .
Using this fast imaging technique , the investigators were able to isolate only those areas of the brain activated during presentation of the first two tones -- when subjects are only perceiving and attending to time .
Their results conclusively demonstrated that timekeeping functions are governed by the basal ganglia and the right parietal cortex .
Investigators have long suspected , based on indirect evidence , that the basal ganglia might be involved in time perception .
The basal ganglia have nerve cells that primarily contain the neurotransmitter , dopamine .
Patients with Parkinson 's disease have an abnormal reduction in dopamine within the basal ganglia and commonly experience problems with time perception .
These difficulties partially improve when patients are administered a drug that increases dopamine levels in the brain .
Defective time perception has also been observed in patients with Huntington 's disease and Attention - Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) , two disorders commonly thought to have abnormal function within the basal ganglia .
Animal studies have also demonstrated the importance of dopamine in timekeeping .
Medical College researchers at Froedtert Hospital , a major teaching affiliate of the Medical College , are currently using this new neuroimaging procedure to better understand how the brain enables dopamine replacement drugs and methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) to normalize time perception in individuals with Parkinson 's disease and ADHD , respectively .
An additional study , in collaboration with investigators at the University of Iowa , will examine time perception in the early stages of Huntington 's disease , prior to the development of the characteristic movement disorder .
The critical role of the parietal lobes in timekeeping was first suggested by coauthor Deborah L. Harrington , Ph.D. , research scientist , Veterans Affairs Medical Center and associate research professor of neurology and psychology , University of New Mexico , Albuquerque , NM .
She and her colleagues reported that stroke patients with damage to the parietal cortex on the right but not the left side of the brain experienced impaired time perception .
Patients for the study have been drawn from Froedtert Hospital and the VA Medical Center in Milwaukee .
Additionally , the researchers are studying adult ADHD patients who have been seen since childhood at the Medical College .
Coauthor of the study with Drs. Rao and Harrington is Andrew R. Mayer , M.S. , graduate student , department of neurology , Medical College of Wisconsin .
The study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health and the W.M. Keck Foundation to the Medical College , and the Department of Veterans Affairs and National Foundation for Functional Brain Imaging to the Veterans Affairs Medical Center , Albuquerque .

WASHINGTON  As Congress prepares to consider extending crucial provisions of the USA Patriot Act , civil liberties groups and some Democratic lawmakers are gearing up to press for sweeping changes to surveillance laws .
Both the House and the Senate are set to hold their first committee hearings this week on whether to reauthorize three sections of the Patriot Act that expire at the end of this year .
The provisions expanded the power of the F.B.I. to seize records and to eavesdrop on phone calls in the course of a counterterrorism investigation .
Laying down a marker ahead of those hearings , a group of senators who support greater privacy protections filed a bill on Thursday that would impose new safeguards on the Patriot Act while tightening restrictions on other surveillance policies .
The measure is co-sponsored by nine Democrats and an independent .
Days before , the Obama administration called on Congress to reauthorize the three expiring Patriot Act provisions in a letter from Ronald Weich , assistant attorney general for legislative affairs .
At the same time , he expressed a cautious open mind about imposing new surveillance restrictions as part of the legislative package .
Paul DeGregorio's ' Everyone Counts ' was paid to carry out fully unverifiable , unsecure Internet , phone election in Honolulu
Voter participation plummets 83 % to boot ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/28/2009 , 12:20 pm PT
-- Brad Friedman , The BRAD BLOG
As if the former U.S. Election Assistance Commission ( EAC ) chair Paul DeGregorio had n't done enough damage to our nation 's electoral system during his disastrous reign as a commissioner from 2003 to 2007 , it looks like he's now more than happy to cash in on his Bush - appointed public post in the private sector as Chief Operating Officer for a dubious Internet voting operation .
Everyone Counts ( E1C ) is the San Diego - based firm which ran " America 's first all - digital online and telephone election " in Honolulu , which was completed last week .
That 's the way it was described by Aaron Contorer , the company 's Chief of Products and Partnership , in a very thinly disguised press release , sadly posted , as if a news article , recently by Huffington Post .
[ Full Disclosure :
We also contribute articles to HuffPo , though we try to offer news , rather than press releases . ]
As COO of Everyone Counts , DeGregorio has posted a video commercial ( and a bad one at that , see the bottom of this article where it 's re-posted ) on his bio page at the company website .
His face is also featured on the front page of their site .
In the short video , DeGregorio crows about his 22 years in the election " business " while posing in front of the U.S. Capitol and Washington Monument in D.C .
Trading on his former self - proclaimed status as " America 's chief election official , " DeGregorio endorses the private company for which he now works , noting in the video : " I 've been involved in this business for 22 years , having risen to the , America 's Chief election official .
And I have found that Everyone Counts is the place for me to be , because it 's the only organization that provides transparency , accessibility , security and choice .
And I think that 's the most important thing for any election official , anywhere in the world . "
While evidently accuracy does n't even make DeGregorio 's list of " most important thing [s ] for any election official " --- not surprising , given his oversight , during his tenure at the EAC , of federal approval for myriad electronic voting systems that fail to meet federal accuracy standards --- the idea that EC's Internet voting schemes provide " transparency " seems to be entirely without evidence , as The BRAD BLOG confirmed with a representative of the Honolulu Neighborhood Commission Office which sponsored last week 's election .
Moreover , Everyone Counts ' virtual election in Hawaii , according to late news reports this week , seems to have been a dismal failure , at least if the 83 % plummet in voter participation might be taken as any indication , in addition to the election 's lack of transparency and verifiability .
Numerous commenters , including us , left responses to Contorer 's misleading and disinformative HuffPo item , noting serious concerns about E1 C's " all - digital " voting scheme .
Concerns were expressed by many posters about citizens ' lack of ability to verify the accuracy of votes cast , and of transparency and security in the system which , Contorer claims , employs " military - grade encryption technology . "
He goes on to try to convince readers that it's also " faster , more reliable , and more secure than if they had voted on paper . "
He failed to answer to any of our critical comments , however , and neither did he offer evidence to back up his claims about his company 's superior reliability and security over fully - transparent , paper - ballot voting .
Despite his shameless promotion , and an offer in his video to contact him with any questions , DeGregorio himself did no better in responding to our request for comment in regard to our concerns ...
Unsecure , Unverifiable
According to Honolulu's Star Bulletin , 115,000 voters were mailed nine - digit PIN numbers earlier this month , which they could then use to vote from their home computer , a touch - tone telephone , or one of several computer sites that the Neighborhood Commission Office had set up for voters to vote online if they did n't have access to their own computer ( or telephone , presumably ) .
Setting aside that there is apparently no way for citizens to know that anybody 's vote was actually recorded accurately by the EC techno- voting scheme , we were curious what safeguards were in place to keep any of those 115,000 voters from giving their PIN number away to someone else --- either out of friendliness or for profit --- to allow them to vote in their place .
Unlike Contorer , or anybody else at E1C , Bryan K Mick , a representative from the Neighborhood Commission in Honolulu , was very responsive to our queries .
He conceded that " there is no procedure to stop someone from selling their vote , " though he noted that along with the PIN number , the last four - digits of a voters ' Social Security Number must be entered in order to vote via the E1C system .
That , he believed , made the system " more secure " than their previous paper - ballot elections .
" In previous years we mailed everyone a paper ballot along with a return envelope , " he told us via email .
" Although the return envelope [ required ] a signature , we did not have access to any signature database and therefore someone could simply have forged a signature .
We therefore feel that this election is actually more secure . "
In response to follow - up questions , in which we noted that at least a signature would allow for some kind of authentication of votes , if allegations of fraud had occurred , Mick agreed we were " correct , " and " if there had been an allegation of fraud [ with their paper system ] we could pull the envelope . "
" I assume the City Clerk maintains a database [ of signatures ] , but we do n't have access to it , at least at the current time , " he told us , before adding , " I know of no allegations of voter fraud . "
Mick seemed unaware of the many reports from governmental and private computer scientists and security experts who have argued that Internet voting is not secure .
" I disagree that computer and voting experts do n't like this method , " he wrote .
" Quite the opposite .
If it was n't safe , there would be no way billions of dollars would be moved online every day . "
That 's the same line of rationalization Contorer mentioned in his Huff
Po blog item , which misleads readers by arguing that " We have been banking online and shopping online for over a decade , " so it must be time to vote that way too !
Contorer failed to note --- and likely failed to inform Mick , or the others in Honolulu - that Internet business transactions , while certainly less than 100 % secure , are made far more secure via the transparency that comes with them .
Unlike a secret ballot that can't be traced to it's " owner " once it 's been cast , business transactions can be tracked , transparently , double - checked , and triple - checked by all of those who are parties to the transaction , at any time afterward , to help ensure accuracy .
That 's simply not the case with a secret ballot .
Ellen Theisen of the non-partisan election watchdog VotersUnite.org summarized just a few of the concerns about Internet voting , as detailed by experts , in her February 2009 testimony [ PDF ] prepared for the state of Washington .
Washington , too , had been foolishly toying with the idea of Internet voting but wisely let the bill proposing it die .
Her well - footnoted , three - page testimony describes how scores of experts have found that " safe use of the Internet for voting is essentially impossible , given the technology available today . "
Theisen 's testimony begins with this handy summary :
In 2004 , a panel of experts commissioned by the U.S. Department of Defense concluded that it was not possible to ensure the privacy , security , or accuracy of votes cast over the Internet with its current architecture .
They said the attempt to provide secure , all - electronic Internet voting was " an essentially impossible task . "
concluded that it was not possible to ensure the privacy , security , or accuracy of votes cast over the Internet with its current architecture .
They said the attempt to provide secure , all - electronic Internet voting was " an essentially impossible task . "
In 2007 , the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) found that email and Internet voting is " more vulnerable to privacy and security compromises than the conventional methods now in use " and that " available safeguards may not adequately reduce the risks of compromise . "
found that email and Internet voting is " more vulnerable to privacy and security compromises than the conventional methods now in use " and that " available safeguards may not adequately reduce the risks of compromise . "
In 2008 , the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) wrote , " Technology that is widely deployed today is not able to mitigate many of the threats to casting ballots via the web . "
wrote , " Technology that is widely deployed today is not able to mitigate many of the threats to casting ballots via the web . "
In 2008 , thirty leading computer science experts and professors at major universities signed a statement asserting that until " serious , potentially insurmountable , technical challenges " are overcome , permitting the Internet to be used for public elections " is an extraordinary and unnecessary risk to democracy . "
Theisen offered more supporting quotes from experts in an additional 7 - page document [ PDF ] .
We suspect Everyone Counts shared none of these warnings with the good folks of Honolulu .
Ironically enough , while Honolulu's Mick had noted hopes that this year 's " all - digital " election might boost participation above the 25 % of eligible voters who took part in last year 's election , the local ABC affiliate reports this week that participation in this year 's first " all - digital " election plummeted by 83 % , compared to last year :
Officials saw an 83 percent drop in the number of voters participating in the Honolulu Neighborhood Board 's recent election that is the nation 's first all - digital election , where people could vote over the Internet or by phone .
For the first time , Oahu voters had to use computers or the telephone to vote for their neighborhood board candidates and many people did not bother .
About 7,300 people voted this year , compared to 44,000 people who voted in the last neighborhood board race in 2007 .
In another one of the many ironies related to this story , a judge in Hawaii , just last week , as voting in Honolulu 's local election was concluding , halted the use of electronic voting machines , and the Internet transmission of votes , in both state and federal elections in the state .
Judge Joseph E. Cardoza found that the state 's use of Hart Intercivic e-voting systems was not implemented through lawful rulemaking , and that the Internet transmission of vote counts was not in compliance with state law .
As Honolulu 's elections were local only , Cardoza 's finding did n't apply .
In either case , it did n't matter .
This election was for the benefit of Everyone Counts , and their hopes of getting rich by undermining American democracy with Internet elections .
It 's certainly not for the benefit of the voters , and the laws of Hawaii , like their voters , do n't matter a lick .
Speaking of Failures , DeGregorio Knows Better , Does n't Care
Everyone Counts ' DeGregorio was the EAC chair who first buried , and then completely rewrote , a bi-partisan report on " voter fraud , " or lack thereof ( without consulting the reports ' authors ) during his ignominious tenure at the federal commission .
He had colluded , with fellow St. Louis , MO , hometown colleague and GOP " voter fraud " scam gangster , Thor Hearne of the American Center for Voting Rights ( ACVR , whom The BRAD BLOG has spent many years exposing as the anti-democracy thug operation that they are ) , in hopes of keeping the report , which showed little or no evidence of actual polling - place voter fraud , from being seen by the public , prior to the 2006 election .
Given the Republican DeGregorio's seeming obsession with " voter fraud " during his reign at the EAC , it seems a tad ironic that he'd be fronting for an e-voting vendor whose " all - digital " voting procedures virtually beg to be defrauded , and whose accuracy , in any case , can never be verified by the public .
While we report far more on these pages , on the very real concerns about Election Fraud ( fraud by insiders in the election " business " who are easily able to manipulate entire elections with the effort of little more than a key stroke or two ) than on the imagined concerns about Voter Fraud ( rarely used at the polls , as it's a very difficult and dangerous way to game an election and requires a large conspiracy which is easily discovered , even though the GOP shamelessly exploits those concerns in order to implement disenfranchising polling - place ID restrictions to keep Democrats from casting legal votes ) , we recognize the way in which that sort of fraud can occur .
Most frequently , it occurs via absentee voting , which is not subject to the same sort of ID restrictions Republicans across the country have been pushing to implement .
However , unlike DeGregorio , apparently , we 'd never do anything to help encourage such fraud .
No , not even for money , as DeGregorio is seemingly all too happy to do .
Moreover --- and not surprisingly --- AP and Fox " News " were similarly all too happy to offer a largely glowing report on Honolulu 's experiment , downplaying any concerns of fraud , and not bothering to note the dismal " turnout " in last week 's election .
At the end of DeGregorio 's video ad for Everyone Counts , he says : " So check us out .
Check out our webpage .
See what Everyone Counts has to offer , " before concluding : " Contact us , and we 'll get right back to you . "
Well , we contacted Everyone Counts , several times , via email , requesting response to our questions about the security and transparency of their voting schemes .
They never bothered to respond .
Maybe it 's not their fault , though .
Perhaps the notes just got lost when they were sent over the Internet .

Testimony in Support of HR 1207 , The Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009 , House Financial Services Committee , September 25 , 2009
I am speaking this morning in support of HR 1207 , the Federal Reserve Transparency Act .
As the Committee knows , this bill would require a full audit of the Federal Reserve by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) .
On November 10 , 2008 , Bloomberg News ran the following headline :  Fed Defies Transparency Aim in Refusal to Disclose . 
The story pointed out that the Fed was refusing to identify the recipients of trillions of dollars in emergency loans or the dubious assets the central bank was accepting as collateral .
When the initial $ 700 billion congressional bailout was being debated last September , Fed chairman Ben Bernanke and then - Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson could n’t emphasize their commitment to transparency strongly enough .
But two months later , as the Fed [ lent ] far more than that in separate rescue programs that did n’t require approval by Congress , Americans [ had ] no idea where their money [ was ] going or what securities the banks [ were ] pledging in return . 
Matthew Winkler , editor - in - chief of Bloomberg News , put it simply :  Taxpayers — involuntary investors in this case — have a right to know who received loans , in what amounts , for which collateral , and why specific loans were made . 
This has been portrayed as a trivial matter being pursued by some cynical and uppity Americans who do n’t know their place .
But there is no good reason for Americans not to know the recipients of the Fed ’s emergency lending facilities .
There is no good reason for them to be kept in the dark about the Fed ’s arrangements with foreign central banks .
These things affect the quality of the money that our system obliges the American public to accept .
End the Fed Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.12 Buy New $ 8.53 ( as of 10:10 EST - Details )
The Fed ’s arguments against the bill are unlikely to persuade , and will undoubtedly strike the average American as little more than special pleading .
Perhaps the most frequent of the claims is that a genuine audit would jeopardize the alleged independence of the Fed .
Congress could come to influence or even dictate monetary policy .
This is a red herring .
The bill is not designed to empower politicians to increase the money supply , choose interest - rate targets , or adopt any of the rest of the Fed ’s central planning apparatus , all of which is better left to the free market than to the Fed or Congress .
It seeks nothing more than to open the Fed ’s books to public scrutiny .
Congress has a moral and legal obligation to oversee institutions it brings into existence .
The convoluted scenarios by which merely opening the books will lead to an inflationary catastrophe at the hands of Congress are difficult to take seriously .
At the same time , as we hear this objection repeated time and again , we might wonder just how independent the Fed really is , what with its chairman up for reappointment by the president every four years .
Have these critics never heard of the political business cycle ?
Fed chairmen have been known to ingratiate themselves into the president ’s favor close to election time by means of loose monetary policy and the false ( and temporary ) prosperity it brings about .
Let us not insult Americans ’ intelligence by pretending this phenomenon does not exist .
Moreover , try to imagine a Fed chairman doggedly seeking to maintain the value of the dollar even if it meant refusing to monetize a massive deficit to fight a war or stimulate a depressed economy .
It is not possible .
If there is any truth to the idea of Fed independence , it lay in precisely this : the Fed may reward favored friends and constituencies with trillions of dollars in various kinds of assistance , while keeping the public completely in the dark .
If that is the independence we ’re talking about , no self - respecting American would hesitate for a moment to challenge it .

A related argument warns that the legislation threatens to politicize lender - of - last - resort decisions .
Again , this is untrue .
But even if it were true , how would that represent a departure from current practice ?
I hope we are not asking Americans to believe that the decisions to bail out various financial institutions over the past two years , and in particular to allow them to become depository institutions overnight that they might qualify for assistance , were made on the basis of a pure devotion to the common good and were not political at all .
Most Americans , not unreasonably , seem convinced of another thesis : that Goldman Sachs , for instance , might be just a little bit more politically well connected than the rest of us .
Opponents of HR 1207 have sometimes tried to claim that the Fed is already adequately audited .
If this were true , why is the Fed in panic mode over this bill ?
It is the broad areas these audits exclude that the American public is increasingly interested in investigating , and these are the gaps that HR 1207 seeks to fill .
The conventional wisdom seems to be that the monetary system we have now is sound and beyond reproach , and certainly better than any system that preceded it .
My purpose today is not to render judgment upon such views , however deeply misguided I happen to consider them , and however inaccurate their implicit view of nineteenth - century financial panics .
My point is simply this : if our monetary system were really as strong , robust , and beyond criticism as its cheerleaders claim , why does it need to rely so heavily on public ignorance ?
How can it be a sound banking system that depends on keeping the public in the dark about the condition of its financial institutions ?
Meltdown : A Free - Marke ...
Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 20.00 ( as of 02:20 EST - Details )
Let me also make clear that supporters of this legislation are strongly opposed to a watered - down version of the bill — which , incidentally , would only increase public suspicion that someone is hiding something .
If the Federal Reserve Transparency
Act passes and the audit takes place , the American people will have achieved a great victory .
If the legislation fails , more and more Americans will begin to wonder what the Fed could be so anxious to keep hidden , and the pressure for transparency will simply intensify .
A recent poll finds 75 percent of Americans already in favor of auditing the Fed .
The writing is on the wall .
The Federal Reserve may as well get used to the idea that the audit is coming .
That would be a far more sensible approach than the counterproductive and condescending one it has adopted thus far , in which the peons who populate the country are urged to quit pestering their betters with all these impertinent questions .
The Fed should take to heart the words of consolation the American people are given whenever a new government surveillance program is uncovered : if you ’re not doing anything wrong , you have nothing to worry about .
The superstitious reverence that Americans have been taught to have for the Federal Reserve is unworthy of the dignity of a free people .
The Fed enjoys a government - granted monopoly on the creation of legal - tender money .
It is not an unreasonable imposition for Americans to demand to know about the activities of such an institution .
It is common sense .
The Best of Tom Woods
If you 're aregular you certainly know -- and have known for years -- whose side Ben Nelson is on ... and it 's never been our side .
He 's always the " Democrat " most likely to cross the aisle , especially on crucial and substantive matters .
He makes Lieberman look like a flaming progressive .
He 's always the first to declare his opposition for anything progressive or anything that could be possibly construed as helping ordinary working families .
Even though Arlen Specter was a genuine , card carryin ' Republican until recently , when you match his ProgressivePunch score on crucial votes up with Nelson 's ( for the current year ) , Specter gets a miserable 42.22 ( just better than Blanche Lincoln 's 46.67 ) and Nelson gets a 33.33 .
That 's out of a possible 100 .
In 2006 when I suggested to my fellow bloggers that we make an example of Nelson 's reactionary stance , I was voted down ( to put it mildly ) .
He was n't behaving as badly -- they never do right before an election -- and people were scared that an even worse reactionary than Nelson ( a Republican ) might win the seat .
" Do n't rock the boat , " I was told .
I did n't .
Now I 'm sorry .
Now we 're all sorry .
So now bloggers and progressive activists are attacking Nelson .
But Nelson is n't up for re-election this year .
Or next year .
Or the year after .
In 2012 who 's gonna remember ?
Will the ads being run against him now make him change his behavior ?
I doubt it -- though there 's as much a chance he 'll get worse ( which is what he 's threatening ) as him getting any better .
Watch the ad ; it 's really excellent :
The PFA - PCCC campaign is very smart too , asking the Senate to stay on duty and not allow Nelson -- who is doing the bidding of his Insurance company donors -- to slow the reform bill down enough to kill it , their goal ( and his ) -- to do the Republicans ' dirty work for them .
Why would Nelson be so against health care reform ?
Follow the money -- which is exactly what he always does .
The Insurance Industry has showered him with $ 1,222,799 , more than any other current member of the Senate -- corporate shill Rick Santorum took slightly more before he was defeated in 2006 -- other than presidential candidates .
And on top of that , the Medical - Industrial Complex and their lobbyists have given him another $ 1,034,266-- 83 % of it from outside Nebraska , of course .
And he 's been worth every dime of it to be the voice inside the Democratic Party than will stand in the way of working families until the cows come home .
For someone who takes so much money from special interests from outside Nebraska , it was ironic to hear Nelson screeching about the ads and calling the small businessman in the ad -- a real person , not an actor -- " an outside special interest group ! "
Straight from the Lee Atwater - Karl Rove playbook !
He 's demanding this guy stop " telling [ Nebraskans ] what to think " and he threatened that if the grassroots keep pressuring him like this , " health care reform may be dead by the end of August . ”
And now he 's got a shill blogger defending his reactionary politics .
If you 're feelin ' flush , please help the DFA - PCCC campaign out with a contribution so they can increase their ad buy .
Remember , if Nelson has a coronary or a stroke , he 's and Diane have great taxpayer funded health care -- and lots of friends in high places inside the Insurance Biz .
If , on the other hand , you want to show reactionary Democrats who consistently vote with Republicans on crucial issues that progressives will make them pay a price for their perfidy , there is one who is in a tough re-election battle : Blanche Lincoln .
Help us retire her from politics .
Let 's make sure Arkansas voters are aware of the insidious role their " Democratic " senator has been playing in helping Big Insurance water down the reform legislation .
Let 's run this ad in Arkansas TV as a follow up to the 1,000 spots we already ran there :
Nelson just announced , as though he were some kind of Republican trying to show how bipartisan he can be once in a blue moon , that he 's going to bring himself to vote to confirm Sotomayor .
DFA and PCCC just announced they are tripling their ad buy against him because of his reactionary anti-family stand on health care reform .

Senator Tom Harkin , who leads the HELP committee , made a stunning statement to The Hill :
The Senate has the votes to pass a healthcare reform bill including a public option , a key Senate chairman said Tuesday .
Sen .
Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) , the chairman of the Health , Education , Labor and Pensions ( HELP ) Committee , said that the Senate " comfortably " has a majority of votes to pass the public plan , and that he believes Democrats can muster 60 votes to break a filibuster .
" I have polled senators , and the vast majority of Democrats — maybe approaching 50 — support a public option , " Harkin said told the liberal " Bill Press Radio Show . "
" So why should n't we have a public option ?
We have the votes .
" I believe we 'll have the 60 votes , now that we have the new senator from Massachusetts , to at least get it on the Senate floor , " Harkin later added .
" But once we cross that hurdle , we only need 51 votes for the public option .
And I believe there are , comfortably , 51 votes for a public option . "
That 's great news .
Let 's hope it plays out this way .
Mike Lux has more :
I have said before ( most recently here ) that the Senate Finance Committee was conservative , in fact the most conservative committee makeup in the Senate , and that we would be likely to lose these votes :
With numbers like this , and with the entire Democratic base mobilized intensely around the issue , you would have to be politically tone deaf as a Democrat to oppose this , but this is the Senate Finance Committee , so public option advocates are likely to lose these votes .
The question , though , will be the margin .
On a committee this conservative , far more conservative than the Senate as a whole , if we only get seven votes for the public option amendments , that would have to be considered a major political victory , and a sign that the public option can definitely get a majority vote on the floor .
So getting 10 votes on this is promising for those of us who believe a public option is essential .
Baucus , Conrad , Lincoln , Carper , and Bill Nelson are five of the ten most conservative Dems in the Senate , and on the Schumer amendment , even two of them went with us .
President Obama is for it , a majority in the House is for it , and the whip count we 're running right here at OpenLeft.com shows that 51 Democrats are in favor of it .
And today Tom Harkin confirmed that our whip count is right ...
Will all this evidence , the public option will only be hard to beat if Democratic leaders decide they do n't want to do it .
And Digby has more :
Carper and Nelson flipped on the Shumer public option amendment , leaving only Conrad , Lincoln and Baucus voting against it .
This is good news believe it or not .
It indicates that there are 51 votes for a public option in the senate .
The question most certainly is whether or not the president can change their minds .
And frankly , if he does n't have enough juice to at least hold them together for one cloture vote then I have to wonder if he has any real juice at all .
Every one of these corporate lackeys can vote against the final bill if they dare .
Assuming they can bring Byrd in to do it , all they need to do is break a Republican filibuster and " allow an up or down vote . "
Now matter what FOX News says , the public option is not dead .
I saw Schumer on with Tweety and he was ecstatic that he flipped a couple of votes .
It sucks that he has to kowtow to Max Baucus , though .
He was talking to him like he was the Duke of Westminster .
All that royalty cannot be overlooked .
Tweety asked Schumer about those pesky liberal ads that are being run against Baucus , as if Matthews thought he was NOT going to defend his Senate brother .
And during our President Obama blogger conference call , Obama told US to keep the pressure on everybody .
He 's got to push for the public option hard no matter what Rahm thinks .

TOKYO — Akihabara , Tokyo's historic electronics district , has morphed into a geek paradise filled with videogames , pop-culture collectibles and other nerd attractions .
Originally home to a vast array of stores selling consumer goods , Akihabara is now the center of otaku culture .
While some outlets still offer great deals on home appliances , the area brims with games , anime , toys and " maid cafes , " where girls in cosplay outfits serve tea to tired shoppers .
With a long string of national holidays this week , Tokyo geeks are out in force , filling Akihabara 's sidewalks and patronizing the shops .
Above :
These shops , some of the oldest in Akihabara , are located directly under train tracks .
This means a skyscraper can't be built in their place , so these tiny stores wo n't be ripped down .
Most of them sell parts for electronics hobbyists .

Tokiwa Musen 's convenient location makes it the first videogame store you see when you leave the Akihabara train station .
It is known for its extremely low prices on slightly older games :
Once a title drops in popularity , Tokiwa clears it out immediately .
Savvy gamers know to wait a few weeks before buying certain titles , since heated competition in Akihabara will cause prices to drop precipitously .
Launch prices of $ 50 to $ 60 can plummet to $ 10 a month after a game 's release .

Many stores in Akihabara are essentially consignment shops .
Called " rental box " stores , they are filled with small glass cubes like these that hobbyists can rent , then fill with collectibles to sell .
Shopkeepers make the sales and keep track of the money .

Strange Horizons Friday : I ’m Matching Donations
So , Strange Horizons is an online magazine of science fiction and fantasy that pays writers official pro rates ( as defined by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America ) , publishes a wide range of fiction and non-fiction about science fiction and fantasy , and goes out of its way to publish new and emerging writers .
They ’re also a non-profit organization ( a real one , with tax - deductible status and everything ) , and do all that they do through donations from readers and others .
This August is its fund drive month , and its goal is to raise $ 7,000 by the end of the month .
Here it is the 14th , and they ’re at $ 1,565 as I write this , which is more than a little disconcerting to me .
I know the people involved with Strange Horizons quite well , and I can assure you that these are n’t people who are taking that donation money and spending it on frivolities .
That money goes right out the door to the contributors of the site and to make the site a great place to visit on a daily basis .
I ’m not even sure the editors pay themselves for all their work , which is kind of insane , but a testament to their dedication to expanding the market for science fiction and fantasy .
The site runs lean .
So when the folks running it say they need the $ 7 k to keep going , they ’re not plumping up their numbers ; dude , they need that $ 7 k .
I got my start in the science fiction field through Strange Horizons ; it was the first outlet to publish my fiction , and one of the very first to seriously interview me after I published my novel .
Between this and the fact that many people I know and respect keep the place going on a daily basis , it ’s fair to say that I am a big supporter of the site for personal reasons .
But even if they had n’t published my fiction and even if I did n’t know those who are running it , I would still be a fan of the site , because of what it publishes and because for almost a decade now the site has been a door into fantasy and science fiction that ’s unlike any other .
It ’s a site worth reading , and a cause worth donating to .
I donate a bit every year to Strange Horizons to help keep it going , but this year I want to do something more , both to show my appreciation for the site and the people who run it , and to encourage those of you who read the site to shell out a bit to keep it going — and to encourage those of you who have not been to the site to check it out and consider pitching in for the fund drive .
So here ’s the deal :
For the day of August 14 , 2009 , John and Kristine Scalzi will do a one - to - one match for every donation made to Strange Horizons , up to $ 500 .
What does this mean ?
Well , if you donate $ 5 , we ’ll donate $ 5 .
Donate $ 10 , we ’ll donate $ 10 .
And so on .
Yes , I ’ve already cleared this with Krissy .
She ’s a fan of Strange Horizons too .
And to give the day as many hours as possible , we ’ll define it as starting midnight Eastern Time but ending at 11:59:59 Pacific
Time , which means that it ’s a 27 - hour donation day .
Which means I ’m retroactively covering donations made today before I published this .
Because , hey : Friday .
Naturally , a good outcome of this would be $ 1,000 in the Strange Horizons coffers for the day .
What I would say would be an even better outcome , however , is an even larger pile of donations sent along to Strange Horizons , for which my and Krissy ’s $ 500 is just the cherry on the top .
Remember all donations to Strange Horizons are tax - deductible for Americans ( if you ’re not in the US , check with your local government ) , so hey : Write - off !
Ca n’t beat that .
Here ’s Strange Horizons ’ 2009 fund drive page , with links to send money via Network for Good and PayPal ( or via old fashioned mail , if you are so inclined ) .
Tell everyone you know about this — we ’re matching any contribution , not just ones from people who come here .
And if you ’re seeing this after August 14 , well , you know .
Donate anyway , please .
Strange Horizons is well worth your support .
So to recap :
a ) Strange Horizons is awesome ;
b) Strange Horizons needs your donations ;
c ) We ’ll match donations today up to $ 500 ;
d ) SO DONATE .
e ) And tell your friends to donate too .
Any questions , drop them in the comments .
Thanks .
And thanks in advance for donating to Strange Horizons today .
I was just going to spend that $ 500 on Red Vines and Coke Zero .
This is a much better use of it .

Those trillions of dollars we 've borrowed from China and then shipped back to China to pay for all of our stuff ?
China 's using them to buy other things , like energy .
The latest move ?
A $ 17 billion bid for a majority stake in Argentinian oil giant YPF .
Will Argentina allow the deal to happen ?
We 'll see .
But if it does n't , you can bet China will just go buy something else .
Aries Poon , WSJ : China National Petroleum Corp. and Cnooc Ltd. have proposed paying at least US $ 17 billion for all of Repsol YPF SA 's stake in YPF , its Argentine unit , two people close to the talks said .
China National Petroleum Corp. and Cnooc Ltd. have proposed paying at least US $ 17 billion for all of Repsol YPF SA 's stake in YPF , its Argentine unit , two people close to the talks said .
The potential deal , which could be the biggest overseas investment by China , highlights the country 's growing thirst for energy resources globally and its willingness to offer big money for access .
It also underlines the ambition of CNPC to build up its presence in South America and elsewhere .
A deal would be another example of how Chinese companies are now working together to buy foreign energy assets after years of working alone .
Read the whole thing >
The stake is being sold by Spain 's Repsol , which needs to sell assets to pay down debt .
The latter sounds familiar .
The WSJ has a nice chart of all the energy assets China has gobbled up in the past two years >
THE woman who inspired The Beatles ' legendary song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds has died aged 46 from an auto - immune disease .
Lucy O'Donnell was at school with John Lennon 's son , Julian , when she was three and it was his picture of her in 1966 that inspired the classic song .
According to various biographies , the young Julian took the picture home to his father and explained : '' It 's Lucy in the sky with diamonds . ''
Inspiration for Lennon 's classic ... Lucy O'Donnell .
The song , which is on the 1967 album Sgt Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , was controversial at the time because of its supposed reference to the drug LSD through its initials , a claim Lennon denied .
Julian Lennon and his childhood friend - who became Lucy Vodden after her marriage - resumed their friendship in recent months after she became ill with lupus , the disease of the immune system that led to her death last week .
'' She was a great supporter of ours and a real fighter .
It 's so sad that she has finally lost the battle she fought so bravely for so long , '' said Angie Davidson of the St Thomas Lupus Trust , which aided Ms Vodden in her illness .
The trust added that Lennon and his mother , Cynthia , were '' shocked and saddened ' ' by Ms Vodden 's death .

low impulse control
high novelty - seeking ( desire to experience new things , take more risks , break convention
no remorse for their actions ( lack of conscience )
inability to see beyond their own needs ( lack of empathy
willing to break rules
always acts in the interest of himself
low impulse control
high novelty - seeking
little remorse for their actions ( would " do it again in a heartbeat " )
inability to see past the needs of others ( very high empathy )
willing to break rules
acts in the best interest of others , or for the " common good " ( because it is the " right thing to do " )
We look at heroes and do - gooders as a special sort of breed ; people who possess extraordinary traits of altruism , or self - less concern for the well - being of others , even at the expense of their own existence .
On the other end , sociopaths also have an extraordinary set of traits , such as extreme selfishness , lack of impulse control , no respect for rules , and no conscience .
As crazy as it sounds , there may be a closer link than than most people would think between the extreme - altruistic personality and sociopathic personality .
Would it shock you to know that two people , one with the traits of extreme - altruism ( X - altruism ) and the other the traits of a sociopath , could be related ?
Even siblings ?
And that their personality traits are very similar , with only a few features to distinguish them ?
Research by Watson , Clark , and Chmielewki from the University of Iowa , " Structures of Personality and Their Relevance to Psychopathology " , present a convincing argument in which they support the growing push for a trait dimensional scheme in the new DSM - V to replace the current categorical system .
Personality has consistently shown to be extremely heritable .
However , the same genetic material arranged and weighted in a slightly different way , may at times express as vastly different phenotypes : the " extremely good " and the " extremely bad " individual .
How is this possible ?
At a first glance , one would be compelled to put the sociopath and the X - atruistic person on opposite ends of a personality scale .
After all , the chances of a serial killer running into a burning building to save a child are pretty slim , right ?
And would n't a hero - type be one of the last people likely to break rules ?
WRONG !!!!
Someone who goes out of their way to help others , even at the expense of their own welfare , is actuallylikely to break rules than the average person .
Think of Dr Ross from the early days of the TV show " ER " .
He was constantly pushing limits , breaking the rules , throwing caution to the wind , all for the sake of the child - patient , even when it ultimately meant getting fired .
On 9/11 , after it was apparent that the buildings were about to collapse , teams of firefighters were called back , yet they disobeyed orders and pushed on anyway , only to perish in the quest to possibly save even one more life .
Those are the actions of a hero , or an X - altruistic personality type .
But consider the type of rule - breaking that the X - altruist engages in - would you classify it as criminal , or even unlawful ?
How does motive factor in ?
People whom we consider to be heroes ( or X - altruists , as I am referring to them here ) , while among some of the most admired individuals , they possess many of the same traits as the sociopath .
However , there is a fundamental difference in the motivation behind their actions that distinguish them from their nasty cohorts .
Incidentally , that one difference is vitally important in determining if someone turns out to be the comic book hero or more like his archenemy .
X- altruists are compelled to good , even when doing so makes no sense and brings harm upon them .
The cannot tolerate injustice , and go to extreme lengths to help those who have been wronged , regardless of their personal relationship to them .
Now , I am not speaking of the guy who helps an old lady cross the street .
I am speaking of the guy who throws himself in front of a speeding bus to push the old lady out of the way , killing himself in the process .
The average , kind , thoughtful person does not take these kinds of extreme personal risks on a regular basis .
If you asked someone with an X - altruistic personality why they take the actions they do ( and I have personal knowledge of at least one person like this ) , they would tell you that they could n't help themselves .
When they are faced with that moment , they just act .
Compulsively .
Barely considering any other course .
The lack the impulse control to stop themselves from doing " the right thing " when it comes to the welfare of others , yet ironically , it almost always results in some form of negative consequence for themselves .
They have no problem breaking the rules when it means helping an innocent , yet they highly value the importance of obeying rules in other contexts .
That 's crazy , you say ?
Now you 're getting the idea .
The word " altruism " conveys images of people like Mother Teresa or Gandhi , passive , extremely self - less people .
They are altruistic , sure .
But the X - altruistic person is anything but passive or meek .
They are often feisty , argumentative , independent , idealistic risk - takers and convention - breakers .
Sound sort of like the sociopathic personality ?
Let 's take a closer look at some similarities and differences between the two .
Sociopath : X- altruist : Both X - altruists and sociopaths have high impulsivity , need for novelty , and the tendency to break rules , but there is a fundamental difference in the motivation driving their behavior .
Someone who is altruistic is always looking to the idealistic good situation , or the way things should be in a fair and just world .
They are able to empathize - feel what the other person is feeling , or imagine themselves in another 's shoes .
This empathy is the force that moves them to engage in heroic behaviors .
They have a need to live in " a fair and just world " , and will go to great lengths to try and maintain that .
They are driven by factors outside of themselves , motivated drives , such as aiding the plight of society or serving the " greater good " .
The sociopath , on the other hand , is motivated byfactors ; selfish desires and the advancement of their own cause , rather than the causes of others or society as a whole .
They do n't have the ability to empathize , so they see no logic in acting in any way other than selfishly , since they cannot imagine themselves in anyone else 's position .
Everything they do is driven by their quest to satisfy their own needs , rather than ( and often at the expense of ) the needs of another person .
If an altruistic person is able to empathize , and thus is motivated to help others , for others , driving them to break rules and put themselves in harms way in order to alleviate the suffering of others or bring fairness to the world .
That extreme empathy , combined with a lower impulse control , the need for novelty , and an intolerance for injustice , is the trait formula of the X - altruistic personality .
Because this type of person often engages in such extreme behavior that results in harm to self on some level , he earns a spot on the dysfunctional end of the personality scale , nearing psychopathology .
Interestingly , these two type of individuals , the sociopath and the X - altruist , may appear similar in their displays of behavior , and at times , even confused for the other type .
If an X - altruistic person is compelled to break rules without remorse in order to help a disadvantaged person , is may seem as if he is acting rebelliously , especially if the motives behind his behavior are not known .
On the other hand , a sociopath may donate a large sum of money to a charity , a seemingly altruistic behavior , but his actions may have been motivated by his selfish need to appear better than or more generous than a colleague .
The defining characteristic that separates the two personality types is their ability to empathize , either not at all or too much , which then drives the extreme behavior of each .
So while the X - altruistic person indeed acts for the good of the people , he often violates laws , breaks rules , or otherwise causes ripples in the order of society .
To be a good citizen , we are required and expected to follow laws at all times .
But we can all agree that the world needs extreme heroes ; they are the ones who consistently go above and beyond the call of duty , for self - less reasons , even when it could mean losing their job , receiving hefty fines , or even serving time in jail .
But are they really criminals ?
Or do we need to bend the rules at times in order to allow for these types of do - gooders to continue on their path , bringing righteousness and justice to an otherwise corrupt world ?
Where do we draw the line between criminality and heroism ?
Here 's an even better question :
How exactly do we support necessary rule - breaking for virtuous intent , yet punish malicious rule - breaking for ill - intent ?
Can it be done ?
Maybe someday we will be able to write public policy that actually serves the best intent of the people , even if it means that once in a while , some rules need to be broken in the process .
I want to send a message out to all of those heroic , X - altruists out there , continually putting their butts on the line for our well - being : Thank you .
The world is a better place because you dare to do good ... even when it seems crazy to do so .* For more on the HEXACO Personality Inventory and how traits define psychopathology , look here .

MIKE ROSS ’ REAL ESTATE PROBLEM ….
Rep. Mike Ross ( D ) of Arkansas , the Blue Dog caucus ’ point - man on health care policy , sold some commercial property in 2007 for a lot more money that it ’s worth .
That , coupled with the pharmacy chain that bought it , makes this a potentially problematic story .
Ross sold Holly ’s Health Mart in Prescott , Ark. , to USA Drug for $ 420,000 — an eye - popping price for real estate in a tiny train and lumber town about 100 miles southwest of Little Rock .
“ You can buy half the town for $ 420,000 , ” said Adam Guthrie , chairman of the county Board of Equalization and the only licensed real estate appraiser in Prescott .
But the $ 420,000 that USA Drug paid for the pharmacy ’s building and land was just the beginning of what Ross and his wife , Holly , made from the sale of Holly ’s Health Mart .
USA Drug owner Stephen L. LaFrance Sr. also paid the Rosses $ 500,000 to $ 1 million for the pharmacy ’s assets and paid Holly Ross an additional $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 for signing a noncompete agreement .
Those numbers , which Mike Ross listed on the financial disclosure reports he files as a member of Congress , bring the total value of the transaction to between $ 1 million and $ 1.67 million .
And that ’s not counting the $ 2,300 campaign contribution Ross received from LaFrance two weeks after the sale closed .

California will be unable to collect nearly $ 1 billion in revenue through the next fiscal year because state workers who collect unpaid taxes cannot keep up with their workload due to furlough days and budget cuts , state finance officials told lawmakers Tuesday .
The setback could further strain California 's budget , contributing to shortfalls in the current and next fiscal years .
Officials from Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger 's administration - from the Department of Finance , the Franchise Tax Board and the Board of Equalization - presented the state Senate Budget Committee on Tuesday with the estimated revenue losses due to the furloughs and budget cuts .
At the hearing , Sen. Denise Moreno Ducheny , D - San Diego , told the officials they should rethink the wisdom of the work stoppages at the tax and equalization boards .
" I just do n't see where we 're getting savings , " a visibly frustrated Ducheny , who chairs the Senate Budget Committee , told a panel of administration officials .
State employees are being forced to take three furlough days each month through June 30 to save the state an estimated $ 1.3 billion this fiscal year .
But those savings have not accounted for the impact on revenue collection .
Among the workers being forced to miss days of work are auditors , tax collectors and other enforcement workers who go after people and businesses that fail to voluntarily pay their taxes .
State officials said they expect that those workers will be able to eventually catch up and collect some of the missed revenue .
However , they noted that some will be forever lost because investigators will miss the statute of limitations in some cases , along with other complications that will allow scofflaws to avoid paying .
Furloughs at the Franchise Tax Board and budget cuts at the Board of Equalization account for only a fraction of the $ 1.3 billion in estimated savings - about $ 100 million in unpaid salaries .
Allowing employees from those two agencies to work full time would bring California enough revenue to cancel at least one furlough day that impacts workers in all departments , Ducheny said .
Officials told the Senate committee that the furloughs and cuts resulted in $ 177 million in uncollected revenue in the last fiscal year , an estimated $ 367 million this fiscal year , and an estimated $ 420 million in the 2010 - 11 year .
The Schwarzenegger administration says despite the loss of revenue for cash - strapped Californians , all employees should be treated equally when it comes to forced time off .
One furlough day a month amounts to roughly a 5 percent cut in pay for state workers .
" At the end of the day , it was recognized that we might lose revenue somewhere , lose morale and productivity , " Pamela Schneider , legislative director for the Department of Personnel Administration , told the committee panel .
But , she said , the decision to go forward was weighed against potential savings .
Asked about the loss of revenue , H.D. Palmer , spokesman for the Department of Finance , said the administration knew the furloughs and cuts would have " different effects on different departments . "
" We see it as part of a way to achieve $ 1.3 billion in savings , " he said .
But that figure does not include loss of revenues .
The Board of Equalization , which has refused to enforce mandatory furloughs , had its budget cut by $ 40.5 million , the equivalent of three furlough days .
Workers have been asked to take a voluntary pay cut and voluntary unpaid leave .
The agency also is likely to face layoffs and officials there estimate general fund losses of up to $ 156 million per year .
Frightening results of Constitution Day survey indicate vast majority of students have little understanding of political system

“ If a nation expects to be ignorant and free , in a state of civilization , it expects what never was and never will be . ”
- Thomas Jefferson
A Constitution Day survey commissioned by the Oklahoma Council of Public Affairs ( OCPA ) has found that the vast majority of high school students do not know that the Constitution represents the supreme law of the United States .
When asked the question
What is the supreme law of the land ?
only 28 % of public high school students in Oklahoma answered correctly .
In addition , over 75 % were unable to identify the first president of the United States as George Washington , with 10 % believing it was either George W. Bush or Barack Obama .
Around 75 % were also unable to identify the name of the first ten amendments to the Constitution , with small percentages answer “ The New Deal ” and “ The Ten Commandments ” .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Alarmingly , just 14 % were able to correctly state that the author of the Declaration of Independence was Thomas Jefferson .
While 34 % said they did n’t know , 7 % thought that Barack Obama wrote it and 2 % frighteningly believed that it had been drawn up by Michael Jackson .
11 % of the students thought that the two major political parties in the U.S. were the Republicans and the Communists .
The questions , posed by national research firm , Strategic Vision , are taken from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services exam , the test that all candidates to become U.S. citizens must take .
As noted by the OCPA in their write up of the survey results , while around 92 % of the people who take the citizenship test pass on their first attempt , only 2.8 % of the students surveyed would have passed the citizenship test .
The results of the survey are displayed below , for further breakdown see the write up :
Question Answer % of Students
Who Answered Correctly
What is the supreme law of the land ?
The Constitution 28
What do we call the first ten amendments to the Constitution ?
The Bill of Rights 26 What are the two parts of the U.S. Congress ?
The House and the Senate 27 How many justices are there on the Supreme Court ?
Nine 10 Who wrote the Declaration of Independence ?
Thomas Jefferson 14
What ocean is on the east coast of the United States ?
Atlantic 61 What are the two major political parities in the United States ?
Democratic and Republican 43
We elect a U.S. senator for how many years ?
Six 11 Who was the first President of the United States ?
George Washington 23
Who is in charge of the executive branch ?
The President 29
Out of 1000 students surveyed , only 6 of them got more than 7 questions correct , and only 108 got more than half of the questions correct .
“ In short , Oklahoma ’s public high - school students have displayed a profound level of ignorance regarding American history , government , and geography . ” the OCPA concludes .
The OCPA also notes that when the same survey was done recently in Arizona , a similar figure , only 3.5 % , of Arizona ’s high - school students passed the citizenship test .

Mary Travers , whose ringing , earnest vocals with the folk trio Peter , Paul and Mary made songs like “ Blowin ’ in the Wind , ” “ If I Had a Hammer ” and “ Where Have All the Flowers Gone ? ” enduring anthems of the 1960s protest movement , died Wednesday night in Danbury Hospital in Connecticut .
She was 72 and had lived in Redding , Conn .
The cause was cancer , said her spokeswoman , Heather Lylis .
Ms. Travers brought a powerful voice and an unfeigned urgency to music that resonated with mainstream listeners .
With her straight blond hair and willowy figure and two bearded guitar players by her side , she looked exactly like what she was , a Greenwich Villager straight from the clubs and the coffee houses that nourished the folk - music revival .
“ She was obviously the sex appeal of that group , and that group was the sex appeal of the movement , ” said Elijah Wald , a folk - blues musician and a historian of popular music .
Here is the complete obituary .
They should 've listened to us three years ago , but Lieberman was with us on " everything except the war " , remember ?
Three years ago the state AFL - CIO convened in New Haven and embraced U.S. Sen .
Joe Lieberman ’s reelection .
Thursday the AFL - CIO reconvened here — and made Lieberman its target .
The occasion was the state labor movement ’s biennial convention at the Omni Hotel .
The convention runs through Friday .
A central theme of this year ’s convention : Push politicians in Washington to pass universal health care with a " public option " — government - backed insurance .
Connecticut Sen. Lieberman has been a prominent opponent of a public option and of moving with what he calls too much speed toward universal coverage .
" Joe ’s gotta go ! " union members yelled at a rally on the Green during Thursday ’s lunch break .
State AFL - CIO chief John Olsen emceed the rally [...]
The labor convention spurned Lamont .
It hailed Lieberman as its friend .
John Olsen lined up the endorsement for Lieberman .
( Read about that here . )
Leaders of individual unions including Yale ’s Locals 34 and 35 proceeded to stage rallies and work the polls for Lieberman ’s reelection .
You would n’t have guessed all that from Thursday ’s convention events .
Charity regulators are investigating the activities of one of the Prince of Wales 's most prominent good causes , the Prince 's Foundation for the Built Environment .
The move was sparked by reports in the Guardian last month that the prince and his charity have influenced the course of a series of major property developments in the UK .
The Charity Commission has announced it is seeking answers from the foundation , which is a registered charity , about whether it has intervened in planning disputes or influenced the choice of architects on projects such as the redevelopment of the £ 1bn Chelsea Barracks site in London .
The foundation is known to have advised on the selection of new architects for the scheme after the prince personally complained to the site 's owners , the Qatari royal family , about the proposed designs by the firm of modernist architect Richard Rogers .
Rogers was subsequently sacked , with the developers citing the prince 's concerns , and five of the 10 firms shortlisted to design a replacement masterplan have close links to the foundation .
The foundation has vehemently denied any wrongdoing , but Republic , the campaign for a democratically elected head of state , has accused Charles of using his charities as " private lobbying firms " .
The Charity Commission has now ordered the foundation to explain its trustee decision - making , the activities it undertakes to further its charitable purposes for the public benefit , and its relationship with Prince Charles .
Further questions were raised after the Guardian revealed that the prince intervened to try to change the architects for a £ 500 m development next to St Paul 's cathedral , and that his aides regularly scrutinise plans by major architects including Sir Terry Farrell , Sir Richard MacCormac , John McAslan and Alan Baxter , who work on some of Britain 's largest building projects .
The foundation describes itself as an educational charity .
" The Charity Commission 's involvement indicates there are serious questions to be answered about the relationship with Prince Charles and the charities he has set up and whether they are pursuing a public good , or working for Charles 's benefit , " said Graham Smith , a spokesman for Republic , which lodged the formal complaint about the foundation .
It included the claim that Charles , who is the charity 's president , " is deliberately using the charity to usurp democratic planning processes and ensure his preferred architects are hired by developers " .
In a letter to Smith this week , the Charity Commission thanked him for bringing the matter to its attention and said that while in law the prince can appoint trustees of a charity , " trustees appointed by the prince have the same duties and responsibilities as other trustees and they need to only act to further the charity 's purposes for the benefit of the public " .
The prince is understood to be closely involved in the charity 's management .
Hank Dittmar , the chief executive of the foundation , strongly denied that the charity was acting in breach of charity law .
" The Republic complaint to the Charity Commission is unfounded and baseless , " he said .
While US federal debt is growing at record levels , the debt of American households and private businesses is actually falling at almost an equally large rate .
The result is that total domestic debt grew only 3.7 % for the one - year period ending June 2008 , as clearly shown by the New York Times chart below .
This is the slowest rate of debt growth since 1950 .
Hence it 's wrong to think that America , as a whole , is leveraging itself to the hilt these days .
As shown by the growth - rates below , the private sector has begun reducing its debt .
Unfortunately , Uncle Sam 's debt has sky - rocketed at the same time .
Thus had the US government been more responsible with its balance sheet , we would have likely seen a historic decline in total domestic debt .
So what US economy does stimulus support ?
It has been preventing a national deleveraging process from taking place , and thereby extending America 's old , broken , leveraged economic model .
Worse yet , it has done this via a shell game of private debt turned into public debt .
By fearing the near - term deflation and GDP decline any rapid deleveraging could cause , the US is delaying much - needed readjustment towards a less - levered and more sustainable US economic growth path .

Enlarge By Charlie Nieibergall , AP Shelley Wolfe , left , and Melisa Keeton , right , hold hands as Rev. Peg Esperanza performs their wedding ceremony on Monday outside the Polk County administrative building in Des Moines .
The couple was the first to obtain a marriage license in the state and be pronounced legally married after the state Supreme Court on Monday issued the final step in clearing the way for such unions .
DES MOINES  Gay and lesbian couples flocked to county buildings throughout Iowa today to marry legally for the first time in the wake of the state supreme court 's landmark same - sex marriage decision .
Melisa Keeton and Shelley Wolfe , a lesbian couple in Iowa 's capital city , exchanged vows outside the Polk County Administration building before a swarm of friends , family and news crews .
" By the power vested in the state of Iowa and God , I now declare you legally married , " said the couple 's pastor , Peg Esperanza of the CHS Rainbow Cyber Church .
" What an honor , " Esperanza added .
" Amen ! " A CLOSER LOOK : Same - sex marriage across Iowa
The ruling made Iowa the third state to allow same - sex marriage , joining Massachusetts and Connecticut , according to the Associated Press .
The ceremony makes Wolfe and Keeton the second same - sex couple to marry in Polk County , but the first to wed after the landmark supreme court decision .
Members of the first couple were Iowa State University students Tim McQuillan and Sean Fritz , who successfully married before a lower - court judge suspended a ruling that allowed gay and lesbian couples to marry .
Wolfe and Keeton were the first couple to receive their license in Polk County , shortly after 8 a.m. today .
They hurried three blocks to the Polk County Courthouse , trailed by reporters , and persuaded a district judge to waive the three - day waiting period ordinary needed to marry in Iowa .
Gay marriage opponents this morning presented county recorders with petitions urging them not to issue licenses , in the wake of the Iowa Supreme Court 's April 3 decision .
The decision , which ignited a political firestorm , made Iowa the first Midwestern state and the third nationwide to allow same - sex couples to wed .
Protesters or petitioners showed up in several counties , including Pocahontas , Sioux , Humboldt , Wayne and Black Hawk .
They wanted recorders to refuse to issue licenses .
Polk County Sheriff Bill McCarthy said he had no reports of protesters .
About eight sheriff 's deputies were assigned to the Polk County administration building this morning " just to keep order , " the sheriff said , adding , " and everything looks orderly . "
The state 's most prominent anti-gay - marriage activist , Chuck Hurley , also showed up the Polk County building this morning .
Hurley , a former legislator who is head of the Iowa Family Policy Center , said his group planned no dramatic protests .
" People I associate with are very much law - abiding people .
They 're not going to chain themselves to their recorders ' offices , " he said , later adding , " But there may be some of that . "
Hurley said a group of Fayette County residents would be at their courthouse this morning to hand over petitions pressing for traditional marriage and urging the recorder to " follow the law . "
He already turned in a stack to Polk County Recorder Julie Haggerty .
" The reason more Iowans who oppose gay marriage are n't making a stand this morning is because they 're " probably raising children , going to work , " Hurley told reporters at the Polk County administration building .

Medicare ’s top officials said in 2006 that they had reduced the number of fraudulent and improper claims paid by the agency , keeping billions of dollars out of the hands of people trying to game the system .
But according to a confidential draft of a federal inspector general ’s report , those claims of success , which earned Medicare wide praise from lawmakers , were misleading .
In calculating the agency ’s rate of improper payments , Medicare officials told outside auditors to ignore government policies that would have accurately measured fraud , according to the report .
For example , auditors were told not to compare invoices from salespeople against doctors ’ records , as required by law , to make sure that medical equipment went to actual patients .
As a result , Medicare did not detect that more than one - third of spending for wheelchairs , oxygen supplies and other medical equipment in its 2006 fiscal year was improper , according to the report .
Based on data in other Medicare reports , that would be about $ 2.8 billion in improper spending .

musings on population
I 've been having rather morbid musings on population at the moment .
The other day I was discussing Malthus , who as any fule know was the bloke who said that when population expands at a greater rate than food production population will then decline due to people dying of malnutrition .
Thats the basic idea and then it was sort of expanded to say and overpopulation can lead to death from increased disease and poverty from living in overcrowded conditions .
And then it became you get population expansion and there will be a RECKONING .
Like Spanish flu or a war that kills us all .
And a lot of people ( or at least several important , educated , government people here ) see HIV or Climate Change as that .
They say they are good things because they will decrease the surplus population .
I would like to mildly point out at this point that the only reason overpopulation is a bad thing is because it leads to hunger , disease and premature death .
So having hunger , disease and prmature death as a solution is n't really winning situation .
Anyway , me and this visitor were discussing the population trends and how we were going to reach 9 billion by 2050 and I gave the example of China in the 1960s which experienced localised ' classic malthus ' where population combined with one years famine led to the deaths of at least 60 million ( in reality prob much higher ) .
Then this maths teacher whose here doing her VSO chirped in rather piously and said ' I thought people were dying in China because they were murdering the girl babies ' .
And I explained no that was a consequence of the mortality , the one child policy was to try and ensure that population growth rate declined so the people who did live had a better chance of surviving , and at first at least it was voluntary , you recieved a loan which you did n't have to pay back if you only had one child , but people kept having a second child and refusing to pay back , and you could n't force them as they had no money .
So then the authorities of the areas were told ' make sure they tow the line , do whatever you have to ' and so you get the forced abortions , sterilisations and people abonding or murdering the female infants because if your only allowed one then its much better to have a boy .
At which point the maths teacher looked like she was about to burst into tears so I stopped this recap of my asia -pacific in post - war period module .
But the question which we began to discuss after she had gone was is it likely that any individual country will adopt a deliberate population policy in the near future , or would such a thing not be possible these days ?
It only worked in China cos they had a powerful non-elected govt .
and you could argue it was only nesecarry because they did n't organise a large scale import of food in times of famine .
Attempts in India have so far been given short shrift .
BROOMFIELD —
Fresh on the heels of several recent proposals to open medical - marijuana dispensaries in Broomfield , the City Council on Tuesday instructed the Planning Department to deny applications to potential distributors and told the City Attorney ’s Office to write briefs supporting council ’s decision .
On Tuesday , the organizers of three potential dispensaries contacted Broomfield to see whether they could set up shop in the city , Planning Director Dave Shinneman said .
City Council members were set to discuss the issue in a study session before the requests were made .
But instead of focusing on the politics or beliefs driving the issue , they tried to frame the discussion in the driest terms imaginable — how the city zoning code would govern where dispensaries could be built .
But the sudden number of permit requests and council members ’ personal opinions quickly took the discussion in a different direction and gave it a sometimes emotional edge .
Councilman Randy Ahrens adamantly opposes distributing marijuana .
“ What we ’re talking about is some people ’s need for weed .
If they really have a medical condition , they have a way to get it , ” Ahrens told the council , referring to drugs containing synthetic THC , a primary component of marijuana .

So apparently punishing terrorists ( assuming we had the right people in the first place ) is n't quite as important as U.S. and British officials make it seem .
It 's all about the oil , baby !
The British government decided it was “ in the overwhelming interests of the United Kingdom ” to make Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al - Megrahi , the Lockerbie bomber , eligible for return to Libya , leaked ministerial letters reveal .
Gordon Brown ’s government made the decision after discussions between Libya and BP over a multi-million - pound oil exploration deal had hit difficulties .
These were resolved soon afterwards .
The letters were sent two years ago by Jack Straw , the justice secretary , to Kenny MacAskill , his counterpart in Scotland , who has been widely criticised for taking the formal decision to permit Megrahi ’s release .
The correspondence makes it plain that the key decision to include Megrahi in a deal with Libya to allow prisoners to return home was , in fact , taken in London for British national interests .
Edward Davey , the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , said : “ This is the strongest evidence yet that the British government has been involved for a long time in talks over al - Megrahi in which commercial considerations have been central to their thinking . ”
Two letters dated five months apart show that Straw initially intended to exclude Megrahi from a prisoner transfer agreement with Colonel Muammar Gadaffi , under which British and Libyan prisoners could serve out their sentences in their home country .
Downing Street had also said Megrahi would not be included under the agreement .
Straw then switched his position as Libya used its deal with BP as a bargaining chip to insist the Lockerbie bomber was included .
The exploration deal for oil and gas , potentially worth up to £ 15 billion , was announced in May 2007 .
Six months later the agreement was still waiting to be ratified .

A search at google scholar suggests that his work was in the area of stochastic models in reliability , though it appears that his academic career was cut short ( the google scholar counts suggest fairly … limited interest in his academic work ) .
From an article in the Telegraph ( UK ) :
Yet although Hatoyama refers jokingly to high office as “ the family business ” , he originally sought to avoid political life .
After graduating from Tokyo University he completed an engineering PhD at Stanford University , and was set for an academic career in the US .
However , his time in America coincided with the nation ’s bicentenary , in 1976 , and the presidential election that saw Gerald Ford replaced by Jimmy Carter .
For the impressionable 29 year - old , it was an astonishing experience : such changes of government simply did n’t happen in Japan , where , despite political and monetary scandals , his grandfather ’s party had remained in power since 1955 .
The AP article has a nice one line definition of operations research :
Hatoyama knows the U.S. well , having obtained three postgraduate degrees from Stanford , including a doctorate in operations research , which consists of using mathematical and scientific models to make decisions within organizations .
Congratulations , Dr. Hatoyama !
Now show the world how operations research training can be translated into political and economic leadership .
UCLA atmospheric scientists have discovered a previously unknown basic mode of energy transfer from the solar wind to the Earth 's magnetosphere .
The research , federally funded by the National Science Foundation , could improve the safety and reliability of spacecraft that operate in the upper atmosphere .
" It 's like something else is heating the atmosphere besides the sun .
This discovery is like finding it got hotter when the sun went down , " said Larry Lyons , UCLA professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences and a co-author of the research , which is in press in two companion papers in the Journal of Geophysical Research .
The sun , in addition to emitting radiation , emits a stream of ionized particles called the solar wind that affects the Earth and other planets in the solar system .
The solar wind , which carries the particles from the sun 's magnetic field , known as the interplanetary magnetic field , takes about three or four days to reach the Earth .
When the charged electrical particles approach the Earth , they carve out a highly magnetized region — the magnetosphere — which surrounds and protects the Earth .
Charged particles carry currents , which cause significant modifications in the Earth 's magnetosphere .
This region is where communications spacecraft operate and where the energy releases in space known as substorms wreak havoc on satellites , power grids and communications systems .
The rate at which the solar wind transfers energy to the magnetosphere can vary widely , but what determines the rate of energy transfer is unclear .
" We thought it was known , but we came up with a major surprise , " said Lyons , who conducted the research with Heejeong Kim , an assistant researcher in the UCLA Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences , and other colleagues .

" This is where everything gets started , " Lyons said .
" Any important variations in the magnetosphere occur because there is a transfer of energy from the solar wind to the particles in the magnetosphere .
The first critical step is to understand how the energy gets transferred from the solar wind to the magnetosphere . "
The interplanetary magnetic field fluctuates greatly in magnitude and direction .
" We all have thought for our entire careers — I learned it as a graduate student — that this energy transfer rate is primarily controlled by the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field , " Lyons said .
" The closer to southward - pointing the magnetic field is , the stronger the energy transfer rate is , and the stronger the magnetic field is in that direction .
If it is both southward and big , the energy transfer rate is even bigger . "
However , Lyons , Kim and their colleagues analyzed radar data that measure the strength of the interaction by measuring flows in the ionosphere , the part of Earth 's upper atmosphere ionized by solar radiation .
The results surprised them .
" Any space physicist , including me , would have said a year ago there could not be substorms when the interplanetary magnetic field was staying northward , but that 's wrong , " Lyons said .
" Generally , it 's correct , but when you have a fluctuating interplanetary magnetic field , you can have substorms going off once per hour .
advertisement
" Heejeong used detailed statistical analysis to prove this phenomenon is real .
Convection in the magnetosphere and ionosphere can be strongly driven by these fluctuations , independent of the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field . "
Convection describes the transfer of heat , or thermal energy , from one location to another through the movement of fluids such as liquids , gases or slow - flowing solids .
" The energy of the particles and the fields in the magnetosphere can vary by large amounts .
It can be 10 times higher or 10 times lower from day to day , even from half - hour to half - hour .
These are huge variations in particle intensities , magnetic field strength and electric field strength , " Lyons said .
The magnetosphere was discovered in 1957 .
By the late 1960s , it had become accepted among scientists that the energy transfer rate was controlled predominantly by the interplanetary magnetic field .
Lyons and Kim were planning to study something unrelated when they made the discovery .
" We were looking to do something else , when we saw life is not the way we expected it to be , " Lyons said .
" The most exciting discoveries in science sometimes just drop in your lap .
In our field , this finding is pretty earth - shaking .
It 's an entire new mode of energy transfer , which is step one .
The next step is to understand how it works .
It must be a completely different process . "
The National Science Foundation has funded ground - based radars which send off radio waves that reflect off the ionosphere , allowing scientists to measure the speed at which the ions in the ionosphere are moving .
The radar stations are based in Greenland and Alaska .
The NSF recently built the Poker Flat Research Range north of Fairbanks .
" The National Science Foundation 's radars have enabled us to make this discovery , " Lyons said .
" We could not have done this without them . "
The direction of the interplanetary magnetic field is important , Lyons said .
Is it going in the same direction as the magnetic field going through the Earth ?
Does the interplanetary magnetic field connect with the Earth 's magnetic field ?
" We thought there could not be strong convection and that the energy necessary for a substorm could not develop unless the interplanetary magnetic field is southward , " Lyons said .
" I 've said it and taught it .
Now I have to say , ' But when you have these fluctuations , which is not a rare occurrence , you can have substorms going off once an hour . ' "
Lyons and Kim used the radar measurements to study the strength of the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth 's magnetosphere .
One of their papers addresses convection and its affect on substorms to show it is a global phenomenon .
" When the interplanetary magnetic field is pointing northward , there is not much happening , but when the interplanetary magnetic field is southward , the flow speeds in the polar regions of the ionosphere are strong .
You see much stronger convection .
That is what we expect , " Lyons said .
" We looked carefully at the data , and said , ' Wait a minute !
There are times when the field is northward and there are strong flows in the dayside polar ionosphere . ' "
The dayside has the most direct contact with the solar wind .
" It 's not supposed to happen that way , " Lyons said .
" We want to understand why that is . "
" Heejeong separated the data into when the solar wind was fluctuating a lot and when it was fluctuating a little , " he added .
" When the interplanetary magnetic field fluctuations are low , she saw the pattern everyone knows , but when she analyzed the pattern when the interplanetary magnetic field was fluctuating strongly , that pattern completely disappeared .
Instead , the strength of the flows depended on the strength of the fluctuations .
" So rather than the picture of the connection between the magnetic field of the sun and the Earth controlling the transfer of energy by the solar wind to the Earth 's magnetosphere , something else is happening that is equally interesting .
The next question is discovering what that is .
We have some ideas of what that may be , which we will test . "

A Georgia man is none too happy that his memory - filled family home , lovingly hand built " brick by brick " by Pop , is now a scene of rubble - strewn desolation after a demolition firm used a GPS to identify its victim and moved in for the kill .
Al Byrd of Sandy Springs got a bit of a shock earlier this month when someone called to let him know the Carroll County house was no more .
Byrd had lived there with his nine brothers and sisters , and the house still contained precious heirlooms including " mom ’s dining room set … her hutch * with her dishes in there " .
These Little House on the Prarie touches meant nothing to the Marietta wrecking outfit , apparently acting on the instructions of another unnamed Texas company , who flattened the building .
The carnage was witnessed by Byrd 's cousin , who captured video images of " a bulldozer in the yard of the house with dumpsters loaded with rubble " .
Byrd confronted the destroyers , who said they had " paperwork " .
He recounted : " I said , ‘ Paperwork for what ? ’ and he said , ‘ For the house , to demolish the house . ’
I said , ‘ I ’m the owner of the house , I have n’t given anybody any authority to demolish this house . ’
“ I said , ‘ What address did you have ? ’ and he said , ‘ They sent me some GPS coordinates . ’
I said , ‘ Do n’t you have an address ? ’ [ and ] he said , ‘ Yes , my GPS coordinates led me right to this address here and this house was described . ’”
Byrd 's gardener had witnessed evidence of the impending apocalypse - in the form of a missing power box and " holes punched in the walls " - prior to the destruction , but these had been dismissed as vandalism .
A very upset Byrd , who reckons a house across the street was the intended target , thundered : “ You ca n’t imagine .
It ’s just incredulous that something like this can happen and no one contact the owner . "
Wsbtv.com has a sobering slideshow of lots and lots of rubble here . ®

My ROCK Radio .
The number two in my cement - audio - series .
It started of being a very nice rectangular brick shape .
Then I found out that a thick layer of cement shields the radio from actually receiving radio waves .

In my next attempt , I will leave the interface on the back open , see if that works …
Left entry = loudspeaker , middle = antenna , right= power ( I found out that plugging the power in the loudspeaker entry did n’t harm the radio , and I thought no icons to point out which plug should sit where was kind of cool )
EXTREMELY LOUD ALSO , PLZ TURNN DOWN YOUR VOLUME ...
The BRICs and what the BRICs would be without China …
In case you missed it …and unless you were in Lente , Italy this weekend you probably did … the G8 Finance Ministers met to reassure one another of their relevance .
By this metric alone , they were not very successful .
Not only has the G8 been rightfully eclipsed by the G20 as the relevant forum for addressing the current financial crisis , but many of the reasons for past G8 meetings seem to have faded or been overtaken by developments .
First , the European members of the group only have one monetary policy between them and that one does n’t seem to be going so well .
Next , European leaders have effectively opted out from anything other than rhetorical interventions in world markets in the wake of the crisis .
Third , even on the rhetorical front there is precious little consensus among the leaders of these countries .
This last point is ironic since the reason G8 - ophiles give for continuing to operate the group even given the absence of the key emerging economies is that we need to gather “ like - minded ” countries .
But the Europeans want big change in the international system .
And the Americans seem to want as little change as possible .
No meaningful addressing of the “ too big to fail ” issue .
No meaningful addressing of executive compensation .
No meaningful regulatory reform .
( Just strengthened coordination which , without new global rules and enforcement mechanisms , is just a page from the “ what I said before only louder ” policy playbook , a favorite for the governments everywhere .
For another example see again the recent U.N. “ sanctions ” against North Korea . )
The whole approach to the financial crisis seems to be : “ What ?
There ’s no wizard ?
There ’s a man behind the curtain ?!
Shit .
Give me a drink of stimulus .
In fact , give me enough shots of stimulus that I can forget that there ’s no man behind the curtain and get back to believing in the wizard .
Gosh , I loved that wizard .
Wizard … wizard … where are you wizard ? ” )
If because you missed the relevance of the G8 gathering then you may be forgiven for not recognizing that the session ’s irrelevance is being underscored by the relative importance of the meeting in a couple days of leaders of the BRIC countries in Ekaterinberg in Russia .
This site was no doubt offered up the Russians because of its rich , resonant irony .
That ’s because it was near Ekaterinberg that the last of the czars and his family finally met their end , and it is at this location the BRICs hope to realize the promise of Fareed Zakaria ’s Post - American World by cutting down to size the closest thing to an imperial power the world has these days … which sadly , fellow Americans , would be us .
The not - so - secret weapon of this group , besides their size , their resources , their power and , most importantly , their growing significance , is their ability to coordinate their policies .
This is not so easy , their interests often conflict ( example : Brazil and India want in to the U.N. Security Council , Russia and China are not so enthusiastic about their joining ) .
But try to imagine our arriving at a solution to the problems in North Korea or with Iran ’s nuclear program , containing threats in Pakistan , stability in Central Asia , or from climate change , or running the world trading system without them and you see the potency of the group … if they stick together .
This is particularly true with the one issue that no doubt will be central to this week ’s discussions — their effort to assert significant influence over the future value of the dollar .
In recent months , BRIC leaders have argued for the adoption of a new international currency ( not so realistic ) , they have shown a willingness to purchase / use IMF SDRs ( standard drawing rights , a kind of currency equivalent ) instead of dollars , and they have talked about their doubts about the dollar .
It is often said that it would hurt the Chinese and the others for the dollar to collapse given their currency holdings and their dependency on trade with and investment from the United States .
And while this is true , that does n’t minimize the leverage they gain from proving to the world that they can play a role in establishing the price of the dollar and that they are not unwilling to use this power .
In fact , their recent statements and actions prove this but I think it ’s fair to speculate that they will , at some point , rattle the saber even louder to enhance the leverage they already have .
( It ’s a power they ’ve used increasingly .
The Chinese called the U.S. Treasury during the Fannie Mae crisis to demand action with the more than implicit “ or else ” being the sell off of U.S. government securities . )
Having said all this …and despite the importance of Russia ’s oil and nukes , India ’s billion people and promise and Brazil ’s continental size , ag export leadership , and recent oil discoveries … there is one critical fact to remember about the BRICs :
Without China , the BRICs are just the BRI , a bland , soft cheese that is primarily known for the whine that goes with it .
China is the muscle of the group and the Chinese know it .
They have effective veto power over any BRIC initiatives because without them , who cares really ?
They are the one with the big reserves .
They are the biggest potential market .
They are the U.S. partner in the G2 ( imagine the coverage a G2 meeting gets vs. a G8 meeting ) and the E2 ( no climate deal without them ) and so on .
And so while the Russians have been the most eager of organizers of the BRICs because they want to create a counterbalance to U.S. power ( not a terrible thing , I think for the world or for the United States given what we ’ve seen of our tendencies when we do when being the sole superpower goes to our head ) , we should see the emergence of the BRIC bloc for what it is at its heart , a major amplifier of the influence of the country at its heart , China .
As an aside , I do n’t think we should see the rise of a counterbalancing bloc as a terrible thing either for the world or even for America .
While having enemies is to be avoided wherever possible , having rivals is essential .
It promotes reevaluation and growth .
Imagine what computing would be like if we lived in an all Microsoft , Apple - less world .
They make each other better .
( Which in that case means Microsoft forces the smaller Apple to be innovative and Apple forces the Microsoft behemoth to be less awful . )
That said , we should also recognize how far the bloc has come in its development and consider that in the future they are — strengths , weaknesses , imbalances , tensions and all — the most likely counterbalance to U.S. influence …and for that matter to the influence of more radical voices like those of rogue states or of extremist Islam somehow united ( which is much less likely than the BRICs keeping their act together . )
Having said that , I have to emphasize that they are not a direct threat to the United States and we should not view them as an enemy .
Their efforts to align themselves actually is likely to diminish the tendency that any one of them may have ( I ’m talking about you , Vladimir ) to stray into more confrontational postures .
And so long as they responsibly play the voice they assert they seek — as an effective counterbalance to the U.S. representing the equities of major populations worldwide — they actually have a very constructive and useful role to play in global affairs .

Toxic Assets
The Trafigura scandal is just one of thousands of cases of the rich world ’s fly - tipping
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian , 22nd September 2009
It was revolting , monstrous , inhumane – and scarcely different from what happens in Africa almost every day .
The oil trading company Trafigura has just agreed to pay compensation to 31,000 people in Cote d’Ivoire , after the Guardian and the BBC ’s Newsnight obtained emails sent by its traders ( 1 ) .
They reveal that Trafigura knew that the oil slops it sent there in 2006 were contaminated with toxic waste ( 2 ) .
But the Ivorian contractor it employed to pump out the hold of its tanker dumped them around inhabited areas in the capital city and the countryside .
Tens of thousands of people fell ill and 15 died ( 3 ) .
It is one of the world ’s worst cases of chemical exposure since the gas leak at the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal .
But in all other respects the Trafigura case is unremarkable .
It ’s just another instance of the rich world ’s global fly - tipping .
On the day that the Guardian published the company ’s emails , it also carried a story about a shipwreck discovered in 480 metres of water off the Italian coast ( 4 ) .
Detectives found the ship after a tip - off from a mafioso .
It appears to have been carrying drums of nuclear waste when the mafia used explosives to scuttle it .
The informant , Francesco Fonti , said that his clan had been paid £ 100,000 to get rid of it .
What makes this story interesting is that the waste appears to be Norwegian .
Norway is famous for its tough environmental laws , but a shipload of nuclear waste does n’t go missing without someone high up looking the other way .
Italian prosecutors are investigating the scuttling of a further 41 ships .
But most of them were n’t sunk , like Fonti ’s vessel , off the coast of Italy ; they were lost off the coast of Somalia .
When the great tsunami of 2004 struck the Somali coast , it dumped and smashed open thousands of barrels on the beaches and in villages up to 10 km inland ( 5 ) .
According to the United Nations , they contained clinical waste from western hospitals , heavy metals , other chemical junk and nuclear waste .
People started suffering from unusual skin infections , bleeding at the mouth , acute respiratory infections and abdominal haemorrhages ( 5a ) .
The barrels had been dumped in the sea , a UN spokesman said , for one obvious reason : it cost European companies around $ 2.50 a tonne to dispose of the waste this way , while dealing with them properly would have cost “ something like $ 1000 a tonne . ” ( 6 ) On the seabed off Somalia lies Europe ’s picture of Dorian Grey : the skeleton in the closet of the languid new world we have made .
The only people who have sought physically to stop this dumping are Somali pirates .
Most of them take to the seas only for blood and booty ; but some have formed coastal patrols to stop over - fishing and illegal dumping by foreign fleets ( 7,8,9 ) .
Some of the vessels being protected from pirates by Combined Task Force 151 – the rich world ’s policing operation in the Gulf of Aden – have come to fish illegally or dump toxic waste .
The warships make no attempt to stop them .
The law could n’t be clearer : the Basel convention , supported by European directives , forbids EU or OECD nations from dumping hazardous wastes in poorer countries ( 10,11,12 ) .
But without enforcement the law is useless .
So , for example , while all our dead electronic equipment is supposed to be recycled by licensed companies at home , according to Consumers International around 6.6 million tonnes of it leaves the European Union illegally every year ( 13 ) .
Much of it lands in West Africa .
An investigation by the Mail on Sunday found computers which once belonged to the National Health Service being broken up and burnt by children on Ghanaian rubbish dumps ( 14 ) .
They were trying to extract copper and aluminium by burning off the plastics , with the result that they were inhaling lead , cadmium , dioxins , furans and brominated flame retardants ( 15 ) .
Tests in another of the world ’s great flytips – Guiyu in China – show that 80 % of the children of that city have dangerous levels of lead in their blood ( 16 ) .
In February , working with Sky News and the Independent , Greenpeace placed a satellite tracking device in a dead television and left it at a recycling centre in Basingstoke run by Hampshire County Council ( 17,18 ) .
It passed through the hands of the council ’s recycling company , then found its way first to Tilbury docks then to Lagos , where the journalists bought it back from a street market .
Under EU law , used electronic equipment can be exported only if it ’s still working , but Greenpeace had made sure the TV was unusable .
A black market run by criminal gangs is dumping our electronic waste on the poor , but since the European directive banning this practice was incorporated into British law in January 2007 , the Environment Agency has n’t made a single prosecution ( 19 ) .
Dump your telly over a hedge and you can expect big trouble .
Dump 10,000 in Nigeria and you can expect to get away with it .
If the mafia were to establish itself as an effective force in this country , it would do so by way of the waste disposal industry .
All over the world the cosa nostra , yakuza , triads , bratva and the rest make much of their fortune by disposing of our uncomfortable truths .
It suits all the rich nations – even , it seems , the government of Norway – not to ask too many questions , as long as the waste goes to faraway countries of which we know little .
Only when the mobs make the mistake of dumping it off their own coasts does the state start to get huffy .
The Trafigura story is a metaphor for corporate capitalism .
The effort of all enterprises is to keep the profits and dump the costs on someone else .
Price risks are dumped on farmers , health and safety risks are dumped on sub-contractors , insolvency risks are dumped on creditors , social and economic risks are dumped on the state , toxic waste is dumped on the poor , greenhouse gases are dumped on everyone .
Another story that broke on the same day was the shifting , by Barclays , of £ 7bn of residential mortgage assets and collateralised debt obligations to a fund in the Cayman Islands ( 20 ) .
These were universally described by the media as toxic assets .
Some traders also call them toxic waste .
Everyone understands the metaphor even if they have n’t thought it through : the banks seek to dump their liabilities while clinging onto their assets .
Perhaps it comes as no surprise to find that Trafigura also runs a hedge fund , or that Lord Strathclyde , leader of the Conservatives in the House of Lords , is a director ( 21 ) .
That party , like New Labour , advocates the continuing deregulation of business .
The Trafigura case , like the financial crisis , suggests that in business there are people ruthless enough to shut their eyes to almost anything if they think they can make money .
Business without regulation is scarcely distinguishable from organised crime .
Regulation without strict enforcement is an open invitation to mess with people ’s lives .
Tedious directives , state power and bureaucratic snooping – the interference that everyone professes to hate – are all that stand between civilisation and corporate hell .

Mark Easton blog : London without the Thames A " furious " London Mayor Boris Johnson has ordered Transport for London ( TfL ) to restore the River Thames on revised Tube maps .
TfL distributed the maps last weekend without the River Thames or the fare zones marked on it .
The mayor reacted angrily when he was told of the missing river on his return from New York , BBC London has learned .
TfL said the Thames would return on future maps following an " overwhelming public reaction " .
On Wednesday TfL said it had removed the fare zones and the river from the revised map as the previous map had become " cluttered " and lost its " simplicity " .
TfL added it was responding to the feedback from passengers .
' Thames reunited '
Mr Johnson said : " I hope Londoners will imagine the Thames in place until it reappears on the maps , and will not forget their beautiful river . "
A TfL spokesman said : " The overwhelming public reaction is that the Tube and Thames should be reunited , so that 's exactly what we will do .
" New maps showing the Thames will be reintroduced from December , the date of the next scheduled revision of the map .
" We are also looking again at the provision of zonal information to ensure that it is widely available to customers and aim to reach a conclusion on that , also by December , when the new Circle Line service needs to be reflected . "
TfL added that it will look at other ways to prevent the map from " becoming too cluttered to be useful " .
' Insulting to London ' Passenger watchdog London TravelWatch and Visit London criticised TfL 's move saying the revision made the map " confusing " .
An employee of London Underground wrote to BBC London anonymously claiming they have " already received complaints from the public about the missing zones " .
Writing to BBC London other people called the revision " terrible " , " incredibly stupid " and " insulting to London " .
Jonathan Howard wrote : " It is so much clearer , and if people want a map with zones , they only have to look at the London Connections map which is displayed alongside . "

WASHINGTON - Critics say a proposal by Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus to raise money for the health care overhaul by taxing insurers on their most expensive plans could hit middle - class pocketbooks - particularly in New England , where health costs are high .
Baucus has proposed paying for more than a quarter of his $ 750 billion health care proposal with a 35 percent excise tax on “ gold - plated ’ ’ insurance plans .
It would be levied on insurance companies , which could pass on the expense to their customers .
The tax was meant to be a compromise , but it has already caused an uproar on both sides of the political aisle , with liberals and conservatives alike complaining it would hurt low - and moderate - income workers and older workers - particularly in high - cost areas .
The tax would hit about 10 percent of plans and 8 percent of taxpayers nationwide , according to Baucus ’s aides , who said state - specific estimates were not available .
It is designed to not only raise revenue but also to discourage employers from offering so - called Cadillac health insurance policies , generous plans that many economists say encourage people to use more health services than they need , driving up prices for everyone .
But critics say the tax would disproportionately affect workers who are sick - and therefore choose plans that have better benefits - or older , since older workers can be charged more for their insurance .
“ A more expensive plan is n’t necessarily a better plan ; it just may mean the workforce is older , ’’ said Celia Wcislo , assistant division director of Service Employees International Union 1199 and a member of the Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector Authority board .
She said people with plans that offer maximum flexibility may have an illness that requires them to see their doctor often or to consult a range of specialists .
The tax would apply only to the marginal difference between the cost of the plan and the price thresholds set in the bill - $ 8,000 for an individual plan and $ 21,000 for a family plan - not to the total cost of the policy .
Baucus has included a three - year transition period to cushion the blow in the 17 most expensive states , including Massachusetts , which has the highest premiums in the country for family plans .
But because the thresholds would rise each year at the rate of inflation - not medical inflation , which is much higher - the tax would probably affect a significant number of New Englanders within a few years .
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Hackers will soon gain a powerful new tool for breaking into Oracle Corp ’s database , the top - selling business software used by companies to store electronic information .
Security experts have developed an easy - to - use , automated software tool that can remotely break into Oracle databases over the Internet to simulate attacks on computer systems , but cybercrooks can use it for hacking .
The tool ’s authors created it through a controversial open - source software project known as Metasploit , which releases its free software over the Web .
Chris Gates , a security tester who co-developed the Metasploit tool , will unveil it next week at the annual Black Hat conference in Las Vegas , where thousands of security experts and hackers will gather to exchange trade secrets .
“ Anyone with no skill and knowledge can download and run it , ” said Pete Finnigan , an independent consultant who specializes in Oracle security and who advises large corporations and government agencies .
He has not yet studied the Oracle tool but is familiar with other Metasploit software and said it works by automating many of the complicated procedures required to hack into Oracle databases , allowing amateurs to hack into them .
Oracle , which declined to comment , has already issued patches to protect against vulnerabilities that the Metasploit tool targets .
But some companies are not diligent in upgrading their software to add the patches , so they are vulnerable to attackers using the new tool .
They hire consultants like Gates to help them make sure they are protected .
Metasploit hacks are available for other software programs , including Microsoft Corp ’s Windows as well as the Firefox and Internet Explorer browsers .
Gates said this is the first Metasploit program to target Oracle ’s database .
“ There is no way to keep these tools out of the hands of people who want to use them for nefarious purposes , ” said Alan Paller , director of research for the SANS Institute .
SANS trains security professionals in areas including use of Metasploit .
Security testers and hackers have previously used other programs to break into Oracle databases , but the new software from Metasploit is easier to operate and runs more quickly than existing options , said Gates .
Metasploit is the most widely used free hacking tool and has a loyal following in the security community .
In addition to letting hackers break into databases over the Internet , the Metasploit tool allows rogue employees to access them from their work PCs .
Workers could break into an Oracle system and secretly steal confidential data such as credit card numbers , give themselves pay raises or make other changes to corporate databases , said Finnigan , who has specialized in Oracle security for eight years .
Green energy producer Canadian Hydro Developers Inc. announced plans Monday to acquire what it says will be the largest offshore wind operation in the world .
The 4,000 - megawatt offshore wind prospect in Ontario will be acquired from U.S- based Wasatch Wind Inc. Financial details were n't disclosed .
The wind prospect to be acquired is located between five to 30 kilometres offshore in one of the Great Lakes bordering Ontario , although Canadian Hydro did n't identify the lake .
Multiple regulatory and environmental approvals will be required from the Ministry of Natural Resources before construction can proceed .
When complete it will be able to supply enough renewable energy to power over two million homes .
Canadian Hydro anticipates the prospect will be built in stages with the first phase coming online by the fourth quarter of 2014 .
" This is a tremendous growth opportunity for our company and our shareholders , and a perfect fit with our long - term strategy and position as a market leader in Canada , " said Kent Brown , Canadian Hydro 's chief executive officer .
" We are eager to pioneer offshore wind in Ontario and North America . "
Canadian Hydro has been fending off a $ 654 - million hostile takeover offer from Calgary - based power generator TransAlta Corp. , which has been extended several times since it was first made in July .
Wasatch Wind is a Utah - based wind project developer with activities throughout the western U.S. and Ontario .
Its Canadian division is based in Windsor .
Sulforapane is found in broccoli and brussel sprouts Researchers have discovered a possible reason why green vegetables such as broccoli , cabbage and cauliflower are good for the heart .
Their work suggests a chemical found in the vegetables can boost a natural defence mechanism to protect arteries from disease .
The Imperial College London team hope their work could lead to new dietary treatments to prevent heart problems .
Details appear in Arteriosclerosis Thrombosis and Vascular Biology .
BRASSICAS Broccoli Cabbage Kale Brussels sprouts Cauliflower Bok choy Rocket Much heart disease is caused by the build up of fatty plaques in the arteries known as atherosclerosis .
However , arteries do not get clogged up with these plaques in a uniform way .
Bends and branches of blood vessels - where blood flow is disrupted and can be sluggish - are much more prone to the build - up .
The latest study has shown that a protein that usually protects against plaque build up called Nrf2 is inactive in areas of arteries that are prone to disease .
However , it also found that treatment with a chemical found in green " brassica " vegetables such as broccoli can activate Nrf2 in these disease - prone regions .
Lead researcher Dr Paul Evans said : " We found that the innermost layer of cells at branches and bends of arteries lack the active form of Nrf2 , which may explain why they are prone to inflammation and disease .
" Treatment with the natural compound sulforaphane reduced inflammation at the high - risk areas by ' switching on ' Nrf2 .
" Sulforaphane is found naturally in broccoli , so our next steps include testing whether simply eating broccoli , or other vegetables in their ' family ' , has the same protective effect .
" We also need to see if the compound can reduce the progression of disease in affected arteries . "
Targeted approaches Professor Peter Weissberg , medical director of the British Heart Foundation , which funded the research , said : " These fascinating findings provide a possible mechanism by which eating vegetables protects against heart disease .
" As well as adding evidence to support the importance of eating ' five - a - day ' , the biochemistry revealed in this research could lead to more targeted dietary or medical approaches to prevent or lessen disease that leads to heart attacks and strokes . "
Using normal mice , and mice engineered to lack the Nrf2 protein , the research found that in straight sections of arteries Nrf2 was present in the endothelial ' lining ' cells .
Through its action on other proteins , it prevented the cells from becoming inflamed , an early stage in the development of atherosclerosis .
In the lining cells of disease - prone sites - such as bending or branched arteries - Nrf2 was attached to a protein that made it inactive .
This stifled its protective properties .
But the addition of sulforaphane re-activated Nrf2 in the disease - prone regions of the artery , restoring the cells ' ability to protect themselves from becoming inflamed .
The researchers believe that this will enable these artery regions to remain healthy for longer , or even reduce the progression of existing disease .

I know many of you people are fans of games like Railroad Tycoon or Transport Tycoon .
There were the best .
But if you 're looking for something more complex I have a tip for you - Simutrans .
It 's a freeware transportation simulator .
It 's being written by bunch of crazies ( read people who willingly spend their free time by writting a code - which reminds me of someone ) .
Today it is far more complex than the old tycoons though grafic is nearly the same as in old transport tycoon and it is still developing .
When I was playing this game for first time I was amazed - however the game was only for few choosen people as you had to configure .ini file to get the game running
Now you can run and configure it only with single click as they made a lot of work on user friendliness .
You can download the simutrans on http://www.simutrans.com
One joke on the end :

In movies , the CIA has so many prolifically lethal assassins roaming the world that the main problem often seems to be reining them in .
But details that spilled out this week about a real CIA assassination program indicate that when the plotting is being done by spies instead of screenwriters , the obstacles are not so easy to surmount .
According to current and former U.S. intelligence officials , the CIA spent seven years trying to assemble teams capable of killing the world ’s most wanted terrorists but could never find a formula that worked .
The struggles came during a period in which the agency had been given unprecedented authority and resources , and a cause -- responding to the Sept. 11 attacks -- with broad public support .

But officials could not solve daunting logistical problems , including how to get teams close to their targets while keeping U.S. involvement secret and being able to extract them safely if they succeeded in killing a terrorist .
In interviews , current and former U.S. intelligence officials said the aim of the effort was broader than has been described in newspaper accounts this week .
In particular , officials said , ambitions for the program expanded to include creating teams that were made up not only of CIA personnel but counterparts from other countries , presumably Pakistan ; and to be capable not just of killing high - value targets but also executing raids and other operations to gather evidence and intelligence that might lead to elusive Al Qaeda leaders Osama bin Laden and Ayman Zawahiri .
Former officials said support for the program persisted in recent years largely because it could compensate for a crucial shortcoming in the ongoing campaign of Predator strikes .
The drones had emerged as a potent weapon against Al Qaeda in Pakistan but had failed to bring the agency closer to Bin Laden .

“ The bottom line is that you ’ve still got No. 1 and No. 2 out there , ” one former high - ranking U.S. intelligence official said .
“ If all you do is blow stuff up and burn stuff up , you never get information that could lead you to the prize . ”
As a result , CIA leaders continued to pursue the idea of elite paramilitary teams that could mount lethal operations on short notice but also quietly capture lower - ranking Al Qaeda members and raid sites struck by Predator missiles to gather any intelligence material left behind .
“ If I can just get in there and get information off the ground , I might find one piece of information that ’s going to lead me to the prize , ” the former official said .
The broader dimensions of the program may account for why some lawmakers , particularly Republicans , have been critical of CIA Director Leon E. Panetta ’s decision last month to kill it .

House Democrats , angry that the program was kept secret from Congress , at least partially at the urging of former Vice President Dick Cheney , have threatened an investigation .
Lawmakers on Wednesday continued sparring over Cheney ’s role and whether Congress had been properly briefed .
The CIA said the program was never of substantial value to U.S. efforts .
“ The program [ Panetta ] killed was never fully operational and never took a single terrorist off the battlefield , ” said George Little , a CIA spokesman .
“ We ’ve had a string of successes against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups , and that program did n’t contribute to any of them . ”

The broader objectives of the program may also help to explain why top counter - terrorism officials saw a need for the CIA to develop its own elite paramilitary teams , rather than relying on U.S. military special operations troops deployed across Afghanistan .
Former intelligence officials said there were intermittent discussions about having special operations troops assigned to the CIA as part of the program , but it was not clear how far those plans progressed .
A second former official with extensive knowledge of the CIA effort said it was seen as crucial that the units reside within the CIA so that the U.S. government would be able to deny involvement if a team were exposed or captured .
Special operations forces routinely carry out clandestine missions , but unlike their CIA counterparts they operate with the expectation that their ties to the U.S. government will not be denied if the mission breaks down .

“ Keeping activities like this secret is the biggest challenge , ” said the second former U.S. intelligence official .
The vulnerability of being far removed from U.S. protection was seen as another major barrier to the success of the program .
Even if an assassination team were deployed and succeeded in killing a senior Al Qaeda figure , “ what happens to the shooter ? ” said Mark Lowenthal , a former senior CIA official .
“ We do n’t send people on suicide missions .
I ’m sure they were troubled by how to get the guy out of there . ”
In its initial conception , in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks , the CIA program was seen mainly as an effort to assemble teams capable of carrying out targeted killings .
But officials have said that it went through multiple “ iterations . ”
Advertisement
Most recently , the program ’s focus had shifted toward intelligence collection , officials said , the latest in a series of efforts toward the end of the George W. Bush administration to find Bin Laden .
In that respect , some officials thought the program could replicate on a small scale the successful formula that the U.S. military had employed as part of the “ surge ” in Iraq , carrying out raids , exploiting the information gathered , and launching follow - up operations in swift succession .
However , different objectives brought different challenges , officials said , including how to get the right mix of personnel that could operate in the badlands of Pakistan without being captured or exposed .
Former officials declined to say whether the CIA had ever held discussions with Pakistan about setting up hybrid teams with members of the Pakistani military or its main spy service , Inter - Services Intelligence .
But one former official said that few officials thought the initiative could succeed solely with U.S. personnel .

“ If you ’re born in Kansas , you ’re always from Kansas , ” the former official said .
“ I do n’t care you long you grow your beard , you ’re still from Kansas . ”
The CIA has sought to carry out assassinations at various times in its history , most notably during the 1960s when it launched a series of botched attempts to kill Cuban dictator Fidel Castro .
The agency has traditionally had paramilitary capabilities as part of its Special Activities Division , which swelled in size after the Sept. 11 attacks and is made up mainly of former members of U.S. military special operations forces .
But carrying out close - range killings “ is something they do n’t really have a capacity for , ” said a former senior CIA official .
“ There really is n’t Jason Bourne walking around doing stuff like this .
The paramilitary guys are mostly retired forces ; they ’re more for training and working with the Kurds ( an ethnic group in northern Iraq ) and things like that . ”

The commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks cited a series of botched attempts to kill Bin Laden in the late 1990s .
The CIA ’s struggles with the secret program show that “ the practical obstacles of setting this up are formidable , ” said Philip Zelikow , who was staff director of the commission .
Citing the contrast with depictions in Hollywood , Zelikow said the agency ’s efforts served as “ one of the more spectacular demonstrations of the real world versus the imagined world of government omnipotence . ”

It ’s not often that bacteria make water more drinkable , but a new microbial desalination cell does precisely that .
The proof - of - principle system removed 90 per cent of the salt from a seawater - like solution .
“ We just wanted to show that it was possible , ” says Bruce Logan , an electrical engineer at Pennsylvania State University in University Park who helped make the prototype .
“ We hope that there will be more research going into this and it could lead to a commercial technology , ” he adds .
Microbial desalination could offer big advantages over the methods currently used to purify seawater , which require enormous pressure to operate , and gobble up huge amounts of energy .
Salt licked
Logan and colleagues at Tsinghua University in Beijing , China , adapted one of these techniques , electrodialysis , in which electricity draws ions from salt water through semipermeable membranes into two chambers – negatively charged chlorine ions in one and positively charged sodium ions into another – leaving the water salt - free .
Advertisement
Logan ’s team replaced an external source of electricity with a microbial fuel cell , which transforms bacteria into batteries .
When the bacteria metabolise nutrients – acetate in this case – they generate protons and electrons .
The researchers then used these positive and negative charges to drive desalination by electrodialysis .
The device removed between 88 and 94 per cent of the salt from various salt - water solutions , including one that approximated sea water .
This water might still leave you thirsty , but Logan thinks that efficiency can be improved .
Furthermore , even with its performance so far , microbial desalination could produce drinking water from brackish waters that contain much less salt than seawater .
“ You could also consider this to be a pre-treatment technology for seawater , ” he says .
Using microbial fuel cells to draw most of the salt out of seawater first could make conventional desalination techniques , such as reverse osmosis , more economical .
Cheaper charge
That ’s not to say that microbial desalination is cheap , at least not now : Logan ’s team fed the bacteria expensive laboratory - grade acetate .
But the team is working on microbial fuel cells that subsist on waste water .
“ Instead of spending money to treat waste water , why not get some electricity from it and help to desalinate some water ? ” he asks .
Lars Angenent , a microbial fuel cell researcher at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , says that advances in electrode and membrane materials will be key to commercialising microbial desalination and other microbial fuel cell technologies .
“ It is possible , but is it economical ? ” Angenent asks .
“ I ’m sceptical , but after a couple of beers I ’m much more positive . ”

Um .
What 's going on here ?
I hate to break the news to you , Mr. Heimbach , but what you describe would be called a :
Road Trip
Wikipedia defines a road trip as : " A journey via automobile , sometimes unplanned or impromptu , or a journey involving sporting game (s ) away from home , thus encompassing any journey by automobile , regardless of stops en route . "
And , according to the same article , road - tripping really took off in America during the 1950s when automobiles became the transportation mode of choice .
You could almost say it 's an :
American Tradition
nowadays -- video recordings during their road trips .
Sounds innocuous enough -- ordinary tourists out enjoying their vacations and all -- but fortunately for us , the FBI 's Threat Management Unit ( TMU ) has developed a computer database called eGuardian where local , state , tribal and federal authorities can track , trace and database all such ordinary tourist activity from now on , forever and in perpetuity .
Heimbach said that when " suspicious activities " and " threats " come in -- such as photographing and videotaping ordinary man-made structures and landmarks while on a road trip -- these are " put into the eGuardian system , and then it sits there , and then we have a mechanism to potentially connect the dot . "
That 's right .
Because that road trip you took this summer ?
" Today it may not link , but five years or ten years from now , it could link , " said Heimbach knowingly ( wink , wink ) .
Below is a diagram of how the FBI handles reports of ordinary tourist activity :
Copyrighted Image ?
DMCA
And here is a description of how it goes through the grinder :
Data is input at an initial level but reviewed at a Fusion Center or similar entity before being passed to eGuardian if the information appears to be linked to terrorism .
The " Agency Data Input Zone " represents law enforcement contributors of suspicious activity reports with a potential nexus to terrorism .
The Fusion Center Management Zone represents the vetting that must occur before these reports are shared with eGuardian participants .
The eGuardian Exchange Zone is where this information sharing will actually occur , once a determination has been made that the report has a potential nexus to terrorism .
And so there you have it
If you and your family have a particular penchant for photographing , or videotaping various American architectural wonders such as dams and power plants while road - tripping , and the appropriate authority catches you ?
KA - BAM .
You will be tracked / traced / databased and classified as a potential terrorist nigh unto forever and there 's nothing you can do about it , because -- according to the Privacy Impact Assessment for the eGuardian Threat Tracking System -- " eGuardian considers all reports submitted to the system to be the property of the submitting agency ... "
And : " Amendment of FBI records is a matter of discretion as the records are exempt from the Privacy Act amendment provisions . "

The Department of Justice has begun looking into whether large U.S. telecommunications companies such as AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. are abusing the market power they have amassed in recent years , according to people familiar with the matter .
The review , while in its early stages , is an indication of the Obama administration 's aggressive stance on antitrust enforcement .

Secret chat logs between the hackers who briefly brought down the Prime Minister 's website last night reveal that the operation was a disorganised failure in one sense , but not in another .
The hackers hoped to crash the site for a sustained period - but that failed .
But , despite their evident lack of geek skills , they achieved their other objective - publicity .
The discussions , on an internet relay chat forum , show the hackers , who identify themselves as being part of a group called " Anonymous " , are preparing to " regroup " for a second round of attacks .
A poll run by PoliticsHome this week revealed a fascinating result to the question : " Do you think in general , the state has too much or too little of a say in what people can and cannot do ? "
Nearly four - fifths of the sample ( 79 % ) answered that the state had too much of a say , while only 8 % believe the state has too little say .
If the poll is an accurate reflection of the nation 's mood this is an important finding .
For some time I have been aware of sharp change in the public 's attitudes to surveillance , as well as a general feeling that the government is too quick to seize personal data and tell people how to lead their lives .
The poll suggests that public has solidly come out against the idea that everyone who has regular contact with other people 's children should be subject to the vetting and barring procedure .
A total of 73 % thought the new laws unfair .
By party , the breakdown is as follows – 83 per cent of Conservative voters were against the laws , 77 % of Liberal Democrats and 58 % of Labour supporters .
So even Labour voters have their doubts about this particular policy , which , incidentally , was the subject of a spirited campaign run by Josie Appleton of the Manifesto Club long before the media woke to the implications of what the ISA checks would mean for ordinary people .
The change in attitudes has been a long time coming and the announcement of the Conservative policy to reduce the rise of the surveillance state ( about which I will write later ) may indicate that private
Tory polling shows widespread concerns across all parties about the character of Labour 's laws .
This is to be expected because Labour supporters like David Goodhart of Prospect magazine , who writes in defence of state control and intrusion , are few and far between , while voices of protest have mounted through the last year , with people such as Stella Rimington , the former director of MI5 , Sir Ken MacDonald , the former director of public prosecutions and Lord Bingham the former chief law lord all expressing grave concerns .
There have been books aplenty – The Assault on Liberty by Dominic Raab , What Price Liberty ? by Ben Wilson , Liberty in the Age of Terror by AC Grayling and most recently Freedom for Sale by John Kampfner .
All of these excellent titles mount a defence of liberty in Britain which the Goodharts of the world have failed to answer with any manifest conviction
And there have been many important reports , most notably from the joint committee on human rights , the information commissioner and the house of lords constitutional committee , which all warned of a slide into the surveillance state .
The annual report from the interceptions commissioner , Sir Paul Kennedy , recently revealed that 504,073 requests for people 's private communications data were made by official bodies .
One in 78 people had become subject to some kind of official snooping .
That statistic struck many like a brick between the eyes .
In a utopia whose perfection hinges upon control of monogamy and privacy , members of the collective begin to question the rules , putting their regimented society on a collision course with forbidden love and revolution .
Gang members shot men for wearing red , cops say Daly City
Moises Frias Jr. , 21 , of San Francisco was shot Thursday while stopped at a red light on John Daly Boulevard near the Daly City BART station in February .

Two suspected members of the MS - 13 gang have been arrested and a third is being sought in the Daly City slaying of a 21 - year - old college student who was shot because his friends were wearing red - a color claimed by a rival gang - police said Thursday .
One of Moises Frias Jr.'s companions was wearing a red sweater , and another a red- and - white San Francisco 49ers cap , when their car was riddled with bullets near the Daly City BART Station on Feb. 19 .
Frias died before he could reach the hospital , and two of the other three young men in the car were wounded .
None of the victims had anything to do with gangs , investigators said .
" That 's very stupid thinking , " Moises Frias Sr. said after learning of the arrests .
" They 're going to shoot him just because of that ?
Why do n't they just kill each other ? "
The father said he would ask San Mateo County prosecutors to seek the death penalty in the killing , which he said devastated his family and made him fear for the safety of his surviving 18 - year - old son and 13 - year - old daughter .
" I would never expect something like this to happen in my life , " he said .
" These guys , they destroyed my life , me and family , for nothing . "
Daly City police Detective Gregg Oglesby noted that Frias ' shooting was strikingly similar to the June 2008 killing of a San Francisco father , Tony Bologna , and his two sons in the Excelsior neighborhood .
Prosecutors say another member of MS - 13 - a subset of the Sureño gang , which claims the color blue - opened fire after mistaking one of the sons for a member of the rival Norteños , who claim red .
" It 's a sad day that young Hispanic men can't wear a red sweater without somebody pointing fingers at them and thinking he 's a gang member , " Daly City police Lt. Jay Morena said .
Around the Bay Area , authorities say several such cases of mistaken gang affiliation in recent years have prompted killings , assaults and robberies .
Many young Latino men say they are routinely " checked , " or asked whether they are Norteño or Sureño .
" They do n't do much verification of rival gang membership , " Oglesby said .
" It 's a variation of racial profiling , but with potentially deadly consequences . "
In the Daly City case , Danilo Velasquez , 28 , was arrested early Wednesday in San Francisco .
Luis Herrera , 18 , was already at San Francisco County Jail on suspicion of auto theft and possession of a gun that was later determined to have been used to kill Frias , police said .
Both have been charged with murder with the special circumstance of lying in wait , three counts of attempted murder and enhancements for participating in a criminal street gang and weapons possession .
A third alleged gang member , Jaime Balam , 20 , was deported to his native Mexico eight days after the shooting - but before he was identified as a suspect - and is still being sought .
Police said Balam , who had been deported once before , was picked up by federal immigration agents in San Francisco on Feb. 24 .
Frias , who loved to dance to Mexican big band music and play baseball , was studying business at City College and was preparing to transfer to a state university .
He was a technician at the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission who hoped to build a career at the water agency .
His friends , too , were college students .
One was in his first year of law school .
On the night they were attacked , police said , they were listening to loud rap music as they drove toward a restaurant in a Buick Regal .
About 7 p.m. , while the group was stopped at a light on John Daly Boulevard next to the Daly City BART Station , Velasquez and Balam jumped out of a stolen Honda Civic and sprayed the Buick with bullets from an assault rifle and a .380 - caliber pistol , Morena said .
The men got back into the Honda , which was driven by Herrera , and sped onto Interstate 280 , police said .
Frias , the Buick driver and another friend were shot .
The driver managed to steer 2 miles to Seton Medical Center as the passenger who was unhurt called for help .
Doctors met the young men in front of the hospital , but Frias was already dead .
The Honda , which had been stolen in San Francisco 's Mission District , was found by police in the Castro a day after the slaying .
Daly City police had few other leads until March 4 , when a " very alert " San Francisco police officer stopped a car in which Herrera was a passenger and arrested him on suspicion of auto theft and possession of a loaded .380 - caliber pistol , Morena said .
Ballistics tests revealed that the pistol had been used in the Daly City shooting , Morena said .

Any righteous cannabisalista knows the timeline , the grand saga of humanity ’s interface with the vegetable mind of the planet .
Back in 8000 B.C. , before Genesis in Sarah Palin ’s book , the sentient were weaving hemp plant into loincloths .
The Chinese had it in their pharmacopoeia by 2700 B.C.
The Founding Fathers used pot processed into paper stock to write a draft of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 , which made sense , since Thomas Jefferson and George Washington , along with their slaves , of course , had been raising the crop for decades .
There are other , darker dates , too , like June 14 , 1937 , when Congress , four years after repealing alcohol prohibition , passed the “ Marihuana Tax Act , ” which essentially outlawed the use of “ all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L. , ” including the “ growing , ” “ the seeds thereof , ” and “ the resin extracted from any part of such plant . ”
As far as yours truly is concerned , however , the most important date in pot history took place on a chilly early - December night shortly after the Great Blackout of 1965 , when , seated on the pitcher ’s mound of a frost - covered baseball diamond in Alley Pond Park , Queens , I first got high on the stuff .
That means I ’ve been a pothead for going on 44 years now , or approximately 72.1 percent of my current life .
Should I live to be 100 , that percentage will increase to 83 percent , since , as Fats Waller implied when he sang “ If You ’re a Viper , ” you ’re always a viper .
I mention this so you know where I ’m coming from , but even if I once knew a guy who claimed to have been the dealer to several members of the Knickerbocker championship teams , I make no claim to being a weed savant .
For me , grass is simply the right tool for the job , a semi-reliable skeleton key to the such - as - it - is creative , an enabler of brainwork .
Outside of continuing to smoke it , sometimes every day , sometimes not for months , or years , I pretty much stopped thinking about marijuana as a cosmologic / shamanic / political entity around 1980 , that insufficiently repressed beginning of the somnambulant Reagan time tunnel , when grass came with seeds and stems and zombies still skulked Washington Square Park reciting their “ loose joints ” mantra : “ Smoke , smoke … try before buy , never die … smoke , smoke … ”
Back then , despite the occasional shouting in the street and polite libertarian proselytizing by William F. Buckley on Firing Line , there was not much thought that pot would ever be legal .
Illegality was key to its ethos , central to the outlaw romance .
All over the U.S. of A. , people were tanking up , driving drunk , killing themselves and others , and still those hot Coors girls were on the TV selling beer at halftime .
The whole country was strung out on Prozac .
But get caught smoking a joint while reading a Thomas Merton book in the park and it was the Big House for you .
What could be more emblematic of the rapaciousness of the culture ?
That ’s how it was until … maybe now .
Could it be that , at long last , the Great Pot Moment is upon us ?
The planets are aligning .
First and foremost is the recession ; there ’s nothing like a little cash - flow problem to make societies reconsider supposed core values .
The balance sheet could n’t be clearer .
We have the so - called War on Drugs , the yawning money pit that used to send its mirror - shade warriors to far - flung corners of the globe , like the Golden Triangle of Burma and the Colombian Amazon , where they ’d confront evil kingpins .
Now , after 40 years , the front lines have moved to the streets of Juárez , where stray bullets can easily pick off old ladies in the Wal - Mart parking in El Paso , Texas , even as Mexico itself has decriminalized pot possession as well as a devil ’s medicine cabinet of other drugs .
At the current $ 40 billion per annum , even General Westmoreland would have trouble calling this progress .
Compare that with the phantasmagoria currently going on in California , where the legal medical - marijuana dispensaries ask only a driver ’s license and a medical letter attesting to some vague ailment — insomnia will do — to begin running a tab at a state - sanctioned , 31 - flavor dispensary .
Somehow , even with many medical - marijuana outfits advertising “ validated parking ” and “ happy - hour specials , ” Western civilization as we know it has not tumbled into the sea .
In November 2010 , initiatives are expected to be on the California ballot to “ tax and regulate ” ( i.e. , legalize ) marijuana altogether .
Taxing the state ’s estimated annual 8.6 million–pound , $ 14 billion pot crop ( more than any amber wave of grain , high - fructose corn syrup included ) could bring as much as $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion in revenue , enough to buy a couple of B - 2 bombers or , failing that , keep a few libraries open an hour more a day .

Pot has n’t been the preserve of the Birkenstock wearer for years .
At least the last three American presidents have been tokers , and you know Bush inhaled , for all the good it did the rest of us .
Obama will no doubt tread lightly with the health - care loonies on his neck , not to mention the conservative black clergy he does n’t want to alienate , but he ’s already presided over curtailing federal busts of medical - marijuana dealers who are in compliance with state laws .
A lively blogosphere debate ensued over whether Obama could really afford to expend any of his political capital on a bud - in - every - bong policy , as the legalize - it forces were hoping .
But the move confirmed officially what many had long known .
Pot smoking simply does not carry the stigma it once did , even in the straightest society .
As it turns out , not all those bong - using college students gave up the stuff when they graduated .
The other day , I was scanning Andrew Sullivan ’s blog , reading posts from salarymen , think - tankers , and Big Board watchers , baring their souls over their continued pot use , long after they were supposed to have put aside such childish things and switched to single - malt scotch .
The drug of the counterculture now belongs to a hitherto unglimpsed silent majority , one that knows how to get things done , even legislatively .
The real engine of this is the pot itself .
In the old days , there were two basic varieties of grass , the shit that got you fucked up and the shit that did n’t .
But now , as is known to any stoner not still searching the skies for that last DC - 3 full of Panama Red , pot has been gourmandized .
You got your indicas , your sativas , your indoor - grown , outdoor - grown , your feminized , your Kushes , your Hazes , with a new , horticulturally hot number rolling down the gene - spliced pike every day .
Historically speaking , a good deal of this flowering comes courtesy of our friendly drug warriors over at the DEA , whose G - man interdiction / kill - at - the - source policy did much to wipe out ( anyone remember Jimmy Carter ’s paraquat crop-dusters ? ) international shipments , thereby mobilizing ex-Berkeley botany majors and other supposedly lazy Mendocino / Humboldt County hippies to grow their own .
Beyond this is a budding secondary market .
With upmarket pot prices holding at $ 60 to $ 70 for an eighth of an ounce , what high - end toker can be satisfied with an intake system based on a 75 - cent pack of Zig - Zag when , for a mere $ 600 , you can have a sleekly designed ashless Volcano “ vaporizer ” to place next to the Bialetti cappuccino - maker ?
For those about to be drug - tested , there is the Whizzinator , a strap - on extra prick containing “ clean ” body - temperature piss that you deftly whip out any time your employer / coach / drug counselor hands you a plastic cup .
All of this is available in the Internet ’s seemingly infinite gray market , where grass - centric URLs offer capsule commentary on the myriad pot strains , including breeding - lineage descriptions right out of the Racing Form ( e.g. , “ Blueberry strain — blue haze X Aussie Duck , from Azura and award - winning Jack Herrer ” ) , date and place of incept , maturation times , buzz properties , etc .
On a recent sweltering afternoon , in lieu of downloading a few seasons of Weeds , I made my way to a top - secret mid-Manhattan location for a little remedial “ tasting ” administered by the esteemed senior cultivation editor of High Times magazine , known by the nom de guerre Danny Danko .
Along with a mini-minyan of like - minded devotees , we hovered over a small but mighty collection of strains : the Chem Dog , the Purps ( so named for its red - blue neonish hue ) , and an assortment of Kush ( OG and Bubba ) from medical - marijuana dispensaries in Los Angeles and the city by the Bay now referred to as Oaksterdam .
While preparing the samples , Danny Danko , 37 , a self - confessed “ pot nerd ” with a seemingly bottomless capacity for THC ingestion , explained his ethic .
A green thumb is not enough to assure the creation of meaningful marijuana , Danko said .
“ Just because you can grow a tomato that might win a prize at the 4 - H club , or a summer squash that ’ll knock the socks off the Iron Chef , does n’t mean you can grow good weed .
Give two growers the same seeds and the same conditions , and you can get two completely different qualities of pot .
There ’s nutrients and care , but there ’s an intuitive factor , too — a deep understanding of the physical , mental , and spiritual benefits of cannabis .
This is n’t a geranium , it is an art , an act of alchemy . ”
We started out on the Purps but soon hit the harder stuff .
With the lexicon of winespeak now lapping over into pot punditry , kindgreenbuds.com describes the Purps as possessing “ hints of buttery caramel coffee and woodsy floral pine . ”
Could n’t say I understood all that from a couple of hits , but the Purps , a spicy little thing , did provide a gleeful cheap amusement - park high not unlike chubby Orson Welles ’s tumbling down the fun-house chute in The Lady From Shanghai .

This playland was soon bulldozed by the Kush .
An ancient indica strain supposedly dating back to the Hindu Kush , where the stubby plant is used mostly to make hashish , the Kush in its multi-variegations has long been the rage among suburban and ghetto youth who gravitate toward the strain ’s stinky olfactory properties and Romilar - esque “ couch - lock ” stone .
It was here that I learned something about pot , then and now .
Prime in the canon of present - day prohibitionists is the claim that today ’s pot is so much stronger that it bears no relation to the stuff nostalgic baby - boom parents might have smoked .
The message : Forget your personal experience , the devil weed currently being peddled to your children is a study - habit - destroying beast of a wholly other stripe .
No doubt , there is merit to this argument ( after decades of some of the most obsessive R&D on the planet , you would n’t think the pot would be weaker ) , but I could n’t fully buy it .
This was because the fancy weed I was smoking , and paying twenty times as much for , was n’t getting me more smashed , at least not in the way I wanted to be .
“ I hear this a lot , because back then , you were probably smoking sativas imported from Jamaica , Vietnam , and Mexico , ” Danko informed me .
Sativas imparted “ a head high , ” as opposed to the largely “ body high ” of indicas .
The problem with this , he went on , was that tropical sativas , being a large ( some as high as fourteen feet ! ) and difficult plant to grow ( the Kush has bigger yields and a shorter flowering time ) , especially under surreptitious conditions , were rare in today ’s market .
My lament was a common one among older heads , Danko said , adding that “ the good sativa is the grail of the modern smoker . ”
Luckily , following the various Kushes , I was able to cleanse the mind - body palate with the mighty Chem Dog , a notable indica - sativa hybrid , reputedly first grown by a lapsed military man — the Chemdog — who came into the possession of a number of seeds following a 1991 Grateful Dead concert .
It was after some moments of communing with this puissant plant life that I was in the proper state to confront the conundrum of the day , i.e. , “ The Existential State of Weed in Its Various Manifestations in the Five - Borough Area of New York City , circa 2009 . ”
Race has always been the driving wheel of reefer madness .
And what a woolly hairball of contradiction it is !
There is all of the above , the whole Mendelian cornucopia of the New Pot with its dizzying array of botanical choice and intake gizmos .
Yet the cold , hard fact is , New York City , which first banned pot in 1914 under the Board of Health “ Sanitary Code ” ( the Times story of the day described cannabis as having “ practically the same effect as morphine and cocaine ” ) , has always been a backwater when it comes to reefer .
The Big Apple viper may gain some small comfort from the fact that getting stoned in California usually leads to being surrounded by stoned Californians , but this does little to mitigate the envy .
Here , in the alleged intellectual capital of the world , where we have no medical marijuana ( even borderline - red states like Nevada and Colorado do ) , at the end of the day , you know you ’re going to be calling that same old delivery service that comes an hour late and wo n’t do walk - ups above the third floor .
In this day and age , nearly 30 years after the AMA began flirting with decriminalizing marijuana , you might think New York City marijuana - possession arrests would be in deep decline .
You might even figure that Charlie Rangel , the four - decade congressman from Harlem and longtime leader of the Select Committee on Narcotics , had his finger on the pulse when he told a House subcommittee that “ I do n’t remember the last time anyone was arrested in the city of New York for marijuana . ”
Uh … wrong !
The fact is , New York City is the marijuana - arrest capital of the country and maybe the world .
Since 1997 , according to statistics complied by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services , 430,000 people age 16 and older have been pinched in the city for possession of marijuana , often for quantities as little as a joint , a reign of “ broken window ” terror - policing that kicked off in the nasty Giuliani years and has only escalated under Bloomberg and Ray Kelly .
More than 40,000 were busted last year , and at least another 40,000 , or more than the entire population of Elmira , will be busted this year .
Somehow , it comes as no shell - shocker that , again according to the state figures , more than 80 percent of those arrested on pot charges are either black or Hispanic .
From the days of Harry Anslinger — who , as the more or less permanent head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics ( J. Edgar Hoover–like , he served for 32 years , appointed by the Hoover , FDR , Truman , Eisenhower , and Kennedy administrations ) , raved about how most pot smokers were “ Negroes , Hispanics , Filipinos , and entertainers ” whose “ Satanic music , jazz and swing ” was driving white women into a sexual frenzy — race has always been the driving wheel of reefer madness .
It was no fun to find this dynamic still at work in the beloved hometown .

But there they were , down in night court at 100 Centre Street , one marijuana arrestee of color after another , standing before the judge to have their class - B misdemeanor possession case heard .
Legal Aid lawyers defend most of these people .
Said one lawyer , “ The cops have their areas of concentration when it comes to these violations .
Sometimes we ’ll get a lot of arrests for so - called trespassing , which often means a person was caught hanging out in front of a project ; it does n’t matter if they live right across the street .
But marijuana is very constant , a hardy perennial , you might say , rolling in regularly like the tide .
The amounts are almost always tiny , which shows that for all the talk about going after the big guys , cops are mostly arresting low - end users .
A lot of people say they were nabbed only minutes after they got the stuff , so it seems as if the cops are just sitting on known spots and busting whoever comes out .
Most arrestees will receive an ACD , or ‘ adjournment contemplating dismissal , ’ a kind of probation .
It is rare , but repeaters could get time .
At the very least , it messes up your night riding around handcuffed in a paddy wagon . ”
Harry Levine , a Queens College sociology professor who has been compiling marijuana arrest figures for years , says , “ The cops prefer pot busts .
They ’re easy , because the people are almost never violent and , as opposed to drunks , hardly ever throw up in the car .
Some of this has to do with the reduction in crime over the years .
Pot arrests are great for keeping the quota numbers up .
These kind of arrests toss people into the system , get their fingerprints on file .
The bias of these arrests is in the statistics . ”
The NYPD ( good luck on getting the Public Information department to respond to your phone calls or e-mails on this particular topic ) belittles these charges , saying the arrest stats are “ absurdly inflated . ”
The kicker in this is the apparently almost unknown fact that possession of 25 grams , or seven - eighths of an ounce — much more than the few joints that are getting people arrested — is not a crime in New York State and has not been since the passage of the Marijuana Reform Act of 1977 , or 32 years ago .
( Right here add sound of potheads slapping their foreheads , like , how come they did n’t know that ? )
There are exceptions , however .
If the pot is “ burning or open to public view , ” then the 25 - gram deal is off .
It is this provision that has been the basis for the arrest outbreak , many civil libertarians contend .
The scenario of what happens on the street , as told to me by several arrestees , is remarkably similar .
It goes like this :
You ’re black , or Spanish , or some white - boy fellow traveler with a cockeyed Bulls cap and falling - down pants .
The cops come up to you , usually while you ’re in a car , and ask you if you ’re doing anything you should n’t .
You say , “ No , officer , ” and they say , “ You do n’t have anything in your pocket you ’re not supposed to have , do you , because if you do and I find it , it ’ll be a lot worse for you . ”
It is at that point , because you are young , nervous , possibly simple , and ignorant of the law , you might comply and take the joint you ’d been saving out of your pocket .
Then , zam : Suddenly , your protection under the Marijuana Reform
Act vanishes because the weed is now in “ public view . ”
The handcuffs , the paddy wagon , and the aforementioned court date soon follow .
Now that he is ahead of Rudy ’s numbers , Mike Bloomberg , who once famously answered a question from this magazine about his pot use by saying “ you bet I did , and I enjoyed it , ” has presided over more marijuana busts than any mayor anywhere .
This could be compared with the record of another New York City mayor , Fiorello La Guardia , who , in response to the 1937 federal ban on pot , requested a report by the New York Academy of Medicine , which concluded that , contrary to Harry Anslinger ’s claim that pot was an “ assassin of youth , ” marijuana was not medically addictive ; not under the control of a single organized group ; did not lead to morphine , heroin , or cocaine addiction ; and was not the determining factor in the commission of major crimes , and that “ publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marihuana smoking in New York is unfounded . ”
Once upon a mid-seventies time , the Yippies , then fronted by downtown immortals Dana Beal and the garbologist A. J. Weberman , staged a pot-legalization march up Fifth Avenue that ended in a rally at the Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park .
The big attraction was a giant glass jar filled with joints ; anyone picking the number of reefers in the jar would win it .
The winner , some shambling longhair troglodyte , broke open the jar and threw the joints into the crowd , prompting a crush toward the stage .
Alarmed , Weberman took the microphone and started screaming , “ It is only crappy Mexican !
Do n’t kill yourself for crappy Mexican ! ”
“ Ah , the good old days , ” says Richard Gottfried , sitting in his state - assemblyman office on lower Broadway .
Gottfried , who was a 23 - year - old Columbia Law student when he was first elected as assemblyman from Manhattan ’s West Side in 1970 ( he ’s been there ever since ) , is the author of the 1977 Reform Act .
Hearing what people were saying about alleged police use of the “ public view ” phrase of the law , Gottfried rubbed at his still red-flecked professorial beard and said , “ Why , if these searches are being conducted in this way … that would be a textbook example of entrapment , would n’t it ? ”
He seemed shocked , absolutely shocked , that such practices were going on right here in New York City .
In 1997 , Gottfried , a largely unsung hero of sane drug policy , wrote New York State ’s first medical - marijuana legislation .
“ It stayed in committee a while , ” says Gottfried .
“ With things like this , politicians tend to be very , very timid . ”
Nonetheless , Gottfried is confident medical marijuana is on the immediate horizon .
It was passed by the Assembly in 2007 , and Gottfried says it would have gotten through the Senate this past spring “ if June 8th had n’t happened . ”
“ Strange as it sounds , I think this is one issue that might actually be nonideological , ” says Gottfried .
“ During the floor debate , these legislators , liberal and conservative , were almost in tears as they told their personal stories about how they and their loved ones had been helped by marijuana , how it brought relief from chronic pain , how it aided family members in last days of terminal diseases .
It was quite moving . ”
This does n’t mean we should expect Californication 2 here , Gottfried says .
“ Medical - marijuana laws differ radically from state to state .
There ’s California and everywhere else . ”
In Maryland , you ca n’t be jailed for medical marijuana , but there ’s no provision for obtaining it , which leaves elderly M.S. sufferers in the bizarre situation of having to potentially go out and score like a randy teenager .
The New York version of the law will be “ modest , ” Gottfried says .
As opposed to the “ doctor ’s letter ” mills in Cali , permissions will be very carefully monitored , with legal possession limited to two and a half ounces .
“ The penalties for violating the medical - marijuana laws will be stiffer than regular possession , ” Gottfried says .
What really mattered was that my kids understood that just because I used it did n’t mean they should .
If this was the best that could be done at this time , so be it .
But why not simply be aboveboard about it ?
How many medical - marijuana patients are there really , at least compared with those who use the stuff for mental and emotional well - being , not to mention flat - out potheads ?
You ’re talking about recreational users ? ” Gottfried asked .
“ You ’re talking about tax - and - regulate legalization ? ”
“ Well … yeah .
How do you feel about that ? ”
Gottfried smiled .
“ If marijuana had a similar status to liquor in this country , a locally controlled system of distribution , the way some states allow booze in the supermarket and some states are dry — I would n’t have a problem with that . ”
But I should n’t hold my breath , the assemblyman said .
“ We are in a period of transition .
It could be a long transition . ”
“ I ’m functioning in the shadow of something that is bound to change , except no one knows when or how , ” says Francis R. , who has been in the pot - delivery business for almost twenty years .
Mostly a painter “ with some music thrown in , ” Francis started off as a “ runner ” for a large Manhattan delivery service during the late eighties , in the wake of the massive drug sweeps like “ Operation Pressure Point ” that successfully ended the hard - drug street scene in many parts of New York .
A gentrifying city had no place for such violence - prone local color .
The delivery services , like the bar - based cocaine trade and the banishment of prostitutes from street corners and into “ escort services , ” where everything is done quietly and by appointment , proved to be a pragmatic compromise between law enforcement , human nature , and the need to keep the nightlife industry going .
In business for himself since shortly after 9/11 , Francis has about 180 clients , of which 50 or so are “ regular reorderers . ”
Employing an easy - to - park 250 - cc .
Japanese bike , Francis works “ like 35 to 40 hours six days a week , ” starting at around one in the afternoon .
For this , he clears an average of about $ 150,000 a year , or about $ 1,000 “ retail ” on a crappy day and up to three grand on “ a great day . ”
Up until about 2004 , Francis got much of his supply from Canada .
“ It was mostly indicas trucked across the country from Vancouver , then across the St. Lawrence Seaway , or Lake Erie .
The first time I did this , I could n’t believe it .
It is totally dark , you could n’t see ten feet .
Then out of fog come these Indians … Indians , in canoes , paddling , like right out of the fucking Last of the Mohicans , bringing in the weed . ”
Eventually , however , the connection dried up .
Some busts were made , but mostly the quality decreased .
Now everything Francis sells is from California .
He recently made one of his regular trips to Mendocino County .
“ I had $ 25,000 in my suitcase , and some friends tell me to drive up toward Ukiah , to the Million Dollar Corner , which is called that because like a million dollars is changing hands there in pot sales like every other day .
High as an elephant ’s eye , dude . ”
I took a pinch of Francis ’s new stuff to Danny Danko ’s “ tasting , ” as sort of a blindfold test to see if the experts would be able to identify the strain .
This got kind of funny , these half - dozen pot gourmets investigating the inch - and - a - half - high bud , smoking it , poking it , checking out its tricombs under a magnifying glass like a no -shit Sherlock Holmes CSI team .
Someone thought it was a clone of the original Skunk No. 1 , others were certain it was in the Sour Diesel family .
One gentleman , who referred to himself as a “ pot snob , ” put Francis ’s high - priced spread down after a few tokes , declaring it “ standard product … nothing to write home about . ”
He based this opinion primarily on the extreme “ tightness ” of the bud structure , which he characterized as “ your typical ass pellet . ”
This was a sign of “ insufficient curing , ” the pot snob said , a giveaway that someone had rushed the crop .
He also objected to the blackness of the ash and the fact that it had taken three match strokes to get the smoke going .
Francis was much put out by this assessment .
“ Everyone ’s a fucking critic , ” he protested , defending his weed .
“ Got you stoned , did n’t it ? ”
Francis said the cops were n’t all that much of a factor .
“ For the most part , I walk through the town unopposed . ”
But what about the busts ?
“ What busts ? ”
I showed Francis a copy of the New York State marijuana - arrest stats .
He could n’t believe it .
He did n’t know a soul who had been pinched .
He was not , however , surprised by the ethnic breakdown .
“ I hate to say it , but there ’s no way I ’m hiring a black guy to work for me .
The chances of a black guy getting stopped is about 50 times more than a white guy .
I ca n’t afford that .
Fact is , pot is legal for white people but not for black people , which is total bullshit . ”
Francis spends “ a lot of time ” thinking about legalization .
“ It is coming , not tomorrow or the next day , but it is coming , ” he says .
This is the general opinion among his colleagues , Francis says .
“ I ’ve heard of guys buying liquor licenses , you know , to stay on the inebriation side of things .
“ Ca n’t say I do n’t have mixed feelings about it , ” Francis went on .
“ I like this job .
It ’s served me well .
Everyone is happy to see me when I come around .
Ca n’t say that for a dentist .
Still , it ’ll be a great day if they legalize it .
Because pot should be legal .
You know what would really bother me , though ?
If gangster corporations like Philip Morris or Seagram ’s got a big piece of the action .
That would really chap my ass .
Because , basically , with a couple scumbags here and there , this is an honorable business , a little - guy business .
It should stay that way . ”
Then Francis , being a swell fellow , told me he happened to have run across “ a little something ” just the other night , something sweet .
“ You got sativa ? ”
Francis shook his head .
“ October … maybe late September .
Maybe .
But this Dog ai n’t no bad dog . ”
He ’d let it go for like maybe a nickel off , because I was putting him in a magazine article .
So I went down the road , to the F train , thinking about how I ’d never drawn a legal puff of marijuana in my life .
The scenic overlook of the paradigm shift shimmied before my eyes .
I could already see the YouTubes of the near future , the debates raging over government versus corporate private - sector control , when every right - minded left - libertarian pothead knows either would be a disaster , a slo - mo shakedown to the Big Bud - weiser versus earnest microbrewers .
No , it was n’t going to be a total picnic when legalization came and people started scoring inside 7 - Elevens instead of behind them .
And there was another issue .
I ’m not one of those potheads who wax on about the first time they got stoned with their kids .
Sounds like a landmine from every angle .
I mean , why make some moron hippie ceremony out of it ?
They knew I smoked , I knew they smoked , unless it was some burglar who stole my stash that night .
Still , it is a crossroads , when you smell the smoke coming from their room .
You feel obligated to tell both sides , even the D.A.R.E. side , citing all sorts of facts and figures , including how , according to a 2008 Australian study , men who smoked at least five joints a day for twenty years had smaller hippocampuses and amygdalas than nonusers .
What really mattered was that kids understood pot was n’t for everyone , that just because I used it did n’t mean they should .
Young brains did n’t need that extra noise , I said , happy to set the legal pot -smoking age at 21 , like booze , or at the very least the day a high - school diploma is attained .
Beyond that , there is nothing left to do but to pray none of them has the addictive chip that makes people lose their good sense .
And , despite the best advice ( “ Whatever you do , do n’t get fucking caught ! ” ) , kids sometimes can , and do , lose their good sense , if only temporarily .
Really , pinched with a gram , in the middle of a celebratory smoke toast in honor of 420 , the equivalent of pothead New Year .
How does that even happen ?
So then , there you are , the pot dad and the newly crowned pot kid , sitting in the office of a court - mandated drug professional who is explaining why this two - month , four - nights - a - week , $ 10,000 program is actually the right thing , because “ marijuana is a gateway drug . ”
At this point , the temptation is to cover your ears like a Munch painting and shout that mutual back - scratching between the criminal - justice system and high - priced treatment centers is one more reason that idiot drug laws have to go .
But it is not that easy , because no matter how much you want the kid to get the same benefits from the mighty weed that it has given you , there is a deep conviction that it would be better if he did n’t smoke at all , at least until he gets his act together , which might take a lot longer than it has to if he keeps smoking .
Still , it was n’t like he needed some cop to participate in that decision - making process .
You can feel it , the war is on .
A couple of months ago , the Times ran a big piece ( “ Marijuana Is Gateway Drug for Two Debates , ” July 17 , 2009 ) with updated Harry Anslinger–style quotes from poor souls made homeless by their marijuana problem .
Words like dependence and habitual were prominently featured .
The DEA is on record as being against the legalization of “ smoked ” marijuana for medical purposes .
They say if people feel sick , they should take Marinol , a nice pharmaceutical that is THC without the fun .
Liquor was against the law for fourteen years .
Pot ’s been banned for 72 .
Neither the cartels nor the prohibitionists are going to just fold up and go away .
Not that I can worry about that .
If I never smoke pot again , I ’m cool .
I appreciate what the stuff ’s done for me already .
I ask only one thing :
Should I contract an illness that even grass , in its alleged miracle - drug mode , ca n’t cure , then just wheel me over to that guy sneaking a toke on the corner .
I ’ll breathe deep and , like the whiff of a just - baked madeleine , be transported to the place inside my head that ’s always been home .

Following on from this post , I ’ll be taking a detailed look at the rest of the second 3+1 trailer .
Just a note , I lightened and / or color - adjusted some of the cuts to get a better look at the contents ; refer back to the official King Records upload to see the original presentation !
Sn134 C017
Mari giving a wry little wave .
What we can see of her plugsuit indicates it ’s a new model , and is n’t simply a palette swap of her previous one ( compare this to this ) .
Black , huh ?
That ’s quite a sharp deviation .
The thing on the wall is an industrial control pendant , which you might use to operate heavy machinery .
Curious .
The relative proximity of this cut to the tease about Wunder going into space makes me wonder if Mari is departing for a Moon - based mission here , but that ’s just wishful thinking on my part … ;)
Sn136 C003
Well , Kaworu did say that they ’d meet again , but … this is just weird !
The lack of choker on either boy means this is n’t a flashback .
Is this on the Wunder ?
I at first thought that Shinji wearing his uniform here was a giveaway that something was funny , but , lo and behold , you can see his uniform in this cut as well .
Shinji was wearing it in the plug at the end of 2.0 , so Wille being able to return his clothes to him is reasonable .
How do you explain this Kaworu , though ?
Shinji ’s expression seems a bit severe , which is interesting .
His mouth and neck are stiff and he ’s not directly facing Kaworu .
Whatever is going on here , Shinji does n’t seem to welcome it .
There ’s nothing good to go on this early , but my own suspicion is that this is n’t a clone , or that Shinji is necessarily hallucinating ( even though he likely has PTSD and nobody could blame him for doing so ) .
Rather , I think this may be similar in cause to the strange Shinji - Rei phenomena happening throughout the films — seeing her on the street , seeing a vision of her inside Eva-01 , talking to her inside his head while unconscious , etc. — though on a visual level it most closely resembles what Rei Q sees while she ’s soaking .
Shinji and Rei have a hidden connection which Gendo has taken advantage of in his plans , and Rei Q , being a Rei clone whose soul is “ somewhere else ” , logically is connected to Rei 2 as well .
To relate this back to the trailer : Shinji had recently synchronized with Kaworu , so the two have a unique spiritual link , which may carry forward beyond Kaworu ’s physical death .
Another thing I notice here is that Kaworu ’s shirt is conveniently left out of frame .
This could well mean absolutely nothing — or it could mean everything , in that khara is deliberately hiding something from us .
The end of this post explores the issue , though it does require that entire thread for context .
Sn143 C003
And a mere seven scenes later , we get … this .
A disheveled - looking Rei — though we do n’t know which one — in the foreground , and an incredibly ominous Fuyutsuki in the back .
Rei ’s eye shifts very slightly during the cut , but the overall effect here is still , for me , very doll - like .
Compare one of the creepy close - ups from EoE .
The background also brings to mind this awful place from 3.0 .
There is certainly not much to go on , but it stirs the imagination , as I ’m sure was intended .
We have never seen Fuyutsuki depicted like this before , which suggests some sort of seismic shift in his character to come .
If , as suggested last time , Gendo actually does sacrifice himself to Eva - 13 , then it ’s another “ I leave the rest to you , Fuyutsuki - sensei ” situation .
In the original series , the intense and uncompromising parts of Fuyutsuki ’s personality took a back seat when the choice came down to “ help the good guys over the long term quietly ” or “ get shot by the bad guys right now ” .
In the new movies , Seele are finally gone , and maybe Gendo will be “ gone ” too , leaving Fuyutsuki to act as he sees fit .
This could get very interesting .
Getting to see Fuyutsuki channel a little of his inner Gargoyle ?
Yes , please !
What ’s going with this Rei is much harder to say .
As I detailed last time , the trailer does provide a subtle hint that it may not be all peaches and cream for Tentative Name : Rei Ayanami .
And , much as we want to see her learn and grow outside the confines of Nerv HQ , she will also need to return there sooner or later to answer that fundamental question : “ Then , what am I ? ” If she is dependent on the facilities there to live ( which “ Until You Come To Me ” might be implying , by showing Rei ’s hand crumble away during her travels with Asuka and Shinji ) , that could also present a slight problem .
My general read on what ’s happening in the shot itself : Rei is back at Nerv HQ seeking answers , and Fuyutsuki ’s brought her to his shrine of assorted horrors in order to provide them .
Except this is n’t like Shinji , where Fuyutsuki was trying to provide information for the boy ’s benefit .
Fuyutsuki ’s playing a much darker game here .
With the glassy doll - eyed look on Rei , it ’s easy to imagine him nonchalantly telling her that she ’s merely a soulless husk pretending to be human .
Whatever ’s going on , I look forward to it .
Sn299 C001
First , note the scene number .
A whole bunch of movie receives no representation in the trailer .
How close are we to the very end here ?
None of the Eva movies have been split up into “ scenes ” before , so … there ’s no way to say .
We get our first full - body look at New Eva -02 and … uh …
Hmm .
That ’s not quite what I was expecting , though in retrospect I really should have known better .
JA - 02 , Eva-02 .
Get it ??
In case you have no idea what I ’m talking about , at the end of Avant1 when Mari uses a special scanning mode on Eva-08 to look inside the Nerv Paris storage lockers , we can see Jet Alone 2 parts inside .
( Main body and arms on the left here , legs on the right here . )
In fact , a LOT of the lockers have “ JA - 02 ” written on them .
I ’d kind of been hoping to see a whole squadron of battle - ready space - faring Jet Alones or something , but I suppose merging one with Eva-02 is a surefire way to force the ‘ bot back into relevancy .
Bravo , Anno. Bravo .
From what we can see here , Eva-02 has actually been restored considerably from the sorry state we saw it in at the end of Q .
Even if the helmet and torso armor can hypothetically hide missing organic parts , that right arm does n’t lie .
Somehow we went from a few stray arm muscles to a complete , functional arm .
Interesting .
The hollowed - out Jet Alone chassis here initially gives the impression that there ’s much less Eva -02 than there actually is ; there ’s a better look inside the brown shell coming up .
The left arm and the legs are 100 % from Jet Alone 2 , though .
It seems Wille can get Eva flesh to regenerate , but they ca n’t outright replace entire units of the body that are missing .
The weird backpack seems to be some kind of missile launcher .
It was first shown in Avant1 , all the way on the left here .
That absolutely crazy weapon could also be glimpsed behind Mari on the left here .
In the side view , you can see a bulky rounded apparatus that looks … sort of like bagpipes ??… on Eva -02 ’s back .
I wonder if that ’s meant to be a power reactor .
Those tubes sticking out of it remind me of the original Jet Alone ’s control rods .
Having the reactor attached as a back module instead of loaded inside the main unit would make it possible to jettison if something were to go wrong , or if you needed to blow something up without killing yourself too , I suppose .
The low bitrate might make it hard to tell , but Eva-02 ’s falling into a writhing mass of Failures of Infinity .
They look kind of like swarming insects .
Pretty strange way for a bunch of headless Eva-01s made of core to move .
After Eva -02 falls a certain distance , the launcher backpack comes off ( ca n’t tell if deliberately or not ) , and the swarm starts to surge upward as Eva -02 dives deeper in .
Sn299 C001A
This shot seems to follow on the previous one directly .
End of previous , Eva-02 had started diving into the swarm , and here we can see it spiraling downward ( note the sun ) .
Its destination is unknown , but that giant multi- weapon it ’s toting tells us it means business .
I ’ve heard Eva -02 ’s new look get compared to a “ grizzled veteran ” , and that ’s… just about perfect .
Here , 02 pulls off this “ I ’ve been through some real shit , so do n’t screw me me ! ” feeling quite well .
The “ scar ” ( representing the eye lost all those years ago in the 10th Angel fight ) , the toothy underbite , the devil horns , all the strapped - on equipment , the jumbo gun like some kind of crazy space marine .
It all takes some getting used to , especially those brown J.A. parts , but it ’ll be great fun to see in action .
Note that here we can clearly see that the main JA body has been hollowed out and partly wraps around Eva-02 ’s torso , providing an extra layer of armor .
I assume that if you go down far enough , Eva -02 does become 100 % mechanical prosthesis , but there ’s no way to make out that exact point here .
Eva -02 ’s new Eva plating is the same as what we saw in Paris , though the right shoulder pylon looks modified .
Sn299 C002
AAA Wunder passing over the camera POV , with Failures of Infinity strewn through the sky and partly blocking out the sun .
We can see the Wunder ’s power core as it goes over ( look for the yellow - striped knobs in the second image ) , suggesting that , alas , Eva-01 gets to spend a significant portion of the movie in there .
( If it ’s stuck inside various containers for ANOTHER whole film , I revolt . )
Sn299 C003
Well , they did tell us Final Impact was going to happen at the end of Q ( in the preview ) , so this is n’t exactly a surprise or anything .
Here we see the Wunder fly past a rather conspicuously - textured background , on past the edges of the Gates of Guf , tilting down toward the epicenter .
The Failures of Infinity flying through the air look like they have a tendency to aggregate in clusters ; maybe Eva-02 was dropped into one such cluster .
This could mean nothing , but the core - speckle effect on the Failures that fly through the foreground is especially prominent .
What we can see of the Gates shows only red , white , and black — no other colors .
Near Third Impact was distinctive for its Gates having no other colors , and if Final Impact has similarly red Gates , that would be a useful clue about how Impacts work .
Alas , this close to the Gates ’ edge , all of them are entirely red .
( See : Second Impact ; Fourth . )
We ’ll have to wait to see if the center is rainbowy or not !
What did the Wunder fly past on the way to the Gates ?
It looks like it could be the Black Moon ( that giant goblet - shaped thing ) ; the sheer quantity of Failures seems to point that way .
( To give you an idea of how many : the Black Moon is about 30 km from top to bottom .
All of that red stuff suspended in midair ?
Countless Failures of Infinity . )
And what ’s at the epicenter ?
Who caused it ?
At this point , I ’m tempted to refer back to my write - up in Pt.1 under Sn105 C001 .
It ’s our friends at Nerv HQ , using Eva-13 and the Key of Nebuchadnezzar .
Whether Gendo and Fuyutsuki are still a co-op , Gendo has become the Emperor Neo to Fuyutsuki ’s Gargoyle , or whatever else .
Notice how these past four cuts are all part of scene 299 , and consecutive : C001 , C001A , C002 , C003 .
Taking a stab at what ’s happening here : Eva -02 gets dropped off outside the Gates , where it descends toward an unknown target amidst the Failure of Infinity swarms ; and in the meantime Wunder heads for the Impact center .
This indicates that , similarly to Fourth Impact , Wille ’s attention is required in multiple places at once .
What could be important enough outside of the epicenter that Wille needs to put their ace Eva -02 on the job ?
It ’s impossible to not start weaving possibilities …
Come join us on the forum and speculate about what wondrous insanity awaits !
See you next time !
FRANKFURT ( MarketWatch ) -- German stocks and nuclear power plant operators in particular rose , while solar - related companies dropped Monday after election results indicated that a center - right coalition will be formed .
In Sunday 's election , Chancellor Angela Merkel 's conservative CDU / CSU bloc won 33.8 % of the vote , while the pro-business Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) captured 14.6 % of the vote , according to projections by German television ARD , allowing for the creation of a center - right coalition .
Read more about the election .
" The German market usually performs better after CDU / FDP wins , " said Martin Lueck , economist at UBS , in a note to clients .
" Last night 's outcome should therefore be good news for the market . "
Germany 's center - right parties generally want to reduce taxes and create investment incentives .
The German DAX benchmark ( DAX ) rose 2.8 % , outperforming other stock indexes in Europe .
See Europe Markets .
" A conservative - liberal coalition has room for bringing about far - reaching reforms , " said Thorsten Polleit , chief German economist at Barclays Capital , in a conference call .
By liberal , the economist is referring to free - market policies that the FDP espouses .
" The key issue for the new government is clearly fiscal policy , " and a CDU - FDP coalition can be expected to put together a new budget plan for next year , Polleit said .
" Improving the fiscal situation should be possible under the new government , but it may not be achieved in the short run , " he said .
The FDP is also likely to push for creating a simpler and more transparent tax system , reducing red tape and reforming the banking sector , according to Polleit .
Utilities gain
The owners of Germany 's nuclear power plants rose .
E.On AG ( EOAN ) surged 3.6 % , RWE AG ( RWE ) gained 4 % , and EnBW Energie Baden - Württemberg AG ( EBK ) rose 2.6 % .
A CDU - FDP coalition is likely to extend the lifetime of existing nuclear power plants to give Germany more time to reach its renewable energy goals .
In Germany , nuclear energy accounted for 23.3 % of power production in 2008 and capacities are owned by the big four utilities : E.On , RWE , EnBW , and Vattenfall AB , which is wholly owned by the Swedish state .
The lifetime of power plants might now be extended by a further 15 to 20 years , wrote Christian Kleindienst , senior credit analyst at UniCredit Research in a note to clients .
" As a nuclear power plant has very little variable cost , a transfer to other fuel sources or power purchases could have led to a massive decline in cash flows on the magnitude of several billion euros for all four operators , depending on future power prices , " Kleindienst said .
However , a possible extension might not be granted at zero cost , Kleindienst said , adding that there are already discussions about a renewable fund model in which nuclear operations have to pay in a certain part of the extension gains .
Solar shares decline
Shares of solar companies , however , posted losses on concerns that a center - right coalition will cut the feed - in tariffs from which the industry benefits .
SolarWorld AG ( SWV ) fell 0.2 % , SMA Solar Technology AG ( S92 ) dropped 0.4 % and Q - Cells ( QCE ) declined 2 % .
Bucking the trend , Phoenix Solar AG ( PS4 ) gained 2.1 % .
" We feel markets are wrongly pricing solar stocks down as recent statements from the liberals suggest they will only seek steep solar tariff cuts for 2011 " rather than for 2010 , said Robert Schramm , analyst at Commerzbank , in a note to clients .
That suggest a " massive demand pull - forward " and the main beneficiaries should be Phoenix Solar , SMA Solar Technology and SolarWorld , Schramm said .

The construction sector , including Essen - based Hochtief AG ( HOT ) and Mannheim - based Bilfinger Berger AG ( GBF ) , should benefit from the CDU / FDP 's higher propensity for privatization and public private partnerships , according to Lueck of UBS .
Shares of Hochtief rose 1.6 % and Bilfinger gained 3 % .
Lueck also advised caution on Deutsche Boerse AG ( DB1 ) , " because introduction of financial market turnover taxation remains an issue even under a CDU - led administration . "
Deutsche Boerse shares slipped 0.9 % .
Investors should also be cautious on Rheinmetall AG ( RHM ) since a strong FDP within the government may mean earlier - than - expected withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan , which could limit Rheinmetall 's potential sales to the German army , according to UBS .
Shares of Rheinmetall , a Düsseldorf - based producer of automotive components and defense equipment , rose 3.6 % .

The US Marines Corps ordered the first ever energy audit in a war zone today to try to reduce the enormous fuel costs of keeping troops on the ground in Afghanistan .
General James T Conway , the Marines Corps Commandant , said he wanted a team of energy experts in place in Afghanistan by the end of the month to find ways to cut back on the fuel bills for the 10,000 strong marine contingent .
US marines in Afghanistan run through some 800,000 gallons of fuel a day .
That ’s a higher burn rate than during an initial invasion , and reflects the logistical challenges of running counter - insurgency and other operations in the extreme weather conditions of Afghanistan .
“ We need to understand where the fuel goes , ” Conway told a Marines Corps energy summit today .
“ The largest growing demand on the battlefield today is for electricity and how we create that . ”
He added : “ We are going to more efficient .
We have got to be . ”
Conway ’s announcement — and the summit itself , which is the first of its kind — were seen yesterday as a dramatic shift in the US military ’s approach to energy consumption and climate change .
The Pentagon began to acknowledge America ’s reliance on fossil fuels and climate change as a national security concern in 2002 .
A report from the Pentagon ’s military advisory board last May called on military bases to work to lower their carbon footprint .
A number of bases inside the US have begun to tap into renewable fuel sources including wind and solar energy .
But the Marine Corps are the first service to try to put those policies into action on the battlefield .
If you read my posts on a regular basis , you know I ’m not surprised by the U.S. Marines beating everyone else to an advanced analysis , a new and useful practice .
It goes back to leadership in place back before World War 2 – and a tradition maintained through the postwar Civil Rights Movement – to the latest requirements of education either on the way in or before your butt is allowed back out into the general public .
It 's been said that art lies at the crossroads of the predictable and the unexpected predictable enough to trigger fond memories , yet unexpected enough to rattle the senses and create a new level of understanding and appreciation .
Thus the art of the cover song .
Is it the chicken or the egg ?
The steak or the sizzle ?
The spark of invention or the twist of the hacker ?
As in life , is it the singer or the song ?
I am a lifelong coveter of covers , but the best ones are getting harder to find .
Maybe it's like the old timer at Baskin - Robbins after years behind the scoop , tastes drift further and further away from chocolate and vanilla .
But the truth is throughout my life on the banks of the river of music , I 've cast my net for the curious and offbeat .
I discovered community radio and used record stores in the 1970s as a high - school suburbanite , and entered the radio / television program at Ohio University and their 24 - hour campus station in the golden era of college radio .
The uptown record store I worked at part time introduced me to luxurious , import - only , seven - inch and twelve - inch singles , backed with exclusive b-sides or , occasionally , mysterious cover choices .
And with them I did what every music junkie used to do : I made mix tapes .
Remember them ?
Much more of an art form than burning your buddy a CD , the art of the mix ( cassette ) tape was a religion in the 1980s .
I 've seen knock - down fistfights with dudes extolling the virtues of TDK SAII 90's over Maxell XLII -S 90s .
And do n't even get me started with Dolby C versus dbx .
Dropping in a freaky cover or two became my signature slipping in Aztec Camera 's acoustic take on Van Halen 's " Jump , " or perhaps Paul Young 's turn on Marvin Gaye 's hit , " Wherever I Lay My Hat ( That 's My Home ) . "
A year after graduation I became the manager at the hippest indie record store in Cincinnati , a job I held for 14 years .
There , at Wizards Records , and in 17 years of writing a nationally syndicated music news column , the covers caravan really kicked into high gear .
From the acres of used LP 's that came across the counter to new CD reissues packed with bonus rarities , I filled hundreds of cassette tapes , each with a specific artist , adding cover tune by cover tune as I found them .
I think I got up to six full cassettes of my Cover Me Beatles series alone .
These days , an external hard drive functions as my digital jukebox and it grows week by week .
With over 1,800 cover songs to date , it 's become the new version of record collecting for me .
( And I 'm pretty picky about separating the wheat from the chaff , holding onto only about one in ten of the covers I come across . )
But Instead of hunting down that red vinyl DJ - only twelve - inch like I used to , all I lust for are more .wav , .mp3 , .flac , and . shn files to satisfy my craving .
One of these days I 'll pick up an Ion turntable or USB cassette deck and I 'll bet I can break 3,000 .
But the question remains : Why ?
Why covers ?
In my case , I think it 's because covers reveal an artists ' taste and guilty pleasures , the same way that looking at someone 's bookcase or record collection ( or iPod ) for five minutes can tell you more about them than be gleaned in a three - hour car trip .
I mean , what 's the first ( well , second or third ) thing you ask a new acquaintance ?
" What kind of music do you like ?
What bands are you into ? "
So , please knock me out with a terrific , inspired cover .
Let me sing along in my head or out loud .
Let me anticipate the break .
Let me be surprised by a new hook .
And let me turn up the good ones and share them , puffing the poetry of a great song into the air like seeds from an electric dandelion .
After a lifetime in music , some of my biggest thrills come from a loud ' n ' twisted or softly mesmerizing remake now , more than ever , within fingertips ' reach on the Web .
Below , ten of my favorites .
And below that , a list of 1,882 more .

Alabama state regulators officially closed Colonial Friday night .
But it had been embattled for months , and its failure was considered imminent .
Its balance sheet was saddled with construction and commercial real estate loans , and its financial condition had been rapidly deteriorating .
Toward the end , Colonial tried to secure federal bailout money ; but those efforts turned up several accounting irregularities that prompted a criminal investigation by the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department .
The deal ensures that the bank ’s depositors will not suffer losses , although its stockholders will be wiped out .
But the F.D.I.C. ’s industry - supported insurance fund will be liable for a big portion of Colonial ’s $ 25 billion loan portfolio .
The F.D.I.C. will absorb all the losses on a $ 3 billion pool of the most risky assets , including those believed to be entangled in fraud , according to a person briefed on the pool .
Federal regulators will split the losses with BB&T on another $ 15 billion pool that is largely made up of commercial real estate and construction loans .
BB&T will be responsible for losses on the remaining $ 7 billion worth of assets , which it will own outright .
Federal regulators have offered similar loss - sharing arrangements to lure prospective buyers for several other seized banks .
With the number of bank failures expected to rise , F.D.I.C officials have grown increasingly concerned about protecting the deposit insurance fund .
It had been drained to about $ 13 billion at the end of the first quarter , the latest number available , and some banking experts are worried that the agency might be forced to turn to an emergency credit line from the Treasury Department for short - term funding .

That , in turn , could put even more pressure on the banking industry if the F.D.I.C. imposed another costly assessment on banks .
“ Banks need that money to rebuild capital so they can lend more , ” said Jaret Seiberg , a financial policy analyst in Washington .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- America is finally getting a detailed look at the sweeping , long - awaited health - care reform platform championed by President Obama .
This week the Democrats have unveiled their two primary proposals -- a 700 - plus page bill in the Senate and the outline of the forthcoming version in the House that presents essentially the same blueprint for change .
The crucial question about Obama 's agenda has always been whether it really will slow the disastrous rise in health - care spending , or actually increase it while hiding the real costs of the new system .
On analyzing the bills , the conclusion is inescapable : Obama promises Americans what appears to be a bargain by heavily subsidizing their premiums .
But the only way to pay for what 's really outrageously expensive coverage will be huge tax increases , especially on the same middle class that 's being wooed as the chief beneficiary of reform .
The plans contain four proposals that will substantially weaken the ability of the market , already limited by burdensome regulation , to restrain medical spending .
First , they will impose rich , standard packages of benefits , with low deductibles , for all Americans .
Those policies , typically containing everything from in - vitro fertilization to mental health benefits , are usually far more expensive than anything most people would pay for with their own money .
Second , the plans would impose on a federal level the doctrine of community rating , in which all customers have to be offered the same rates , regardless of their health risks .
Community rating forces young people to pay far more than their actual cost , a main reason for today 's 46 million uninsured , while it subsidizes older patients .
Third , Obama would ban consumers from buying private insurance across state lines , perpetuating the price differences in today 's fragmented market , instead of allowing all Americans to shop anywhere for the best deals .
Fourth , both plans propose what 's known as a " public option , " or a Medicare - style plan that would compete with the private offerings .
The previous three proposals would make the private plans extremely expensive .
With the same subsidies , the Medicare - style plan could put them out of business .
Before we get into the specifics of each problem , it 's important to note that Obama 's health - care plan is not included in his 2010 budget .
The administration pledges that his health - care plan wo n't expand the deficit because it will be entirely paid for by tax increases .
But even if the deficit stays the same , spending and taxes will be far from the same .
By most estimates , Obama 's plan will cost more than $ 200 billion a year by 2019 .
All told , government outlays as a share of GDP are projected to reach 26 % by that point , up five percentage points from when Obama took office .
Now , let 's examine the four ways in which the new proposals are likely to increase costs :
1. ) The two bills would require states to establish insurance " exchanges " that would offer a variety of plans .
The rub is that the federal government would impose minimum standards on all of those plans , from New York to Wyoming to Hawaii , that are often more stringent and expensive than the existing laws require .
A case in point is the first requirement , the minimum benefits package .
Today , many states require a menu of costly coverage , while others impose only light requirements .
Colorado , for example , mandates hair transplants , rehab services , and hearing aids , while Illinois requires none of them .
The Senate bill gives a preliminary list that includes mental health and prescription drug benefits , and substance abuse programs .
That 's the minimum menu that all states would have to offer .
A special panel of experts would add to that list -- and you can bet that the additions would be substantial and costly .
As a result , it would be far more difficult for consumers to purchase basic , stripped down , low - cost policies for catastrophic care that are bargains in states like Alabama or Indiana .
2. ) In its purest form , community rating requires that insurers charge the same premiums for all their patients , regardless of their age , obesity or any lifestyle differences .
New York , New Jersey and a half - dozen other states have stringent community rating laws .
In most states , insurers can charge their customers according to their actual costs , so a 62 - year - old smoker would pay , say , $ 10,000 for a policy versus $ 800 for a 20 - year - old marathoner .
The senate plan would impose a strict , narrow band on all premiums nationwide : Insurers could never charge more than twice as much in premiums for their most expensive patient versus their least costly .
So the 62 - year - old 's policy might fall to $ 5,000 , and the 20 - year - old 's would go to $ 2,500 .
The senior would get a big subsidy , and the youngster would pay far more than his real cost .
3. ) The state " exchanges " would exist in 50 totally separate markets .
Even with the harmonization of community rating and benefits packages , the differences in prices across states would remain large .
Allowing Americans to buy insurance anywhere , at the lowest prices , would create nationwide competition that would drive down costs everywhere .
But the Obama plan will not allow a true national market .
It 's remarkable that Obama would endorse a plan that perpetuates big price differences .
His solution for Medicare is to do just the opposite by flattening costs in the most expensive regions to match the lowest levels anywhere in the U.S .
4. ) The so - called public option is now included in both the Senate and House bills , and is strongly endorsed by Obama .
Under the public option , the exchanges would offer a plan resembling Medicare for more than 100 million working Americans .
Today , most of them are covered by their employers ' plans .
But the Democrats ' proposals contain a " pay or play " provision that would allow companies , in effect , to drop their coverage and substitute a payroll tax .
Because their health care costs are growing so rapidly , it 's likely that most companies would dump their plans .
" That 's what will happen , " says John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis , which champions free - market solutions to health care .
" Employees could then go to the exchanges and get subsidized insurance . "
The problem here is that the public option would compete directly with the private plans .
Both would be heavily subsidized , with Americans making up to $ 110,000 eligible for assistance under the Senate proposal .
It 's likely that the Medicare - like option will drive out private insurers , since the government plan has several advantages .
The plans impose public - utility - like restrictions on the insurers , capping their profits and transferring premiums from the insurers with the younger , healthier patients to those who serve an older , sicker population .
Those restrictions will hardly make them nimble competitors .
At the same time , the imposition of costly benefits packages and community rating will raise their costs .
That the government enjoys an edge in purchasing does n't mean that the overall costs will fall .
It 's precisely the opposite .
The public plan will be so heavily subsidized that Americans will tend to over - consume expensive medical services just the way they do now under regular Medicare .
Only this time , the number of patients will be almost three times larger .
The demand for everything from knee surgery to mental health counseling will soar .
But the government will keep a lid on prices , so Americans , for the first time , will be faced with rationing .
The hospitals and physicians simply wo n't be able to satisfy the unhinged demand for the services that look like a bargain .
The lines will grow .
And so will the spending , and the taxes .
And that 's what Obama is n't telling you .

Stoners are always looking for like minded people because it ’s more fun to share than it is to smoke alone .
So if you ’re wandering around looking for someone to smoke some herb with , then you better know how to tell if someone is a stoner .
We do n’t think we should define what is a stoner or the stoner personality , but we thinks it ’s important to say , just as a disclaimer , that you can get some pretty strange reactions if you wander up to a non -smoker asking if they want to share your joint .
Some people has in their minds the “ classic stoner with dreads ” or the hippie kind when we talk about how to spot a stoner , but it ’s not that easy nowadays .
There are even people that ask the differences between pothead vs stoner …
Well , if you ’re one of those , there are no differences between stoner and pothead , it ’s a different word to designate the same concept .
Those people are probably here wanting stoner quizzes to know if they smoke enough weed to become one or questions to ask a stoner to reveal their identity as if it was that easy .
So , if you are one of those searching for a magic formula , we can tell you that these tricks will work better .
There ’s a famous Norman Rockwell painting titled “ Freedom of Speech , ” depicting an idealized American town meeting .
The painting , part of a series illustrating F.D.R. ’s “ Four Freedoms , ” shows an ordinary citizen expressing an unpopular opinion .
His neighbors obviously do n’t like what he ’s saying , but they ’re letting him speak his mind .
That ’s a far cry from what has been happening at recent town halls , where angry protesters  some of them , with no apparent sense of irony , shouting “ This is America ! ”  have been drowning out , and in some cases threatening , members of Congress trying to talk about health reform .
Some commentators have tried to play down the mob aspect of these scenes , likening the campaign against health reform to the campaign against Social Security privatization back in 2005 .
But there ’s no comparison .
I ’ve gone through many news reports from 2005 , and while anti-privatization activists were sometimes raucous and rude , I ca n’t find any examples of congressmen shouted down , congressmen hanged in effigy , congressmen surrounded and followed by taunting crowds .
And I can’t find any counterpart to the death threats at least one congressman has received .
So this is something new and ugly .
What ’s behind it ?
What Health Care Can Learn From Whole Foods
I 've gotten a couple requests to respond to John Mackey 's op - ed advocating a series of health - care reforms that would n't solve anybody 's health - care problems .
The ideas in there are n't interesting and are n't new .
The archives of this blog contain plenty of posts explaining why , for instance , it would n't help matters for the federal government to declare it illegal for Arizona to mandate that insurers cover mammograms and diabetic care .
What is new to people is that Mackey is writing the op - ed .
Mackey founded Whole Foods , a traditional favorite of liberals , and so his libertarianism comes as a surprise to some .
But the interesting insights on health - care reform do n't come from the CEO of Whole Foods .
They come from the stores .
Food is more like health care than it is like cable television .
We worry if people do n't have enough food to eat .
We worry quite a lot , in fact .
So we have a variety of programs meant to ensure that people have sufficient food .
If you do n't have much money , you rely on these programs .
As of September 2008 , about 11 percent of the population was on food stamps .
It 's probably somewhat higher now .
Millions more rely on the Women , Infants , and Children nutrition program , and reduced - price school lunches .
The insight that people need food has not led us to simply deregulate the agricultural sector ( though that might be a good idea for other reasons ) or change the tax treatment of food purchases or make it easier for rich people to donate to food banks , which is what Mackey recommends for health care .
It 's led us to solve , or try and solve , the problem directly by giving people money to buy food .
And that works .
These programs , as every Whole Foods shopper knows , have n't grown to encompass the whole population or set prices in grocery stores .
If you have more money , you shop for food on your own .
And if you have a lot of money , you shop at Mackey 's stores .
That 's pretty much the model we 're looking at in this iteration of health - care reform .
We 're also laying down some rules so grocery stores -- excuse me , health insurers -- can't simply refuse to sell you their product , or take it away after it 's already been purchased ..
Mackey , playing to type , has offered a Whole Foods solution for health care :
It makes the system even better for the rich and the young and the educated -- the sort of people who shop at Whole Foods , in other words -- and does n't do a lot for those who really need help .
But the existence of a vibrant institution like Whole Foods within a broader system that considers it unacceptable -- at least in theory -- for the poor to go hungry , and so subsidizes their purchase of food , does have lessons for heath - care reform .

Anna Kournikova allegedly involved in a Las Vegas bar fight
Tennis player Anna Kournikova was reportedly involved in a brawl in a Las Vegas nightclub on Saturday after a woman threw a drink over her .
The blonde beauty , who is dating singer Enrique Iglesias , was partying with pals at nightspot Lavo in Sin City when a fellow club goer took offense at the group ’s behavior .
According to New York Post gossip column Page Six , the woman felt “ Anna was invading her space , ” and reacted by soaking the star in an alcoholic beverage .
The publication claims a fight ensued when Kournikova “ sprung into action ” and started to push and shout at the woman before the reveler was kicked out .

CIA Withholds Key Torture Documents From ACLU
Judge Hellerstein had ordered the government to turn over the documents by August 31 , following an ACLU lawsuit , or else to provide justification for continuing to withhold them .
However , in a court filing late Monday , the CIA said if will not release the documents , claiming that disclosing details about the enhanced interrogation program would harm national security .
In its filing , the CIA also argued that the information available to the public about the enhanced interrogation program should be limited to its historical context and legal underpinning .
“ Giving the vast amount of evidence that the US torture program was widespread and systemic , it is disappointing that the government continues to withhold these vital documents that would fill in the remaining gaps in the public record , ” said Alex Abdo from the ACLU .
Most of the revelations about the US treatment of terrorism suspects were uncovered following lawsuits from the ACLU .
One of the key ACLU lawyer in the case , Amrit Singh , was interviewed yesterday by NPR ’s Melissa Block .
Singh said that beside the fact that 100,000 documents are now with the ACLU , the information in the public domain remains incomplete .
Amrit Singh is specifically pushing for the release of the photographs withheld by the Obama administration .
“ These photographs , the government concedes , depict the abuse of prisoners .
And yes , there are different from text because images convey what words possibly cannot .
And the whole point of getting these photos out into the public domain is so that the best evidence of the treatment of prisoners can be aired , and the public can draw its own conclusion , ” said Singh .

Time is running out for wealthy Americans with secret Swiss bank accounts as they weigh whether to hand themselves in to the Internal Revenue Service or gamble that their names are not among the thousands set to be exposed in one of the U.S. government ’s most aggressive efforts to hunt down international tax cheats .
The Swiss government will turn over names of suspected U.S. tax dodgers who have held 4,450 secret accounts at banking giant UBS -- accounts that at one point together contained as much as $ 18 billion , U.S. officials said Wednesday .
Furthermore , the Swiss government promised to assist Washington in similar investigations at other Swiss banks , the IRS said .
The announcement follows a long - running U.S. effort to penetrate Swiss bank secrecy , focusing first on UBS .
The federal government had been seeking a U.S. court order demanding that UBS identify the holders of 52,000 accounts .
The Swiss government had promised to block such a disclosure , leading to weeks of negotiations followed by Wednesday ’s announcement of a settlement .
“ We will be receiving an unprecedented amount of information , ” IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman said .
“ This agreement represents a major step forward with the IRS ’ efforts to pierce the veil of bank secrecy and combat offshore tax evasion . ”

The U.S. - Swiss deal is a blow to rich Americans who have enjoyed Switzerland ’s legendary banking secrecy .
Some UBS customers have taken advantage of a leniency program that allows them to come forward to the IRS in exchange for reduced penalties .
That program , which began in March , expires Sept. 23 .
But others may want to take the chance that their accounts wo n’t be uncovered .
It is n’t clear how the names will be chosen .
“ You really have to think about whether you want to stick your head out and do this , or make the calculated judgment that your name is not going to be disclosed , ” said Robert W. Ray , a white - collar criminal defense lawyer at Pryor Cashman .
He said some of his clients had taken advantage of the leniency program , but others were waiting on the sidelines to see what they should do .

IRS officials offered no estimate of how much the agency might recoup in back taxes and penalties .
Shulman said the deal sent an “ unmistakable message ” to tax dodgers : “ Wealthy Americans who have hidden their money offshore will find themselves in a jam , ” he said .
But Sen. Carl Levin ( D - Mich . ) , who held hearings on UBS last year , called the U.S. - Swiss deal “ at most a modest advance ” toward ending abuses of bank secrecy .
The Swiss government has agreed to work with the U.S. on similar requests for disclosure involving other Swiss banks , Shulman said on a conference call with reporters .

UBS Chairman Kaspar Villiger said in a statement that the settlement “ helps resolve one of UBS ’s most pressing issues . ”
UBS will pay no penalties under the deal , the bank said .
In February , to avoid criminal prosecution , UBS agreed to pay the U.S. government $ 780 million and admitted that it had schemed to defraud the U.S. by helping Americans hide money from the IRS .
At that time , the Swiss provided the names of 200 to 300 American depositors , and UBS said Swiss law prohibited it from disclosing any more .
Switzerland was fighting to preserve the reputation for privacy that has made its banking industry a global powerhouse and a pillar of the Swiss economy .

The settlement announced Wednesday includes potentially face - saving concessions for Switzerland , as it argues that its tradition of secrecy survived the battle .
The U.S. agreed to narrow its request for names to those considered most likely to have engaged in tax evasion .
Swiss law already allowed the release of client information under certain egregious circumstances , such as fraud .
But the threshold for disclosing the information has been a point of contention .
Sydneysiders are being warned that a huge dust cloud will continue to affect the city through the day , after they woke to an eerie red dawn this morning .
The huge dust storm which has settled over the city and much of New South Wales was carried east overnight by gale - force winds of up to 100 kph .
This morning the weather bureau said the dust cloud was expected to hang around until late afternoon .
Senior forecaster Barry Hanstrum says more high winds are on the way and could cause more damage .
" The winds wo n't drop off until later today and when they do we think that the dust haze will start to clear , " he said .
" The weather system that generated the dust yesterday is associated with gale force winds and the area which is most likely to be affected today is the Wollongong - Greater Sydney region and the Hunter Valley - Newcastle area .
" The winds at times during the morning will average 65 k ph , which is gale force , with some stronger squally gusts up to about 90 - 100 k ph . "
The dust reduced visibility across the city and large parts of the state , with callers to ABC Radio saying the scene looked like something from the end of the world .
The bureau has issued a severe weather warning for damaging winds in Sydney and other parts of NSW , with a gale warning issued for Sydney closed waters .
Environmental Health director Dr Wayne Smith says people in poor health , especially those with asthma and heart and lung disease should remain indoors .
He says children with health problems , as well as older adults and pregnant women , should also take precautions and people should avoid heavy exercise .
' Like Armageddon '
Karen from Dulwich Hill , in Sydney 's inner west , says she woke up to find the red dust had covered her floors and birds had been blown out of their nests .
" It did feel like Armageddon because when I was in the kitchen looking out the skylight , there was this red , red glow coming through , " she said .
Mick told ABC Online : " In Sydney 's south - western suburbs I 've just woken up to a glowing red window !
Thought it was Armageddon !
Either that or South Korea [ sic ] had nuked us ! "
Another ABC Online contributor wrote in : " Red. Dusty .
Making hard to breath ...
There are baby birds dead in our backyard .
And our cat 's gone missing . "
Another listener says her lakeside vista has been replaced by a desert view .
Others have commented on how birds are struggling to cope with the haze , with some " falling out of the sky " .
Another said : " I went out for a ride on my bicycle and I ended up looking like a red panda . "
Caller Mary spoke about a dust storm she saw in 1939 : " I was 13 years of age and I lived in Leichhardt , " she said .
" I remember I walked to my aunt 's place and you could n't see your hand in front of your face .
The colour was a sort of yellowy - brown . "
Schools open
Meanwhile , schools are still open and parents are being told to send their children to school unless they have asthma or other breathing problems .
Sydney Ferries cancelled its services earlier but they are now set to resume .
Flights into Sydney have been diverted to Brisbane and Melbourne .
Departing flights are delayed .
Steve , who is driving to Tamworth , says rain is making conditions even more treacherous .
" It 's almost raining mud , " he told ABC Local Radio .
" I have a green car and it's now an orange car .
The wipers are barely able to cope with all the mud . "
Calls for help
The dust storm is also creating work for the fire brigade , with a huge amount of false alarms triggered by the dust
Supreintendent Warwick Kidd says crews in Sydney have had more than 500 call - outs this morning .
" This is certainly an extraordinary event for us , ' he said .
" The dust actuates in some of the electrical componentry and also some of these alarms are actually particle alarms that go off with the particles inside the smoke .
" The dust simulates smoke so the fire alarm goes off . "
The ambulance service has received around 140 calls from people having breathing difficulties because of the dust , since the storms began .
More than 50 calls were made from Sydney , 50 from the state 's west , 23 from the north and 12 from southern regions .
The SES had 175 calls for help overnight .
Most came from Crookwell , north of Canberra , where hail the size of cricket balls has fallen and roofs have been damaged .
' Pretty widespread '
Bureau of Meteorology spokeswoman Jane Golding said dust had settled on much of the state , including Sydney .
" It 's pretty widespread , " she said .
" We 've had reports of low visibility up out as far up as Moree , Dubbo , Canberra 's got some raised dust in the area and Wollongong , so it 's very widespread . "
Gale force winds of up to 100 kph hit the Hunter region before moving through Sydney early this morning .
" Dubbo 's still in pretty thick dust .
The dust will last a bit but we 're also expecting those winds to pick up as well . "
Havoc in the Hunter
The storm has also wreaked havoc in the Hunter Valley , where the dusty air reducing visibility to between 100 and 200 metres .
Peter from Branxton says he cannot see past his front gate .
" It looks foggy but it 's not fog , if you 're going to do a movie about the end of the world you 'd do it today , " he said .
Lorraine from Broke thought there was a bushfire .
" It 's very dusty , visibility is very poor and we have an orange crimson light , it 's quite eerie , " she said .
Steve from Maitland says he has never seen anything like it .
" Bushfirey - type smoke , but the dust is very pungent ...
I 've just shut the house up , " he said .
Yesterday gale force winds whipped up heavy dust storms and powerful electrical storms across parts of New South Wales .
The winds will also reach parts of Victoria , where a flash flooding warning has been issued .

Alex Jones - Introduction
Alex Jones is a talk radio show host from Dallas , Texas - though I 'm pretty sure that he spends most of his time in Austin , Texas today .
I first heard of Alex Jones in 2000 from somewhere on the Internet .
He did n't seem much different from any other conspiracy theorist out there at the time , but in recent years he 's blown up and become a rather large figure in the conspiracy arena .
Originally this site was only going to cover the Zeitgeist movie , but I really enjoyed researching that film and I decided I wanted to do something else .
Alex Jones tells people to " look at the evidence and decide for yourself " - so that 's what I 'm doing .
Keep in mind that I will also discuss movies he directed , produced , and wrote even if someone else 's name is on them , for two primary reasons :
Any movies he produces , directs , etc he has a heavy hand in the content
He is almost always associated as a creator of the film by his fans , followers , etc .
Unfortunately I could n't find transcripts to all of his movies , only a few of them , and I was really wanting to start with his first movie and then go through the list .
I could type out the transcripts myself , but that takes a lot of time .
So , I started on the ones I do have the transcripts for , starting with the earliest and moving to the newest one at this time , the Obama Deception .
Articles
This is a list of complete and incomplete articles related to Alex Jones on my web site .
If you want to see only the ones that are completed , see the list on the left side of this page .
Dark Secrets : Inside Bohemian Grove Released in 2000 this film covers the occult agenda Alex Jones believes is happening at the Bohemian Grove in California .
It also contains footage of him sneaking in and his analysis of their " summer ritual " .
The Order of Death Released in 2005 this is the follow up to Dark Secrets : Inside Bohemian Grove - it contains some new footage from an " insider " at the Grove , as well as more analysis from Alex Jones about the occult .
The Obama Deception Released in 2009 , this movie is likely to be Alex Jones ' most popular movie of all time .
It covers President Barack Obama and what his true agenda is .
Methodology
One of the things that makes discussing Alex Jones harder than discussing Zeitgeist is that he makes many vague statements and statements with blind sources -- such as " The UN is going to take over the world " , without any discussion of how or why .
I 'll do my best to discuss all I can in the various articles related to him , and if I can't find the origin for a statement he makes , I 'll say so and attempt to discuss his statement without any sources - I 'll be sure to note I do not have any sources if that case comes up .
As usual , statements from the movie will appear in a different color , usually green , and my statements , quotes , etc appear in black .
One important issue I 've found when researching Alex Jones is that he sees what he believes and not the other way around .
Meaning he wants to see something so he sees it , instead of what 's actually happening .

UK 's oldest Roman Coin found in Thatcham UK 's oldest Roman Coin found in Thatcham Imagine finding a 2,000 year old Roman coin near the ancient path of the Ridgeway that had slipped from the fingers of a Celt in 207BC .
Thatcham metal detectorist Malcolm Langford has discovered the UK 's oldest Roman coin .
The UK 's oldest Roman coin .
Driven by his love of history , retired electrician Malcolm Langford has been metal detecting for seven years , always with the permission of the relevant landowner .
Treasure Treasure Trove was originally defined as gold or silver in any form , whether coin , plate or bullion which had been hidden and rediscovered , and which no person could prove he or she owned .
The Treasure Trove law was replaced by the Treasure Act in 1996 .
If you find treasure there is a legal obligation to report it .
The British Museum decides if a found item falls under the treasure act , and then the local coroner holds an inquest to decide who is the legal finder of the treasure .
If the museum decides to buy the treasure , it must pay the finder its full value .
However , most metal detectors agree to split any money from treasure found 50/50 with the landowner where the treasure was found .
He has found everything from stone age artefacts to Roman coins , and enjoys taking his finds to schools to pass on his passion for the past .
But his latest find , the UK's oldest Roman coin , has amazed archeologists .
Malcolm told BBC Berkshire 's Henry Kelly : " It was in a pasture field , near the ancient Ridgeway and it was probably six to eight inches into the ground .
" I dug it up and I could see it was a Republican denarius because there was a Roman head on it .
The Ridgeway " It came out of the ground all brown , and I used a bit of spit and a bit of sheep 's wool to clean it and it came up silver . "
Malcolm said he discovered the age of the coin when he took it , along with another Iron Age silver coin of Eppillus to the West Berkshire and Oxfordshire Finds Liaison Officer , Anni Byard , so she could record them .
Anni immediately confirmed the Iron Age coin was only one of 11 that have been recorded in the UK and suspected the Roman coin , a Republican silver denarius , was quite rare .
She said : " I almost fell of my chair when I found out what date it was , it 's in almost mint condition , which shows it was here much earlier than other Roman coins .
" Historically it 's a wonderful find and I think Malcolm should be very proud .
Malcolm Langford , Henry and Anni Byard .
" This coin is very important .
It means that these Republican denarii were around in Britain before the Claudian invasion in AD 43 and possibly even before Caesar .
" At that time there was a lot of trade going on .
It could have been a Celtic trader or a mercenary back from the wars . "
" A find like this could update all of our history books . "
The silver denarius depicts the helmeted head of Roma on the obverse and the galloping Dioscuri on the reverse .
The coin was struck in Rome during the Republican period , just two years before the Roman general Scipio defeated Hannibal near Carthage .
Republican silver denarii are often found in Britain , and although the coins began to be struck in Rome in 211 BC , this new coin appears to be the earliest denarius recorded from Britain , earlier than any of the 600 similar coins which have been recorded .
Malcolm said : " I was so excited I was like a dog with six tails , I did n’t know which one to wag first ! "

History The Big Picture
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites .
It would be wise for anyone concerned about climate change to keep an eye on the movements and pronouncements of the US Chamber of Commerce over the next few months as Barack Obama 's cap - and - trade bill finally reaches the Senate .
The world 's largest not - for - profit business federation has made it patently clear in recent months that it does not like the look of the so - called Waxman - Markey bill .
In fact , it thinks it stinks .
So much so that it is currently trying every trick in the lobbyist 's handbook to scupper its legislative progress .
For example , it is currently supporting the Energy Citizens campaign , which bills itself as
a nationwide alliance of organisations and individuals formed to bring together people across America to remind Congress that energy is the backbone of our nation 's economy and our way of life .
On the surface , Energy Citizens has the look and feel of AN Other citizen movement holding folksy grassroots " rallies " across the US to get across its point of view .
In the past week or so , it has held events in Indiana , Colorado , Florida , North Dakota , Missouri and Tennessee .
On its website it promotes a " Share Your Stories " facility for citizens to post their own messages and videos .
One recent example is " Shaka " from Tennessee urging the Senate to " do the smart thing and defeat this bill " .
The use of his first name helps to give the video that all - important " ordinary joe " impression .
But hang on : could our Shaka actually be this Shaka , the one who is listed as the executive vice president of the Tennessee Center for Policy Research which is " dedicated to providing concerned citizens , the media and public leaders with expert empirical research and timely free market policy solutions to public policy issues in Tennessee " , and provides a link on its website to the Carnival of Climate Change sceptics site ?
There sure does seem to be a striking resemblance between the two .
Uncanny .
Almost .
Is it really any wonder that Energy Citizens is now being cited as little more than a front for the sorts of big business / free - market lobbyists – a la the US Chamber of Commerce - who are instinctively drawn to the global - warming - is - baloney school of thinking ?
( for more on Energy Citizens and the rise of astroturfing , read Bobbie Johnson 's blog ) .
Professional lobby groups have been bending , cajoling and manipulating public discourse and opinion in ways similar to this for decades .
If they can interrupt the debate , or better still muddy or even stall it , then their vested interests can be protected and allowed to prosper without hindrance .
Such dark arts have been described in the past as " manufacturing doubt " .
But in an interesting recent twist , the US Chamber of Commerce is now calling for the " truth " to be outed once and for all .
It is demanding that the science that underpins our understanding of anthropogenic climate change be " put on trial " .
In papers filed with the federal court on 25 August , it argues that the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) should hold a public hearing " complete with witnesses , cross-examinations and a judge who would rule , essentially , on whether humans are warming the planet to dangerous effect " .
The LA Times , which broke the story , reported a US Chamber of Commerce official as describing the hearing as " the Scopes monkey trial of the 21st century " , in reference to the 1925 test case that saw the prosecution of a Tennessee teacher named John Scopes for violating a state law that forbade any public school teacher from denying the Bible 's account of man 's origin .
" It would be evolution versus creationism , " said William L Kovacs , the US Chamber of Commerce 's senior vice president for environment , technology and regulatory affairs .
" It would be the science of climate change on trial . "
The papers filed with the federal court make interesting reading .
The US Chamber of Commerce is saying that it wants the EPA to hold its " Endangerment Finding Proceeding " into whether carbon dioxide emissions are harmful to public health in public and on the record .
It says that a proceeding on the record …
… is necessary to narrow the areas of scientific uncertainty , to permit a credible weighing of the scientific evidence , and to enable submitters of proof to demonstrate the falsity of some [ the EPA 's ] key erroneous claims .
… will narrow any uncertainty on the question whether , on balance , higher temperatures will not lead to net increases in human mortality .
… will enable the EPA to resolve any uncertainties about the impacts of higher temperatures on the conventional pollutants entitled to the greatest weight in considering the issue of endangerment .
… will permit the parties to provide any necessary confirmation that temperature increases would overall benefit human welfare and the environment , and allow the EPA to receive evidence rebutting unsubstantiated claims to the contrary .
… is the most efficient and only complete method for testing the competing claims in the record concerning extreme weather events and disease .
… is necessary because the EPA has generated legitimate concern that it has prejudged the outcome of the proposed endangerment finding , only an on - the - record process can produce a reliable and legally durable outcome .
It also argues that a " transparent , on - the - record process with no ex parte communications or political interference is required , would be manageable here , and indeed would be the best way to ensure that scientific integrity prevails " .
Go to the bottom of the document and you can see that it means business : it has hired the services of Kirkland & Ellis LLP , one of the world 's largest corporate law firms .
As it says on its own website :
In every year since 1995 , Kirkland has ranked as one of the most frequently used firms by Fortune 100 companies in The National Law Journal survey , ' Who Represents Corporate America ' .
It then proceeds to list its corporate clients , which include Boeing , BP America , Dow Chemical , General Motors , McDonalds , Raytheon and Siemens .
Far more pertinent , though , is a quick look though the membership list of the US Chamber of Commerce itself .
It claims 3 m small businesses as members , but also boasts some big household names on its board , including Pfizer , ConocoPhillips , Caterpillar Inc , IBM , Accenture , Eastman Kodak , Lockheed Martin , Deloitte , FedEx Express , Fox Entertainment , The Carlyle Group , Rolls - Royce North America , and US Airways .
Do all these companies really want to be associated with such a trial ?
Possibly not , as it happens .
It appears that not all of the board members are happy with the US Chamber of Commerce 's public position on climate change .
Back in May , a group of members including Nike and Johnson & Johnson publicly expressed their dissatisfaction with the US Chamber of Commerce 's increasingly strident stance on the issue .
According to Politico.com , Johnson & Johnson asked the Chamber to refrain from making comments on climate change unless they " reflect the full range of views , especially those of Chamber members advocating for congressional action . "
Meanwhile , a Nike spokeswoman said her company has also been " vocal " with the Chamber 's leaders " about wanting them to take a more progressive stance on the issue of climate change . "
It 's highly tempting to call the Chamber 's bluff on such a trial and say " bring it on " .
It sure would be fun – and deeply revealing – to see who it would call as its expert witnesses .
But the reality is such a trial would provide the distraction and delay it so evidently craves .
What the proposed trial does provide , though , is a sobering reminder about the combined might and resources of the forces that are now working so hard to scupper any meaningful action on reducing emissions .
I ’m pretty sad , I ’ll tell you what .
After 13 seasons , on Sept. 13 at 8 p.m. , Fox ’s King of the Hill will air its last two episodes , back to back .
Fans will want to check out the current issue of Entertainment Weekly , in which Hank , Peggy , Bobby , Luanne , and Hank ’s alley pals — with the help of the KOTH writers — share their parting words of wisdom ( Says Bobby , “ Football and propane are what make America tick .
Oh , really , my dad wo n’t be reading this ?
Then , I dance with troll dolls and I love it ! ” ) .
These pearls are accompanied by an original drawing of the gang ’s farewell cookout that you ’ll want to hang up on your wall and stare at wistfully the next time you smell propane .
One of my favorite shows , Mike Judge ’s KOTH has been on the air for 13 seasons , as comfortably reliable a part of the TV landscape as David Letterman and Doppler radar .
( Well , semi-reliable :
In its later years , Fox scooted it all over the schedule like it was in the witness relocation program . )
It never got old to me , as there was no mythology to burn out , no romances to come and go , just funny , perceptive storylines .
The characters never aged ( the writers say that the entire run took place over one year in Arlen , Texas ) , nor did they evolve .
And that was kind of the point :
They were suburbanites who wanted no surprises , and for their worlds to stay happily familiar .
Everything was fine with Hank , as long as his lawn was in good shape , he had enough gas in the tank for the weekend barbecue , Dale Gribble was n’t setting his house on fire , and everyone around him was patriotic .
( Much like Everybody Loves Raymond , another classic sitcom about stagnant suburbanites , KOTH wo n’t go out with a stunt - filled finale .
The last episodes will be characteristically low - key and organic : Bobby becomes an in - demand date for the Homecoming dance , and later bonds with his dad after getting a job inspecting raw meat at the local plant . )
As we approach these final new moments with the Hills ( who thankfully will live on in reruns and rerun accessories ) , let ’s reminisce :
What were your favorite King of the Hill moments ?
After 255 episodes , they ’re hard to narrow down , but here are some of my top picks : I loved when Hank , Boomhauer , Bill , and Dale become volunteer firefighters and ruin a funeral and burn down the firehouse .
( Frankly , anything with lonely sad - sack Bill is great with me . )
Then there are the classic Bobby storylines : he forgets to send in the home insurance bill ; he becomes obsessed with Dance , Dance Revolution ; and after learning self - defense to protect himself from bullies , he becomes addicted to kicking people in the groin .
( “ I did n’t go looking for trouble .
Trouble came a - knockin’ and Bobby Hill ’s foot answered the door . ” )

An Illinois bright spark , who decided the best way to check the level of combustible fluid in a petrol can was by using a cigarette lighter , ended up with a torched car and second - degree burns .
According to the Chicago Sun-Times , the unnamed 27 - year - old woman was in a gas station in Joliet last week and " was filling up a gas can , which was sitting on the passenger seat of the car " , as police later explained .
The cops continued : " She then used a lighter to observe how full the can was . "
The petrol duly ignited , the can exploded and " apparently afraid that the fire would spread to the gas pump she had been using , the woman began to push the burning car " .
Firefighters arrived to find the vehicle ablaze about five feet from the pump .
The woman was treated at the scene for " second - degree burns to her right wrist and right thigh " , and was later admitted into hospital with serious but not life - threatening injuries . ®

Did we really need Jimmy Carter to tell us that racism is one of the driving forces behind the relentless and often scurrilous attacks on President Obama ?
We did n’t know that ?
As John McEnroe might say , “ You ca n’t be serious . ”
“ There is an inherent feeling among many in this country that an African - American should not be president , ” said Mr. Carter .
I guess he was aiming his remarks at those who contended when Mr. Obama was elected that we had achieved some Pollyannaish postracial society .
But it ’s hard to imagine , after all the madness and vitriol of the past few months , that anyone still believes that .
For many white Americans , Barack Obama is nothing more than that black guy in the White House , and they want him out of there .
( Mr. Carter knows a little something about kowtowing to that crowd .
During his presidential campaign in 1976 , he blithely let it be known that he had no problem with residents “ trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods , ” and he tossed around ugly terms like “ black intrusion ” and “ alien groups . ”
He later apologized . )
More than three decades later we have Sherri Goforth , an aide to a Republican state senator in Tennessee sending out a mass e-mail of a cartoon showing dignified portraits of the first 43 presidents , and then representing the 44th  President Obama  as a spook , a cartoonish pair of white eyes against a black background .
Facebook bully jailed : Death threat girl , 18 , is first person put behind bars for vicious internet campaign
' Twisted ' : Keeley Houghton arrives at court to receive a three - month prison sentence
A teenager who posted a death threat on Facebook , yesterday became the first person in Britain to be jailed for bullying on a social networking site .
Keeley Houghton , 18 , said she would kill Emily Moore , whom she had bullied for four years since they were at school together .
On her personal page , Houghton wrote of her victim : ' Keeley is going to murder the bitch .
She is an actress .
What a ******* liberty .
Emily **** head Moore .'
Two days before she made the threat , Houghton had intimidated Emily , who is also 18 , after spotting her in a pub .
Sara Stock , prosecuting , told Worcester magistrates : ' When Emily was sitting on her own the defendant came over and sat next to her and asked her , " Are you Emily Moore ?
Can I have a huggle ? "
Emily told the defendant to leave her alone otherwise she would call the police .
Keeley then told her , " I 'll give you something to ring the police about " . '
Yesterday , jobless Houghton sobbed as she was sentenced to three months in a young offenders ' institution after pleading guilty to harassment .
She was also given a restraining order banning her from contacting Emily in person , via the internet or in any other manner for five years .
People have previously been jailed for harassment and stalking on social networking sites but she is thought to be the first to be jailed for bullying via the internet .
Houghton , of Malvern , Worcestershire , had two previous convictions relating to her vendetta against Emily , the court heard .
In 2005 she was convicted of assaulting her as she walked home from school .
Houghton was subsequently expelled from school .
Two years later she was convicted of causing criminal damage to Emily 's home after kicking her front door .
District Judge Bruce Morgan said : ' Since Emily Moore was 14 you have waged compelling threats and violent abuse towards her .
' Bullies are by their nature cowards , in school and society .
On this day you did an act of gratuitous nastiness to satisfy your own twisted nature . '
Facebook bully : Houghton , 18 , swore and gave death threats against Emily Moore ( file picture )
The court heard that Houghton had told police she wrote the death threats while she was drunk late at night .
But when officers examined internet records they discovered Houghton wrote the comments at 4 pm on July 12 and kept them on her Facebook page for 24 hours .
Megan Gillan : Found dead by her parents after she took an overdose of painkillers
Last month , an inquest heard how a schoolgirl took a fatal overdose of painkillers after bullies waged a hate campaign against her on Bebo .
Megan Gillan , 15 , of Macclesfield , Cheshire , swallowed the tablets to avoid a science exam after classmates posted spiteful messages on the social networking site .
She was found dead in bed by her parents after she failed to come down for breakfast on the day of the exam .
Her death prompted the Archbishop of Westminster , Vincent Nichols , to criticise such sites , saying they encouraged teenagers to build ' transient relationships ' that can leave them traumatised when they collapse .
The archbishop , who was appointed to the post in April , said the sites encouraged young people to put too much emphasis on the number of friends they have rather than on the quality of their relationships .
Emma Jane Cross , from campaign group Beatbullying , said yesterday : ' The sentencing of an 18 - year - old girl for cyber bullying is the first of its kind in the UK and sets an important precedent .
' Cyber bullying is a worrying and fast growing trend which can be more harmful than typical schoolyard bullying .'
Drama on Facebook
Facebook is used by tens of millions of people across the world , but the way some users use the site has led to various dramas .
Last week , a picture surfaced of an alleged Facebook sacking , after an employee ranted about her boss online .
He promptly replied , reminding her she had added him as a ' friend ' before promptly firing her .
Meanwhile term ' Facebook Rage ' is entering our language , often defined as feeling anger when a relationship breaks down and a former partner begins posting updates about their love - life .
It has also been used to describe users , convinced their other half is cheating , who spend hours stalking their partner online in a bid the find further proof to fuel their suspicions , deliberately searching for incriminating evidence .
Facebook was also in the dock a fortnight ago after a judge banned a gang of thugs from posting menacing photographs of themselves online .
In a landmark ruling , nine men pictured making gun gestures on social networking websites will be locked up if such images appear again .
Judge Clement Goldstone QC issued the ban while sentencing members of the Fallowfield Mad Dogs gang for affray .
He was shown pictures of them pulling gun poses and talking about ' preparing for war ' on a networking site .
Teacher Sonya McNally , 35 , from Grimsby , is also currently suspended on full pay since calling her 13 - year - old pupils ‘ bad ’ in a private conversation on the social networking site .
Cystic fibrosis can be deadly A genetic breakthrough raises hope of easing suffering for people with chronic lung disease - and maybe those just fighting a common cold .
The biological reason why the lungs of people with conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis often clog up with thick mucus has been unclear .
But Cincinnati Children 's Hospital researchers have identified the main genetic switch behind the build - up .
The Journal of Clinical Investigation study raises hopes of new treatments .
Lead researcher Dr Jeffrey Whitsett said a way to combat excessive mucus production would potentially be a significant step forward , as there was currently no effective treatment to remove build - up once it had taken place .
WHAT IS MUCUS ?
A sugar - coated collection of large proteins that , in healthy conditions , help the body defend itself by collecting and then clearing out contaminants
It was thought that after airways were attacked by an allergic response or inflammation mucus cells , known as goblet cells , divided and proliferated at a very fast rate - a process known as hyperplasia .
But instead the Cincinnati team discovered that a type of lung cell , called Clara cells , instead morph into goblet cells - a process called metaplasia .
They also showed that the process was reversible - goblet cells can change back to Clara cells if the initial problem is dealt with .
In work on mice , the researchers also identified a gene called SPDEF as key to the process of mucus production .
Allergic reaction
They used a protein from egg whites to induce an allergic reaction in inflammation in the animals ' lungs , and showed that SPDEF activity soared in the affected tissues , leading to hyper - production of mucus .
However , when the gene was switched off inflammation and excessive mucus production did not occur .
And mice lacking SPDEF were unable to increase mucus production or develop goblet cells .
Further analysis showed that SPDEF plays a complex role switching other genes involved in inflammation and mucus production on and off .
The researchers hope it will be possible to develop treatments that influence activity of the gene , but warn tests in humans are still several years away .
Dr Keith Prowse , spokesperson for the British Lung Foundation , said : " Excess mucus production blights the lives of millions of patients with chronic lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
" At present there are only a few treatments available and they are often not very effective .
" The finding that SPDEF which controls mucus production could lead to new and effective treatments which would benefit the millions of people with chronic lung disease in the UK . "
Dr David Halpin is a spokesman for the British Thoracic Society and a consultant respiratory physician at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital .
He said : " Sputum production is a symptom of respiratory disease which is poorly treated by current medicine .
" Any advance in the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this is likely to be a benefit to patients . "

Doctors should think twice before giving young children codeine , and the popular painkiller should never be prescribed after the most common tonsillectomies , Canada 's top pediatric drug expert says .
In a letter published today in the New England Journal of Medicine , Dr. Gideon Koren calls for an end to the routine practice of giving toddlers codeine after tonsillectomies aimed at curing sleep apnea , which he says could kill some children .
Moreover , the founder of the Hospital for Sick Children 's Motherisk program says the drug may have dangerous side effects on many children and doctors should consider alternate analgesics after operations on the very young .
" Even if North America uses codeine ... as a gospel , we may need to rethink our way of treating people , " says Koren , specifically about children 5 years and younger .
With effective alternate pain relievers available , Koren says , codeine medications should be avoided in toddlers , or only be prescribed at the lowest recommended doses for post - operative pain relief .
Several thousand Canadian children undergo tonsillectomies each year , the vast majority to relieve sleep apneas .
The journal warning was based on a study that looked at the death of a 2 - year - old boy who was given codeine after a tonsillectomy .
He died days later of respiratory complications the drug might have caused .
Though it is unusual to tie so sweeping a recommendation to a solitary case , Koren says he had no qualms about issuing the prestigious journal alert .
" It 's the first child we could prove that died ( from potential codeine complications ) ... but other kids die after tonsillectomy and often times the reason is not known . "
Codeine , an opiate , is metabolized by the body into morphine , a potent painkiller and known respiratory suppressor .
But some people are genetically programmed to metabolize it much more rapidly than others , leaving them with higher concentrations of morphine in their systems .
In 2007 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a similar warning for new mothers , saying they would undoubtedly be " ultra - rapid " metabolizers of the drug and risked feeding their babies high levels of morphine through breast milk .

Danger for the Dollar
The dollar will probably go up .
Still , we ’d stay away …
Here is Warren Buffett ’s view :
“ Last fall , our financial system stood on the brink of a collapse that threatened a depression .
The crisis required our government to display wisdom , courage and decisiveness .
Fortunately , the Federal Reserve and key economic officials in both the Bush and Obama administrations responded more than ably to the need .
“ They made mistakes , of course .
How could it have been otherwise when supposedly indestructible pillars of our economic structure were tumbling all around them ?
A meltdown , though , was avoided , with a gusher of federal money playing an essential role in the rescue .
“ The United States economy is now out of the emergency room and appears to be on a slow path to recovery . ”
This is probably the view shared by most economists and most investors .
It is not our view .
From where we sit there is no recovery underway … and there never will be one .
You can recover from a hangover .
You can recover from a nasty divorce .
You can even recover from an earthquake .
But once a depression begins , you can only endure it .
Get on with it .
Get it over .
And then , you can begin rebuilding again .
You will never recover the economy you had before the crisis .
You must find a new economic model .
A headline from yesterday : “ Reluctant shoppers hold back recovery . ”
That ’s one way to put it .
Shoppers do n’t have any money .
They need to cut back .
Most likely , they will cut back until their savings rates reach 10 % of disposable income .
That will take $ 1 trillion out of consumer spending .
The economy cannot possibly recover under those conditions ; it ca n’t return to its same old , consumer - led , credit - fuel self .
Instead , it must go through a period of transition – in which output is depressed – until it finds a new personality , better suited to the new economic circumstances .
But Buffett is not worried about the depression .
He ’s worried about how the recovery is financed :
“ … enormous dosages of monetary medicine continue to be administered and , before long , we will need to deal with their side effects .
For now , most of those effects are invisible and could indeed remain latent for a long time .
Still , their threat may be as ominous as that posed by the financial crisis itself . ”
Buffett does the math .
This year , the US deficit will total $ 1.8 trillion .
Since 1920 , the largest peacetime deficit was 6 % of GDP .
This is 13 % of GDP .
The magnitude of it alone should be cause for alarm .
But there ’s more .
Where does this money come from ?
Even if you could direct 100 % of the net US trade deficit ( about $ 400 billion , the money that ends up in foreigners ’ hands as a result of American spending ) and 100 % of American ’s savings ( estimated to be about $ 500 billion ) , you ’d still be $ 900 billion short .
Desperate borrowers should expect to pay high rates of interest .
A borrower who does n’t need the money can shop for the best rates and hold out for a good deal .
But when a person needs to borrow , he takes what the market gives him .
Yet , one of the most curious things about the financial world circa 2009 is the yield on the 10 - year Treasury note .
It has fallen to under 3.5 % .
Despite record borrowing by the feds , lenders content themselves with the lowest yields in nearly half a century .
Go figure .
The market seems to be anticipating a depression .
Why else would bond yields be so low ?
If the economy sours …and the stock market sinks … the safe yields on Treasury bonds will seem like a good alternative .
But Buffett believes the Treasury yields are not as safe as they appear .
That other $ 900 billion has to come from somewhere .
And the feds ca n’t allow interest rates to rise significantly ; that would undermine all their stimulus efforts .
High real interest rates depress economic activity .
So , what can the feds do ?
“ Washington ’s printing presses will need to work overtime , ” says Buffett prophetically .
Of the two ways of financing the deficit , one is a flimflam ; the other is robbery .
In the great credit expansion consumers borrowed so they could buy things such as automobiles .
Now , the feds borrow and bribe the voters with money to buy automobiles .
No matter who does it , borrowing for consumption is merely taking from the future .
Then , when the future comes … the account has to be settled .
Result : no net gain .
What was consumed in one year is not consumed in the next .
Of course , the feds do n’t spend money the same way consumers did .
Consumers wasted their money on frou - frou and watchamacallits of their own choosing .
The government wastes money on different things – like turtle crossings and billion - dollar bailouts .
Not that we ’re complaining about government spending .
We ’re just pointing out that it ’s not the same as private spending .
What makes goods good is that people choose them and buy them with their own money .
They get what they ’ve got coming .
But the feds are spending other peoples ’ money .
If they get any goods at all it is practically an accident .
But what we ’re talking about this morning is the dollar .
According to Buffett , the dollar is in danger .
He ’s worried about the larceny , not the flim - flam .
Printing up additional dollars robs savers .
Each new dollar created to buy US debt makes each one already in existence – say , in a vault in the Bank of China – worth less than it was before .
If that is n’t true , the whole body of economic thinking from Adam Smith to Irving Fisher is nothing but a fantasy .
And the only way to protect the value of the dollars held by savers , theoretically , is to withdraw the stimulus money before inflation sends prices soaring .
Buffett is an optimistic fellow .
He believes that responsible authorities will turn off their dollar - printing machines in order to protect the greenback .
Here at The Daily Reckoning , we ’re not so sure .
First , the depression is likely to be worse than people think .
This will mask the effects of dollar printing .
Plus , it will make the need for more dollars – more federal spending , more US debt – seem more urgent than ever .
Instead of pulling the plug , they ’ll turn up the speed .
Second , the feds are not really interested in the health of the real economy anyway .
This is an insight , which while it may seem obvious , it only came to us recently .
When the feds put in place absurd policies to delay and restrain the inevitable correction , they are making things worse , generally , for everyone .
But the politicians are responding to their constituents ’ demands .
One campaign donor wants to keep his business alive .
Another wants to keep his job .
Still another promises the feds high paying jobs on Wall Street , after their term in Washington is over .
Millions of others – more than enough to turn an election – want free pills and mortgage subsidies and so forth .
When the feds try to bailout the economy , they are only doing their jobs !
They ’re not going to stop doing their jobs – especially in a depression – just to protect foreign dollar - holders .
Until tomorrow ,
Bill Bonner
The Daily Reckoning
Last week , the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) stated that investigations into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan may result in the prosecution of U.S. policymakers or servicemen .
The potential prosecution of U.S. persons by the court over incidents that the U.S. deems lawful is one of the prime reasons why the Bush Administration did not seek U.S. ratification of the treaty creating the court , rejected ICC claims of authority over U.S. persons , and sought to negotiate agreements with countries to protect U.S. persons from being arrested and turned over to the ICC .
The investigation is not complete , the prosecutor has not determined if he will seek warrants against U.S. officials or servicemen , and Afghanistan is constrained from turning over U.S. persons to the ICC under existing agreements .
However , the potential legal confrontation justifies past U.S. policy , emphasizes the need to maintain and expand legal protections for U.S. persons against ICC claims of jurisdiction , and should lead the Obama Administration to endorse the Bush Administration 's policies toward the ICC .
U.S. Policy toward the ICC
The U.S. initially was an eager participant in the effort to create the ICC in the 1990s .
However , America 's support waned because many of its concerns about the proposed court were ignored or opposed .
Among other concerns , the U.S. concluded that the ICC lacked prudent safeguards against political manipulation , possessed sweeping authority without accountability to the U.N. Security Council , and violated national sovereignty by claiming jurisdiction over the nationals and military personnel of non-party states in some circumstances .
In the end , U.S. efforts to amend the Rome Statute were rejected .
President Bill Clinton urged President George W. Bush not to submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent necessary for ratification .
After additional efforts to address key U.S. concerns failed , President Bush felt it necessary to " un-sign " the Rome Statute and take additional steps to protect U.S. nationals , officials , and service members from the ICC , including passing the American Service - Members ' Protection Act of 2002 , which restricts U.S. interaction with the ICC and its state parties , and seeking Article 98 agreements to preclude nations from surrendering , extraditing , or transferring U.S. persons to the ICC or third countries for that purpose without U.S. consent .
The Afghan Investigation
On September 10 , the Prosecutor for the International Criminal Court , Argentinean Luis Moreno Ocampo , announced that ICC investigators had begun looking into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity , including torture , " massive attacks , " and collateral damage resulting from military action in Afghanistan .
The allegations were made by human - rights groups and the Afghan government .
According to Béatrice Le Fraper du Hellen , a special adviser to Ocampo , the ICC has been " collecting data about allegations made against the various parties to the conflict " since 2007 .
Since Afghanistan acceded to the Rome Statute -- the treaty establishing the ICC -- on February 10 , 2003 , the prosecutor is empowered to receive and investigate crimes alleged to have occurred in Afghanistan after the establishment of the court in July 2002 .
Although the investigation will also look into crimes allegedly committed by the Taliban , Ocampo confirmed that North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops participating in the United Nations mandated International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) mission to bolster the Afghan government could become a target of ICC prosecution .
A decision to prosecute ISAF forces for actions in Afghanistan would almost certainly involve American servicemen which , as of July 23 , 2009 , constituted nearly half of all foreign troops involved in the mission ( 29,950 out of 64,500 ) and represent one of the few countries willing to fully engage in military action to confront Taliban forces .
The ICC investigation is at an early stage .
According to du Hellen , " [ I ] t 's particularly complex .
It 's taking time to gather information on crimes allegedly committed on the government side , on the Taliban side and by foreign forces . "
In the end , the ICC may find no evidence to proceed with a warrant against anyone -- American or otherwise .
Status of Forces Agreement
The ICC can act only if a country is unwilling or unable to pursue the alleged crimes .
However , in a situation like Afghanistan , it is very likely that the ICC would have to assert jurisdiction because the government of Afghanistan has extremely limited legal jurisdiction over U.S. officials and service members .
Specifically , the U.S. and the Afghan government entered into a Status of Forces Agreement ( SOFA ) regarding military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan engaged in " cooperative efforts in response to terrorism , humanitarian and civic assistance , military training and exercises , and other activities . "
Under the SOFA ,
U.S. personnel are immune from criminal prosecution by Afghan authorities , and are immune from civil and administrative jurisdiction except with respect to acts performed outside the course of their duties .
[ The agreement ] explicitly authorized the U.S. government to exercise criminal jurisdiction over U.S. personnel , and the Government of Afghanistan is not permitted to surrender U.S. personnel to the custody of another State , international tribunal [ including the ICC ] , or any other entity without consent of the U.S. government .
Although the SOFA was signed by the interim government , it remains binding on the current government and the Afghan government could not try U.S. officials or service members for acts committed during the " course of their duties , " even if it wanted to .
Thus , the ICC would undoubtedly find the Afghan government unable to pursue the alleged crimes .
Such a finding would raise another issue .
Under the Article 98 agreement with Afghanistan , the government has agreed not to turn over U.S. persons to the ICC or to allow a third party to do so without U.S. permission -- an unlikely development , given that a U.S. official has stated that the United States has no reason to believe that U.S. persons have committed crimes in the conduct of their official duties under ISAF that have not been properly investigated and adjudicated .
These safeguards are not a guarantee of protection from the illegitimate claims of ICC jurisdiction , but U.S. officials and service members are much more protected than they would be without them .
Most likely , an ICC warrant would be executed against a U.S. person in Afghanistan only if that person traveled to an ICC state party that does not have an Article 98 agreement with the U.S.
The current scenario , therefore , only underscores the urgency of negotiating more such agreements .
Reject the Rome Statute
The Obama Administration is reportedly close to announcing a change in U.S. policy toward the ICC , including affirming President Clinton 's 2000 signature on the Rome Statute and increasing U.S. cooperation with the court .
Weakening protections against ICC prosecution of U.S. officials and service members would be a grave mistake , as illustrated by the ongoing investigation in Afghanistan .
The ICC's Afghan investigation is a testament to the wisdom of the Bush Administration .
To protect its officials and servicemen , the U.S. should continue to insist that it is not bound by the Rome Statute and does not recognize the ICC 's authority over U.S. persons , maintain and expand legal protections like Article 98 agreements , and exercise great care when deciding to support the court 's actions .

Andrew Flintoff will become international cricket 's first freelance globe - trotter as soon as he recovers from injury next year , when he plans to play the short - form game for as many as six sides on five different continents , according to his manager , Andrew Chandler .
The news of his intentions will put Flintoff , recovering in Dubai from an operation on his right knee , on course for a showdown with Andy Flower , the England team director .
Flintoff has been offered a new 12 - month , incremental deal by England , but intends to play the entire season in the lucrative Indian Premier League , part of which clashes with England and Wales Cricket Board duties .
On Friday , Flower , when asked about the possibility of resting Flintoff for the tour to Bangladesh in February , said : " We would n't welcome a situation like that .
I do n't think there are going to be huge negotiations over what type of games he plays .
Fred will be available for one - day international and Twenty20 cricket for England .
Simple as that . "
Flower said that any England player chosen for the Bangladesh games would be able to play for only three weeks of the six - week IPL .
According to Chandler , however , Flintoff 's new ECB offer contains no clause preventing him from playing in all IPL fixtures for the Chennai Super Kings , who will pay him a record $ 1.55 m ( £ 935,000 ) .
Any such conditions , Chandler said , would dissuade Flintoff from signing for the ECB .
" I 'm not saying he 's not going to play for England because he probably will do , " Chandler said .
" But he 's definitely going to play for different teams during the year .
The England contract does not state anything about not being able to play IPL or anything like that . "
He expects to discuss the offer with Flintoff today and make a decision tomorrow .
England will need Flintoff judging by their desperate performances against Australia , who won again at Lord 's yesterday and lead the seven - match series 4 - 0 .
Flintoff , who will be on crutches for eight weeks , is aiming to be fit by early in the new year , and will play out his career as a freelance for a number of teams .
He will sign for Lancashire as a one - day player , and will also play four - day games if the county need him .
" And if Freddie needs the practice they 'll play him .
It 'll be for mutual benefit , " said Chandler , who expects Flintoff to play for at least five teams .
" He 'll play for Chennai , he might play for an Australian team , a South African team , maybe one in the West Indies .
They will be Twenty20 competitions .
" If he had n't have been injured he would have probably played in December - January in Australia .
And then at the end of January , early February in South Africa .
I was already negotiating with them .
We were negotiating with South Australia and the Durban team , the Nashua Dolphins .
And there 's been an offer from Northern Transvaal as well . "
The only drawback is that Flintoff might take longer than he had hoped to reach match fitness .
" He 's set himself the target of [ being fit by ] Bangladesh , though the operation has hurt him a lot more than he thought , " said Chandler .
An ECB spokesperson , when asked last night about a possible conflict between Flintoff 's intentions and Flower 's statement , said : " Andy Flower answered those questions yesterday . "
More than 1,300 children have been poisoned by a manganese factory in central China , the state media reported today , amid growing fears about the prevalence of heavy metal pollution nationwide .
The exposure of mass lead contamination in Wenping township , Hunan province , is the second case in as many weeks , prompting accusations that the authorities have failed to adequately regulate toxins that build up over time .
A local government official told the Xinhua news agency that tests of children living near the smelter showed that 60 - 70 % had unhealthy levels of lead in their blood .
With tests continuing , more positive cases are expected .
The authorities closed the factory last week and detained two executives on suspicion of " causing severe environment pollution " .
The plant reportedly opened in May 2008 without the approval of the local environmental protection bureau within 500 m of a primary school , a middle school and a kindergarten .
Although the factory had only been operating for a year , the blood of 1,354 local children was found to have more than 100mg of lead per litre , the limit considered safe .
A gradual build up of lead in the bloodstream can lead to anaemia , muscle weakness and brain damage .
The plant is unlikely to have gone ahead without support from the local government .
Many poor districts ignore environmental regulations to attract investment , and Hunan is notorious for its heavy metal industry .
The Wugang city government said it had demanded an overhaul of more than 100 plants , including seven other smelters .
But the problem is likely to be nationwide because authorities are not obliged to conduct expensive tests for heavy metals , which tend to accumulate over time rather than be emitted in noticeable bursts .
In a separate case in Shaanxi , northern China , last week , 615 children tested positive for lead poisoning attributed to a nearby smelter , which is now due to cease operating this Saturday .

WASHINGTON — Like a run of the mill drug dealer , he hid cash in the freezer .
Like a run of the mill drug dealer , he used cryptic code words in conversations .
In one instance , he used the words “ African Art ” when referring to a cash bribe to an African official .
Like a run of the mill drug dealer , he was paranoid about the FBI , and said so much during a meeting with rich Virginia investor / FBI informant Lori Mody , who just happened to be wearing an FBI wire .
Still , William J. Jefferson , a 9 - term Congressman , was anything but a run of the mill criminal .
He had a law degree from Harvard .
He had an advanced tax degree from Georgetown .
He had a sophisticated wife and well educated daughters .
He was intelligent .
Low key .
He was thoughtful .
And he was more than just another Congressman to many of his constituents .
He was the first African American Congressman to be elected in Louisiana since Reconstruction .
“ Since he ’s been in office , he ’s one of the few black officials who has been able to get in office and do something for the people , ” a 58 - year man old man told me down in New Orleans during Jefferson ’s successful re-election campaign in 2006 .
Jefferson lost two years later .
On Wednesday , Jefferson was convicted of 11 of 16 counts of public corruption .
The case centered on allegations that Jefferson took bribes in exchange for using his Congressional influence to promote businesses in Africa he or his family members had a hidden interest in .
He ’ll be sentenced in October and you can be sure he ’ll get some serious prison time .
At 62 , whatever it is , it ’s likely to amount to a life sentence — or close to one .
Now , instead of being a stand up politician , instead of being someone people could rely on , Jefferson becomes another cliché in this town , a crooked politician , who came with ideals , who left with a criminal record — someone few outside his district knew of — that is until the FBI raided his home on Capitol Hill on Aug. 3 , 2005 , and found $ 90,000 in FBI marked bills that the rich Virginia woman / FBI informant Lori Mody gave him .
Back in 2005 , while I was a reporter at the Washington Post , I wrote about the raid .
And when a source tipped me off about the money in freezer , I was amused and surprised .
But the source said matter of factly , something to the effect : “ Drug dealers hide money in the freezer all the time . ”
Thus , my earlier reference to drug dealers .
Jefferson liked to live on the edge .
He shook down business people for bribes .
He did it before the FBI came along .
He did it while the FBI was watching and listening .
During trial , his attorney Robert Trout , who did a fine job , said Jefferson was a “ rock star ” in Africa .
What Trout did n’t say was that Jefferson used his official office , and his rock star status , to meet with high ranking African officials to promote those businesses he had hidden interest in .
Sadly , it ’s not as if Jefferson did n’t hear the alarms , did n’t get fair warning .
In 2006 , someone with knowledge of the African political landscape , told me that Jefferson had apparently been warned that rumors had been circulating — even before the FBI raided his homes in 2005 — that he was on the take in Africa .
Jefferson apparently gave it little thought .
In the end , at trial , the best Jefferson ’s attorney could say was that , yes , Jefferson may have violated some Congressional ethics , and yes , he may have done some pretty stupid things , but he did not break the law .
Echoes of Dick Nixon : “ I am not crook ” .
No crook ?
Well , the tape FBI conversations sure made him sound like one .
So , while to compare him to a drug may be a little harsh , calling him a crook is pretty accurate .
In the end , shortly after the verdict was announced , I thought :
The bigger crime here would have been for William J. Jefferson to get acquitted and walk free .
The joke would have been on all of us .
vxargs : running arbitrary command with explicit parallelism , visualization and redirection
Overview
vxargs is inspired by xargs and pssh .
It provides the parallel versions of any arbitrary command , including ssh , rsync , scp , wget , curl , and whatever .
One reason to use it is to control a large set of machines in the wide - area network .
For example , I use vxargs on PlanetLab to control hundreds of machines spreading around the globe when I 'm working on DHARMA project .
The main features are :
parallelism : run many jobs at the same time
flexibility : arbitrary command with arbitrary options
visualization : monitor the total / per job progress in a curses - based UI
redirection : stdout and stderr of each individual job are redirected to files respectively for further analysis .
FAQs
Why not use pssh ?
There are a couple of reasons :
(1 ) with pssh , you can only run limited command , e.g. ssh , rsync , and with limited command - line options .
It is not flexible .
With vxargs you can run everything in the way you like it .
( 2 ) vxargs has a curses - based user interface that can dynamically monitor the execution process .
(3 ) vxargs is only 1 python script , which is extremely simple to install .
Why not use xargs ?
xargs could do some of the work .
Check out the ( rarely used ) options of - - max - procs ( - P ) and -- replace ( - i ) .
However , there seems to be no easy way to track of which individual process is running and output from all processes are mixed together .
xargs also can't specify the maximal life time for each process to run .
vxargs addresses these issues .

HOWTO
To install vxargs , simply download the latest vxargs python script , rename it to your favorite name ( e.g. vxargs ) , make sure it has the executable permission ( e.g. chmod +x /home/username/bin/vxargs ) and its dir is in your PATH .
Of course , make sure you have Python 2.2 or above installed .
Read the man page or type vxargs -- help for the detailed usage .
Here I 'll show several examples to explain how it works .
Suppose the iplist . txt file has following content :
$ cat iplist .

check the uptime of every node in iplist .
txt using ssh in parallel .
vxargs - a iplist .
txt -o /tmp / result ssh {} uptime
Note : {} is replaced by the dynamic arguments ( IP addresses ) respectively for each job .
This is equivallent to run
ssh 216.165.109.79 uptime ssh 158.130.6.254 uptime ssh 158.130.6.253 uptime ssh 128.232.103.203 uptime

Gough 's Cave was an attractive site for Ice Age hunters
The Cheddar Gorge in Somerset was one of the first sites inhabited by humans when they returned to Britain towards the end of the last Ice Age .
New radiocarbon dates on bones from Gough 's Cave show people were living there some 14,700 years ago .
The results confirm the site 's great antiquity and suggest human hunters re-colonised Britain at a time of rapid climate warming .
From 24,000 years ago , an ice sheet extended over much of Britain .
Beyond that ice sheet , in southern Britain and much of northern France , the environment resembled a polar desert .
Evidence suggests these inhospitable conditions kept people out of north - west Europe for more than 9,000 years .
But human groups were able to retreat to ice - free areas ( refugia ) in southern France , Iberia and elsewhere .
After the Ice Age peaked , humans bounced back , expanding from southern refugia to re-colonise northern Europe .
Gough 's Cave is situated in the Cheddar Gorge , a deep canyon on the southern edge of Somerset 's Mendip Hills .
Dates re-visited Interest in the site was stimulated by the discovery in 1903 of " Cheddar Man " , the complete skeleton of a male individual dating to about 9,000 years ago ( after calibration this comes to about 10,000 calendar years ) .
In the 1980s , excavations uncovered accumulations of human and animal bones and artefacts that appeared to be much older even than Cheddar Man .
The discoveries caused a sensation when it was realised many human remains bore a pattern of cut marks compatible with cannibalism .
Cheddar Man was part of another wave of people into Britain However , researchers were perplexed by the radiocarbon dating results .
Although the remains seemed to represent a single occupation level in the sediments , the remains appeared to be a thousand years different in age .
" We had these apparently cannibalised human bones and artefacts and animal remains with signs of butchery .
They all looked like they should be part of a consistent population pattern , " said Chris Stringer , head of human origins at London 's Natural History Museum .
" Even some re-fits of bones which seemed to be from the same individual were giving different ages . "
Since those tests were carried out , there have been significant advances in radiocarbon dating technology , particularly to reduce contamination in the samples .
This allows more accurate dating of archaeological materials .
When the bones were sent to be re-tested at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit , the remains fell into a much narrower age range , converging on 14,700 years ago .
The latest results were a much better fit with the archaeological findings .
Members of the Ancient Human Occupation of Britain ( AHOB ) project now think the bones from Gough 's Cave could have accumulated over just two or three human generations .
The possible evidence of cannibalism at Gough 's Cave led to lurid newspaper headlines at the time of the excavations , with some seizing on the fact that a number of the modified bones belonged to children .
A river system in the bed of the English Channel may have acted as a barrier to humans and fauna
" There are large numbers of cut marks on them and they are almost entirely smashed .
And that smashing looks remarkably like the patterns of breakage you get on the animal bones in the cave - which we have assumed to be for bone marrow extraction , " co-author Roger Jacobi told BBC News .
But Dr Jacobi said this was not the only possible interpretation : " Another might be that the people were dying away from the cave , " he posited .
" Other people are then making the human bones small and compact enough to bring them back to the cave where they are deposited .
They cut off the flesh and smashed the long bones to make them more portable . "
The new dates correspond precisely to a period of very rapid climate warming which could have occurred over as little as three years : " [ The occupation ] really is right on the cusp of this warming which we can see in Greenland ice cores , " Professor Stringer told BBC News .
" Europe starts to defrost and the animals move ; the humans are right there with them . "
Horse hunting
They appear to have been hunting horses : " One of the puzzles from the previous radiocarbon dating was that some of the evidence for human occupation seemed to be divorced from the evidence for horse butchery , " said Chris Stringer .
" Now they are right there together , so these people were probably following herds of horses across Doggerland ( an ancient landmass once linking Britain to the rest of Europe ) because of a large river system in the bed of the English Channel which was blocking the way from France . "
Professor Stringer believes humans expanding out of southern France may have circumvented this river system by taking a detour into Belgium or the Netherlands , moving into eastern Britain across land that is now submerged under the North Sea .
However , after the warm period which attracted people back to Britain for the first time in nearly 10,000 years , the climate and environment changed again .
Birch forests expanded , which created a less attractive habitat for horses .
In turn , the signal of human presence largely disappears from caves and becomes weaker and more scattered across the landscape .
Then north - west Europe plunged into the " short , sharp shock " of the Younger Dryas , a cold climate period which seems to extinguish the signal of human occupation altogether .
Cheddar Man , who lived in the cave 10,000 years ago , appears to belong to an entirely new population which arrived from the continent after conditions once again improved , said Professor Stringer .

Creeping camera capsule
Designed to creep along inside a patient 's digestive tract using springy " legs " , the robot carries a camera and could provide an alternative to traditional endoscopy .
The robot could be used to examine the inside of the gullet , stomach and duodenum for damage or ulcers , and was developed in the CRIM Lab at the Scuola Superiore Sant ' Anna , Pisa , Italy .
( Image : Royal College of Surgeons / Scuola Superiore Sant' Anna )
Swimming camera capsule
Driven by tiny propellors , this camera capsule is also designed to explore the human digestive system .
After being taken by mouth , it would " swim " to inspect the area of interest .

Distant diagnosis
A doctor consults with a nurse , via the RP - 7 remote presence robot .
As well as having a camera and screen that let the patient and a distant doctor see one another , the robot connects to stethoscopes , otoscopes and ultrasound scanners .
This allows the remote physician as close to a real experience as possible .

Muscle machine
RI - MAN is a prototype hospital porter developed at the RIKEN Bio-Mimetic Control Research Center in Nagoya , Japan .
As well as a soft , safe exterior , RI - MAN has touch sensors on its arms and torso to allow it to carefully lift and carry people .
In the long term , it is intended to take over the tasks human carers do for the elderly or infirm .

Robot cameraman
FreeHand allows surgeons to control , using movements of their head and feet , the laparoscopic camera used during minimally invasive surgery ( " keyhole surgery " ) .
This means they can reserve their hands for actually performing the procedure .

Prostate robot
Probot is designed to let surgeons accurately resection enlarged prostates , with minimal effort .
The surgeon specifies the volume to be excised , and the robot automatically cuts it out without further intervention .

A robot you can swallow
The ARES robots – for Assembling Reconfigurable Endoluminal Surgical System – can be swallowed or inserted through natural orifices in pieces .
They then assemble themselves inside the body .
The intention is to allow surgery with few , or no , external incisions .
A patient will swallow up to 15 different robotic modules that can travel to the affected site inside the body .
Once there , the component robots reassemble into a larger device capable of carrying out surgical procedures .

Robotic colonoscope
The Endotics robotic colonoscope uses a series of grippers and extenders to pull itself along the bowel , rather than being pushed by a doctor like a conventional colonoscope .
This exerts less pressure onto the bowel wall , reducing the patient ’s discomfort .
The robot 's motion was inspired by the " inchworm " caterpillar of the geometer moth .

GUANGZHOU , China–
The scene stunned the local , law - abiding Chinese :
They 'd never seen anything like it .
At a busy intersection in the heart of this southern city recently , angry Africans carried a bleeding black man , held aloft , across eight lanes of heavy traffic to deposit him smack at a police station 's door .
Almost immediately hundreds of other Africans converged on the station – shouting for the police to come out and take responsibility .
The wounded man 's name was Emmanuel Okoro of Nigeria .
Trapped in a police raid on illegal immigrants that afternoon , Okoro chose to leap from the second floor of a shopping mall rather than be arrested .
He landed on his head .
Now , as he lay unconscious on the station 's doorstep , angry protestors fanned out into the street – blocking traffic , ripping up plants , waving tree limbs and denouncing the police .
It took six hours to restore order .
No serious injuries were reported .
But it left many asking the same question :
Is this the end of China 's African dream ?
For a decade now , thousands of African traders have descended upon Guangzhou – the hub of a region called " the workshop of the world " – to buy goods cheaply and re-sell them back home for a profit .
Today more than 20,000 Africans reside in this 10 square kilometre stretch that local Chinese cab drivers call " Chocolate City . "
As many cities around the world have " Chinatowns , " so Africans have come to think of this area as a kind of burgeoning " Africatown . "
The sounds of Afrobeat music permeate the air , business gets done in English or Igbo ( a Nigerian language ) and colourful west African dress abounds .
But the Chinese are not an immigrant nation .
Fully 92 per cent belong to one ethnic group alone : the Han .
They dominate political and cultural life and remain relatively cool to foreign ways .
Regardless – 29 - year - old Nigerian Kizito Ezeribe sees himself as a nascent stakeholder .
" For me , coming here was my African dream , " he says , seated inside his shop in the Tanqi Garment centre , busily wrapping bundles of blue jeans to ship back home .
His business card is emblazoned with his motto : " In God I Trust . "
" My brother came here first to seize the opportunity .
So I came , too .
Everything is so much cheaper here , " he said one recent afternoon .
He and other African buyers tour local factories regularly , he says , looking to buy " seconds " with minor imperfections .
A pair of blue jeans can be had for as little as 15 Chinese yuan , the equivalent of $ 2.45 , he says .
These he can sell right here at his stall for 28 yuan , or about $ 4.60 .
But back home they can fetch as much as 45 yuan or $ 7.35 , maybe even more .
Ojukwu Emma , president of the Association of the Nigerian Community in China , who has lived and worked here for more than 10 years , says China is a huge magnet for African traders , and it pulls in more every day .
" China rules the world , " he says .
" Much of what African consumers want is made here .
It 's good quality and you can get it at a good price – clothing , electronics , auto parts – anything .
" For us , it used to be all about the United Kingdom , Europe or the U.S.A. , " he explains .
" Today it 's all about China . "
But Emma also worries about the impact of the unprecedented July 15 riot , he says .
He already senses a backlash .
He does n't blame the Chinese for that .
He says his people – Nigerians – need to take responsibility : they need to understand and respect Chinese law .
" China is a communist country , " he says .
" They 're not like us , a democratic country .
They have their own laws and regulations that we have to respect .
" You can't blame the Chinese law for people carrying fake passports , " he stresses .
" We have big problems ... and it's making ( Chinese ) people change their minds .
" At first , they welcomed us . "
He worries that Nigerians , in particular , have worn out their welcome .
" We have to rebuild our image , " he says .
" You know , people at this end of the neighbourhood , " he says , referring to the eastern part of the African sector , " they 're people from Mali and Guinea and Congo – they 're not facing the problems we 're facing .
" In Tanqi ( where the disturbance took place ) , it 's all Nigerian .
" It 's time we put our own house in order , " says Emma .
" Shutting down traffic was wrong .
I do n't support that kind of activity . "

But not everyone agrees .
Ishmail , a trader from Nigeria 's economic capital of Lagos who owns two shops in that city , says the situation on the ground in Guangzhou is more complicated .
" African people are suffering here , " he says .
" You ca n't help but overstay your visa . "
He says African traders can't get business done in 30 days ' time and sustain the constant costs of international flights back and forth .
" Plus the pressure and the tension associated with these raids is insufferable , " he adds .
" People are being detained for three , four , six months at a time before they can pay their 5,000 yuan fines ( about $ 800 ) .
Then if they 're released they face the cost of a $ 2,000 ( U.S. ) air ticket home .
No one can afford that . "
But is n't China just doing what any country would to ensure visitors ' visas are in compliance with the law , he 's asked ?
" In Nigeria we are free , " Ishmail implores .
" We have two Chinatowns in Lagos .
The government set aside land for them .
No one in Nigeria asks Chinese people to show their visas .
Here they can stop you on the street for no reason .
And there are more Chinese in Africa than there are Africans in China , " he says .
" Plus , they are welcomed in Nigeria . "
But some Chinese businesses welcome Africans and their business , too .
Deng Huarong , who runs an electronics shop in Tongxin Rd. , says he does constant business with African traders and enjoys the interaction .
" The poorer ones bargain very hard , " he says .
" And if anything goes wrong with their order – a day 's delay for example – they can be very short - tempered .
But they 're direct , straightforward and friendly .
" If I had to choose whether to do business with a Middle Eastern businessman or one from Africa – I 'd choose the African , " he says bluntly .
" The Middle Eastern people are just too shrewd . "
But there are signs that official pressure on the Africans is continuing to mount .
Chinese police have vowed publicly to intensify their campaign to flush illegal Africans out of Guangzhou .
And last Sunday police vans with flashing lights were even parked outside of the Star Hotel in central Guangzhou , where a weekly Christian service for foreigners attracts African worshippers .
As the service ended and congregants poured out into the street , Malcom , an African engineering student , took offence at the police presence .
" Why are these people harassing us ? " he said .
" They 've never come here before .
Why are they coming now ? "
An older African man holding the hand of a young African child was about to exit the hotel , but spied the police and quickly turned back into the hotel lobby .
Barry Sautman , a professor at Hong Kong 's University of Science and Technology , who has done research on the African community in Guangzhou , says the recent clampdown appears more intense – and might be the result of data suggesting greater numbers of visas are not up to date .
But whatever the reason , the clampdown is raising tensions .
" So far it has only resulted in deteriorating relationships between the African community and the authorities , " said Sautman .
Ojukwu Emma of the Nigerian Community in China says he and the Nigerian embassy are working on an agreement with local authorities to provide exit visas for Nigerians whose visas have expired and who wish to return home .
If formalized , it would allow Nigerians to leave China within 10 days , without threat of detention .

Moral debates need to return to public square , says Archbishop
Dr Morgan laid the blame for the current economic crisis with market driven policies , and a tendency towards attaching a monetary value to everything , including human life .
This , he added , had deeply damaged the public 's sense of community and trust in public bodies .
He also warned of a “ groundswell ” of public concern about “ excessive self - interest ” .
“ Despite the undoubted pain it has brought in its wake , the global recession may have helped bring us to a tipping point .
Market - driven politics have been discredited , " he said .
Dr Morgan was speaking at the start of a two - day meeting of the Church in Wales ' Governing Body in Lampeter on Wednesday .
He said that the church needed to speak up even in difficult moral debates because all aspects of life were relevant to God .
“ Since the 1960s , moral and ethical debates and passion for great causes have been increasingly frozen out of politics , which has helped to create the divided society we have today .
To some extent the church has been complicit in this .
“ The growth of ethnic and religious diversity , political correctness , the rise of atheism , our absorption in our own internal politics as well as the prevailing political atmosphere have all conspired to still our voices .
“ Now we need to start lifting them again , raising the consciousness of our congregations and communities , challenging perceptions , looking at the bigger picture and helping to put the difficult moral debates firmly back on the political agenda . ”
Dr Morgan insisted that it was a basic human right for Christians to be involved in public debate and refuted the claims of some that publicly expressing a Christian viewpoint offends people of other faiths .
“ To argue as some do , that we should not even engage in public debate is to diminish our human rights .
What we have to remember as well is that people of other faiths have no problems with Christians taking the lead in these matters .
It is nervous public officials or aggressive secularists who have their problems , ” he said .
The Archbishop also praised the Church in Wales ’ Education Review , launched today , which claimed that pupils in schools with a Christian ethos are outperforming their peers in secular schools .
He emphasised the importance of a spiritual dimension in all schools and expressed his concerns about the Welsh Assembly Government ’s decision earlier this year to allow sixth - formers to opt out of school assemblies .
He said , “ The law that requires a daily act of worship in schools is not a mandate to compel pupils to recite the Lord ’s Prayer and be so inspired that they turn up at church the next Sunday .
It is an invitation to experience what faith and commitment might mean .
“ How vital it is , therefore , to feed the minds and hearts of the 17 and 18 year olds who stand on the cusp of adult life and all the responsibilities it carries .
“ We must help them encounter a world that is not a bland secular wasteland , but a place of rich spiritual diversity where faith plays a fundamental role in moulding and shaping our live . ”

Thousands of music videos pulled from YouTube in a royalties dispute will go back online after peace broke out today between the website and the music industry .
A new licensing deal with PRS for Music , the trade body that collects music royalties , has brought the six - month dispute to an end .
It began when YouTube accused the PRS of proposing exorbitant new payment terms and led to the website fending off criticism from the PRS , which felt it was punishing British music fans by removing videos in the quest for greater profits .
Thousands of music videos are now being reinstated after being blocked from the site by YouTube 's parent company Google during the licensing wrangle .
But while this conflict has been resolved , another dispute has erupted over the digital future of the music industry .
A rift has opened between music 's creators and its record labels , with a broad alliance of musicians , songwriters and producers fiercely criticising the business secretary Lord Mandelson 's plans to cut off the broadband connections of internet users who illegally download music .
In a statement seen by the Guardian , a coalition of bodies representing a range of stars including Sir Paul McCartney , Sir Elton John and Damon Albarn attacks the proposals as expensive , illogical and " extraordinarily negative " .
The Featured Artists Coalition ( FAC ) , the British Academy of Songwriters , Composers and Authors ( Basca ) and the Music Producers Guild ( MPG ) have joined forces to oppose the proposals to reintroduce the threat of disconnection for persistent file sharers , which was ruled out in the government 's Digital Britain report in June .
The plans have already been attacked by privacy campaigners , internet service providers and a range of MPs , some of whom accuse the business secretary of being influenced by secret meetings with senior figures from the music and film industry , a charge he denies .
The coalition accuses the government of being backward looking , saying there is " little support from logic " in proposals to cut off file sharers – a move welcomed by the record companies and UK Music , the umbrella body for the entire industry .
The statement says : " We vehemently oppose the proposals being made and suggest that the stick is now in danger of being way out of proportion to the carrot .
The failure of 30,000 US lawsuits against consumers and the cessation of the pursuit of that policy should be demonstration enough that this is not a policy that any future - minded UK government should pursue . "
There has been an explosion in file sharing in the last decade , with albums being swapped hundreds of thousands of times over the internet – Lady Gaga 's The Fame was swapped 388,000 times on P2P site Pirate Bay within seven days of its release .
But there is little agreement in the music industry about how the problem should be tackled .
The BPI , the body representing record labels , argues that the UK's 7 million file sharers cost the industry an estimated £ 200 m a year and called Mandelson 's proposals " a step forward " .
But Patrick Racklow , the chief executive of Basca , said those involved in music had to look for new ways of licensing new music technologies , rather than fighting them .
" The problems the music industry faces will not be dealt with effectively through legislation , " he said .
" We can't support these proposals because we do n't think it will work , it will cost too much and is far too blunt a tool . "
Research suggesting that people who file share also buy more music provided hope , he said .
" The music industry is quite a scary place to be at the moment and we do n't know what it will look like in 10 years ' time , but if we find ways of licensing , new ways of doing things will evolve .
What we can't do is try to push things forward by looking back . "
Deals such as the one struck between YouTube and PRS , as well as licensing agreements with music - streaming websites such as Spotify and We7 , may provide light at the end of the tunnel for the industry , proving that compromises can be made if consumer demands are considered .
Patrick Walker , YouTube 's director of video partnerships , said the dispute had been regrettable , but that the service was committed to building relationships with the music industry .
" This deal provides a positive example that people can come together with the objective of satisfying user demands , " he said .
" It is a very fast - moving area and we need to make sure we do n't retrench but remain flexible so that everyone can benefit . "
Andrew Shaw , the managing director of broadcast and online at PRS , said the organisation was delighted that music videos were back on YouTube .
" We hope it is the first of many deals with other services so that music can get out there in whatever way people want to listen to it , while making sure our members get paid , " he said .
Both organisations were vague about the agreement , but music industry analyst Mark Mulligan , vice - president of Forrester Research , said the disclosure that a lump - sum deal had been reached suggested the terms were more favourable to YouTube than PRS .
The YouTube deal and the musicians ' condemnation of plans to prosecute file sharers were indicative of the fundamental power shift happening in the music industry , he said .
" We are in a period of transition , and traditional business models are being reassessed , " he said .
" The position of the record labels is inherently weaker because of the falling value of recorded music and that gives the other people in the equation , including artists , managers and producers , more power .
What we are seeing here is those players flexing their muscles , which is only possible because the record labels are weakening . "
Sound and fury : industry 's uphill struggle
In 1999 the music business was booming , CDs were flying off the shelves and , even if the Backstreet Boys were at the top of the charts , the music industry felt like a good place to be .
Few people were aware that at the Northeastern University in Boston student Shawn Fanning was creating an online music file sharing service that would transform the music landscape forever .
Napster – as the service was called – allowed people to easily share their MP3 files , cutting out the record labels and paying little heed to copyright .
For a music industry which had long complained that home taping was killing music , this was devastation of a different order .
Napster was soon followed by similar websites KaZaA and Gnutella and , as the potential of filesharing to undermine the record sales became clear , the music industry 's reaction was quick and brutal .
In 2001 Napster was shut down by a US court order , but it had paved the way for other peer - to - peer file - sharing programmes , which continue to plague record labels today .
A year later Apple 's iPod was launched , instantly allowing music fans to carry hundreds of albums with them in digital form .
It was followed in 2003 by the launch of the iTunes store , providing a legal online store for people to buy digital music .
It was arguably too late .
Profits were plummeting , and by 2007 British album sales had dropped 10.4 % on the previous year .
In 2004 global revenue from CD and DVD sales was around $ 32bn ( £ 20bn ) , by 2008 that had dropped to $ 22bn and by 2012 it is expected to drop to about $ 11bn .
New ways of getting music online began to appear .
MySpace debuted in 2004 , providing a new platform for bands to interact directly with fans , allowing them to post music that could be listened to instantly .
In the same year , digital single sales surpassed physical single sales for the first time .
In 2008 Spotify , a legal ad - funded online streaming service , was launched allowing music fans to listen to hundreds of thousands of tracks and albums instantly , and for free .
Video games like Guitar Hero , released in 2005 , began boosting music sales for some artists .
As CD sales continue to fall today artists are making more money than ever from concerts – figures from PRS for Music revealed that UK music tour revenues increased by 30 % last year .
As a result , record labels are increasingly trying to sign artists on " 360 º contracts " that take a cut of merchandising , live music , and sponsorship deals .
The industry continues to look for new ways to make money in the digital age .
In June the cable company Virgin Media announced the launch of an unlimited download service in partnership with the world 's largest music company , Universal , which would allow subscribers to stream and download as many tracks as they want for £ 10 - £ 15 a month .
IT ’S COME TO THIS … .
In 1988 , then - President Reagan spoke to students nationwide via C - SPAN telecast .
Among other things , he talked about his positions on political issues of the day .
Three years later , then - President Bush addressed school kids in a speech broadcast live to school classrooms nationwide .
Among other things , he promoted his own administration ’s education policies .
President Obama wants to deliver a message to students next week emphasizing hard work , encouraging young people to do their best in school .
The temper tantrum the right is throwing in response only helps reinforce how far gone 21st - century conservatives really are .
This is no small , isolated fit , thrown by random nutjobs .
The New York Times , Washington Post , LA Times , AP , and others all ran stories this morning about the coordinated national effort to either keep children at home so they can’t hear their president ’s pro-education message , or demanding that local schools block the message altogether .
A Republican state lawmaker in Oklahoma said , “ As far as I am concerned , this is not civics education — it gives the appearance of creating a cult of personality .
This is something you ’d expect to see in North Korea or in Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq . ”
Fox News personalities have adopted the same line , calling a stay - in - school message from the president “ cultist ” and reminiscent of “ North Korea and the former Soviet Union . ”
I can appreciate there ’s a question of whether the Department of Education erred in the wording of one sentence in the supplementary materials .
It ’s reasonable to think officials should have been more cautious .
But that ’s not what this is about .
The administration not only edited the supplementary materials , but has offered to make the text of the address available in advance , just so everyone can see how innocuous it is .
It ’s made no difference .
Conservatives do n’t want school kids to hear a message from their president .
Those who claim superiority on American patriotism have decided to throw yet another tantrum over the idea that the president of the United States might encourage young people to do well in schools .
This is what American politics has come to in 2009 .
Michelle Cottle had a good item on this , calling conservatives ’ behavior “ disgraceful . ”
… Obama is the leader of this entire nation .
It does n’t matter if you voted for him — or even if your head threatens to explode every time you think about him .
He is the president , and , as such , it ’s a big deal that he ’s speaking directly to students about the importance of education .
( Not teachers unions , you hysterics . )
And , whatever one ’s party registration , the idea that any child should be kept home from class purely so their parents can make a political statement about an apolitical speech is appalling .
Is the idea that we should shelter children from any contact with or knowledge of any president we personally dislike ?
Maybe , during the years our preferred party is out of power , we should just pretend that the president does n’t exist .
That ’s a healthy way to run a democracy .
Admittedly , Obama is smooth .
But he ai n’t smooth enough to wipe away an entire childhood of conservative teachings with one quickie speech about ( all together now ! ) working hard in school .
Buck up , all you deep - red wingers :
Make the kids watch Glenn Beck afterward if it eases your anxiety .
Have them genuflect before a poster of Rush Limbaugh or Ann Coulter .
But do n’t be so paranoid about what might happen if they ’re briefly exposed to the sinister charms of a liberal president that you drag them down into your foxhole of craziness .
Even Joe Scarborough asked , “ Where are all the GOP leaders speaking out against this kind of hysteria ? ”
They are , alas , nowhere to be found .
As John Cole explained , “ The entire party has been taken over by crazy people . ”
C# , The Ternary Operator , and Mono
2009-08-18
The Quiz
One of my coworkers recently sent out this C# programming quiz :
static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { object x = null ; object y = ( short ) 4 ; x = ( y is System .
Int32 ) ?
( System .
Int32 ) y : ( System . Int16)y ; Console.WriteLine(x.GetType( ) ) ; }
What is printed out ?
Try it .
Explain why you were wrong .
If you run the code , you get this output :
System.Int32
The code snippet as it stands does n’t make it clear exactly where the unexpected behavior is .
This is a little more clear :
static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { object x = null ; object y = ( short ) 4 ; x = false ?
( System . Int32 ) y : ( System . Int16)y ; Console.WriteLine(x.GetType( ) ) ; }
This code outputs the same thing as the above snippet .
So why does this snippet output System .
Int32 , when x clearly gets set to ( System . Int16 ) 4 ?
The answer is in the C# implementation of the ternary operator .
The Answer
In line 5 of the second example above , x is set to the result of the expression on the right side of the equals sign .
Since the thing on the right is an expression , it must have a single type .
The C# Language Specification , in section 14.13 , spells out how the type of the expression is determined :
The second and third operands of the ? : operator control the type of the conditional expression .
Let X and Y be the types of the second and third operands .
Then ,
If X and Y are the same type , then this is the type of the conditional expression .
Otherwise , if an implicit conversion exists from X to Y , but not from Y to X , then Y is the type of the conditional expression .
Otherwise , if an implicit conversion exists from Y to X , but not from X to Y , then X is the type of the conditional expression .
Otherwise , no expression type can be determined , and a compile - time error occurs .
In our example , since there ’s an implicit cast from an Int16 to an Int32 , but not an implicit cast from an Int32 to an Int16 , the compiler says the type of the expression must be Int32 .
Then , when our Int16 is returned , it ’s typecast to an Int32 .
More Types
The spec makes it pretty clear what is supposed to happen if there ’s an implicit conversion from one of the operands to the other , but not the other way around .
But what happens if there ’s an implicit conversion in both directions ?
According to the spec , none of the first three conditions are met , so the compiler must output an error .
There is an implicit conversion from a byte to int , and also one from const int to byte , as long as the int is small enough to fit into the byte .
So , let ’s try compiling this :
static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { const int i = 1 ; const byte b = 2 ; object x = null ; x = true ?
i : b ; Console.WriteLine(x.GetType( ) ) ; }
The Bug
If you compile this with the .NET 3.5 compiler , it compiles without errors .
There ’s a warning about hardcoding true into the ternary operator , but nothing about the types .
So , the compiler does not conform to the C# language spec .
That ’s a bug , but it ’s not that shocking .
There are other places where the .NET compiler does n’t conform to the spec .
It seems that Microsoft has a policy to leave such bugs in , so as to not break compatibility with existing code , so it will probably stay that way for the foreseeable future .
Mono
This got me wondering if the Mono compiler properly supports the spec .
So , I tried compiling with the Mono 2.0 C# compiler .
Here ’s what you get :
Program.cs( 13,17 ) : error CS0172 : Can not compute type of conditional expression as `int ' and `byte ' convert implicitly to each other Compilation failed : 1 error(s ) , 0 warnings
So it looks like Mono conforms to the spec in this case .
It ’s a bit amusing that an open source project supports the spec better than Microsoft itself , but there are probably also cases where it goes the other way .
However , this means that the Mono implementation is incompatible with the .NET implementation of C#. Now , this particular incompatibility is unlikely to come up that often , since there are n’t many types that have two - way implicit conversions with each other , but it ’s something to consider .
The Law
The legal implications of this bug are perhaps the most interesting part .
A few weeks ago , there was a lot of talk about the Mono patent situation .
This has now been largely resolved with Microsoft putting C# and the CLR under its Community Promise .
However , the Community Promise only applies to a given implementation “ to the extent it conforms to one of the Covered Specifications . ”
If an implementation does not conform to the specification , it is not covered by the promise .
You can probably see where I ’m going with this .
If Mono decided to support compatibility with the .NET compiler by breaking from the spec and implementing the ternary type bug the same way Microsoft has , it might be giving up its protection against patent lawsuits .
In order to be legally safer , it ’s probably wiser for Mono to stick to the spec and break compatibility with the .NET compiler .
This is significant , because the more situations like this crop up , the harder it will be for programmers to port their .NET code to Mono .
There ’s not much that the mono project can do about this , but it ’s unfortunate that the legal situation forces their hand on compatibility .
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Marine scientists from California are venturing this week to the middle of the North Pacific for a study of plastic debris accumulating across hundreds of miles ( km ) of open sea dubbed the “ Great Pacific Garbage Patch . ”
Slideshow ( 2 images )
A research vessel carrying a team of about 30 researchers , technicians and crew members embarked on Sunday on a three - week voyage from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography , based at the University of California at San Diego .
The expedition will study how much debris -- mostly tiny plastic fragments -- is collecting in an expanse of sea known as the North Pacific Ocean Gyre , how that material is distributed and how it affects marine life .
The debris ends up concentrated by circular , clockwise ocean currents within an oblong - shaped “ convergence zone ” hundreds of miles ( km ) across from end to end near the Hawaiian Islands , about midway between Japan and the West Coast of the United States .
The focus of the study will be on plankton , other microorganisms , small fish and birds .
“ The concern is what kind of impact those plastic bits are having on the small critters on the low end of the ocean food chain , ” Bob Knox , deputy director of research at Scripps , said on Monday after the ship had spent its first full day at sea .
The 170 - foot vessel New Horizon is equipped with a laboratory for on - board research , but scientists also will bring back samples for further study .
Little is known about the exact size and scope of the vast debris field discovered some years ago by fishermen and others in the North Pacific that is widely referred to as the “ Great Pacific Garbage Patch . ”
Large items readily visible from the deck of a boat are few and far between .
Most of the debris consists of small plastic particles suspended at or just below the water surface , making it impossible to detect by aircraft or satellite images .
The debris zone shifts by as much as a thousand miles north and south on a seasonal basis , and drifts even farther south during periods of warmer - than - normal ocean temperatures known as El Nino , according to information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
Besides the potential harm to sea life caused by ingesting bits of plastic , the expedition team will look at whether the particles could carry other pollutants , such as pesticides , far out to sea , and whether tiny organisms attached to the debris could be transported to distant regions and thus become invasive species .
I was just on the phone talking with a reporter for a national media outlet who referred to Senator Olympia Snowe ’s idea for a public option “ trigger ” as the “ centrist position . ”
Whoa .
When the mainstream media start naming something as “ centrist ” the game is almost over because just about everyone with any authority in our nation ’s capital wants to be at the “ center . ”
Let me back up a step .
The public insurance option has become a lightening rod for Republicans , hate radio jocks , Fox News , the Wall Street Journal ’s editorial page , and lobbyists for the health - industrial complex who accuse the White House and Democrats of planning a “ government takeover ” of health care .
Anything that has the word “ public ” in it is always an automatic target for their rants .
But most Democrats understand that a public insurance option is essential to control healthcare costs and expand coverage — both because private for - profit insurers now face so little competition in most markets that only the prod of a public option will force them to lower costs and extend coverage , and also because a nationwide public option would have the scale and authority to negotiate lower rates with drug companies and healthcare providers , thereby pushing private insurers to do the same .
The White House is looking for a way to be in favor of a public option but also get enough Blue Dog Democrats — many of whom hail from swing districts and states , and therefore need some cover — to vote for it .
One such cover is a Republican Senator from Maine , named Olympia Snowe .
If she votes for the bill , Blue Dogs can calm their constituents — who have been worked up into a lather by the right — by saying “ you see ?
Even a prominent Republican senator is voting for this . ”
So will Snowe play ball ?
It depends .
Her idea ( evidently encouraged by Rahm Emanuel , the President ’s chief of staff ) is to hold off on any public option .
Give the private insurance companies a period of time — say , five years — within which to make changes that extend coverage to more people and also drive down long - term costs .
If those goals for coverage and cost are n’t met by end of the five - year grace period , kaboom : the public option is triggered — which will force such changes on the insurance companies .
The beauty of Snowe ’s proposal is that it seems to offer Blue Dogs a way out and liberal Democrats a way in .
Nobody has to vote for or against a public option .
The public option just happens automatically if its purposes — wider coverage and lower costs — are n’t achieved .
And the trigger idea seems so , well , centrist .
The problem is twofold .
First , it ’s impossible to design airtight goals for coverage and cost reductions that wo n’t be picked over by five thousand lobbyists and as many lawyers and litigators even if , at the end of the grace period , it ’s apparent to everyone else that the goals are n’t met .
Washington is a vast cesspool of well - paid specialists who know how to stop anything resembling a “ trigger . ”
Believe me , they will .
Second , any controversial proposal with some powerful support behind it that gets delayed — for five years or three years or whenever — is politically dead .
Supporters lose interest .
Public attention wanders .
The media are on to other issues .
Right now the public option is very much alive because so many Democrats care deeply about it , with good reason .
But put it off for years , and assign it to the lawyers and lobbyists I just mentioned , and you can kiss it goodbye for ever .
If the idea is to have a public option waiting in the wings in case private insurers blow it , why wait for it at all ?
If it gets lower costs and wider coverage , it should be included right from the start .
What worries me is n’t just that the mainstream media are calling Snowe ’s trigger “ centrist , ” but that the White House might see it as an easy out .
“ I continue to believe that a public option within that basket of insurance choices would help improve quality and bring down costs , ” the President said Monday .
Fine .
But he has n’t yet said the public option is essential .
He has n’t threatened to veto a bill lacking it .
There ’s even reason to believe the White House has quietly encouraged Olympia Snowe to pursue her “ trigger . ”
The best way to give Blue Dogs cover is for the President to explain clearly and boldly why the public option is essential to health care reform , and why he ’s ready to veto any bill that does n’t include it .
That ’s also the only way to give the nation a good chance of getting true health care reform .
Hopefully , that ’s what he ’ll do Wednesday evening .
Otherwise , we get a trigger to nowhere .
Amazing Little Moments Sculpted by Thomas Doyle
New York sculptor Thomas Doyle works in miniature , creating detailed scenes capturing specific moments in his tiny people ’s lives .
Some of these moments are rather mundane , while others are epically dramatic .
What all these sculptures share however , is best put in Doyle ’s words :
The pieces ’ radically reduced scales evoke feelings of omnipotence — as well as the visceral sensation of unbidden memory recall .
Hovering above the glass , the viewer approaches these worlds as an all - seeing eye , looking down upon landscapes that dwarf and threaten the figures within .
Conversely , the private intensity of moments rendered in such a small scale draws the viewer in , allowing for the intimacy one might feel peering into a museum display case or dollhouse .
Though surrounded by chaos , hazard , and longing , the figures ’ faces betray little emotion , inviting viewers to lose themselves in these crucibles — and in the jumble of feelings and memories they elicit .

Ever wonder who actually wrote most of the Obama campaign ads that were filling the airwaves this time last year ?
It was a thirtysomething Deadhead named John Del Cecato , who managed to mesh gears with his favorite band while also helping get his candidate elected .
He was then named one of Politics Magazine ’s “ Rising Stars ” .
Del Cecato had worked with David Axelrod at the consulting firm AKPD Message and Media since way back in 2001 .
When Axelrod left the firm to set up shop next to the Oval Office as White House Senior Advisor , it left Del Cecato and a few partners running one of the hottest political shops in the country .
We recently chatted with John about music and politics ( and everything in between ) .
Tell us about your role in the Obama campaign .
I served as media advisor on the Obama campaign .
Primarily , it was my job to write and produce TV commercials , but I also helped with message development and press strategy .
David Axelrod ( my business partner until January , when he left to work at the White House ) was the campaign ’s chief strategist , and David Plouffe ( who still works with us at AKPD ) was the campaign manager — so I got a bird ’s - eye view of the campaign from start to finish .
In your view , how did the youth vote and the influence musicians have on the youth vote play into the election ?
Do you think work that various organizations and musicians put in – both partisan and nonpartisan – had an impact ?
For as long as I can remember , the conventional wisdom states that young people were among the least reliable political participants – from organizing , to fundraising , to voting .
President Obama and his campaign team simply refused to accept that , and it paid off .
The percent of Iowa caucusgoers under 30 grew from 17 % in 2004 to 22 % in 2008 .
That ’s a 30 % increase in their share of the electorate – a real game changer .
Music can clearly be a motivating tool – and we spent many hours in the studio working to find the right tracks for our spots .
We listened to a hundred songs before we finally got the right feel for our first youth - oriented ad .
We wanted it to feel fresh , energetic , and motivating , without being so edgy as to risk turning off older voters .
( The track was composed by a brilliant New York musician named Dan Zweben . )
One rule of thumb for effective grassroots communication is “ meeting voters where they are . ”
That ’s why groups like HeadCount have been so successful in making politics relevant to many folks who had n’t participated in the process before .
Same goes for Will .
I.Am and the powerful “ Yes We Can ” video , which was made without the campaign ’s knowledge and proved to be incredibly viral .
You must have some amazing stories from the campaign .
What is your favorite one ?
Through HeadCount , I got to meet one of my musical heroes , Phil Lesh – and I had the opportunity to introduce him , his wife Jill , and their son Brian to President Obama in fall 2007 .
Phil could not have been more down - to - earth and genuinely interested in helping the cause .
He asked me to film a message from Obama that the band could air at the DeadHeads for Obama concert at the Warfield , just prior to the California Democratic primary .
I told Phil I seriously doubted I could make that happen , but to my surprise , the President agreed and recorded an off - the - cuff message while traveling on the campaign plane .
We turned it around in a day or so and got the video to San Francisco just in time .
It was very cool to see my worlds collide .
People sometimes forget how close the primaries were .
With that in mind , what do you think was the most critical strategy or tactic that helped Barack Obama win the Democractic nomination and ultimately the presidency ?
What one thing that do you look back at and say , “ Wow , I ’m so glad we did that ” ?
The most important strategic decision was to let the campaign be a truly grassroots effort .
We did n’t give orders from headquarters and demand that all of our volunteers and supporters stay on script .
Instead , Plouffe decided we would embrace the creativity and ideas that ordinary people were inspired to offer – whether it be a viral video , email , or a local rally .
Not all of them worked , but many of them did , and that peer - to - peer persuasion was more potent than any TV ad I ever made .
What are you up to these days ?
Are you finding time to see music ?
Right now I ’m in the middle of the fight to pass health - insurance reform , trying to recapture some of that grassroots energy that elected the President and apply it to a cause that affects almost everybody in this country .
The fact that insurance companies can currently deny coverage due to preexisting conditions , or hike out - of - pocket costs to absurd levels , or refuse to pay the full cost of preventive care that keeps people healthy – it ’s just un-American , in my view .
Between work and my new puppy , I have n’t gotten to see nearly as much music as I ’d like .
I did catch The Dead at Roseland back in March , and Billy ’s band BK3 in New Haven a few months ago .
You ca n’t leave one of those shows without feeling like these guys understand the power of music like nobody else – and they channel every ounce of their passion into lifting up the audience instead of themselves .
That ’s the way music ( and politics ) should be .
GLENROCK , Wyo . ( AP )  A 76 - year - old Wyoming man shot with a Taser by police while driving an antique tractor in a small - town parade says it hurt but he 's OK .
Retired truck driver Bud Grose of Glenrock told The Associated Press in a telephone interview on Wednesday that he has a heart condition but did n't require any medical attention .
Investigators say police in Glenrock used a Taser on the man after he disobeyed orders .
They say the tractor may have hit a car .
Two officers were placed on paid leave and state agents are investigating , but the police chief says it does n't appear any policies were violated .
Grose would n't discuss specifics of the incident until he speaks to his attorney .

Sky watchers could catch a dazzling treat on Tuesday and Wednesday , with the peak of the annual Perseid meteor shower .
Meteors are bits of dust or rock that collide with Earth 's atmosphere and heat up gas particles to produce a glowing trail .
A handful of meteors can be seen each hour on any clear night , but during a meteor shower dozens may be visible .
The Perseid shower occurs each year when the Earth passes through a stream of debris shed by the comet Swift - Tuttle , which orbits the sun once every 130 years or so and last passed through the inner solar system in 1992 .
The Perseid shower is expected to reach its peak at 1:30 p.m. on August 12 , but dozens of meteors per hour should be visible on the nights preceding and following the peak .
The best time to catch the shower may be around 4:00 a.m. on August 12 , when meteor numbers may get a slight boost as the Earth passes by an additional stream of debris left by the comet in 1610 .
On a clear night , an average of 60 meteors can be seen per hour close to the Perseids ' peak .
This year , the number may be lower because the moon , which is approaching its last quarter , will rise at about the same time as the shower is expected to begin .
Perseus Rising
Moonshine could obscure the fainter meteors , cutting the total number of meteors that might be seen in half , says Tony Cook of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles .
" That actually might bother meteor experts more than it does people who want to enjoy the shower , because the ones you want to see are the really bright ones anyway , " Cook says .
The Perseid meteor shower gets its name because the meteor trails all lead back to a point in the northern constellation Perseus .
Every evening this week , the shower should start around 11 p.m. local time as the Perseus constellation rises , and the number of visible meteors should increase as the evening progresses to peak before dawn .
Perseid Meteor Shower 2009
The meteors will appear all over the sky , so the best strategy for viewing the shower is to lie down and stare at as large a patch of sky as possible .
Observers will want to point their gaze away from the moon to reduce its effect on night vision .
Although the best Perseid viewing is in the northern hemisphere , some viewers just south of the equator may also be able to catch a glimpse .
The number of people watching catch - up television online is also growing Britons are more willing to cut back on holidays and meals out than on spending on communication technology during the recession , an Ofcom review suggests .
The watchdog 's annual report says spending on mobiles , the internet and TV is regarded as a higher priority than almost anything except food .
In a poll of 862 people , over 40 % said they would save on holidays and eating out and 19 % chose spending on mobiles .
Ofcom 's Peter Phillips said people were " more canny " about paying for services .
The study also highlights a major rise in the use of social networking websites .
Some 19 m people in the UK , 50 % of internet users , visit Facebook , spending an average of six hours a month on the site , it says .
This is an increase from four hours in May 2008 .

The report said the proportion of 25 to 34 - year - olds who said they had a social networking site profile grew by six percentage points in a year to 46 % , while the figure also rose among 35 to 54 - year - olds to 35 % .
But the proportion of 15 to 24 - year - olds with such a profile dropped from 55 % in the first quarter of 2008 to 50 % in the first quarter of 2009 , the study added .
Ofcom researchers asked consumers where they were likely to be cutting back on spending during the recession , as part of its communications market report
Of those asked , 47 % said going out for dinner , 41 % said DIY and 41 % holidays .
This compared with 19 % who said they would cut back on mobile phone spending , 16 % who said TV subscriptions and 10 % who highlighted broadband services .
The report says the trend is supported by the fact communications are costing less , with longer , cheaper mobile phone contracts and the bundling of services such as television and internet at reduced prices .
Ofcom 's Peter Phillips said : " Despite the recession , people are spending more time watching TV , using their mobile phone or accessing the internet .
" They would rather do without meals out or holidays than give up their phone , broadband or pay TV package ..
OFCOM STUDY FINDINGS 50 % of internet users use Facebook There were 2.6 m
Twitter users in May 2009 Men are more likely to watch catch - up TV Leeds has the highest take - up rate for mobile broadband ( 29 % ) Mobile broadband take up was lowest in the Scottish Borders ( 3 % )
Technology , Twitter and the downturn Send us your comments " Meanwhile , we are becoming more canny about the way we pay for these services .
" Almost half of us economise by taking a bundle of communications services from a single supplier , while one - fifth opt for cheaper mobile contracts which do n't include an expensive new phone . "
Catch - up TV boost
The report's other findings include :
In May 2009 , consumers spent an average of 25 minutes a day online at home - up from nine minutes in 2004
Average household spending on internet services fell in real terms between 2007 and 2008
Nearly a quarter of households , 23 % , were watching catch - up TV online in 2008 , compared with 17 % in 2007
This was driven by the BBC iPlayer , with 15 % of internet users , 5.2 million , watching the service in 2008
Overall take up of broadband across the UK reached 68 % of households by the end of the first quarter of 2009 , up from 58 % on the previous year
In May of this year there were more than 250,000 new mobile broadband connections , up from 139,000 new connections in May 2008 .
Ofcom also published a report into communications in the nations and regions , which showed take up of services was rising rapidly .
Use of broadband in Scotland was up from 53 % to 60 % , in Northern Ireland take up rose from 52 % to 64 % , and in Wales from 45 % to 58 % .

The protesters who expect to be arrested this weekend in the campaign to close down Hazelwood power station may break the law , but they have justice on their side .
The protesters who expect to be arrested this weekend in the campaign to close down Hazelwood power station may break the law , but they have justice on their side .
With scientists predicting runaway climate change unless we take drastic action in the next five years , and the manifest failure of our democratic system to respond adequately to the overwhelming threat posed to our future , it is legitimate to step outside the usual boundaries of protest .
Last year , six British Greenpeace protestors scaled the smokestack of the Kingsnorth coal - fired power plant in Kent and painted a slogan on it .
They were arrested and charged with criminal damage .
In court they did not dispute that they had caused damage but argued that they acted to prevent a greater harm — the damage to the atmosphere being caused by carbon dioxide emissions from Kingsnorth .
The 40 - year - old Hazelwood power station is Australia ’s largest single source of carbon pollution and symbolises everything that is wrong with greenhouse policy in this country .
An industrial relic , Hazelwood was due to be decommissioned this year .
The owners applied for an extension of its life to 2031 .
In 2005 the panel appointed by the Victorian government to review the application concluded that , if Hazelwood ’s electricity output were replaced by natural gas turbines , carbon dioxide emissions would be two - thirds lower .
But Big Coal won and the Victorian Labor government extended Hazelwood ’s license to pollute to 2031 .
The extension of its life will add around 340 million tonnes of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere .
By comparison , in 2007 the whole electricity sector in Australia was responsible for 200 million tonnes of greenhouse gases .
Over the next two decades , the carbon emissions from Hazelwood will wipe out more than half of the emissions savings from the Rudd Government ’s 20 per cent renewable energy scheme .

The jury in the Kingsnorth trial heard the arguments from defence and prosecution .
They accepted that the protesters had a lawful excuse for damaging the power plant and acquitted them .
The law was applied and they were found not guilty .
While anyone can claim that their cause justifies civil disobedience , few receive such an unambiguous endorsement for their ‘ law - breaking ’ from fellow citizens .
In history ’s league table of great causes , fighting global warming is up there with campaigns for the suffrage and civil rights and against slavery and apartheid .
In fact , it puts all others in the shade because the fate of the planet hangs in the balance .
Global warming is uniquely dangerous because victory can come too late .
Unless it occurs now a sudden awakening by governments to the peril will be too late ; the global climate system will have shifted course and the future will have been taken out of our hands .
We are lucky to be citizens of a country that is peaceful , prosperous and governed by the rule of law .
Yet runaway climate change jeopardises the stable and civilised community that our laws and our democracy are designed to protect .
Those who have overcome the natural tendency to avoid or play down the facts and so recognise the awfulness of the threat we now face must ask whether they are bound to submit to laws that protect those who continue to pollute the atmosphere in a way that threatens our survival .
The people who will gather at the gates of Hazelwood this weekend are some of the most law - abiding in the country .
They are among the most civic - minded , the most committed to democratic participation , and the most respectful of laws that serve the common interest .
They and thousands of others around the country have pursued every avenue — petitions , letter - writing campaigns , media events , delegations to MPs , lobbying , peaceful protests and elections .
It is now clear that the influence of the energy and mining companies swamps the effect of community campaigns and drowns out the warnings of our best scientists .
Disobeying the law should be a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted .
And they have been .
Given the moral imperative for decisive action on global warming , the protesters who plan to trespass at Hazelwood this Saturday are morally justified in breaking the law .
Their target is not the laws against trespass or criminal damage , but the failure of our governments to make laws that would see Hazelwood and other coal - fired power plants in Australia closed down in short order .
Many hoped a new dawn had broken with the election of a Labor Government promising to take far - reaching measures to tackle Australia ’s contribution to global warming .
Many believed the Prime Minister when he declared that climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our generation .
But it is now apparent that its true intentions were business - as - usual .
It is now clear that beneath the superficial differences there is bi-partisan agreement that short - term commercial interests must come first and as little should be done as governments can get away with .
The scattered acts of disobedience we have seen to date in Australia and other countries are a mere taste of what is to come .
The only hope for the world lies in a campaign of radical activism aimed at shifting power away from those who do not care about the future .
Never has a campaign been more necessary .
It is a campaign for all of those who understand that the lives of our children and grandchildren are at stake .

Yesterday , in furtherance of his indictment of Barack Obama as an Olympics - mongering gamewhore , Glenn Beck pointed out that the Olympics suck and Vancouver lost $ 1 billion when it hosted them .
Next year .
In as sad an indication we 've seen yet of how low the politico - media complex has fallen , it took the fucking White House of the United States of America to point out , on its blog , that you can't lose money on the 2010 Olympics if it 's still 2009 :
RHETORIC : BECK SAID VANCOUVER LOST $ 1 BILLION WHEN IT " HAD THE OLYMPICS . "
Glenn Beck said , " Vancouver lost , how much was it ?
they lost a billion dollars when they had the Olympics . "
[ Transcript , Glenn Beck Show , 9/29/09 ] REALITY : VANCOUVER'S OLYMPICS WILL NOT TAKE PLACE UNTIL 2010 .
Vancouver will host the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games from February 12 – 28 , 2010 and March 12 - 21 , 2010 , respectively .
[ Vancouver2010.com , accessed 9/29/09 ]
That 's why the White House has a blog :
To periodically remind us of transparently true and immutable facts about our inescapably temporal existence .
( CNN ) --
An 11 - year - old California girl snatched from the street in front of her house in 1991 had two children with the man accused of taking her and was forced along with the children to live in backyard sheds , police said Thursday .
Jaycee Lee Dugard as she looked in 1991 and an age - progression image of what she might look like as an adult .
" From what they have both said , he fathered both of those children with Jaycee [ Dugard ] , " El Dorado County Undersheriff Fred Kollar told reporters .
The girls , now 11 and 15 , had been living with their mother , now 29 , in a series of sheds behind Phillip Garrido 's house in Antioch , California , until they were discovered on Wednesday , Kollar said .
" None of the children had ever gone to school , they had never been to a doctor , they were kept in complete isolation in this compound , if you will , at the rear of the house , " he said .
" They were born there . "
In a rambling telephone interview from jail , Garrido told CNN affiliate KCRA of Sacramento he was relieved at being caught .
" I feel much better now , " he said .
" This is a process that needed to take place . "
Kollar said Garrido's wife , Nancy , was with her husband when Dugard was abducted from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe .
Garrido was already a registered sex offender at the time .
Watch police talk about why they arrested Garrido »
" There was nothing then nor is there anything now to indicate that this was anything other than a stranger abduction of an 11 - year - old , " Kollar said .
The investigation went years without apparent progress until Tuesday , when Garrido showed up on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley with his two daughters and attempted to get permission to hand out literature and speak , Kollar said .
He did not know the subject of either the literature or the planned talk .
Police officers " thought the interaction between the older male and the two young females was rather suspicious , " so she confronted them and performed a background check on him , Kollar said .
That check revealed that Garrido was on federal parole for a 1971 conviction for rape and kidnapping , for which he had served time in the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth , Kansas .
A school spokesman identified the officers as Allison Jacobs and Lisa Campbell , and said the two became suspicious of " subtle behavior " Garrido exhibited .
They passed on the information to Garrido 's parole officer , who requested that the 58 - year - old man appear Wednesday at the parole office .
Garrido did just that , accompanied by his wife , Nancy , " and a female named Allissa , " Kollar said .
The presence of " Allissa " and the two children surprised the parole officer , who had never seen them during visits to Garrido 's house , Kollar said .
" Ultimately , Allissa was identified as Dugard , " Kollar said .
DNA confirmation is being sought to confirm her identity , but Dugard revealed information during an interview that only she could have known , Kollar said .
" The two minor children turned out to be children of Jaycee and the male suspect , Garrido , " he said .
Scott Kernan , undersecretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation , told reporters that Garrido admitted to having abducted Dugard .
El Dorado County Sheriff 's
Office online records showed that Phillip and Nancy Garrido were in the county jail , held on suspicion of offenses including conspiracy to commit a crime and kidnapping with the intent to commit robbery and rape .
Dugard had been living behind Garrido's home since she was kidnapped , Kollar said .
But her presence there apparently went unnoticed by others in the residential neighborhood , where homes on one - fourth to one - half - acre lots typically sell for less than $ 200,000 , said Kathy Russo , whose father has lived two houses away from the Garridos for 33 years .
" My dad said he never saw a young woman , " said Russo , who added that her father , 94 - year - old Dante Confetti , considered Garrido to be a " kind of strange , reclusive , kind of an angry kind of guy . "
She said the one - story house 's backyard was obscured by trees and ringed by a wooden fence .
Her family 's last contact with Garrido was last fall , she said .
" He was burning something in the backyard and my home health aide called the fire department , " Russo said .
" He was really pissed off , " she said .
" Came over to the house and started yelling . "
Garrido told KCRA that he left documents three days ago with the FBI in San Francisco , California , that would shed light on the case .
" They 're going to be a part of the trial , " he said .
A call from CNN to the FBI 's San Francisco bureau was not immediately returned .
Garrido said he could not go into detail about why he chose to abduct Dugard .
" I have n't talked to a lawyer yet , so I can't do that , " he said .
But Garrido said he had " completely turned my life around " in the past several years .
" You 're going to find the most powerful story coming from the witness , from the victim , " he said .
" If you take this a step at a time , you 're going to fall over backward and in the end you 're going to find the most powerful , heartwarming story . "
He added , " Wait 'til you hear the story of what took place at this house .
You 're going to be absolutely impressed .
It 's a disgusting thing that took place with me in the beginning , but I turned my life completely around . "
Describing the two daughters , he said , " Those two girls slept in my arms every single night from birth ; I never kissed them . "
But in a later comment , he said that , from the time the youngest was born , " everything turned around . "
Asked about the fact that they had not seen doctors , he said , " We just did n't have the finances and so forth . "
Kollar said a search of Garrido's property " revealed a hidden backyard within a backyard , " he said .
It included several sheds no higher than 6 feet tall , two tents and several outbuildings " where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives . "
The " secondary " backyard was inside the first and was " screened from view . "
One of the sheds was soundproof , he said .
" The way the backyard is set up you could walk through the backyard , walk through the house and never know that there was another set of living circumstances in that backyard . "
At the end of the backyard is a 6 - foot fence lined with shrubs , tall trees , garbage bags and a tarp , all of which obscured views of what was there , he said .
Extension cords provided electricity to the sheds and tents , and an outhouse and rudimentary shower " as if you were camping " were there , too , he said .
Dugard " was in good health , but living in a backyard for the past 18 years does take its toll , " Kollar said .
He described her as " relatively cooperative , relatively forthcoming " in discussions with detectives .
He said Dugard was " in relatively good condition , " neither obviously abused nor malnourished .
He added , " There are no known attempts by her to outreach to anybody . "
The mother and her two daughters were staying at a motel in the area , he said .
" Family reunification has begun and will be a long and ongoing process , " he said , presumably referring to Dugard 's parents .
Earlier Thursday , Carl Probyn , Dugard 's stepfather , told CNN that an FBI agent had called his wife , Terry , on Wednesday afternoon to tell her that Dugard had been found .
" Jaycee remembers everything , " he said .
" They talked back and forth and she had the right answers to all my wife 's questions . "
He said , " I 'm feeling great ! ...
It 's like winning the Lotto . "
He witnessed the abduction of the blond , blue - eyed girl , who was wearing a pink windbreaker and pink stretch pants as she walked to her bus stop on June 10 , 1991 .
Watch the stepfather describe finding out Jaycee is alive »
At the time , " It was reported that a vehicle occupied by two individuals drove up to Jaycee Dugard and abducted her in view of her stepfather , " the El Dorado County Sheriff 's office said Thursday .
Ernie Allen , president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , said the reappearance of Dugard is " absolutely huge . "
" One of the things that we preach to searching families all the time ... is that even in these long - term cases there 's hope , " he said .
" Even in these long - term cases ... it 's important that we not let the world forget . "
CNN 's Taylor Gandossy , Tom Watkins and Stan Wilson contributed to this report .

Worlds Most Dangerous Animals
10 worlds most dangerous animals
Rhinos , hyenas , alligators – devastating human predators , right ?
Wrong !
Though an attack by one of these beasts would surely mean bad news , they ’re statistically least likely to kill a human .
Check out the most deadly animals in the world , discover how they mete out their punishment and , most importantly , find out how to avoid them !
The mosquito
Yes , the humble mosquito .
What we Brits regard as an annoying pest is actually the most dangerous creature on the planet , thanks to its ability to spread disease with alarming efficiency .
Best known for spreading deadly malaria , mossies also spread elephantiasis , yellow fever , dengue fever and West Nile virus , which was recently introduced to the US and is now prevalent in all states .
Responsible for :
An estimated 2 - 3 million fatalities a year .
Hangs out in : Worldwide ; harmful in Africa , Asia and North America .
Method of dispatch : Using serrated mouth parts , female mosquitoes pierce the skin and inject saliva containing a thinning agent to liquidise the blood .
Most people wo n’t know that they have been bitten until the immune system reacts , resulting in red , itchy bumps that continue to itch for days after the initial bite .
Useful avoidance techniques : Mosquito nets treated with DDT are the most effective way to keep them at bay , as well as combative sprays and treatments that can be applied directly to the skin .
Wear light - coloured , long clothes in the evening .
If travelling to malaria zones , ensure that you take your full course of tablets before , during and after your stay .
The venomous snake
Though there are more than 2,000 species of snake , 450 of which are venomous , only 250 are capable of killing a man .
That ’s little consolation to the thousands who meet a nasty death due to snake bites each year – it ’s usually members of local populations who bear the brunt as they live and work where snakes inhabit and usually wear no protective gear .
Responsible for :
An estimated 50 - 125,000 fatalities a year .
Hangs out in : Africa , Asia and North America .
Method of dispatch : Snakes are very fast and any part of the human body is a good place for a bite , seeing as the venom can flow into the bloodstream within minutes ; although those near major veins and arteries will travel faster .
Snakes use their venom to paralyse their prey .
A fully grown king cobra can rear up so it looks a man in the eye ; others can spit venom into the eye .
Nasty .
Useful avoidance techniques : Unsurprisingly , most people come a cropper when they try to harass a snake or draw close to it .
Snakes will usually only attack if they ’re feeling threatened so the short answer is : stay away !
Wear stout boots if hiking and check either side of paths .
Do n’t mess about looking under rocks or fallen vegetation as you ’ll get more than you bargained for .
If you come across a snake , back away very slowly , as it can strike to half its length and sudden movements are likely to alarm it .
The scorpion
Highly deadly and twice as ugly , the scorpion is a nasty critter that is probably responsible for more deaths per year than recorded , due to the isolated places they hang out and probable lack of access to antivenin .
However , out of an estimated 1,500 species of scorpion worldwide , only around 25 are regarded dangerous .
Responsible for :
An estimated 800 - 2,000 fatalities a year .
Hangs out in : Worldwide ; particularly Africa , the Americas and Central Asia .
Method of dispatch : Scorpions paralyse their prey by pumping deadly venom through the obvious curved stinger at the end of their tails .
As with all venom , humans are particularly susceptible if they are allergic – though the African spitting scorpion , who scuttles around Africa , is the most venomous , as it is able to spray venom up to a metre .
Yuk .
Useful avoidance techniques : Scorpions become active at night and lie low during the day , so be sure to shake out any bedding , clothing or anything close to the ground before use .
Be vigilant at night and wear thick socks .
Big cats
These big cats certainly mean business .
With destruction of their natural habitat and a decline in prey species , particularly concerning the tiger and North American mountain lion or cougar , attacks on humans are increasing .
The African lion is the biggest and most feared of big cats , but holidaymakers on safari are 100 per cent safe viewing from a vehicle , unless they decide to take a closer look and step down .
Mountain lions are found in many national parks and are responsible for six attacks a year in the US and Canada .
Responsible for :
An estimated 800 fatalities a year .
Hangs out in : Africa , North America and India .
Method of dispatch : Tigers generally attack from the back and look to bite the jugular or break the neck .
Mountain lions stalk their prey and often attack from a vantage point .
Presumably they then set about mauling the victim in a manner identical to that we ’ve all seen in countless nature programs .
Useful avoidance techniques :
To avoid a heinous attack by a big cat , stare them in the eye and do n’t look away .
To make yourself appear larger by opening your coat ; they are unlikely to attack a larger animal , particularly in the case of a mountain lion .
DO NOT turn and run – you may as well flash a neon sign asking to be attacked .
They can outrun you in any case .
Shout , scream and throw stones .
If one has you , punch its nose and eyes .
The crocodile
Crocodiles are dreaded prehistoric creatures capable of wreaking a terrible punishment on puny human flesh .
North American , Estuarine and Nile crocodiles are the most dangerous and probably kill more people yearly than figures show due to the isolated areas where attacks are likely to take place and distance from help .
One meal will keep a crocodile sated for a good while , so they like to wait in the water for the perfect time to strike .
Responsible for :
An estimated 600 - 800 fatalities a year .
Hangs out in : Africa and Australia .
Method of dispatch :
With terrifying speed , crocodiles can launch themselves out of the water like a missile and latch hold of their prey .
They then go into a death roll , spinning the victim around and around to disorientate , thereby lessening its chance of escape .
Useful avoidance techniques : Straight from the society of stating the obvious : do not swim in areas where there are crocodiles .
It may be hot , and you may want a swim , but the croc will see you coming and the rest does n’t bear thinking about .
If you ’re unfortunate enough to be grabbed , shout , scream , claw … and pray .
The elephant
Despite their friendly and approachable image thanks to zoo feeding times , these herbivores kill an alarming amount of people every year .
Elephants are unpredictable creatures , and have been known to kill zookeepers who have been with them for as long as 15 years .
It is recorded that even the tamest of elephants can attack without warning , though it is thought that most elephants do not realise the harm they do with almost no effort .
Responsible for :
An estimated 300 - 500 fatalities a year .
Hangs out in : Africa and India .
Method of dispatch : Considering their huge size – the average elephant weighs over 6 tons – they trample and gore using their fearsome tusks and are capable of causing untold amounts of devastation .
Useful avoidance techniques : General advice on avoiding an elephant attack seems to be : do n’t startle the beast ; he is more likely to charge if he feels intimidated .
If the elephant seems intent on charging , make as much noise as you can and try to put it off – otherwise scale the nearest tree ( large enough so that the elephant cannot knock it down , of course ) .
The hippopotamus
At first glance , these wallowing river - horses appear to be bulky , lazy beasts and not the fearsome predators you would expect to have a habit of mauling humans .
However , with gaping mouths that can open four feet wide and swinging sledgehammer heads , as well as the fact that they can outrun us on land , these highly aggressive animals have plenty of scope for destruction and are considered one of the most dangerous of African animals .
Responsible for :
An estimated 100 - 150 fatalities a year .
Hangs out in : Lakes , rivers , wallows – in fact any water – in Africa .
Method of dispatch : Hippos will charge , trample and gore victims with alarming ferocity , often when they are blocked from deep water or someone is standing between the hippo and their calf .
They have also been known to upturn boats and canoes without provocation and feast on the victim within , despite being herbivores .
Useful avoidance techniques : Surprising hippos is a big no - no .
If canoeing in hippo waters , rap on the side of the boat with your paddle to warn any wallowing occupants that you are close by , therefore giving them a chance to move to deeper waters .
If you surprise them on land where they feel most vulnerable , do not block their escape route to water .
Jellyfish
The sting - masters of the sea , Jellyfish are usually passive drifters who use their tentacles to dredge up small prey .
However , anyone who becomes entangled with a jellyfish will experience degrees of pain from a nasty nip to excruciating pain , depending on the species .
The box jellyfish is one of the most venomous marine creatures in the world ; a sting can kill a man within minutes and most fatalities occur following a brush with a toxic jelly like this .
Responsible for :
An estimated 100 fatalities a year .
Hangs out in : Northern Australia , Papua New Guinea , Malaysia , Indonesia , the Philippines , Thailand and Vietnam .
Method of dispatch :
The jellyfish unwinds its coiled stinging tentacles , fires them at the victim and then pumps their venom to paralyse the unfortunate recipient , usually manifesting itself as cardiac arrest in humans .
Useful avoidance techniques :
If swimming in an area where there are known jellyfish , wear a sting - suit .
However , if you are stung , get out of the water pronto and apply vinegar to any stings remaining embedded in the flesh to remove the venom , then brush or lift off using a credit card , stick or similar .
The shark
Sharks have a terrible reputation thanks to films such as Jaws and Deep Blue Sea , but it ’s one not entirely without cause .
It seems that although great whites are often blamed for unprovoked attacks on humans , it is more likely to be down to those snappy bull sharks , who are very aggressive .
Out of 360 species , only four are known killers : tiger , great white , oceanic whitetip and bull sharks .
However , as we ’ve seen with bears , although there are a high number of shark attacks , actual fatalities are fairly low .
Responsible for :
An estimated 100 fatalities a year .
Hangs out in : Florida , Australia , Hawaii and South Africa .
Method of dispatch : Sharks attack the only way they can – by lunging with fearsome teeth .
Sharks can grip their prey easily in their powerful jaws and are capable of biting through almost anything .
Useful avoidance techniques :
Do n’t wear yellow or orange , as sharks have good eyesight and these colours in particular seem to irritate them .
If you are cut , get out of the water as they will smell blood from miles away .
Engage in your aquatic recreation in groups – sharks are more likely to attack solitary prey .
If you are attacked , punch the shark on the nose and claw the eyes and gills as these are sensitive spots .
The bear
Forget gentle Ben – when a bear rears on its hind legs you know you ’re in trouble .
Although bears have a fearsome reputation , you are statistically more likely to survive a bear attack than to perish , but that ’s small consolation to those who are faced with a bristling bear .
With five attacks in Canada in 2005 alone , it seems that they ’re on the increase due to human destruction of , and encroachment on , bears ’ natural habitat .
Responsible for :
An estimated 5 - 10 fatalities a year .
Hangs out in : North America , Canada , North Pole , Russia and isolated pockets around the world .
Method of dispatch :
There are many different sub -species of bear and not all of them are vicious .
However , the polar , black and grizzly varieties are deadliest .
Bears will trample , maul and generally savage their prey until they ’re frightened off or finish the job ; and will attack for a variety of reasons , hunger being one .
You should always keep food well away from your camp .
Useful avoidance techniques :
If you are faced with an angry bear ( categorised by snorting , false bluffs , ground beating , etc ) , slowly back away from the bear , watching it all the while .
DO NOT turn and run .
If it continues to act aggressively , you should respond in kind by shouting and throwing sticks and stones while continuing to back away .
If a bear is upon you , fight back as you will stand a better chance of survival than if you play dead .
In a report that was actually completed last October but not published until this week in the New England Journal of Medicine , researchers from the North American Opiate Medication Initiative ( NAOMI ) found that giving heroin under supervision to some hard - core drug addicts was more effective than giving them methadone .
The study 's publication in the prestigious peer - reviewed journal is already leading to calls for experiments with heroin maintenance in the US .
To qualify for the study , participants had to have been addicted to heroin , Dilaudid , or another opiate for at least five years , have been injecting for at least the past year , have tried addiction treatment , including methadone maintenance , at least twice , and be at least 25 years of age .
While researchers were loathe to generalize their findings , they described heroin maintenance as " a safe and effective treatment " for chronic addicts who have not taken to other forms of treatment .
Hastings St. , downtown Vancouver ( from vandu.org )
In the NAOMI project , researchers monitored 251 heroin addicts in Vancouver and Montreal and provided them with maintenance drugs for a year under the supervision of nurses , doctors , social workers , and psychiatrists .
One hundred fifteen received pharmaceutical heroin ( diacetylmorphine ) , 111 received methadone , and 25 received Dilaudid ( hydromorphone ) .
Among participants who received heroin by injection , 88 % completed the program compared to 54 % of those receiving oral methadone .
Similarly , illicit drug use rates dropped by 67 % among those receiving heroin , compared to 48 % among those receiving methadone .
" Our data show remarkable retention rates and significant improvements in illicit heroin use , illegal activity and health for participants receiving injection assisted therapy , as well as those assigned to optimized methadone maintenance , " said Dr. Martin Schechter , principal investigator for the Center for Health Evaluation and Outcome Sciences at the University of British Columbia School of Population and Public Health and NAOMI 's lead researcher .
" Prior to NAOMI , all of the study participants had not benefited from repeated standard addiction treatments .
Society had basically written them off as impossible to treat , " he said .
" We now have evidence to show that heroin - assisted therapy is a safe and effective treatment for people with chronic heroin addiction who have not benefited from previous treatments .
A combination of optimal therapies -- as delivered in the NAOMI clinics -- can attract those most severely addicted to heroin , keep them in treatment and more importantly , help to improve their social and medical conditions , " explained Schechter .
The NAOMI research results mirror similar findings from a number of European countries , a fact noted in a Journal editorial by Virginia Berridge .
" The results of this trial may be added to those from Germany , the Netherlands , Spain and Switzerland , " Berridge wrote .
" Switzerland has 10 years of experience in the prescription of heroin , and in a November 2008 referendum , 68 % of voters were in favor of its continued prescription . "
The NAOMI findings , along with earlier work from Europe , are relevant to the United States .
According to government figures , nearly 700,000 Americans are heroin users , and 15 % to 25 % of them are heavy users who could benefit from prescription heroin .
But heroin is a Schedule I drug under the US Controlled Substances Act , which means it cannot legally be prescribed .
That is unlikely to change anytime soon .
Even allowing for a pilot program would require political decisions that are unlikely to be made in the foreseeable future .
That needs to change , said advocates of evidence - based drug policies .
" The NAOMI results are clear that prescription heroin reduces crime , and overdose deaths , " said Laura Thomas , deputy state director of the Drug Policy Alliance .
" The reason this effective treatment is n't available in the United States right now is politics .
The science is there . "
" The success of NAOMI , combined with similar results in other countries , leaves little question that heroin prescription would reduce crime , and overdose fatalities in the United States as well , " added DPA executive director Ethan Nadelmann .
" Recent votes in Germany and Switzerland , combined with similar evidence of public support in other countries , show that the public will support even controversial drug policies when they have proven results .
There is no question that heroin prescription programs are needed and long overdue in this country .
All that stands in the way is ideology and the backward assumption that it can never happen in the United States . "
It was n't just DPA wondering about more effective forms of drug treatment .
In a blog post titled Prescription Heroin ? , New York Times science columnist John Tierney asked just that :
Is it time for prescription heroin in the US ?
He did n't provide an answer , but the fact that the question is being asked by someone like Tierney is suggestive .
And if not prescription heroin , what about Dilaudid ?
It is Schedule II and can be prescribed , although not , under current law , for maintenance purposes .
Schecter and his fellow researchers found that NAOMI participants could not distinguish it from heroin and that it appeared to be equally effective .
When someone registers a domain like glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com , they probably expect to hear from Glenn Beck 's lawyers .
In this case , it took two days .
The site 's anonymous operator tells
Ars that the whole thing is satire — but that may not be enough to avoid charges of defamation .
Gilbert Gottfried , what have you started ?
The controversy started a week ago in the Fark forums , where someone picked up on an old Gilbert Gottfried roast of the " comedian " ( scare quotes fully intended ) Bob Saget .
During the roast , Gottfried repeatedly said ( watch the video ) that Saget had " not raped and killed a girl in 1990 . "
The Fark forums took the joke about the power of insinuation and applied it to right - wing talk show host Glenn " Obama is a racist " Beck .
One of the Fark readers then took the forum meme to the next level , registering a domain name and launching a web site in order to make a point about talking head TV demagoguery .
" Why wo n't Glenn Beck deny these allegations ? " asks the site .
" We 're not accusing Glenn Beck of raping and murdering a young girl in 1990 — in fact , we think he did n't !
But we can't help but wonder , since he has failed to deny these horrible allegations .
Why wo n't he deny that he raped and killed a young girl in 1990 ? "
At the very bottom of the page was a small text disclaimer saying that the site was satirical .
I spoke to the anonymous owner of the site , who tells
Ars that launching it " just felt right " — it flipped the " birther " non-falsifiable conspiracy theories about Obama 's birth and citizenship around and applied the same tactics to one of the biggest talking heads ( no pun intended ? ) on cable news .
It 's just " using Beck 's tactics against him " and is a small way of " directing all this frustration " with Beck and others into action .
The site went up on September 1 and had a huge spike of initial interest — it served more than 120,000 page loads in the first 24 hours .
By September 3 , lawyers for Beck 's media company , Mercury Radio Arts , had contacted the domain registrar demanding that the " highly defamatory domain name " glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com be deleted , that the WhoisGuard privacy protection service be revoked , and that the owner 's contact information be turned over to the lawyers .
Registrar NameCheap did n't do this , of course , and Beck 's lawyers sent another letter the next day , making the same demands .
They also showed that they were reading the website : " We also note that it appears you contacted the individual , as he states on his website hosted on the Defamatory Domain that 'my webhost is taking some flak over this website , so if he gets shuts me down , it may take a bit to get rehosted . ' "
The registrar did change the site 's nameservers without alerting the owner , but allowed him to change them back once he contacted the company , and the site remains up .
The owner also registered additional backup domains , such as " DidGlennBeckRapeAndMurderAYoungGirlIn1990.com " ( form of a question ! ) and " gb1990.com " ( inoffensive ! ) .
Beck 's lawyers also filed a case with the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) in Switzerland , the group which handles the worldwide domain dispute resolution process , on the grounds that the new website was improperly using Glenn Beck 's trademarked name .
( Side note : Beck 's name is in the process of being trademarked in the US .
While most of the " goods and services " associated with the name are obvious ones like DVDs and books containing Beck 's special brand of commentary , the mark is also reserved for use on " cups , ice buckets , mugs , non-metal piggy banks , ceramic and porcelain holiday ornaments . "
The thought of such an ornament hanging on a Christmas tree ... )
Be careful when stating " facts "
Paul Levy of Public Citizen routinely stands up for Web users who complain about ( or otherwise antagonize ) deep - pocketed corporate interests , but when we asked him about the site and the defamation complaints , he was happy to stay seated in his chair .
Neither a rapist nor a murderer
The Communications Decency
Act basically protects registrars and web hosts from liability for the content that people put up using such services , so the letters to the registrar are n't so much a legal threat as an attempt to get the website owner 's contact info without a subpoena .
And the trademark claims made at WIPO ?
Levy thinks they sound " preposterous . "
But the possibility of a US defamation / libel suit against the anonymous site operator is a real one .
Certainly , domain names alone " can be defamatory , " Levy says , pointing out that the first iteration of the site posed the " rape and murder " claim as a statement — not as a question .
Levy says that such a statement is only actionable if 1 ) it 's false ( and we 're quite sure it is ) and 2 ) it was stated with actual malice .
That last bit could be tricky to prove , especially in a case involving an anonymous speaker , but Levy makes clear that the site might well be on the wrong side of a very fine line .
" I do n't think ' Ha ha it 's a joke ' at the end gets you off , " he says ; if the parodic information is defamatory , it 's risky for the defendant in such cases .
That 's complicated by the fact that the original domain name made the allegedly defamatory claim against Beck — and of course no one stumbling across the site in a search engine or elsewhere would see any disclaimer .
In such cases , the domain name itself is a standalone piece of content ; the disclaimer may help regarding the website content , but it wo n't necessarily transfer a cone of protection to the domain name as well .
Corynne McSherry , a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , chose the same word to describe the WIPO domain name dispute process : " preposterous . "
But she 's less convinced that Beck 's lawyers have a case to make regarding defamation , even when it comes to the website 's name .
" I 'm not sure of any case where someone has claimed that a domain name was defamatory , " she tells Ars .
And while domain names do pop up alone in search engines and other places , the public generally thinks of a site 's name in connection with the full content of the site , not as some standalone morsel of content .
While acknowledging that the name is " pretty dramatic , " she notes that this is often part of the point of parody — to highlight perceived outrageous behavior in one 's opponents by upping the ante ( think , for instance , of Jonathan Swift 's vicious satire " A Modest Proposal " in which he proposes that the Irish poor make money by selling their children to the wealthy ... as food ) .
In McSherry 's analysis , the site is " pure political criticism and there 's nothing wrong with that . "
Important to do
When I ask the site 's owner whether he thought , on a human / moral level , the joke had gone to far , there is a pause .
" Would i do something like this to any random human being ? " he says .
" No way , of course not . "
But the site is intended as a parody and Beck is a public figure ...
Will the site change any TV talking head tactics ?
The anonymous owner admits that it probably wo n't , but he says that the site " feels important to do . "
It " served as that release valve of frustration " for people angered by the tactics of talk show hosts .
And yet , he had a moment of pause when someone wrote in to him saying that she had been raped as a young girl and that she found the site grotesque rather than humorous or insightful .
No lawsuit has yet been filed , and it's not clear how far Beck 's lawyers will take the matter .
Unless the site owner responds to the WIPO domain dispute , however , he will lose the original domain .
On the site forums , readers are already thinking of ways to extend the satire .
" Glenn Beck hosts a daily radio show from 9 am - noon , " wrote one .
" I think we should begin calling and asking why he refuses to address his alleged rape and murder of a young girl in 1990 ...
If you do call in , please record and upload , so we can share his answers ( or lack there of ) with the world . "

Mr. Paul was drafted in 1942 and worked in California for the Armed Forces Radio Service , accompanying Rudy Vallee , Kate Smith and others .
When he was discharged in 1943 , he was hired as a staff musician for NBC radio in Los Angeles .
His trio toured with the Andrews Sisters and backed Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby , with whom he recorded the hit “ It ’s Been a Long , Long Time ” in 1945 .
Crosby encouraged Mr. Paul to build his own recording studio , and so he did , in his garage in Los Angeles .
There he experimented with recording techniques , using them to create not realistic replicas of a performance but electronically enhanced fabrications .
Toying with his mother ’s old Victrola had shown him that changing the speed of a recording could alter both pitch and timbre .
He could record at half - speed and replay the results at normal speed , creating the illusion of superhuman agility .
He altered instrumental textures through microphone positioning and reverberation .
Technology and studio effects , he realized , were instruments themselves .
He also noticed that by playing along with previous recordings , he could become a one - man ensemble .
As early as his 1948 hit “ Lover , ” he made elaborate , multilayered recordings , using two acetate disc machines , which demanded that each layer of music be captured in a single take .
From discs he moved to magnetic tape , and in the late 1950s he built the first eight - track multitrack recorder .
Each track could be recorded and altered separately , without affecting the others .
The machine ushered in the modern recording era .
In 1947 Mr. Paul teamed up with Colleen Summers , who had been singing with Gene Autry ’s band .
He changed her name to Mary Ford , a name found in a telephone book .
They were touring in 1948 when Mr. Paul ’s car skidded off an icy bridge .
Among his many injuries , his right elbow was shattered ; once set , it would be immovable for life .
Mr. Paul had it set at an angle , slightly less than 90 degrees , so that he could continue to play guitar .
Mr. Paul , whose first marriage , to the former Virginia Webb , had ended in divorce , married Ms. Ford in 1949 .
They had a television show , “ Les Paul and Mary Ford at Home , ” which was broadcast from their living room until 1958 .
They began recording together , mixing multiple layers of Ms. Ford ’s vocals with Mr. Paul ’s guitars and effects , and the dizzying results became hits in the early 1950s .
Among their more than three dozen hits , “ Mockingbird Hill , ” “ How High the Moon ” and “ The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise ” in 1951 and “ Vaya Con Dios ” in 1953 were million - sellers .

The politicians declared one plan for health care reform “ off the table ” from the beginning : a single - payer system that would cover all Americans and cut out private insurance .
But as Dr. Andy Coates explains , it remains the only alternative that can solve the crisis of the health care non-system .
Coates is a member of Physicians for a National Health Program ( PNHP ) , co-chair of Single Payer New York and a steward in the Public Employees Federation in New York .
Ashley Smith :
The right wing has mounted a major offensive against Democrats proposals for health care reform , with all sorts of absurd allegations and distortions .
What ’s your assessment of the right - wing attacks ?
Dr. Andy Coates :
At one town hall I attended , a guy had a sign that said , incredibly , “ Tsars are not for the USA , Tsars are for the USSR . ”
Nearby , there was quiet bragging that somebody had a gun in his car .
So there is nuttiness , but also potential danger as the right wing mobilizes .
At that meeting , I thought that people for single - payer outnumbered the right wing .
Those in favor of some kind of reform far outnumber those against , but the “ get the government out of health care ” group fought for the mike and fought for attention .
Earlier , I was heckled while speaking in favor of single - payer on a panel in Syracuse convened by a Congressman .
The interesting thing to me–besides hearing people holler “ socialism ! ” at the top of their lungs –was that the hecklers listened carefully to every word people said .
And I noted their applause when I said that mandating the purchase of health insurance would n’t solve anything .
At that meeting , a clear majority was for single - payer , but that ’s not how the press reported it .
So I think that many people , swayed by Republican arguments , will actually think this through for themselves .
For example , someone who ’s 59 years old , avoiding the doctor , trying to make it a few more years to Medicare , worried that Medicare wo n’t be there –and rightly so , for the Republicans keep repeating that it ’s “ bankrupt , ” and the President keeps saying that Medicare and Medicaid is breaking the country .
I believe we can win these people over to single - payer .
We should n’t let the TV coverage of these meetings distort our view .
Poll after poll , and our own experience , attests that the majority of people are on the side of real reform–of Medicare - for - all single - payer health care .
AS : Many people find the debate in Washington completely confusing and exasperating .
What do you think is going on ?
AC : It is confusing .
Just think about it –the Republican Party recently came out foursquare in defense of Medicare , after decades of calling for its abolition .
Of course , the Republicans want to protect Medicare Part D , a giveaway to the pharmaceutical industry , and they love Medicare Advantage , a privatization of Medicare that has proven lucrative for private insurance companies .
Meanwhile , we have the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association of America , led by former Republican congressman Billy Tauzin .
Tauzin was quoted in the Los Angeles Times saying that the White House promised not to negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry –promised to preserve Medicare Part D , and also not to allow the import of drugs from Canada or other countries where they would be cheaper than American prices .
In exchange , PhRMA is going to spend $ 150 million advertising in favor of so - called “ reform . ”
So PhRMA and the White House and the Republicans all appear to be in alignment , defending Medicare Part D from reform .
Perhaps Obama was accurate when he said recently that there was 80 percent agreement on the proposals .
Yet we hear “ government takeover ! ” as if someone were actually proposing such a thing .
AS : It seems like both the Republicans and the so - called “ blue dogs ” in the Democratic Party oppose the idea of government involvement in health care .
What ’s your view of their argument ?
AC : We should set the record straight .
The government is deeply involved in medical care .
Taxpayers fund at least half of all health care spending in the U.S.
The number of people covered by Medicare , Medicaid and military health plans is over 87 million .
The idea of getting the government out of health care could be called a utopian fantasy .
Medicare has been an enormously successful program for 44 years .
The Veterans Administration is a socialized system where the federal government owns the hospitals and clinics , pays the staff directly , and bargains with the pharmaceutical industry for low drug prices .
The Veterans Administration delivers the best quality health care in the country –numerous studies attest to it .
AS : Why has the Obama administration made such a mess of its campaign for health care reform ?
AC : No one disputes any longer that our system is in grave trouble .
We ’re spending twice as much as any other nation on health care , and yet we have a mediocre , dysfunctional system .
The Obama administration ’s message has been , again and again : “ If you like your insurance , you ’ll get to keep it . ”
They needed to find an argument that would help them earn the support of the health insurance industry .
So Democratic Party pollsters “ discovered ” that people love their health insurance .
In the name of reform , ironically , they broadcast the idea that people fear change .
This is at odds with everyday experience and the 2008 election returns , on top of many polls that show popular support for single - payer .
I think there is great enthusiasm and great expectation in favor of change–dramatic , fundamental change .
And people find the hassles of health insurance ridiculous .
AS : What is the nature of the reform that the Democrats are proposing ?
AC : The heart of the reform is a mandate that individuals purchase health insurance –to criminalize the uninsured .
In exchange for accepting some new regulation , the insurance industry will get the government to coerce people into buying their product .
Because working people do n’t make enough money to buy the product , tax money will be used to subsidize the private insurance premiums .
The Los Angeles Times called this “ a bonanza ” for the health insurance industry .
AS : This is exactly what Massachusetts did .
What has been the impact there ?
AC : Yes , Massachusetts mandated that everyone buy health insurance .
And this has n’t made premiums affordable .
To reduce premiums , policies have things like very high deductibles and large co-pays .
In the case of a single person making just over $ 30,000 a year , if you add up the premiums and deductible , she or he will have to shell out over $ 5,000 before any insurance kicks in .
This simply is n’t affordable .
Massachusetts subsidizes insurance premiums for everyone who makes less than 300 percent of the federal poverty line .
This guarantees a constant flow of money into private health insurance companies , while it exacerbates the state ’s budget deficit .
And to address the deficit , Massachusetts has cut safety net health care !
They have taken hundreds of millions of dollars out of programs that would have helped poor and low - income patients –the very people most need the care and whom the reform should have most helped .
In addition , Massachusetts has a feature like what ’s in the proposed federal reform–a brokerage house called the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector .
It ’s supposed to help people get private health insurance .
But it ’s yet another layer of bureaucracy !
The Insurance Connector alone employs more people than the province of Ontario has working for its Medicare program .
Medicare in Canada costs 1.3 percent of health spending .
The Insurance Connector adds 4.5 percent in administrative cost to each policy it brokers .
And the province of Ontario has twice as many people as the state of Massachusetts .
The Massachusetts model does n’t work .
It does n’t lower costs , and it does n’t cover everyone .
It forces people to buy defective , unaffordable insurance .
And when you lose your job in Massachusetts , you still lose your health insurance .
AS : Beyond the idea of mandates , the Democrats have also floated the so - called public option .
What do you make this idea ?
AC : Let ’s look back to the early 1960s .
When Medicare was gaining momentum and needed to be enacted by Congress , its opponents put forward a proposal intended to be friendly to the health insurance industry .
The idea was that seniors should be able to purchase health insurance from private companies , but also have the choice of a public insurance option .
Medicare passed instead , thank goodness .
It seems fair to ask whether today we should support a proposal that was objectionable over 45 years ago .
The idea of the public option was again put forward in 2007 , in a briefing paper by Professor Jacob Hacker .
He envisioned a very large public program , enrolling all of the uninsured and anyone else who voluntarily wanted to purchase health insurance from a public insurer .
The public insurance company , in turn , would have the market share , the clout and the low overhead to compete against private health insurance companies .
Many good - hearted people have latched onto this proposal today because they think that the private health insurance industry is simply too powerful to conquer .
These people are n’t against single - payer .
They simply lack confidence that we can achieve a Medicare - for - all single - payer system in one step .
They ’re looking for an incremental route .
In PNHP , some of us like to say , “ You ca n’t jump a chasm in two leaps . ”
In the insurance marketplace , the winning company keeps the healthy and wealthy customers and avoids or jettisons the sick and the poor .
Would a public option really be able to compete ?
Would n’t it simply end up with the sick patients , whose care is costly , and flounder ?
Would n’t it more likely lead to greater disparities , an official two - tiered system ?
Is there anyone who really believes that the heavily monopolized U.S. insurance market would even reform–let alone abolish–itself simply because people were given the choice of a public plan ?
Even so , what seems surprising so far is that we have n’t seen much of a specific proposal for what this public option would look like .
We hear the words “ public option , ” but the details about how it would be launched and funded , who would be enrolled , and how it would , in fact , impact the market remain murky .
If you ’re looking for an incremental route , some specific steps might be useful .
Because the Democratic leaders did n’t put forward a specific proposal , the public option really seems like little more than a bargaining chip .
It ’s a feint , not a punch .
The New York Times editorial the day after his September speech advised the president not to surrender the public option–yet .
The advice was to try and trade away the public option for Republican votes .
Meanwhile the public option , as a posture , has lured progressives and liberals to support a reform that is a huge giveaway of taxpayer money to insurance companies .
So the Democratic Party leadership now finds itself in a bit of a pickle .
A significant part of the liberal community finds the public option utterly compelling .
They see in the idea a morally defensible alternative to the insurance industry , whose profits are essentially blood money .
Will the Democratic leaders , even so , abandon the public option ?
We ’ll see .
In Rolling Stone , Matt Taibbi noted that when Nancy Pelosi was asked if progressives might bring down health care reform over the public option , she laughed out loud and said that there ’s no way that progressives would vote against the President , no matter what .
AS : Even if we got the public option , would it deliver the health care reform that we need ?
AC : In the best - case scenario , the public option will not cover everyone , improve quality , redress disparities or guarantee the choice of physicians .
PNHP founders David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler estimate that the maximum cost savings it would offer would be only 9 percent of what single - payer would offer .
It would also add yet another insurance entity to the 1,300 different insurers we have now .
And it wo n’t end the fundamental problem with health care – the profit motive .
That ’s what lies behind the health care crisis in America .
Let ’s be honest –competitive insurance companies successfully shun sick and poor patients , and enroll healthy and wealthy patients instead .
Any entity , including a public option , that enters that marketplace , even with the best intentions , has got to compete for the healthy and wealthy patients to survive .
How can a public option get the insurance market to reform itself ?
It would also require a colossal amount of regulation–active government coercion of the private industry .
Let ’s talk about the political feasibility of getting the government to reform the insurance market in a way that all the companies would share the risks , the burden of the sick and poor , with account books open to the public , so everyone can know what resources are going to the care of patients , and see the fairness of the insurance market reform .
That proposal , in my estimation , would actually require much more political organization–a mightier political force–than we need to win single - payer and go ahead and expand and improve Medicare to include everyone .
It makes more sense to simply ask the insurance industry , which has failed our country so terribly , to step aside .
AS : How would single - payer solve the health care crisis in the U.S. , and how do you respond to those who say it ’s unrealistic to challenge the health insurance industry ?
AC : I think about the dimensions of health reform as a pentad , with five interrelated points .
We need to reign in unaffordable costs , improve the quality of care , lessen disparities , guarantee access and protect the provider - patient relationship .
Any proposal for comprehensive reform has got to get at all of these : costs , quality , disparities , access and choice .
When you see it that way , a single - payer program is the most basic foundation that would have the power to deliver comprehensive reform .
It would liberate tremendous resources , hundreds of billions of dollars annually , that are presently squandered in a vast administrative bureaucracy that exists to extract money from the system .
This bureaucracy drives health care into a dysfunctional frenzy .
Single - payer would not only eliminate that administrative waste but a myriad of perverse monetary incentives .
Under a single - payer system , everyone would have health care–not insurance , but health care .
We would be able to build new hospitals and clinics to meet needs in medically underserved communities .
This would not only guarantee access , but improve quality and lessen disparities .
And this would be also an economic stimulus of gigantic proportions , a very important thing given the current economic crisis .
With everyone in and nobody out , single - payer would guarantee every patient the right to go to any doctor , nurse practitioner or any health care provider they chose .
It would be based upon protecting , not eroding , the privacy of the provider and the patient .
As liberating as single - payer can be , without a true people ’s movement , we ca n’t take on the entrenched power of the insurance industry .
The insurance companies control hundreds of billions of dollars of health spending through a byzantine , bureaucratic apparatus that exists to extract resources , including profits , from the care of sick people .
It has an enormous lobbying apparatus and contributes rivers of money to both Republicans and Democrats .
It ’s a very , very serious foe .
AS : How can the debate be shifted to put single - payer at the center ?
AC : By sticking to the facts .
The right likes to say that single - payer can’t happen because we need to have a uniquely American system .
But if we ’re going to have an evidence - based debate about the best way to provide a uniquely American system of health care , it would be between the Medicare model , which is socialized health insurance , and the Veterans Administration , a socialized health system in which the federal government owns every hospital and clinic , pays the doctors and nurses directly , bargains with the pharmaceutical industry with bulk purchasing as its leverage , and monitors the quality of care , with excellent results .
The practicality of the single - payer proposal ca n’t be refuted .
The idea is gaining momentum .
If we mobilize , it will become unstoppable .
If we ’re creative and if we do n’t back down , we will win this reform .
Remember , Medicare was implemented 45 years ago within one year .
The government enrolled and guaranteed benefits for every single person over 65 in an era before personal computers , with typewriters and carbon paper .
In the 1990s , the Taiwan government studied health reform and concluded that single - payer , modeled on our Medicare system , was the best way to go .
They pushed it through within a few tumultuous months .
And the health finance system in Taiwan has been successful and popular ever since .
AS : What should the strategy of single - payer advocates be in the health care debate this fall ?
AC : Build the grassroots movement !
Look at recent history .
Our emerging movement has overcome all sorts of opposition .
Before he was elected , Obama organized living room discussions on health care .
PNHP heard from across the country that hundreds of these meetings were actually in favor of single - payer .
The Obama campaign ’s report , over 100 pages , managed little more than a mention of single - payer .
It was dismissive .
When the White House had a meeting on health care that did n’t invite any single - payer advocates , activist doctors threatened a picket line unless Oliver Fein , the president of PNHP , was invited .
Within a day , the White House changed course and invited Oliver Fein and John Conyers , who had also been excluded .
Then , the White House held health forums throughout the country , in Michigan and Vermont , Iowa , North Carolina and California .
Single - payer people came out in the hundreds to the meetings .
Max Baucus , the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , declared single - payer off the table early in 2009 .
So when the Senate Finance Committee heard testimony , at two sessions , activists , including doctors and nurses , stood up to demand that single - payer be put on the table .
That civil disobedience galvanized our movement .
Dr. Margaret Flowers was then invited to testify before the Senate Health , Energy , Labor and Pensions Committee .
When the House committees took testimony , single - payer was on the table .
Meanwhile , members of Congress have now heard and heard and heard again from single - payer activists .
This spring , Nancy Pelosi was quoted as saying , “ It ’s single - payer , single - payer , single - payer , everywhere we go . ”
Because of this nascent mass movement , it looks like single - payer will now get to the floor of the House of Representatives this fall for the first time .
New York Rep. Anthony Weiner managed to get Nancy Pelosi to allow a floor vote on HR 676 , the single - payer bill .
In the Energy and Commerce Committee , Weiner and six other representatives proposed an amendment that would substitute the text of HR 3200 with the text of HR 676 , the single - payer bill .
The committee chair , Henry Waxman , interrupted Weiner to say that if he would withdraw the amendment from committee , the speaker would allow a floor debate and vote .
This shows that single - payer really is on the table .
This should give our movement confidence .
AS : What do you think of the Rep. Dennis Kucinich ’s proposed amendment that would allow states to pursue single - payer plans on their own ?
What should single - payer activists say about his state - by - state strategy ?
AC : Dennis Kucinich has proposed an amendment to HR 3200 , the main House health care reform bill , which would allow states to implement state - based single - payer programs .
Because it came through committee–in fact , it passed the House health committee with Republican votes–it wo n’t have a floor vote .
Three committee chairs and the House Speaker will decide whether the Kucinich amendment will be included in the final version of HR 3200 .
The Kucinich amendment is an expression of the great energy to establish state - based single - payer health insurance programs in California , Vermont , Pennsylvania , New York and elsewhere .
Many activists who argue for such a state - by - state strategy point to the precedent in Canada .
There , Saskatchewan was the first province to enact a single - payer health care system , which then spread province by province in Canada .
Yet with 50 different states , it ’s hard to imagine a similar process unfolding in the U.S. when we consider the wide disparities across states–say , Louisiana compared with Minnesota .
It ’s also difficult to imagine how state - based single - payer reform would work practically .
Say that we won state - based single - payer in New York state–how would it affect people from northern New Jersey , southern Connecticut and elsewhere , who use the excellent hospitals in Manhattan ?
If a small state like Vermont passed single - payer , how would the system defend itself against the onslaught of attacks that would inevitably come from the powerful insurance and pharmaceutical industries ?
The Kucinich amendment , in a way , highlights these challenges .
Even so , I ’m completely in favor of fighting for state - based single - payer reform .
It is a legitimate demand and great way to educate .
However , we must not lose sight of our goal–national health insurance .
AS : Given that we are going to have some version of the Obama proposal likely passed what will that mean for the single - payer movement ?
AC : Back in February , in his first appearance before Congress , the president said that health care reform cannot and will not wait another year .
But even if a bill gets passed , the main elements –like the insurance mandate , any kind of public option if it survives and the insurance exchange – wo n’t begin until 2013 .
Meanwhile , we face a system where the experience of seeking care is often a hassle and humiliating , and is sometimes deadly .
This fall , health care activists should explain that we have workable reform within our grasp–single - payer health insurance .
We should use the deliberations that go on in Washington and the points that come out of them to explain why and how single - payer would be better .
In reality , whatever happens in Washington will not change our lives much for the better .
But the election of the president and the call for sweeping reform have raised the nation ’s expectations sky - high that there will be meaningful change .
Under those conditions , I ’m enormously optimistic that we can build the kind of grassroots movement that we need to win single - payer national health insurance .

CDU
Wolfgang Schäuble
Wolfgang Schäuble , Innenminister , " Vor allem die Geheimdienste und das Bundeskriminalamt müssen alles Erdenkliche tun . "
Wo die Grenze sei , wurde er in einem Spiegel - Interview gefragt .
Seine Antwort : Es gibt keine .
" Die rote Linie ist immer die Verfassung , die man allerdings verändern kann . "
Und weiterhin : " Das Grundgesetz würde doch zerbrechen , wenn wir es nicht anpassen würden " ( Siehe PDF des Interviews auf seiner Webpage oder beim BMI )
" Zunehmende Schwierigkeiten habe [ ich ] damit , dass ein Terrorist den gleichen Schutz des Grundgesetzes genießen solle wie jeder Bürger . " ( Quelle : sueddeutsche.de )
Wolfgang Schäuble hat " Zweifel , ob das Verfassungsgericht wirklich entscheiden sollte , für welche Straftaten man welches Instrument gesetzlich vorsehen kann oder nicht " und spricht sich damit öffentlich gegen die in Artikel 20 Grundgesetz festgeschriebene Gewaltenteilung aus ... [ 1 ]
Die " Verunsicherung der jungen Leute " in Bezug auf die in der vergangenen Legislaturperiode geschaffenen Sicherheitsgesetze nannte Schäuble völlig ohne Grund .
Ohne Sicherheit könne es keine Freiheit geben .
Die Grundrechte müssten durch Regeln beschränkt werden , so der Bundesinnenminister .
( Quelle : heise.de )
Es sei aber ein " Prinzip der Demokratie " , dass man sich über die Grundprinzipien des Wahlrechts nicht streite , " sagte Schäuble der Leipziger Volkszeitung .
Der Grünen-Fraktionsgeschäftsführer Volker Beck hielt Schäuble vor , mit seinen Äußerungen der Demokratie zu schaden .
Wer mutwillig daran festhalte , dass ein " verfassungswidriges Wahlrecht in Kraft " bleibe , der diskreditiere die parlamentarische Demokratie , sagte Beck .

NPD
In einem Brief fordern die Rechtsextremen ( als Partei ! ) unter anderem türkischstämmige Bundestagskandidaten ( also deutsche Staatsbürger ! ) dazu auf , das Land zu verlassen .
( Quelle Spiegel Online )
In ihrer Mischung aus Fremdenfeindlichkeit , Homophobie , nationalistischem Gesellschaftsmodell , populistisch - antikapitalistischen Parolen und dem Glauben an autoritäre Führung ist die Programmatik der NPD jener der NSDAP der 1920er – und frühen 1930er - Jahre ähnlich .
Wie diese möchte die Partei nicht nur bestimmte politische Ziele durchsetzen , sondern das heute herrschende System des demokratischen Rechts - und Verfassungsstaates beseitigen , weshalb die NPD als verfassungsfeindlich eingestuft wird .
Entsprechend findet sich im Verfassungsschutzbericht des Landes Baden - Württemberg 1998 ein Ausschnitt aus der Eröffnungsrede des 1 .
Tages des nationalen Widerstandes von Holger Apfel , in welchem er die NPD als einzige organisierte Partei darstellt , „ die das politische System in der BRD bis auf die Wurzel bekämpft , auch die Wurzel abnimmt .
Ja , liebe Freunde , wir sind stolz darauf , dass wir alljährlich in den bundesdeutschen Verfassungsberichten stehen und dort als feindlich , verfassungsfeindlich , gegen dieses System gerichtet genannt sind .
Jawohl , wir sind verfassungsfeindlich .

This is my solution to dealing with large table migrations in MySQL .
This method easily applies to tables managed by ActiveRecord since it maintains created_at and updated_at for you .
The good bits are on GitHub .
Read on for some back story .
For any database - driven application having a well optimized table schema and indexes is crucial for good performance .
Usually this is not a problem in development .
However , once your app goes live and you are dealing with millions upon millions of rows of data , the cost of revising your table schema quickly becomes very large .
With MySQL , an ALTER TABLE statement is extremely expensive .
MySQL is fairly conservative ( or unintelligent ) in how ALTER TABLE works :
Within a table - level write lock , MySQL creates a new table with the revised schema and inserts every row from the original in primary key order ( building the indexes along the way ) .
Sound slow ?
It sure is , as this process is essentially unoptimized .
An ALTER TABLE on a decently sized table can take on the order of hours to complete , and you have no access to it in the meantime .
Although MySQL is n't helping us much , by digging a little deeper it is possible to take matters into our own hands to get the job done .
The key to improving the situation is to take advantage of what we know about our data .
While locking the table during the migration is the most straightforward way to get a consistent copy , if you can determine when a row has been created or updated , you can copy most rows in parallel to normal application traffic , and then within a table lock copy over only the difference before swapping old for new , based on row creation or update info .
Additionally , by copying this difference asynchronously multiple times , you can shrink the size of the difference down to a only a few rows , such that the final lock - copy - swap is almost instantaneous .
Since almost the entirety of the operation happens outside of a table lock , this allows for zero downtime migrations of very large tables .
At this point , the bottleneck is not the copy operation , but determining the changes between the old and new tables between passes .
If you can take advantage of an index on the relevant row timestamp , you 're set .
If not , although the time in the table lock can be minimized with this method , it can not be eliminated .
I recommend adding an index when you can .
Table Migrator is a fairly simple script we wrote at Serious Business that encapsulates this logic in order to make it easier to use .

Dish Network and its sister company EchoStar must cough up an extra $ 200 million to TiVo for continuing to offer DVR functionality in their set - top boxes after being slapped with a court injunction .
The award comes after TiVo successfully argued to a Texas judge in June that EchoStar was in contempt of an order to disable its digital video recording technology that allegedly violates a TiVo patent .
After Echo had lost the original infringement case filed by TiVo in 2004 , the company tried reprogramming its set - top boxes with a workaround for the disputed technology .
But the court ruled that EchoStar 's changes were n't suitably different to avoid the injunction .
TiVo then argued it was entitled to all of EchoStar 's DVR profits made during the period it was in contempt of the injunction - a figure TiVo estimated is at least $ 974.5 m .
EchoStar countered that it had acted in good faith to redesign the set - top boxes and that sanctions are unwarranted in the case .
It said any harm to TiVo would be fully compensated by a jury 's previously decided infringement fine of $ 1.25 per customer per month , for a total of $ 114.8 m extra damages .
On Friday , US District Judge David Folsom said he was unconvinced by either party 's suggested awards : " On the one hand , EchoStar 's suggested $ 1.25 royalty rate is inadequate .
It would merely extend the jury 's royalty over the contempt period , effectively turning this Court 's injunction into a compulsory license , " the judge said .
" On the other hand , TiVo 's suggested disgorgement of nearly $ 1 billion is unreasonable under the circumstances of the case , " he added .
Instead , Folsom decided a rate of $ 2.25 per DVR subscriber per month was appropriate , for an estimated total of $ 192.7 m .
Combined with the original damages , Echo must pay TiVo about $ 390m .
Dish said while it would appeal the ruling , it was pleased the court did n't agree with TiVo 's request for a $ 1bn fine .
EchoStar advertisements ruled ' distasteful '
Judge Folsom also registered his disapproval that Dish Network had begun running an ad campaign touting its DVR service as " better than TiVo " while continuing to violate the TiVo patent .
Folsom called the advertisements " distasteful " in his ruling , but said the company may have genuinely believed in its design - around efforts . ®
If nothing else , for the sake of their photos it should have been the last stop .

Art builds upon art .
All great artists in history build upon the work of their predecessors .
Even if the artist radically changed their field , they still used the existing art around them as a jumping board into something new .
This process is also valuable for photographers .
Growing as a photographer , means seeing the world in new ways .
The work of other photographers can help you with this .
Photographers also grow by learning new techniques .
What better place to start than learning from those that have already mastered these techniques ?
Here are three ways you can learn from the work of others , followed by a list of 25 great photographers to emulate .
Three Steps to Learn from the Work of Other Photographers
1. Study
Pay close attention to the individual photos of a photographer .
Note the things you like , as well as the things you do n’t like .
Figure out the composition choices they ’ve made .
What would be the effect of a different composition ?
Study the lighting .
What kind of light is used ( soft , harsh , natural , artificial , etc. ) ?
From what direction is the main light source coming from ?
Were there secondary light sources ?
Did they use a flash ?
Is the photo shot with a specific technique ?
Can you detect any evidence of post - processing ?
You are basically reverse engineering the photo , so you can continue on to step 2 .
2. Copy
Imitating another artist is a very effective way of learning .
The Helpful Art Teacher has great examples of famous artists imitating other artists .
After studying the work of a photographer , you should have an idea how they created a photo or a certain effect .
Now is the time to put that idea to the test .
By trying to copy someone ’s photo , you will learn more about the decisions that photographer made .
It will also train you to pay even closer attention to the differences between your copy and the original .
Do n’t be discouraged if you ca n’t replicate the original photo exactly .
Just by trying to copy a photo , you will improve your own photography skills .
3. Transform
In this final step , you take the original photo and transform it using your own creative judgement .
For example , you could parody , dramatize , or even photoshop the original picture .
If there was something about the original work you did n’t like , try to improve that .
You could also apply the same technique , idea , composition , etc. to a different context .
In short , it ’s up to you .
View this process as a conversation with the photographers that came before you .
It ’s now the time to carve out a space for your own unique voice .

The Mushroom Tunnel of Mittagong [ Image : Shiitake logs on racks in the Mittagong mushroom tunnel .
All photos by the author ] .
Note :
This is a guest post by Nicola Twilley .
As Geoff mentioned here on
[ Image : The mushroom tunnel , on the left , was originally built in 1886 to house a single - track railway line .
By 1919 , it had to be replaced with the still - functioning double - track tunnel to its right , built to cope with the rise in traffic on the route following the founding of Canberra , Australia 's purpose - built capital city .
The tunnel is still state property : the mushroom farm exists on a five - year lease ] .
The idea of re-purposing abandoned civic infrastructure as a site for myco-agriculture was intriguing , to say the least , so we were thrilled when Dr. Arrold kindly agreed to take the time to give us a tour ( Li-Sun is not usually open to the public ) .
Dr. Arrold has been growing mushrooms in the Mittagong tunnel for more than twenty years , starting with ordinary soil - based white button mushrooms and Wood -ear ,
[ Images : ( top ) Dr. Arrold with a bag of mushroom spawn .
He keeps his mushroom cultures in test - tubes filled with boiled potato and agar , and initially incubates the spawn on rye or wheat grains in clear plastic bags sealed with sponge anti-mould filters before transferring it to jars , black bin bags , or plastic - wrapped logs ; ( middle ) Shimeji and ( bottom ) pink oyster mushrooms cropping on racks inside the tunnel .
Dr. Arrold came up with the simple but clever idea of growing mushrooms in black bin bags with holes cut in them .
Previously , mushrooms were typically grown inside clear plastic bags .
The equal exposure to light meant that the mushrooms fruited all over , which made it harder to harvest without missing some ] .
A microbiologist by training , Dr. Arrold originally imported his exotic mushroom cultures into Australia from their traditional homes in China , Japan , and Korea .
Like a latter - day
He showed us a recent acquisition , which he hunted down after coming across it in his dinner in a café in
Since there is currently only
[ Images : ( top ) Logs on racks ( Taiwanese style ) and mounted on the wall ( Chinese style ) in the tunnel ; ( bottom ) Wood - ear mushrooms grow through diagonal slashes in plastic bags filled with chopped wheat straw ] .
The tunnel for which these mushrooms have been so carefully developed is 650 metres long and about 30 metres deep .
Buried under solid rock and deprived of the New South Wales sunshine , the temperature holds at a steady 15 º Celsius .
The fluorescent lights flick on at 5:30 a.m. every day , switching off again exactly 12 hours later .
The humidity level fluctuates seasonally , and would reach an unacceptable aridity in the winter if Dr. Arrold did n't wet the floors and run a fogger during the coldest months .
In all other respects , the tunnel is an unnaturally accurate concrete and brick approximation of the prevailing conditions in the mushroom - friendly deep valleys and foggy forests of

If you could perhaps combine this kind of atmosphere - modifying architecture with today 's omnipresent
[ Images : ( top ) Li-Sun employees unwrap mushroom logs before putting them on racks in the tunnel .
The logs are made by mixing steamed bran or wheat , sawdust from thirty - year - old eucalyptus , and lime in a concrete mixer , packing it into plastic cylinders , and inoculating them with spawn .

Once their mushrooms are harvested , the logs make great firewood .

The Shiitake log shock tank – Dr. Arrold explained that the logs crop after one week in the tunnel , and then sit dormant for three weeks , until they are " woken up " with a quick soak in a tub of water , after which they are productive for three or four more weeks .
" Shiitake , " said Dr. Arrold , in a resigned tone , " are the most trouble – and the biggest market . " ]
Outside of the tunnel , Dr. Arrold also grows

Chestnut mushrooms grow in jars for seven weeks : four to fruit , and three more to sprout to harvest size above the jar 's rim .

Thousands of mushroom jars are stacked from floor to ceiling .

( fourth ) Empty mushroom jars are sterilised in the autoclave between crops , so that disease does n't build up .

The fact that the King Brown and Chestnut mushrooms only thrive at a higher temperature than the railway tunnel provides makes their cultivation much more expensive .
Their ecosystem has to be replicated mechanically , rather than occuring spontaneously within disused infrastructure .
I could n't help but wonder whether there might be another tunnel , cave , or even abandoned bunker in New South Wales that currently maintains a steady 17 º
Celsius and is just waiting to be colonised by King Brown mushrooms growing , like ghostly thumbs , out of thousands of glass jars .

Most are far too hot for mushroom growing ( not to mention commuter comfort ) .
Nonetheless , perhaps the

Service shafts along the hot Central line might be perfect for growing Chestnut Mushrooms , while the marginally cooler Bakerloo line has several abandoned tunnels that could replicate the subtropical forest habitat of the Oyster Mushroom .
And – unlike Dr. Arrold 's Li-Sun mushrooms , which make no mention of their railway tunnel origins on the packaging – I would hope that Transport for London would cater to the locavore trend by labeling its varietals by their line of origin .
[ Images : Shiitake logs on racks in the Mittagong mushroom tunnel ] .
Speculation aside , our visit to the Mittagong Mushroom Tunnel was fascinating , and Dr. Arrold 's patience in answering our endless questions was much appreciated .
If you 're in Australia , it 's well worth seeking out Li-Sun mushrooms : you can find them at
[ Image : Nicola Twilley is the author of Edible Geography , where this post has been simultaneously published ] .
As Geoff mentioned here on BLDGBLOG a few weeks ago , we spent our last full day in Australia touring the Li-Sun Exotic Mushroom Farm with its founder and owner , Dr. Noel Arrold .
Three weeks earlier , at a Sydney farmers ' market , we had been buying handfuls of his delicious Shimeji and Chestnut mushrooms to make a risotto , when the vendor told us that they 'd all been grown in a disused railway tunnel southwest of the city , in Mittagong .
The idea of re-purposing abandoned civic infrastructure as a site for myco-agriculture was intriguing , to say the least , so we were thrilled when Dr. Arrold kindly agreed to take the time to give us a tour ( Li-Sun is not usually open to the public ) .
Dr. Arrold has been growing mushrooms in the Mittagong tunnel for more than twenty years , starting with ordinary soil - based white button mushrooms and Cremini , before switching to focus on higher maintenance ( and more profitable ) exotics such as Shimeji Shiitake , and Oyster mushrooms .
A microbiologist by training , Dr. Arrold originally imported his exotic mushroom cultures into Australia from their traditional homes in China , Japan , and Korea .
Like a latter - day Tradescant , he regularly travels abroad to keep up with mushroom growing techniques , share his own innovations ( such as the black plastic grow - bags shown above ) , and collect new strains .
He showed us a recent acquisition , which he hunted down after coming across it in his dinner in a café in Fuzhou , and which he is currently trialling as a potential candidate for cultivation in the tunnel .
Even though all his mushroom strains were originally imported from overseas ( disappointingly , given its ecological uniqueness , Australia has no exciting mushroom types of its own ) , Dr. Arrold has refined each variety over generations to suit the conditions in this particular tunnel .
Since there is currently only one other disused railway tunnel used for mushroom growing in the whole of Australia , his mushrooms have evolved to fit an extremely specialised environmental niche : they are species designed for architecture .
The tunnel for which these mushrooms have been so carefully developed is 650 metres long and about 30 metres deep .
Buried under solid rock and deprived of the New South Wales sunshine , the temperature holds at a steady 15 º Celsius .
The fluorescent lights flick on at 5:30 a.m. every day , switching off again exactly 12 hours later .
The humidity level fluctuates seasonally , and would reach an unacceptable aridity in the winter if Dr. Arrold did n't wet the floors and run a fogger during the coldest months .
In all other respects , the tunnel is an unnaturally accurate concrete and brick approximation of the prevailing conditions in the mushroom - friendly deep valleys and foggy forests of Fujian province .
This inadvertent industrial replicant ecosystem made me think of Swiss architecture firm Fabric 's 2008 proposal for a " Tower of Atmospheric Relations " ( pdf ) .
Fabric 's ingenious project is designed to generate a varying set of artificial climates ( such as the muggy heat of the Indian monsoon , or the crisp air of a New England autumn day ) entirely through the movements of the air that is trapped inside the tower 's architecture ( i.e. by means of convection , condensation , thermal inertia , and so on ) .
If you could perhaps combine this kind of atmosphere - modifying architecture with today 's omnipresent vertical farm proposals , northern city dwellers could simultaneously avoid food miles and continue to enjoy bananas .
Outside of the tunnel , Dr. Arrold also grows Enoki King Brown , and Chestnut mushrooms .
These varieties prefer different temperatures ( 6 º , 17 º , and 18 º Celsius respectively ) , so they are housed in climate - controlled Portakabins .
The fact that the King Brown and Chestnut mushrooms only thrive at a higher temperature than the railway tunnel provides makes their cultivation much more expensive .
Their ecosystem has to be replicated mechanically , rather than occuring spontaneously within disused infrastructure .
I could n't help but wonder whether there might be another tunnel , cave , or even abandoned bunker in New South Wales that currently maintains a steady 17 º

In the UK , for instance , Transport for London has kindly provided this fascinating map of summertime temperatures on various tube lines .
Most are far too hot for mushroom growing ( not to mention commuter comfort ) .
Nonetheless , perhaps the estimated £ 1.56 billion cost of installing air - conditioning on the surface lines could be partially recouped by putting some of the system 's many abandoned service tunnels and shafts to use cultivating exotic fungi .
These mushroom farms would be buried deep under the surface of the city , colonizing abandoned infrastructural hollows and attracting foodies and tourists alike .
Service shafts along the hot Central line might be perfect for growing Chestnut Mushrooms , while the marginally cooler Bakerloo line has several abandoned tunnels that could replicate the subtropical forest habitat of the Oyster Mushroom .
And – unlike Dr. Arrold 's Li-Sun mushrooms , which make no mention of their railway tunnel origins on the packaging – I would hope that Transport for London would cater to the locavore trend by labeling its varietals by their line of origin .
Speculation aside , our visit to the Mittagong Mushroom Tunnel was fascinating , and Dr. Arrold 's patience in answering our endless questions was much appreciated .
If you 're in Australia , it 's well worth seeking out Li-Sun mushrooms : you can find them at several Sydney markets , as well as branches of Woolworths .

A Jordanian national was arrested Thursday and charged with attempting to bomb a Dallas skyscraper , the FBI said .
Hosam Maher Husein Smadi , 19 , will make his first appearance in U.S. District Court before Magistrate Judge Irma C. Ramirez on Friday morning .
Smadi was arrested near Fountain Place , a 60 - story glass office tower in downtown Dallas .
He is accused of placing an inactive bomb in the building 's parking garage , investigators said .
The FBI said Smadi believed the device , which was provided by an undercover agent , was a car bomb .
Smadi is accused of targeting the Wells Fargo Bank offices in Fountain Place , which is located at 1445 Ross Avenue , according to an arrest affidavit .
Investigators said Smadi was in the country illegally and lived and worked in Italy , Texas , which is about 45 miles south of Dallas .
The FBI said it believes it has a strong case against Smadi , but officials said the level of concern about him as a terrorist was relatively low .
Federal officials said the case has no connection with the major terrorism investigation under way in Colorado and New York or the Thursday arrest of a man facing similar charges in Springfield , Ill .
FBI Had Smadi Under Constant Surveillance
Smadi had been the focus of an undercover FBI investigation and was under continuous surveillance since undercover agents said they discovered him in an online group of extremists .
Undercover FBI agents made more than 60 communications with Smadi since early March .
During those interactions , Smadi made clear his intentions of acting as a solider for Osama bin Laden and al Quaida in conducting a violent jihad , according to an arrest affidavit .
Smadi initially wanted to target Dallas / Fort Worth International Airport , according to the arrest affidavit .
On July 16 , he contacted one of the undercover FBI agents and said he changed his mind about the target , according to the document .
Smadi allegedly decided the aiport was not a viable target because the security was too strong .
Smadi then allegedly told the undercover agent he wanted to target a larger building containing the bank .
" Let us make it the big fish instead of the smaller fish ; they are all fish in one sea -- the main bank for the city and not the branch that we had identified .
God willing , the strike will be certain and strong .
It will shake the currently weak economy in the state and the American nation because the bank is one of the largest banks in the city .
... The bank 's exterior is made of glass .
The bank has billions of dollars .
Let 's say that the bank has collapsed and they took the money out .
The losses will be excessive in credit card information .
Millions of people would incur losses : unemployment , poverty , hunger , and a strike to the head of the government .
Do n't forget the psychological impacts for the loss of this beautiful building ...
Of course , our joy will be in the success of this operation . "
On June 24 , while meeting with an undercover FBI agent at a Dallas hotel , Smadi allegedly stated he had a new idea to target the buildings belonging to the biggest credit card companies , such as American Express or Visa .
Smadi said credit cards drive America , and that he desired to attack one of the main locations where the building accommodates the management and administration , according to the arrest affidavit .
Smadi allegedly addressed the topic of security at the buildings by giving this example :
" We will have a clever idea ..
I have a car .. this car will be the bomb ... but there will be a routine before this car ...
I would have entered the building prior ... to see how the security is , how they search ... what type of security .. so if a bomb is planted , for instance , in the car , timed or to detonate remotely ... a very fast operation , smart , and decisive . "
Investigators Provide Smadi With Fake Bomb
On July 21 , an undercover agent traveled to Italy , Texas , to pick up Smadi , who directed him to drive to a Wells Fargo bank at the Fountain Place office building located in downtown Dallas , according to the arrest affidavit .
Smadi allegedly conducted reconnaissance of the building and told the undercover agent he had located a bathroom on the basement level that would be a good location to " plant a bomb . "
Smadi told the agent the bathroom had a locking door and a drop ceiling that could be accessed by standing on the toilet seat , according to the arrest affidavit .
On Aug. 26 , Smadi discussed the expectations of the explosion with an undercover agent , the arrest affidavit said .
" I will plant it in the ... foundations ... exactly under the building ... when it explodes , it will shake the foundations so that the building , if it is heavy in weight , tons , all that will come down , " he allegedly told the agent .
Smadi allegedly showed the undercover agent what he described as building plans and stated , " What I discovered was that this building , my dear sir , is the same building as Sept. 11 in New York ...
That it is a trade building . "
Smadi allegedly said he would have preferred to do the attack on " 11 September " but decided to wait until after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan .
At the conclusion of the meeting , it was decided that a vehicle - born , improvised - explosive device would be used , according to the arrest affidavit .
Federal agents built a device that was designed not to explode and put it in a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac .
Undercover Agent Was With Smadi When He Tried to Blow Up Building
On Thursday , Smadi allegedly drove to Dallas to meet the undercover agent and got into the Ford Explorer that contained what he believed was a weapon of mass destruction , according to the arrest affidavit .
He is accused of then driving through downtown Dallas , entering the parking garage under Fountain Place building and then parking the vehicle .
Smadi attempted to ignite and detonate the explosive device by setting the device 's timer and flipping the power switch on the explosive device before leaving the garage on foot , the arrest affidavit said .
Smadi then allegedly walked over to the undercover officer and got into another vehicle .
They drove several blocks away so that Smadi could remotely detonate the bomb via cell phone , the affidavit said .
The agent offered Smadi earplugs , but he declined , indicating he wanted to hear the blast , according to the affidavit said .
The affidavit said Smadi then dialed the cell phone , believing it would detonate the bomb .
The phone number Smadi dialed rang to the phone of law enforcement officials , and he was arrested by the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force and other assisting law enforcement officers .
Smadi will make his first appearance in U.S. District Court before Magistrate Judge Irma C. Ramirez on Friday morning .
" The identification and apprehension of this defendant , who was acting alone , is a sobering reminder that there are people among us who want to do us grave harm , ” said U.S. Attorney James T. Jacks .
Dallas Mayor Tom Leppert thanked the FBI in a statement released Thursday night .
“ We are extremely grateful for the vigilance of the FBI , " he said .
" We have a strong working relationship with FBI officials , and they have kept us informed of their investigation .
Thanks to their efforts , no one was ever in any danger . ”
Danny Deffenbaugh , a retired FBI agent who supervised the bureau 's Dallas office during the Sept. 11 terrorist attack in New York said federal officials headed of what could have been a serious terrorist threat to Dallas .
" They obviously thwarted a terrorist event , because he wanted to make sure that bomb was going to go off , " Deffenbaugh said .

UPDATE : Here ’s some video showing Fox News giving stage directions to Tea Party protesters so they would look good for the cameras during the 912 event in DC .
As Jed Lewison says :
Although this video provides a clear - cut example of Fox propaganda in action , the only thing truly shocking about it is that it wo n’t wake up real journalists to the fact that just about every single thing you see on Fox is manufactured .
They are an infotainment channel for conservatives , not a real media outlet .
UPDATE 2 : Rick Sanchez going after
Fox for manufacturing news :
Lara and Lucy are emperor tamarin twins born at the Denver Zoo on July 9 .
Their father died before they were born , and their mother died July 20 of cancer .
So zookeepers and veterinary staffers are stepping in to make sure the girls get the care they need in the nursery .
“ It was such a shock to lose Yana ( their mother ) , as she did not show signs of illness .
She was a wonderful mother and we are trying to fill her role in every way , providing the best care and nutrition for these twins , ” curator of primates and carnivores Beth Jo Schoeberl said in a news release .
“ So far , they are doing great and we are pleased with their progress . ”
Zoo visitors can see the twins being fed daily at 10:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m .
The twins are fed from a syringe with a nipple .
They also get some chilled vegetables to chew on while they are teething .
So far , “ feedings have gone well and the tamarins continue to gain weight , ” the zoo release said .
According to zookeepers , the twins ’ older brother , Paddy , has been very attentive to the newborns , as well .
Zoo staffers are doing their best to fill the functions of a mother monkey .
They created a “ baby bouncer ” device to “ encourage the twins to hang on to a moving replica of mom , ” the release said .
The baby monkeys need this for muscle strength and coordination .
In the forests of Central America , the emperor tamarins forage the trees and forest floor for a variety of insects , fruit and nectar .
Many other species of the tamarin can be found in Central America .
The monkeys typically live in family groups of three to eight individuals , with the burden of raising the young shared by all the adults .
I hope that President Obama , the members of Congress , and the rest of us will
all consider going meatless one day of the week .
Pie - in - the - sky thinking ?
Maybe , but I hope not .
We only have one earth and we should try to do whatever
it takes to save it .
Heather Moore has written yet another very worthwhile article on Care2
called " Are Meatless Mondays Going Global ?
I think the best way I can condense
her article is by asking some thought - provoking questions for which - in my
opinion , she has very good answers .
1 . Did you know that going vegetarian for at least once a week is becoming
the " green " thing to do in some countries ?
Israel began promoting Vegetarian
Monday in their upscale restaurants .
Paul McCartney is spreading the message
in Britain and Australia and just recently the city of Ghent , Belgium urged its
citizens to eat vegetarian on Thursdays .
Way to go !
2 . Did you know that not surprisingly - we in the US are lagging behind in
adopting this concept ?
However , kudos to Johns Hopkins School of Public Health
which is sponsoring Meatless Mondays to help Americans eat healthier .
This
will also help the environment and animals as well .
The less meat we eat - the
less green house methane gas expulsed into the air .
Also fewer animals will
need to suffer as a result of our intensive CAFO farming and slaughtering methods .
We can also help to halt water pollution as well .
3 . Did you know that if meat - eating patterns do n't change - the world wide per
capita meat consumption is expected to rise by 14 per cent in 2030 .
And when
you factor in population growth - the rise equates to an increase of about 53
percent in global net consumption .
Not at all what we need to lesson the continued
threat of global warming from the significant amounts of methane production by
the animals .
4 . Did you know that '" The Live Earth Global Warming Survival Handbook " states
that " refusing meat " is the " single most effective thing you can do to reduce your
carbon footprint ? "
But I have to interject here - how many of us truly care ?
How
many people even bother to read enlightening posts such as the one by Heather
Moore and others of her ilk ?
I do n't think even President Obama has given this
much thought either .
How to get to him ?
What about his cabinet ?
What about
Congress ?
I think they pretty much are daily meat eaters with the one exception
that I know - my own congressman - Dennis Kucinich who is a vegan .
Does
anyone know of any other exceptions ?
If our leaders do n't feel the need to curb
global warming by eating less meat - what kind of example are they showing to us
their constituents ?
Ms. Moore suggests we do n't wait for any politician to
designate a vegetarian day and that we should pick one ourselves .
She even thinks
that once we mastered one day a week - we may " graduate " to two and so on .
What an optimistic thinker !
God bless her .
5 . Did you know that Care2 has a site where you can sign '' our vegetarian for a
month " petition ?
You'd be surprise - sometimes just such a signing may start
you on a course of hopefully no return to the over - eating meat habit .
And Heather
even steers us to a place for recipes and product suggestions : www.VegCooking.com.
And lastly , I have to reply to a comment which asked - How is this a new concept ?
The writer says " that the Catholic Church has suported meatless days as long as
I have been alive .
They are certainly global and have lots of followers .
I believe
1.3 billion Catholics was the last count . "
Well , whoever wrote that comment must have been born after 1966 when the Pope
at that time took away the obligation of 52 MEATLESS FRIDAYS each year for
Catholics .
What an impact that would have made if that Pope had not lifted the
meatless Friday ban .
Goes to show you Popes do n't always make wise decisions .
The 7 meatless Fridays during Lent we now observe are hardly comparable to the
impact of the the 52 meatles Fridays of the past .
If we had been observing meatless
Fridays - can you imagine how many animal lives would have been spared ?
Can
you imagine how much less methane green gas would have been expelled into the
air since then ?
Since I 'm a vegan , I do n't have to pick a day - but if I did - I would choose Friday
again as remembering the day Jesus died on the cross .
The technology is due to bring re-recordable CD devices to the market in the early months of 1997 at prices below $ 1,000 , and should begin being built into top - end computers next year .
The new format will enable users to store 450 times as much data , including video and audio recordings , as a 3.5 inch floppy diskette and is designed to be compatible with new CD - ROM readers and upcoming DVD - ROM drives .
" ReWritable removes the single biggest barrier to greater market acceptance of CD writing technology , " said Dave Deane , Future CD Writer Product Manager at Hewlett - Packard 's Colorado Memory Systems division in Loveland , Co .
Hewlett - Packard , Mitsubishi Chemical and Ricoh are the other companies unveiling the new technology , which has been 18 months in the works .
Analysts said the CD - ROM technology could eventually pressure other storage companies like Iomega , whose revenues have soared on the popularity of its 100 megabyte Zip drives and other storage products , and struggling removable hard drive maker SyQuest Technology .
" I think this would put some pressure on SyQuest type products , " said Ray Freeman , president of Freeman Associates , a Santa Barbara market research firm .
" This is a higher - capacity product , so it 's not going head - to - head , " he said , noting that Compact Disks store up to 650 megabytes of data , a larger capacity than Iomega and SyQuest offer on their lower - end consumer - oriented models .
Because the new technology standard is designed to work with common CD - ROM readers and the new DVD - ROM technology , Freeman said its introduction was " an important step in a continuum , " following CD - Recordable , a technology on the market since 1991 that allows once - only recording .
Freeman projects the CD - Recordable market will hit 1.3 million units this year , and the combined CD - Recordable and CD - ReWriteable market will more than double to 2.9 million units in 1997 and , combined with DVD systems , grow to 10.65 million in 2000 .
Rob van Eijk , director of strategic marketing at Philips Laser Optics North America , in San Jose , Calif. , said the new CD technology is aimed more at the space occupied by 100 million CD - ROMs than the floppy disk space .
The small office home office market and the high end home or small office markets are viewed as key markets for the technology as well , he added , saying the compatibility with other media made it a versatile technology .
Both Philips and Hewlett - Packard expect to offer devices in the first quarter of 1997 that would be under the $ 1,000 price point , but at a sizable premium to the CD - Recordable write - once equipment now selling for as low as $ 499 .
Hewlett - Packard 's
Deane said his company had reached the conclusion that without the new CD - ReWritable technology , " the potential market would top out at a fairly low number . "
I ’m for the kids .
It ’s crazy not to be .
Are you , dear reader , mighty Atlas , going to hold the world in place and keep it from changing into something new ?
One lesson of all hitherto existing human history is that the kids have the advantage in the long run .
This is a function of time and finitude .
The only real wisdom comes in realizing that the kids of today will get their comeuppance with the swift passing of a decade or so .
They , too , will wake up one day to find themselves representatives of what was , instead of what shall be .
The kids keep on coming .
We learned recently ( from a New York Times article by Jennifer Schuessler ) that Holden Caulfield , the anti-hero of J.D. Salinger ’s The Catcher in the Rye , has lost his appeal among the teenage crowd .
This came without fair warning .
No pimply representative of the Millennials stepped forward to cushion the blow .
Instead , we are informed by Barbara Feinberg — “ who has observed numerous class discussions of ‘ Catcher ' ” — that a 15 - year - old boy from Long Island has said , “ Oh , we all hated Holden in my class .
We just wanted to tell him , ‘ Shut up and take your Prozac . ’ ”
It is easy to respond defensively and with contempt .
People do n’t like to have their heroes snubbed , especially when the snubbing comes from some little punk from Long Island whose fingers are surely rubbed raw from constant tweeting , texting , gaming , and masturbation .
We ( shall we define ‘ we ’ as that part of the population over 30 ? ) find subtle ways to undercut the legions of cheeky hormone machines .
Trying to explain the sudden disdain for Mr. Caulfield , a cultural critic by the name of Mr. Dickstein says ,
The skepticism , the belief in the purity of the soul against the tawdry , trashy culture plays very well in the counterculture and post - counterculture generation .
[ Today ] , I would n’t say we have a more gullible youth culture , but it may be more of a joining or togetherness culture .
Indeed , Mr. Dickstein would never say that we have a more gullible youth culture now than in his time , except that he just did .
Such are the sneaky tactics of the older generations in the face of youthful boldness .
I , for one , did identify with Holden Caulfield .
My father gave me The Catcher in the Rye in my early teenage years with a wink and a nudge and that was all I needed .
The first sentence made me happy :
If you really want to hear about it , the first thing you ’ll probably want to know is where I was born , and what my lousy childhood was like , and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me , and all that David Copperfield kind of crap , but I do n’t feel like going into it , if you want to know the truth .
I did want to know the truth , and I was pretty sure that this kid Holden had a handle on it .
Not just because of what he was saying , but how he said it .
That rambling first sentence takes its time .
It ’s a wind - up .
The phrase “ all that David Copperfield kind of crap ” kicks in at just the right moment .
There is real anger there , with the perfect dose of passive - aggressive bratiness .
Plus , it doubles as a literary manifesto .
This book ai n’t gonna be the high language of the 19th - century novel or literary modernism either .
Holden will speak like Holden and that is that .
But I outpace myself .
The fact is I ’m willing to throw Holden under the bus .
I refuse to accept the idea that Holden Caulfield represents the only authentic model of youthful revolt .
I ’m reminded , in this , of something that Alfred Kazin wrote about Salinger in the early ’ 70s .
Salinger has a genius for capturing the emotional giveaway .
Love is isolating .
The fact that his love necessitates so much disdain shows how much social comedy springs from coldness toward the world . …
The whole scheme of values in Salinger ’s fiction is to give the highest marks to the individual made exceptional by a sensitivity to society that is fear of it .
In other words , “ alienation . ”
It ’s a deep question when you come to think of it .
Is alienation an essential , structural part of being a teenager ?
And if so , is that moment of disjunction , the realization that all is not as it seems , the central experience by which , forever after , we will measure the distance between real and fake , truth and lies ?
The central adjective of The Catcher in the Rye is “ phony . ”
The central question in J.D. Salinger ’s all - encompassing metaphysics is whether something or someone is phony or not .
The key emotion is distance and distrust .
I ’ll go ahead and speculate that alienation is , in fact , a reasonably universal feeling .
It also tends to reach a heightened state in the transition from being a child to being an adult .
A sampling of literature across time and culture will confirm the general point .
But there are degrees .
The generations that make up the 20th century made a cult icon of the alienated individual .
From the High Modernists to the Baby Boomers to the Slackers it was Holden Caulfield ad infinitum .
Authenticity was marked by a “ coldness toward the world . ”
Truth was possible only in an attitude toward society that “ is fear of it . ”
The new generation , the one that brushes Holden aside , is not as afraid of society as we have been .
This has its advantages and disadvantages .
But to dismiss it as mere complacency or the new face of stupidity would be a mistake .
In a funny way , it puts Robert Burns ’ poem “ Coming Through the Rye ” right again .
Holden quotes Burns as “ if a body catch a body comin ’ through the rye . ”
Thousands of little kids and nobody ’s around — nobody big , I mean — except me .
And I ’m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff .
What I have to do , I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff — I mean , if they ’re running and they do n’t look where they ’re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them .
That ’s all I ’d do all day .
I ’d just be the catcher in the rye and all .
I know it ’s crazy , but that ’s the only thing I ’d really like to be .
I know it ’s crazy .
But the original lines have nothing to do with “ catching . ”
There is no catcher in the rye .
In the Robert Burns poem it is “ meeting ” instead of “ catching . ”
If a body meet a body comin ’ through the rye .
And that meeting leads directly to kissin’ .
That Salinger turned “ meeting ” into “ catching , ” turned basic human interaction into paranoia and fear , is no fault of J.D. Salinger .
Holden Caulfield spoke to three generations because alienation was real .
It still is real .
But not in the same way .
There ’s a twist to the story that we are still trying fully to grasp .
The kids are working on new metaphors .
They have their own archetypes to construct .
If that means saying goodbye to Holden Caulfield then so be it .
I would n’t be at all surprised if he makes his eventual return , resurrected by the kids of the kids somewhere down the line when somebody has had a little too much of the phonies .

I guess I will beat the dead horse of death panels once more .
On " The Week With George Stephanopoulos , " John McCain , the 2008 Republican presidential nominee , had this to say about the Sarah Palin death - panel rumors ( via Steve Benen ) :
MCCAIN : Well , I think that what we are talking about here is do -- are we going to have groups that actually advise people as these decisions are made later in life and …
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That 's not in the bill .
MCCAIN : But -- it 's been taken out , but the way that it was written made it a little bit ambiguous .
" Ambiguous . "
Thus do we witness McCain joining the prestigious Michael Steele school of literary criticism .
You see , a health - care bill is really a lot like Hamlet or The Wasteland .
Interpretations may vary .
Where some scholars find an utterly innocuous and optional expansion of Medicare coverage , others might see a program akin to mandatory government euthanasia .
I have expressed my frustration with this tactic many times before , and I know it is getting tedious .
But , to recap , the tactic is this : ( 1 ) Make a preposterous and false claim about a bill .
( 2 ) Have the claim disproved .
( 3 ) Avoid defending the original claim , but instead observe that the controversy reflects " a legitimate difference of interpretation " about what might happen in the future .
Effective opposition in three easy steps !
And so we have a conundrum : Ignore the tactic , and let the falsehood persist , or engage with the tactic , and play into the false appearance of legitimate debate .
I do not have a good solution .
The best I can do is repeat , with endless tedium , that the bill is not ambiguous and the original claim is still false .
I can further add that people who hide falsehoods behind the smokescreen of an equally false ambiguity are doing a fabulous job of destroying legitimate public discourse .

According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection , the Guiberson Fire in Ventura County , California , was 100 percent contained as of September 27 , 2009 .
The fire had burned 17,500 acres ( approximately 70 square kilometers ) , caused 10 injuries , and destroyed one outbuilding .
The cause of the fire was still under investigation .
The Advanced Land Imager ( ALI ) on NASA ’s Earth Observing - 1 ( EO - 1 ) satellite acquired this false - color image on September 26 , 2009 .
The image uses shortwave infrared light to increase the contrast between burned and unburned land .
Agricultural fields appear fluorescent green .
Natural vegetation not burned by the fire appears greenish tan .
The burn scar appears deep brick red .
The boundary between the burn scar and the neighboring fields suggests that the Guiberson Fire encroached upon agricultural fields , burning irregular borders along what would otherwise have been straight lines .
Irregularly shaped splashes of bright green appear inside the burn scar .

5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth
Here 's why you should be pummeling dolphins instead of adoring them .
Today , you are already aware , is the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks .
Tomorrow , you may or may not be aware , is the date of Glenn Beck ’s 9/12 Project , which the Fox News host will be marking with a live - TV event in Washington , and which he announced in March in an effort to
bring us all back to the place we were on September 12 , 2001 .
The day after America was attacked we were not obsessed with Red States , Blue States , or political parties .
We were united as Americans …
You can make your own judgments about the platform of Nine Principles and Twelve Values that Beck has tied to the anniversary of a heinous mass murder .
But as someone who happened to be in New York City eight years ago today , the implicit premise of the 9 - 12 Project — that those who are n’t on Beck ’s side must have somehow “ forgotten ” 9/11 and its aftermath — ticks me off royally and personally .
I was at home in Brooklyn , holding my six - week - old baby on the couch , when I saw the second plane crash into the World Trade Center on TV .
I watched the smoking pit of the ruins from the roof of my apartment building as bits of memo paper and ash drifted on the winds to my neighborhood .
I was there on 9/11 , and 9/12 , and 9/13 .
You ’ll excuse me if I do n’t feel warm nostalgia for the lingering smell of burnt airplane fuel , and metal , and bodies .
Nor , of course , does Beck .
What he purportedly wants is to bring back our feeling of “ unity . ” I remember that feeling .
After 9/11 , I remember hardcore liberal New Yorkers rallying behind Rudy Giuliani , saying nice things about President Bush when he spoke at the WTC ruins .
I remember thousands of American flags being flown out of apartment and brownstone windows , not as political statements or in the you - better - prove - your - patriotism spirit of flag pins and Freedom Fries , but simply because we felt we Americans were all in this together .
So since March , what has Glenn Beck been doing to re-establish that sense of nonpartisan national brotherhood ?
Calling President Obama a racist , declaring that the government was bringing fascism upon us , asking his fans to dig up dirt on political figures he does n’t like , and predicting civil - war - like uprisings .
Because that ’s how you bring people together .
None of us have a unique claim on the meaning of 9/11 , or 9/12 .
The fact that I was in New York on 9/11 does not make my views about anything that ’s happened since more valid than anyone else ’s .
( If you were in Montana on 9/11 , your views are just as legitimate as mine . )
Millions of us were here , and we drew millions of different lessons from that day .
New York being a Blue city , of course , millions of those people disagree with Glenn Beck .
But that does not mean that those New Yorkers — or Washington D.C. residents — have “ forgotten ” 9/12 , or 9/11 .
Believe me , we damn well wish we could forget .
You want to bring back the feeling of national unity and civility , Glenn Beck ?

口座をお持ちな らＷＥＢ 完結申し込みで最短即日融資
お金を必要としている人にとっては、即日に融資をしてもらいたいものです。ところが、多くの場合は審査までに時間を有し、実際に融資されるまでに日数を要することがあります。そのような悩みを解決してくれるのが、みずほ銀行のカードローンです。
みずほ銀行の口座を持っている方であれば、WEB完結申し込みで最短即日の融資が可能となります。口座を持っていなくても、銀行窓口へ出向き手続きが完了すれば即日融資は可能です。それ以外の方法ですと日数がかかってしまう場合もありますので、前もって口座を準備しておくといざという時に安心です。
みずほ銀行で融資を受ける条件
みずほ銀行カードローンはみずほ銀行の口座をお持ちなら口座開設の時間の手間も省けるため審査にかかる時間を大幅に短くすることが出来、スピーディーな融資を受けることが可能になります。その際に審査にかかる時間を短く出来るように平日の午前中までにインターネットで申込を完了させておくことが重要です。
またみずほ銀行で融資を受ける条件として勤務先への在籍確認や信用情報機関への照会をすぐに出来る状況にすることで、スムーズに手続きが流れていきます。融資を受けるメリットは急にお金が必要な時にも柔軟に対処でき、今後の生活に活かせることです。
カードローン審査と属性スコアリングの内容
返済能力があるということと、安定的な継続収入があるということがカードローンの融資には欠かせないものであり、カードローンの申し込みをすると必ず与信審査として属性スコアリングが行われるようになっております。
消費者金融ではそうした属性スコアリングの結果を基にして、審査の回答を出したり限度額を決めたりします。
現代ではカードローンも融資サービスが一般的になってきておりますので、即日融資に対応できるように、属性スコアリングに関しても自動でスピーディに結果が出せるように工夫されるようになってきております。
過去の借り入れ状況や、返済の遅延などもスコアリングでチェックされる項目となっておりますので、滞納や多重債務などは発生させないようにしていくことも大切なポイントになってきます。
審査時の 「 属性」について
ここではローン審査における属性のことを中心に、触れていきます。
審査において主な判断材料になるのは、
属性
ローンや公共料金等の支払い状況、利用履歴
のこの２つです。
一般的にはこれ ら2つを合わせて、信用情報と呼ばれます。
それでは、ローン審査における「属性」とはですが、利用者に関する情報そのものです。
例えば、年収や職業、勤務先、年齢、家族構成など。
属性は自動的に一定の基準によってスコアリング（点数化）され、審査の判断材料として活用されます。
属性ごとの点数を加算して、その合計点数によって、「貸すか貸さないか」「どのくらいの金額を貸しても大丈夫か」を算出しているのです。
「 属性」として考慮される主な情報は、次のようなものです。
年齢
年齢が20代後半から50代くらいの働き盛りが点数が高い 職業、勤務先、雇用形態
公務員・一部上場企業の正社員は点数が高い。雇用形態は正社員＞契約社員＞派遣社員＞フリーターの順。 勤続年数
勤務先の勤続年数が長いほど点数が高い 年収
年収が高いほど点数が高い 居住年数
居住年数が長いほど点数が高い 居住形態
持ち家＞賃貸＞公営住宅の順。持ち家の場合、本人名義で住宅ローンが完済してると高い。 家族構成
独身よりも既婚の方が点数が高い。同居中の家族がいると点数が高い。 電話
固定電話があると点数が高いが携帯電話の普及で固定電話を持たない人も増えたので昔ほど重要ではない 健康保険の種類 など
で、金融機関によっては、さらに細かい項目が設定されているようですが、基本は上記の項目となります。
みずほ銀行カードローンの審査をする保証会社について
みずほ銀行カードローンの審査を通る上で気をつけなければならないのが、保証会社の存在です。みずほ銀行カードローンの審査をするのは保証会社の「オリエントコーポレーション」です。
実際に申し込みページをクリックすると個人情報の入力の前に「重要事項の確認」として保証会社名が株式会社オリエントコーポレーションであることが確認出来るかと思います。
このオリエントコーポレーションはクレジットカードでおなじみの「オリコ」です。
オリコはみずほ銀行カードローンの審査以外にも地銀のカードローンの審査保証も行ってます。過去1年以内にオリコが審査保証を行う銀行カードローンに落ちた場合は申し込みを踏み止まりましょう。
また直近でオリコ関連のクレジットカード、ローンをご利用中、過去に支払いの延滞・滞納がある場合は審査に通らないと考えた方がいいでしょう。もし心当たりがある方は下記にある保証会社がオリコ以外の銀行カードローンの申し込みを検討しましょう。
在籍確認につい て
在籍確認はオリエントコーポレーションが必ず電話で行います。この電話での在籍確認は避けられません。無収入の専業主婦の方の場合は、自宅もしくは携帯電話に電話が掛かってきます。決して旦那様の職場への連絡はありません。
消費者金融のアイフルやアコムの在籍確認の場合、条件にもよりますが会社名と住所明記されてる健康保険証と直近の給与明細書2か月分と源泉徴収書を用意することで職場への電話での在籍確認を回避する事が可能だったりします。
この点では銀行カードローンの場合は、消費者金融の審査よりも厳しいため電話での在籍確認は徹底してます。
土日の審査に関し て
みずほ銀行カードローンでは土日の審査は行っていません。土日の申し込みは可能ですが、審査回答は早くて翌営業日となります。土日にどうしても現金が必要な場合は他行、または土日対応の消費者金融を利用しましょう。
銀行カードローンなら三菱東京UFJ銀行バンクイックと三井住友銀行カードローンが土日に対応してます。
バンクイックの場合、運転免許証が必須になりますが、WEBから申し込みを行いカードの受取方法で「テレビ窓口」を選びます。あとは直接足を運びカード発行してもらえばその場で現金を手にすることが可能です。受付時間は土・祝日が10時から18時、日曜日が10時から17時となります。
⇒バンクイックの詳細・申し込みはコチラ
三井住友銀行カードローンの場合もバンクイックと同様にWEBから申し込みを行いローン専用カードのお受取方法を「ローン契約機（ACM）でローン専用カードを受取」を選択します。審査後にローン契約機でカードを発行することでATMより借り入れが可能となります。三井住友銀行カードローンはコンビニATM以外にゆうちょ銀行ATMでの利用手数料が時間外も含めて無料です。
⇒三井住友銀行カードローンの詳細・申し込みはコチラ
また消費者金融でもアイフル、プロミスなら土日に対応してます。アイフルの場合はWEBから申し込みを行い、カードを自動契約機の「むじんくん」で受け取ることで対応出来ます。むじんくんは土日祝日8時から22時まで営業してます。
⇒アイフルの詳細・申し込みはコチラ
プロミスも同様 にWEBから申し込み、カードを発行する場合はプロミスATMへ直接足を運び受け取ることで可能です。プロミスATMの営業時間は7：00～24：00です。※ATMにより営業時間、休日が異なります。
プロミスの場合、三井住友銀行またはジャパンネット銀行口座をお持ちの方は「瞬フリ」というサービスを利用することでも可能です。WEBから申し込みを行い、カード発行しないでWEB完結(※対象金融機関は200行以上あります)。瞬フリにて指定の口座に振込依頼をすれば最短10秒で振り込まれます。
ただし三井住友銀行の場合は毎週日曜日21時～翌月曜日7時、ジャパンネット銀行の場合は毎週月曜日0時～7時はサービスが停止されるので注意が必要です。

キャッシュカード兼用型とカードローン専用型について
みずほ銀行カードローンのカードはキャッシュカード兼用型とカードローン専用型があります。
キャッシュカード兼用型 みずほ銀行の普通預金キャッシュカードにカードローン機能を付加したものです。 自動貸越機 能
普通預金を引き出す際に残高が不足した場合、自動的にカードローン口座から借り入れを行い、引き出しができるようにする機能 自動振替サービス カードローン口座への入金時に入金後の残高がプラスとなる場合、プラス残高部分を普通預金口座に自動入金するサービス カードローン専用型 カードローン専用カードを新規に発行。カードローンカード到着後(カードローンの契約手続き完了後、1～2週間程度)利用可能。
まずみずほ銀行カードローンはみずほ銀行普通預金口座がなければ契約できません。
カードローン専用型はみずほ銀行普通預金口座のキャッシュカードとは別にもう一枚カードローン専用カードを発行するということになります。カードを分けたい場合はカードローン専用型にしましょう。
※既にみずほ銀行口座をお持ちでカードを分けたい方はインターネットからの申し込みの場合、「みずほ銀行口座をお持ちでない方はコチラ」から申し込みを行います。「みずほ銀行口座をお持ちの方はコチラ」からの申し込みはキャッシュカード兼用型のみの受付となってますので注意しましょう。
カードローン専用型は基本的にカードが届くまで借り入れが出来ず届くまで1～2週間ほど掛かります。口座をお持ちでない場合は、まずカードローンの審査に通過したら口座が開設される、そこから専用カードが届くのを待つイメージです。
みずほ銀行窓口のみ対応の 「 即時振替サービス 」
ただし口座がなくても窓口でみずほ銀行カードローンと口座開設を同時に申し込みを行う方法だと、キャッシュカード兼用型でもカードローン専用型どちらでもオリコの審査次第で最短で即日融資を受けることも出来ます。(※審査の混雑状況で2~3日掛かることもあります。)
窓 口で同時に申し込みをする場合、審査結果は窓口から電話で連絡してきます。審査に通ったらその場で口座開設されますが、その時点ではカードは発行されず後日郵送で送られてきます。
しかし窓口で 「即時振替サービス」で開設したカードローン口座から返済用普通預金口座へ振替という形で入金してもらえるのでその場で借入が可能となります。この即時振替サービスは店頭でカードローンの口座開設をした場合のみ対応してます。
カードの種類による最短利用方法
以上のことをまとめると、みずほ銀行カードローンを最短で利用する方法は、
口座をお持ちでキャッシュカード兼用型はWEB完結申込、
口座をお持ちでカードローン専用型の場合はWebからだと書類のやり取りで時間が掛かるので窓口、
口座をお持ちでない場合はキャッシュカード兼用型とカードローン専用型の両方とも窓口でカードローンと口座開設の同時申し込みということになります。
口座有キャッシュカード兼用型 WEB 完結申込 口座有カードローン専用型 窓口 口座なしキャッシュカード兼用型 窓口 口座なしカードローン専用型 窓口

銀行系より審査スピード重視なら消費者金融※総量規制対象
Intel 's battle for the ages against the European Commission 's antitrust regulators has a surprising new twist :
Intel is claiming that its human rights were violated .
Yes , you read that correctly .
Human rights .
Intel is claiming that very large fines ( €1,000,000,000 in this case , or $ 1,450,000,000 ) can only be handed down by a criminal court .
And Intel was never actually charged with any criminal wrongdoing .
The allegation that Intel threatened to withhold rebates from customers who also purchased AMD chips has been treated as a civil matter , not a criminal one .
The EU 's antitrust investigations are an administrative process , not a legal one , like in the United States .
Therefore , the European Commission violated the Intel corporation 's human right to due process , or so the argument goes .
This has led to some ridicule .
Intel is a corporation , not a human being , so how can it have human rights ?
Even Forbes described Intel 's defense as " grasping for straws . "
A commenter at Ars Technica worried that " Any corporation that claims personhood for the purpose of asserting human rights opens a very scary Pandora 's Box . "
That line of thought deserves a closer look .
To say that corporations should not have human rights is to deny corporations individual standing under the law .
Without this convenient legal fiction , the global economy as we know it would cease to exist .
Sounds like hyperbole .
It is n't .
Intel , for example , has three million shareholders who collectively own the company .
And those three million faces are constantly changing .
More than fifty million shares of Intel stock change hands in an average day .
Now suppose your company wants to buy some computer chips from Intel .
You could have each shareholder sign the sales contract - good luck finding them all - or you could treat Intel as a person with the right to sign a contract , and the obligation to honor it .
To deal with one person or millions ?
That is why corporations have legal standing as individuals .
What if Intel violates the terms of that sales contract , bankrupting you and your family ?
If Intel does n't have human rights , you can't sue it .
Remember , you can only sue an entity with legal standing .
Have fun tracking down all those shareholders again .
And make sure they 're the ones who held shares during the life of that contract - if you wrongly sue a shareholder for violating something they did n't sign , they can sue you back .
Righting a wrong becomes impossible .
Denying corporations human rights makes corporate abuse more likely , not less .
When payroll comes around every two weeks for Intel 's 83,500 employees , the same problem comes up yet again .
Just give
Intel the right to cut its own checks , then .
Problem solved .
All of these individual trees are part of the same forest of corporate individual rights .
To cut any one tree down weakens the rest .
Cut too many down , and the forest disappears entirely .
And with it , most of our modern economy .
Intel 's human rights defense may sound a little unusual , but all it is doing is applying an uncontroversial , widely established principle in a way that people are n't used to .
Despite its novelty , the tactic has been tried before in Europe .
It 's worked , too , though not yet in an antitrust case .
Article 34 of the European Convention on Human Rights says , plain as day , that " any person , non-governmental organisation or group of individuals " may seek redress of their grievances ( emphasis added ) .
Short of legal gymnastics , courts have to respect that .
In the U.S. , media corporations routinely use human rights in their defense .
The New York Times Co. won two Supreme Court cases by asserting its right to free speech .
Intel 's appeal has one more point in its favor .
It recently came out that antitrust regulators intentionally omitted " exculpatory evidence " from the case .
At least one of Intel 's major customers denied any coercion on Intel 's part .
If that had happened to a person , there would be no controversy .
All defendants , whether human or corporate , have the right to due process .
Berkeley Police question Sigma Pi fraternity members on Friday .
The investigation allegedly revolves around illegal drugs which may have been mailed to the fraternity .
Daily Cal Staff Writer
Police questioned members of a UC Berkeley fraternity Friday morning as part of an investigation into an alleged incident involving illegal drugs .
UCPD and Berkeley police arrived at the Sigma Pi chapter house , located at 2434 Warring Street , at 10:25 a.m. and spoke to several members , said Berkeley police Sgt. Mary Kusmiss in an e-mail .
No arrests were made and police did not issue a search or arrest warrant .
Berkeley police Lt. David Frankel confirmed that the allegations involve illegal drugs , but said he could not elaborate further on the investigation .
Chapter President Neil Bell declined to comment on the specifics of the allegations .
" The fraternity will continue to work closely with the police department and all local authorities to ensure that this matter is properly resolved , " Bell said .
Mark Hanna , the fraternity 's chapter director , said members told him a package containing hallucinogenic mushrooms was recently delivered to the house .
The package , which Hanna said may have been tracked from Oregon by law enforcement officials , was not addressed to any member of the fraternity .
Hanna said he believes the investigation revolves around a former prospective member of the fraternity who did not live at the chapter house .
The fraternity has " terminated any interest in this person , " he said .
Fraternity officials declined to release the individual 's name .
" No one in the house was aware of this drug activity , " Hanna said .
" It 's a bizarre set of circumstances .
No one expected the police to show up . "
The fraternity will continue to support police in the ongoing investigation , he said .
Advanced Micro Devices is introducing an energy - efficient EE version of its six - core " Istanbul " Opteron processor .
AMD is targeting its 40 - watt Opteron chip at two - socket servers for dense computing environments , cloud computing platforms and Web 2.0 applications , Jeff Jenkins , director of server product marketing at AMD , said in an interview .
" They 're looking for price / performance per watt , " Jenkins said .
The introduction of the Istanbul EE processor Aug. 31 comes four months after AMD rolled out the 40 - watt EE version of its quad - core " Shanghai " chip in April , and joins the 75 - and 55 - watt versions of Istanbul already on the market .
AMD and its larger rival , Intel , are aggressively pushing increased performance in their newest chips while driving down power consumption .
Enterprises are driving the demand for greater energy efficiency in their technology , Jenkins said .
" They need to lower the operational costs ... in their data centers , " he said , pointing to the rapidly increasing costs of power and cooling .
Last year , businesses worldwide spent more than $ 30 billion to power and cool their data centers , Jenkins said .
IT administrators expect to spend 27 percent more on power and cooling on servers over the next four years .
The new 40 - watt six - core processors offer 30 percent more performance and 38 percent more performance per watt over than quad - core Opterons , he said .
For AMD , a key difference is that the company is able to keep the key features - such as its high memory speed , cache , AMD - P power management capabilities and AMD - V virtualization technology - found in the higher - wattage models in the EE version , Brent Kirby , senior product marketing manager , said in an interview .
To reach 38 watts in its Xeon L5506 model , Intel needs to reduce its memory speed and bus speed , and remove such features as HyperThreading and Turbo Boost , which dynamically adjusts processor frequency based on demand .
Another key difference is the memory used .
Intel uses the more expensive DDR3 memory , Kirby said .
AMD currently uses DDR2 , arguing that DDR3 is still not mainstream enough and too costly , he said .
Memory is a key need in such environments as cloud computing , and cost is an important factor , Kirby said .
AMD will make the switch to DDR3 next year , when the cost goes down .
Compute power and density also is important to cloud computing environments .
In the same standard rack , businesses using servers powered by the 40 - watt EE model - which is shipping now - can increase the density of a standard 42U rack by 40 percent over those using 75 - watt Opterons while staying within the same power budget .
The new Opterons are part of a larger strategy that AMD will continue to push in 2010 to build offerings around user workloads and platforms - rather than simply rolling out new chips - all the while keeping focused on power envelopes and price / performance per watts , Kirby said .
" It 's more than just throwing processors out there , " he said .
Aug. 12 , 2009 - If you 're getting too little sleep , you may also be getting diabetes .
People at risk of diabetes tend to get too little sleep .
They also tend to exercise too little and eat unhealthy Western diets .
Is poor sleep really a diabetes risk factor ?
Yes , suggests a study by University of Chicago researchers led by Plamen Penev , MD , PhD .
" If confirmed by future larger studies , these results would indicate that a healthy lifestyle should include not only healthy eating habits and adequate amounts of physical activity , but also obtaining a sufficient amount of sleep , " Penev says in a news release .
Five men and six women volunteered for the study .
Their average age was about 40 .
They were a little overweight and did n't exercise much , but were otherwise healthy .
They tended to sleep just under eight hours a day .
During two 14 - day periods , they stayed in a lab where their sleep , activity , diet , and blood chemistry were carefully monitored .
They were n't allowed to exercise , and junk food was always at hand .
For one of the 14 - day periods , they were allowed to sleep for 8.5 hours a day .
During the other period , they were allowed no more than 5.5 hours sleep each day .
Sleep researchers say it 's rare for a person to need less than six hours of sleep daily .
As their sleep times shortened , the volunteers went to bed later ( at half past midnight rather than at 11:15 p.m. ) and got up earlier ( at 6 a.m. rather than 7:45 a.m. ) .
With all the junk food lying around and with so little physical activity , they gained more than 4 pounds of weight regardless of how much they slept .
What was different was their ability to control their blood sugar .
When sleeping too little , the volunteers ' blood sugar was higher on a glucose - tolerance test .
They also became less sensitive to the blood sugar - lowering hormone insulin .
" When the unhealthy aspects of the Westernized lifestyle are combined with reduced sleep duration , this might contribute to the increased risk of many overweight and sedentary individuals developing diabetes , " Penev says .
The study appears in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism .
A bear with a prominent grease spot on his little beige nose spends his days wedged behind the bumper guard of an ironworker 's pickup in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn .
A fuzzy rabbit and a clown , garroted by a bungee cord , slump from the front of a Dodge van in Park Slope .
Stewie , the evil baby from " Family Guy , " scowls from the grille of a Pepperidge Farm delivery truck in Brooklyn Heights , mold occasionally sprouting from his forehead .
All are soldiers in the tattered , scattered army of the stuffed : mostly discarded toys plucked from the trash and given new if punishing lives on the prows of large motor vehicles , their fluffy white guts flapping from burst seams and going gray in the soot - stream of a thousand exhaust pipes .
Grille - mounted stuffed animals form a compelling yet little - studied aspect of the urban streetscape , a traveling gallery of baldly transgressive public art .
The time has come not just to praise them but to ask the big question .
Why ?
That is , why do a small percentage of trucks and vans have filthy plush toys lashed to their fronts , like prisoners at the mast ?
Are they someone 's idea of a joke ?
Parking aids ?
Talismans against summonses ?

Every morning I scour the web to see what 's making news of Irish interest and up popped this picture on the right .
It 's a piece from Cleveland.com about an Irish dancing teacher called Eileen O'Kennedy Dunlap who is teaching American children how to do the intricate steps in a place called Medina .
What 's new about that ?
says you .
Well , it was the picture that grabbed me .
None of the girls are wearing those hideous wigs of ringlets and curls which have infiltrated Irish dancing like noxious weeds .
There .
I 've said it .
I love Irish dancing but I detest the wigs .
I do n't know where they came from but they should all be stuffed into the drawers of history along with legwarmers and jeggings .
I do n't know why this Ohio school has resisted the craze but fair play to them .
Maybe it 's time for a campaign to ban the wigs from Irish dancing ?
Playing With Your Head The Dawning Age of Mind - Reading Machines
Imagine controlling machines , typing text or juggling balls using nothing but the power of thought .
What sounds like far - fetched science fiction is gradually becoming possible , providing hope for disabled patients -- and new gimmicks for the computer gaming industry .
The last time Rodney King was beaten up by the police , Los Angeles experienced appalling race riots in which 53 people were killed , more than 2,000 injured , and a billion dollars - worth of damage caused by the city 's outraged black community .
Seventeen years , a criminal trial and a $ 3 m legal settlement later , King has put himself back in harm 's way , agreeing to go toe - to - toe with a notoriously aggressive cop through the colourful medium of celebrity boxing .
America 's most famous living victim of police brutality last night stepped into a ring with one Simon Aouad , who was thrown out of Philadelphia 's police force because , in his own words , he " could n't follow the rules " .
Their fight , at a hotel near the city 's airport , was broadcast across America on pay - per- view and watched by a live audience paying $ 25 a ticket .
It marked the latest in a series of bizarre money - making projects that have allowed King to emerge as an unlikely star of reality television .
Now 43 , King recently appeared in the cable TV shows , Sober House and Dr Drew 's Celebrity Rehab , undergoing treatment for the alcoholism that led to his original arrest in 1991 .
He now claims to have been " clean " for 14 months .
Aouad , for his part , decided to fight under the nickname " The Renegade " .
The 31 - year - old achieved fame in 2006 when he was thrown out of the police force for following a " shoot first , ask questions later " policy with regard to an intruder on his property .
During interviews to publicise the bout , the heavily tattoed Aouad has repeatedly referred to King 's past , promising : " I 'm going to beat you so bad , Rodney , you 're going to wish you were back in LA .
I broke bones for a living every day . "
The comments refer to the famous 1992 incident , in which King was set upon by four baton - wielding cops after he refused to pull over for a highway patrol officer who suspected him of speeding , drink - driving , and possibly being under the influence of drugs .
Video of the arrest , shot by an onlooker and later sold to TV networks , showed King being Tasered as he lay helplessly on the ground , before the four officers spent almost two minutes kicking , punching and beating him with batons .
He suffered a fractured facial bone , a broken leg , several lacerations , and heavy bruising .
Public outrage led to the officers being charged with using excessive force .
When they were sensationally acquitted – by a jury with no black members – the ensuing race riot lasted for three days , ending only after King appeared on television to say , " People ... can we all get along ? "
King was later awarded $ 3.8 m in a civil damages case .
He was never charged in relation to the incident , but was later convicted of drink - driving , and spent time in prison for a 1995 hit - and - run incident .
" I know some people will see the irony here , " said King , of his decision to fight a cop .
" But I would have fought anyone who was worthy .
I take this very seriously .
Never felt better , physically and in the mind . "

“ I said O.K. , ” Jalil said .
The screen flashed again .
Another Afghan appeared , younger than the first .
His name was Niaz , a resident of Mirwais Mena .
His nickname , he told the camera , was Bango .
In Pashto slang , “ bango ” means “ hashish . ”
On an evening in early November , Bango , 18 , said , he drove his motorcycle to see Jalil and two other men he ’d never met , Naim and Torjan .
Jalil handed the two men $ 1,200 each .
They would spray the acid .
Torjan handed Bango $ 125 .
He would drive .
“ When Torjan started spraying the first girl , I stopped my bike , but he told me to keep moving , ” Bango said into the camera .
“ So I kept moving , and he sprayed another group of girls in the middle of the road . ”
The screen flickered again .
This time , an Afghan girl appeared , writhing in a hospital bed .
She was covered in bandages .
The scene changed again ; the same girl reappeared , this time seated at a table .
She wore a white head scarf , but the scars were still visible , rimming her eyes in a bright mask and spreading across her cheek .
A caption gave her name as Shamsia Husseini .
“ We want them to be executed in front of us , ” Shamsia said .
She spoke calmly and slowly .
“ The same way they sprayed acid on us , we want acid sprayed on them . ”
After a while , the screen went dark .
EIGHT YEARS AFTER the Americans came to Afghanistan , it is hard to find reasons to be optimistic about the future .
In November 2001 , when the Taliban clerics fled Kabul , the country lay in ruins .
Today , it still does .
Outside Kabul , there is hardly any government to speak of .
There are governors , there are some police authorities and there is very little else .
The roads are mostly broken and unpaved .
Warlords hold much of the country in their hands .
The goodwill that flowed so freely eight years ago has mostly disappeared , drained away by the failure to rebuild the country , to crush the Taliban and to do so without slaughtering innocents .
It is easy to give in to despair .
And yet if there is one unambiguously positive change that the American - led enterprise has brought it is the education of girls .
In 2001 , only a million Afghan children were enrolled in school , all of them boys .
The education of girls was banned .
Today , approximately 7 million Afghan children attend school , of which 2.6 million , or roughly a third , are girls .
As a correspondent in the late 1990s , I traveled often to Afghanistan when the Taliban were in control .
The country was a grim and medieval place — I witnessed a public execution at a Kabul stadium .
In July 2000 , when the Taliban were at the height of their power , secret schools for girls were springing up across the country .
The women and men who ran these schools , often out of their own apartments , risked horrible punishments .
One afternoon in Kabul , on my way to meet some parents who were running one such school , I was descended on by the Taliban ’s vice - and - virtue police .
I was arrested and expelled from the country .
I did n’t return to Afghanistan until after 9/11 .
Yes , this obviously was a " divine assessment " .
They did n't even attempt to disguise the fraud .
Which , to me , tells me they panicked .

6. Intralase LASIK Method - All Laser and No Razor , Bladeless LASIK
Safety is our main priority for your Orange County LASIK eye surgery .
The all - laser LASIK method with the 5th generation Intralase ( iFS ) laser has greatly improved the safety of the flap creation for your LASIK Surgery at the Orange County LASIK Institute .
Instead of using a razor blade ( microkeratome ) , the Intralase uses a laser to safely create the LASIK flap .
In addition , being able to use a laser to make the flap allows your LASIK surgeon to create a thinner flap .
The flaps made with the Intralase heal faster , are stronger and have less dryness than LASIK flaps made with the microkeratome .
7. LASIK Good Enough For Pilots - Advanced Custom Treatments with Iris Registration
Every eye has a unique wavefront map or " fingerprint . "
When Dr. Pham at the Orange County LASIK Surgery Institute does your LASIK , he uses wavefront mapping to eliminate all of your eye 's unique aberrations and irregularities .
Your eye 's individual " fingerprint " is mapped out using wavefront technology .
Moreover , Dr. Pham uses iris registration in order to provide advanced custom treatments for his laser eye surgery patients .
Iris registration compensates for any rotation that your eyes may make during your LASIK surgery .
This process registers the iris and makes sure that the treatment is completely aligned .
Dr. Tony Pham of the Orange County LASIK and Laser Eye Surgery Institute is a certified iLASIK surgeon .
iLASIK is the highest level of LASIK surgery and laser vision correction .
It combines both all laser Intralase LASIK and custom LASIK with iris registration .

We believe that practicing ethically is the most important thing in running a successful practice .

Some of the important things that we screen you for include keratoconus ( corneal disease ) , pellucid marginal degeneration ( corneal disease ) , dry eyes , glaucoma , cataract , realistic expectations , presbyopia , corneal scars , and other ophthalmic conditions .
Our Orange County LASIK practice believes in giving you as much information as possible .
LASIK is an elective surgery and it is extremely important that you know about possible side effects .
The possible side effects and risks include dry eyes , glare / halo , loss of vision , flap complications , infection , and inflammation .
It is impossible for any website to give you all your unique risks and benefits so it is important to get a free LASIK consultation .
Although technology has revolutionized all - laser LASIK , it is important for you to discuss the risks , benefits , and alternatives of laser vision correction with your Orange County LASIK doctor .
Some People Should Not Have LASIK

Healthy eyes without ocular disease , realistic expectations , and informed decisions are essential for a successful LASIK operation in Orange County .
Complications are rare , but it is important for you to discuss your risks of infection , inflammation , loss of vision , keratoconus , glare , or dryness with your LASIK Surgeon .

Summary : Microsoft ’s Chief Operating Officer on the “ tremendous progress [...] made by the teams on open source and going against Linux ”
USING internal correspondence ( Comes vs Microsoft ) , we were able to show that Microsoft creates anti-GNU / Linux ' hit teams ' which it calls “ taskforces ” .
We saw Microsoft using a “ taskforce ” to take GNU / Linux off the shelves at Wal - Mart and there is a reason to believe that similar tactics are used all the times , to this date .
“ We saw Microsoft using a “ taskforce ” to take GNU / Linux off the shelves at Wal - Mart … ” Several years ago , Microsoft hired Kevin Turner from Wal - Mart to become the company ’s Chief Operating Officer ( COO ) .
He is one of the pivotal people behind the Novell - Microsoft patent deal .
Jason from Mono -Nono.com found the following quote from Kevin Turner , which suggests that he publicly admitted what we saw in private E -mails .
In 2006 he said : “ [ W ]e are going to compete to win in the Linux and open source area .
Tremendous progress has been made by the teams on open source and going against Linux ”
As Jason puts it , “ Yes , Microsoft actually has internal “ teams ” that attack Open Source and Linux .
Most people have a hard time imagining this – people tend to take an individual view of things ( ” That does n’t directly affect me . ” or “ Hey , it ’s a matter of personal choice ” .
Rest assured Microsoft does not take the individual view , they are working hard at removing that choice . ”
To quote another bit from Kevin Turner , here he is using the term “ fraudulent perception ” to refer to price of Free ( dom ) software .
And we ’re really getting the message out about the fraudulent perception of free in the marketplace as it relates to open source .
IT pros and decision - makers are starting to get it , that it ’s not free , that there ’s a lot of TCO that goes along with that , and there ’s also substantial security risks that go along with it .
And so we ’re really making some traction in this area , and we ’re going to continue to hit the gas and go more and more aggressive as it relates to winning share .
This is interesting because they repeated the same accusatory term — “ fraudulent perception ” — more than once just a few weeks ago in an analogous meeting .
The above is a transcript from the Financial Analyst Meeting of 2008 and on July 15th the slur was repeated in a meeting with shareholders . █
“ What we [ Novell and Microsoft ] agreed , which is true , is we ’ll continue to try to grow Windows share at the expense of Linux .
That ’s kind of our job .
But to the degree that people are going to deploy Linux , we want Suse Linux to have the highest percent share of that , because only a customer who has Suse Linux actually has paid properly for the use of intellectual property from Microsoft .
And we took a quota , you could say , to help them sell so much Suse Linux .
That ’s part of the deal .
We are willing to do the same deal with Red Hat and other Linux distributors , it ’s not an exclusive thing .
But after a few years of working on this problem , Novell actually saw the business opportunity , because there ’s so many customers who say , ‘ Hey look , we do n’t want problems .
We do n’t want any intellectual property problem or anything else .
There ’s just a variety of workloads where we , today , feel like we want to run Linux .
Please help us Microsoft and please work with the distributors to solve this problem , do n’t come try to license this individually . ’
So customer push drove us to where we got . ”

PHILADELPHIA -- Jim Johnson , whose attacking defenses helped the Philadelphia Eagles to one Super Bowl appearance and five NFC title games , has died .
He was 68 .
Johnson had taken a leave of absence from the team in May as he continued to battle a cancerous tumor on his spine .
The Eagles announced his death on Tuesday afternoon .
Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Johnson had taken a leave of absence from the team in May as he continued to battle a cancerous tumor on his spine .
Howard Smith / US Presswire
A veteran of 22 years as an NFL assistant , Johnson was considered one of the top defensive minds in the league , known for complex schemes that confused opponents and pressured the quarterback from every angle .
His defenses consistently ranked among the best in the league , including last season , when the Eagles finished third in total defense and fell one victory short of the Super Bowl .
From 2000 - 08 , Johnson 's Philadelphia defenses ranked second in the NFL in sacks ( 390 ) .
During his 10 - year tenure , the Eagles made the playoffs seven times and he produced 26 Pro Bowl selections .
" This whole Eagles - Andy Reid regime here that 's taken place would n't have been possible without Jim , " said Andy Reid , who hired Johnson to be his defensive coordinator shortly after he got his first head coaching job with the Eagles in 1999 .
" I 'm not sure there 's a person that I 've met that is n't a Jim Johnson fan .
He really represented everything this city is all about with his toughness and grit .
That 's the way he fought this cancer . "
Eagles chairman Jeffrey Lurie praised Johnson for his leadership skills and the person he was .

We all know what the world looks like .
But a new series of extraordinary maps shows our planet in a very different light .
Rather than defining each country by size , these computer - generated modified maps - or cartograms - redraw the globe with each country 's size proportionate to its strengths , or weaknesses , in a whole series of categories .
For instance , when it comes to military spending , the U.S. appears bloated , but Africa is huge when HIV prevalence is mapped .
The cartograms were produced in a unique collaboration between the universities of Michigan in the U.S. and Sheffield .
Here are images and more details on some of the most fascinating ...
Alcohol Consumption ( 2001 )
The average Western European drinks over a third more alcohol than the average person in any other area on earth .
In some places there is practically no alcohol consumption , which is why many Middle Eastern countries are not visible on this map .
Ugandans drink the most alcohol per adult , closely followed by Luxembourg , the Czech Republic and Ireland .
The map shows the proportion of worldwide alcohol drunk in 2001 .
It does not take population density into account , so some countries , such as Australia , are unexpectedly shrivelled , while Britain is particularly bloated even though we not in the top ten .
HIV Prevalence
The map shows the distribution of all people aged 15 - 49 with HIV .
In 2003 , the highest HIV prevalence was in Swaziland , where almost four in every ten people , were HIV positive .
All ten territories with the highest prevalence of HIV are in central and southeastern Africa .
House Prices
The most expensive housing stock per person in the world is in Europe , the cheapest in the African regions and Southern Asia - despite
taking into account that money goes further in these territories .
Britain , with its non -stop housing boom , looks disproportionately large .
Military Spending
Aa the world 's biggest military spender in 2002 , the U.S. appears hugely bloated in this map , taking up 45 per cent of the world 's land mass .
It spent $ 353 billion on arms , out of a world total of $ 789 billion .
While America spent the money , it reaped hardly any of the consequences - the U.S. shrinks to almost nothing in the map of war deaths on the right ...
War and death
In 2002 , there were an estimated 172,000 war deaths worldwide , across 80 territories .
The Democratic Republic of Congo ( dark red ) bore the brunt - 26 per cent - of the total figure .
Nine territories accounted for 70 per cent of all deaths .
Burundi had the highest death rate owing to war at 1.2 people per thousand of the population .
Toy Imports
The following two maps demonstrate the passage of the world 's toys from east to west .
The U.S. ( blue ) is the world 's biggest net importer of toys , followed by the UK and Europe ( red ) .
The lowest importer of toys is Africa ( orange ) .
Toy Exports
As the world 's biggest net exporter of toys , China appears on the map like a vivid green giant , attached to the paler green Hong Kong , the second largest net exporter .
Britain 's once - great toy export industry has all but disappeared .
Wealth of Nations ( 1500 )
The big difference between 1500 and 2002 ( next map ) is that all that time ago , the vast bulk of the world 's wealth was contained in European and Asian countries .
Measured by Gross Domestic Product per person , the wealthiest regions were Eastern and Southern Asia .
Wealth of Nations ( 2002 )
Today , 500 years on , the money has all moved west : 46 per cent of the wealth is in North America and Western Europe .
Along with Japan , these are the regions with the most purchasing power per person , while the people with the lowest purchasing power are to be found in Africa .

Resources
Choosing a cell phone plan can be confusing .
Carriers often display plans on separate pages , use fancy terms , or bury hidden costs in their terms of service .
Our plan comparison tool takes the guesswork out of finding the best deal , but how do you know which plan is the best plan for your needs ?
And what should you look for ?
Most mobile phone plans share a number of similar options , including an allotment of minutes , data , and SMS messages .
They ’ll often also include a set of common calling features , such as voicemail , caller ID , group calling , and call waiting .
But what about everything else ?
What makes one plan better for you than another ?
This guide answers all the important questions you might have .
Payment Considerations
The type of plan you choose will determine both when you pay for service and how you are billed .
Plans typically fall into one of three types :
Prepaid or pay - as - you - go plans where you pay in advance
or plans where you pay in advance Monthly plans where you pay at the end of a monthly billing cycle
One plan type is n’t automatically better than the other .
Each option offers unique strengths and weaknesses you should consider to find the best fit for you .
It all depends on what you need in a plan and your financial situation .
Prepaid Plans
As the name suggests , with prepaid service , you pay in advance for the features you want to use .
While you ’ll still likely pay more for prepaid than monthly services , it ’s not as expensive as it once was .
Benefits to prepaid service include :
No credit checks
No early termination fees
No worries about extra charges
The ability to tailor your bill to meet your needs and budget
Of course , there are aspects of prepaid that might not work for you either ...
Prepaid services often offer smaller data allowances than monthly plans .
Adding extra data to your allotment is often more expensive as well .
Some prepaid carriers do not let you use your phone while travelling either .
However , if you have an unlocked phone , you can pick up a different prepaid SIM to use at your destination .
You can either you either pay upfront for an allotment of minutes , data , and messages -- often on a monthly basis -- or you can buy credits that are added to your account .
Two Types of Prepaid Plans : Pay - As - You - Go and Bundles
With credit - based prepaid plans , you spend credits each time you place a call , send or receive a message , or use data .
This is also known as Pay - As - You - Go ( PAYG ) phone service .
The allotment based plans are known as bundles or bundle plans .
These include a set amount of minutes , data , and message for a flat rate .
How you use your phone will determine which type of prepaid service is best for you .
Bundles often feature lower per-feature prices compared to credit - based plans .
However , your minutes , data , and messages also expire at the end of your billing cycle if you do n’t use them .
If you do n’t use all your minutes , data , and messages , you ’ve paid less for the features , but you ’ve also paid for features you did n’t use .
Pay - as - you - go rates are often higher on a per-feature or per-credit basis , but they rarely expire as long as you add credits to your account regularly .
For light users , this is often a better option as you ’re not paying for things you do not use .
Monthly Plans
This is the standard type of plan offered by most major carriers .
You use your phone and they bill you each month .
If you go over the minutes , texts or data included with your plan -- or use services not included with your monthly plan -- the additional usage is tacked onto the next bill .
A few years ago , monthly billing was the way to go for most .
However , smaller carriers and prepaid providers have improved service and prices since then making the choice less clear .
Two of the biggest reasons to consider a monthly plan are :
Multi-line discounts :
Most major carriers offer substantial discounts for having more than one line ( one phone number ) on an account .
This makes getting a phone for the whole family much more affordable .
Most major carriers offer substantial discounts for having more than one line ( one phone number ) on an account .
This makes getting a phone for the whole family much more affordable .
Larger / Unlimited data packages : Unlimited data and larger data pools are often only offered on monthly plans .
These are ideal if you ’re not within range of Wi-Fi often or like to stream music , movies , or TV shows to your mobile device .
The biggest downside to monthly billing is that it often requires a credit check and contract .
If you do n’t have great credit , you ’ll face a hefty deposit to get started .
While most carriers offer refunds on your deposit , the terms are often incredibly specific .
One late payment and you could lose your deposit .
Phone Needs
Most carriers offer shiny new phones at a discount or let you bring a phone you already own , assuming it ’s compatible .
But whether you buy a new phone or not could impact your plan choices .
So considering the best approach is essential to getting the best value for your new service plan .
Do n’t Need a New Phone or Want to Bring Your Own ?
While most carriers might not make it obvious , many offer plans that allow you to use your own phone with their service .
These are known as SIM - only or Bring Your Own Device ( BYOD ) plans .
SIM - Only plans do n’t include device financing or subsidies .
So you ’re on your own to buy an unlocked phone to use with the service find an unlocked phone -- be that from your carrier , online , or at your favourite electronics retailer .
The advantage to SIM - Only plans is that they are often priced lower than prepaid or monthly plans that include a phone .
SIM - only plans are available in both monthly and prepaid payment types , allowing you to pick the payment type you prefer .
However , depending on the carrier you choose , they may still require a credit check and contract to establish service .
Upgrade Your Phone or Buy New Phones Using Device Subsidies
If you ’ve seen ads online or on television offering you the latest smartphone for next to nothing , you ’ve seen phone discounts -- or phone subsidies -- in action .
Essentially , the carrier offers you a substantial discount on a new phone .
In return , you agree to stick with that carrier for up to two years .
If you cancel before that -- or ca n’t pay your bill -- they ’ll recover their subsidy with an early termination fee .
While this seems like a good deal , in most cases , you ’ll get better prices and enjoy greater flexibility if you buy your phone upfront .
If you must use a subsidy to get your phone , ALWAYS check the terms .
If they add interest to the cost of the phone or tack on additional financing fees , do the math and be sure you ’re getting a good deal .
Phone Leasing or Early Upgrade Programs
Phone leasing is a relatively new concept with carriers but works very similar to how it works with cars .
You pay each month for your phone just like if you had financed it .
Most leases have one - or two - year terms .
At the end of your term , you can return it to the carrier for a discount on a new leased device or pay a reduced lump sum to keep it based on how much you paid toward the phone ’s price during your lease .
Many carriers use different names for their phone leasing programs .
One of the most popular names is “ early upgrade plans . ”
But take a minute to read the terms of the contract -- it ’s still just a lease program in disguise .
Lease terms vary depending on the carrier but most require you to keep the phone in like - new condition in order to trade it back in .
Some carriers include phone insurance with your lease fees , others do n’t .
So read the fine print to understand the true risks and costs of your phone lease or early upgrade agreement .
Regardless of the carrier , unless you upgrade every time a new phone is released , you ’ll probably save money over the long - term by purchasing a device outright .
Recommendations
So now that you understand the different options , which should you choose ?
It will mostly depend on the number of phones you need and your budget .
If you only need a single line of service , we recommend buying your phone outright .
You ’ll spend a bit more upfront over taking a discount or financing , but spend far less in the end due to cheaper plans and more flexibility .
If your budget does n’t allow that shiny new model of phone you have your eyes on , buying an older model upfront and pairing it with a SIM - only plan can reduce your upfront costs significantly while giving you access to a capable smartphone .
While today ’s high - end releases are super powerful and sleek looking , the high - end phones from a year or two ago will still suit the needs of the average person .
If you need multiple phones -- like when you ’re buying phones for the whole family -- decisions get tougher …
Buying multiple high - end phones upfront is out of the question for the budgets of many buyers .
In these cases , subsidizing or leasing a phone from your carrier are likely the best approaches .
Just be careful ...
Should the phone take a dip in the pool or smash to the ground , you might be left on the hook for both the price of the phone and the monthly service fees for the rest of your contract term .

Carrier Options
In the early days of mobile phones , carrier coverage did n’t overlap much .
This meant that you had only one or two options in your area for mobile phone service .
These days as carriers expand networks , offer coast - to - coast coverage , and use deals with other carriers to offer service around the world , the number of options you have to choose from might feel intimidating .
Not to fear .
By looking at a few important factors , you can begin to limit your options and find the best deals in your area .
Big Carriers vs Small Carriers
Many smaller carriers are what are known as mobile virtual network operators or MVNOs -- though there are a few small regional carriers left as well .
MVNO ’s typically use the same networks as the big carriers .
They just lease access to the network and resell it to you .
There are even some MVNO ’s which are owned by the major carrier .
So , in most cases , coverage is similar to what you ’ll find with the bigger names .
The biggest downside to smaller carriers is that you ’ll often find fewer phone options in their stores and limited customer support options .
Some smaller carriers use email or online forums while others only allow phone support .
Also , depending on the network that the carrier uses , you might also see slower data speeds than major carriers in your region .
If these differences are important to you , a big carrier might be the best choice .
However , for many , smaller carriers offer substantial savings and comparable service quality .
Signal Strength in Your Area
There ’s nothing more frustrating than missing calls and messages or having to find that magic corner on the second floor of your home or office to send a text .
You want a carrier that offers solid coverage in the areas you frequent .
But how do you know which carriers have the best coverage near you ?
One way is by checking the coverage maps offered by carriers .
These offer a general idea of what you can expect but keep in mind that these maps only estimations based on readings in nearby areas .
Just because their map says you should have great service does n’t guarantee you will .
From thick walls to network congestion there are endless factors these maps ca n’t account for .
Instead , we recommend checking one of the third - party coverage maps -- such as OpenSignal or RootMetrics .
Better still , you can check with friends or ask in local social media groups about which carriers they use and any problems they might have with coverage .
By checking a few different sources , you can see if service might be inconsistent in your area .

Customer Service Options and Availability
Even if you ’re confident in your tech abilities , there ’s a good chance you ’ll need help with your phone or account from time to time .
When this happens , not having support available could be the difference between a quick resolution and a frustrating few days without your phone .
Many smaller carriers and low - cost carriers have limited support options .
At a minimum , we recommend choosing a provider that at least offers real - time chat support .
This means you can resolve issues quickly and not have to wait for replies to emails or sift through hundreds of forum posts trying to find an answer .
If you expect you ’ll have questions or need help with your phone or service , we highly recommend choosing a carrier with telephone support ( preferably toll - free ) and , ideally , with a retail store in your area .
This means you can skip the hassle of waiting on hold or trying to explain your issue through chat and swing by the store instead .
Tip : Check out our carrier summaries to compare the support options offered by the carriers in your area .
Single vs. Group Plans
Group and family plans are one of the easiest ways to save on your monthly mobile bill .
In many cases , the people on the plan do n’t even need to live at the same address .
This makes it easy to add kids in college , elderly parents , or even a trusted friend or coworker to your plan and split the costs of your phone service .
Terms and conditions vary .
However , in most cases , multi- line plans work in one of two ways :
Shared allotments :
With these group plans , everyone ’s use comes out of the same pool of minutes , texts and data .
This is ideal in family situations where some people might use a lot of one feature and others very little .
For example , your kids love to text with their friends and stream video but you might just want a phone to make calls with .
With a shared plan , they ’re not sitting with wasted minutes on their plan , and you ’re not required to keep a ton of data you ’ll never use .
Everyone shares the same set of features .
Per -line data :
With these plans , each line often shares a pool of texts and voice minutes but has an individual data bucket .
These plans are useful if you use little data or want better control over how much data each person can use .
In most cases , group plans offer better discounts for each line you add .
If you only need two lines , you might save money with individual lines through a prepaid provider .
Prepaid plans are often cheaper than monthly plans and the group plan discounts for two lines are often very small .
So with a bit of shopping around and comparing plan options , you might be able to find a cheaper prepaid service than the monthly group plan will cost .
However , for three or more lines , group plans are almost always the most affordable and flexible option available .

Voice Minutes
If you plan to use your phone regularly to make or receive calls , you ’ll want to make sure you have enough minutes to use your phone without worry .
If you already have service through another provider , check your past three bills to see how many minutes you used .
This should give you an idea of what to look for with a new service provider .
If you ’re new to mobile phones , choose an option that seems slightly more than what you might need .
In most cases , you can downgrade your minutes later if you ’re not using them .
And paying for a slightly higher plan is often cheaper than paying for any amount of overages .
If you plan to talk a lot -- or have kids who love to talk on your plan -- consider an unlimited talk plan .
Then you ’ll have zero worries when the bill rolls in .
With prepaid phones , using all of your minutes -- or credits in the case of pay - as - you - go -- could mean you ’re unable to use the calling , messaging , and data features of your phone until you add more credits to your plan or renew at the end of your billing cycle .
On monthly plans , you ’ll likely switch to per-minute billing if you use your monthly allotment .
This can result in a scary surprise when the next bill rolls in .
Even if the carrier adds minutes in bundles , they ’re likely at a higher rate than if you had signed up for a higher tier plan to begin with .
Calling Options
How calls are billed varies by the plan and carrier .
If you ’re only calling in your local area , you should have no worries regardless of the plan you choose .
However , if you ’re calling friends and family on the other side of the country or abroad , you ’ll want to look at the carrier ’s calling terms .
Many carriers now include nationwide calling as a basic feature on most plans .
If the plan you ’re considering does n’t include it , check the add - ons or bundles to see if you can add it for a reasonable fee .
Even an hour of long distance calling will exceed the cost of the monthly add - on for most carriers .
Virtually every carrier charges additional fees for long distance international calls .
If you plan to call abroad often , choose a carrier with a flat - rate international calling plan .
These include a set amount of minutes and texts to a specific country or set of countries at a substantial discount over the regular per-minute rates .
Just keep in mind that if you do n’t use all of your monthly minutes , you ’ll likely lose them at the end of your billing cycle .
Roaming Fees
Most major carriers now offer nationwide coverage and service but some smaller or regional carriers still use calling zones to determine how to bill your call .
If you ’re making calls from your home area , there is n’t much to worry about .
However , if you travel often you ’ll want to check the terms of service .
You can find the roaming details for each carrier in our carrier summaries .
If your travels take you outside the country , you ’ll also want to consider international roaming fees .
Many carriers charge extra fees for using your phone service in other countries .
And although some carriers automatically suspend roaming service after you reach a certain bill amount , these limits are still high enough to stress the budgets of the average person .
We recommend choosing a carrier that offers flat - rate travel passes in regions you frequently visit .
These allow you to either use your standard allotment of minutes , texts and data or give you a dedicated allotment for use while you travel .
You can also consider a travel SIM or pick up a prepaid SIM when you reach your destination .
NOTE : Some prepaid carriers do not support international roaming .
In this case , you ’d be without service while travelling unless you swap out your existing SIM for a travel SIM or pick up a prepaid SIM that offers service in the area you ’re visiting .
Data Considerations
Mobile data use continues to rise as more people use smartphones and network speeds improve .
If you ’re looking to keep your phone costs manageable each month and enjoying your mobile phone to its fullest , choosing the appropriate data plan is essential -- especially considering that Canada has some of the most expensive data plans in the world .
But before we talk about how much data you might need , let ’s look at the different network types and data speeds available .
This will provide an idea of what you can do with the data included in your plan .
2G , 3G , 4G , LTE , 5G : What ’s the Deal with Data ?
These labels all refer to the type of network the carrier uses .
While the specifics of how they work are n’t important , they can give you an idea of what to expect when using your mobile data .
Network types include :
2G : Basic data , mostly good for voice calls and text messages .
Not compatible with streaming or browsing the web .
Most carriers are slowly phasing out their 2G networks .
3G : As the replacement to 2G , this network is slower than 4G but still fast enough for basic internet use and light streaming .
It is more common outside urban areas .
4G : Faster than 3G , these networks can stream HD video or audio and work similar to a home or business broadband connection .
These networks are common in urban areas though carriers are adding 4G coverage in rural regions rapidly .
LTE : As the next stage of 4G , LTE offers yet another speed boost and improved reception on congested networks or in densely populated areas .
5G : While still in its early stages , this will be the replacement for 4G LTE in the coming years .
It offers further speed boosts , lower latency , and improved indoor reception .
However , at the time of writing , there are very few 5G networks in operation .
Real - world usage will vary based on your phone model , location , network congestion , and other factors .
For a better idea of what to expect regarding network speeds in your area , we suggest consulting OpenSignal .
Their data comes from real people using their app in your area instead of estimates .
This means it should line up well with the speeds you will experience .
How Much Data Do I Need ?
Much like minutes , the amount of data needed will vary from person to person .
In general , the more you use your phone for things other than calling or texting , the more data you ’ll need .
Also , while faster mobile speeds provide better video quality and more options in how you use your phone on the go , it also means you can use data -- and potentially rack up hefty overage fees -- quicker as well .
As one of the most expensive parts of the typical mobile phone bill -- especially if you exceed your data allowance -- this is one of the most important considerations when choosing a plan .
Most data plans are measured in gigabytes .
One gigabyte ( GB ) equals approximately 1000 megabytes ( MB ) .
With 1GB you can :
Receive 500 to 1250 emails with typical - sized ( 800 KB to 2MB ) PDF attachments
Download 166 basic apps
Download 16 basic game apps
Download 2 high - quality , 3D games
Stream music at high quality for up to 7 to 14 hours depending on settings
Stream NetFlix for 3 hours at Low Quality
Stream NetFlix for 1.4 hours at Medium Quality
Stream NetFlix for 20 minutes at High Quality
Upload 500 to 2000 images to Instagram
Browse images on Facebook for 51 hours
Use Google Maps Navigation for approximately 100 hours
Send 34,000 WhatsApp text messages
Video Chat on Skype for 4 hours
Watch 68 videos on YouTube at SD quality
As you can see , how you use your phone vastly changes what you can do with a set amount of data .
In most cases , if you plan to use any data at all , we recommend opting for at least 1GB of data .
While some carriers offer data packages with less data , it ’s often only a slight savings over the 1GB plan .
If you use apps , social media or email frequently , we recommend at least 2GB .
Want to stream music or video or play games ?
We advise at least 4GB .
You can find out more information in our mobile data guide .
Tethering
This feature allows your phone to act as a mobile Wi -Fi hotspot .
This means you can use your mobile data connection on your tablet , laptop , or any other Wi -Fi enabled device .
Whether you need tethering will depend on your typical usage .
However , it is handy to have if your home Internet connection goes out , you ’re working on the road , or you 're planning to travel and wo n’t have access to Wi-Fi .
Keep in mind that unless you ’re tethering with another phone , you ’ll use data quicker than normal .
When tethering on a small data plan , be sure to watch your usage closely to avoid additional fees .
Carrier support for tethering varies .
Most that support it do n’t charge extra to enable the feature .
However , there are sometimes limits to data speeds or allotments when tethering .
You can find the full details on tethering for each carrier in our carrier reviews .
Beware of Data Roaming Charges
As with calling , most carriers offer data service nationwide .
However , fees for international data usage are one of the leading causes of bill shock .
Data roaming fees often start at dollars per megabyte .
This is particularly true of cruise ships where carriers might charge as much as $ 10 or $ 15 PER MB .
This means checking your Facebook feed or watching a cute cat video could cost you hundreds of dollars .
If you ’re planning to use data while travelling , be sure to check for flat - rate add - ons or consider getting a travel SIM or prepaid SIM at your destination .
Wi -Fi Calling & VoLTE
If you live in an area with poor coverage or frequently spend time in areas prone to signal issues -- such as basement offices or dense urban areas -- Wi-Fi calling can provide a reliable signal when mobile coverage cannot .
Both VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling also promise clearer audio when calling with less compression and distortion .
You might think , “ Wi - Fi calling sounds great !
Sign me up ! ”
But check the carrier ’s terms first .
Many carriers still bill you for minutes and texts over Wi-Fi .
So the features are not a way to save money on your bill .
If you have a bandwidth limit on your wireless network , this means your phone could cost you twice -- especially if your carrier makes it hard to switch between Wi-Fi calling and traditional mobile networks .
Some carriers also cannot transfer calls from Wi-Fi to mobile networks seamlessly .
If you ’re talking and leave the range of your router , your call might drop .
While it ’s far from a deal - breaking consideration , it might frustrate you if you have a weak Wi -Fi signal or frequently talk while on the go .
" Free " Perks
Many carriers attempt to attract customers by adding exclusive perks or “ free ” services along with their phone service .
This can range from discounts on movies , concerts , and other entertainment to free access to popular streaming services .
While these deals are legitimate , consider what they ’re worth to you before you sign up for service .
If you do n’t use a service often , then you might have found a better deal elsewhere .
Not to mention that while the service provider might call the service free , the cost is likely hidden in your bill somewhere .
Extra Features
Most carriers offer a range of additional services you can add to your service plan .
Whether they are worth it for you depends on your preferences .
Let ’s look at a few of the most popular plan add - ons …
Phone Insurance
In our opinion , insurance is n’t worth it .
Back in the days of flip phones and Nokia candy bar phones , phone insurance plans made sense .
You paid a couple dollars a month and if your phone took a swim or hit the ground a little too hard , you phoned up your carrier and they shipped out a replacement for next to nothing .
These days , when a flagship phone retails for nearly $ 1000 , carrier ’s ca n’t afford to just hand you a new phone .
This means you pay more each month for insurance .
Then , when it breaks and you phone in for a replacement , they say , " Sure !
Your deductible is $ 349 . ”
What ’s worse is that they often then mail you a refurbished replacement , not a brand new phone .
Sure , it ’s cheaper than outright replacement ...
But let ’s be honest , $ 200 to $ 350 for a deductible still is n’t exactly budget friendly for most of us .
Especially after paying for phone service and insurance every month .
Instead of opting for insurance , we suggest picking up a good case , like an OtterBox , and stashing a little money away each month in case your phone breaks .
TIP : If you need a phone with built - in protection , rugged phone options have improved greatly in recent years .
There are even smartphone models with infrared cameras and other advanced features .
This means you can take your phone to the construction site or go hiking without worrying about drops , water , or dust .
Roadside Assistance
Some carriers offer roadside assistance as an add - on but the value of the service is a matter of preference .
Should you ever need to use it , there ’s a good chance it will pay for itself in only one or two uses .
Do n’t use it and it ’s money you could spend elsewhere .
However , be sure to check prices and what services are provided .
Also check to see that you do n’t already have roadside assistance through your car insurance , a credit card , or a club membership .
Streaming TV or Music Services
Before the glorious era of Netflix , Hulu , Spotify , Pandora , and other streaming sites , carriers tried to entice subscribers into subscribing to streaming video and music services to enjoy their favourite media on the go .
These days , they ’re often more expensive than the more popular standalone services while offering less content .
And , in most cases , you can only access the service on your phone or tablet .
One key difference is if you ’d like to watch live TV .
Many carriers are TV service providers too .
So they ’ll add live channels to their phone streaming services .
However , with services like Playstation Vue , Sling TV , and DirecTV NOW , gaining popularity their advantage is dwindling .
But the biggest consideration when deciding if you want streaming add - ons -- unless you ’re on an unlimited plan -- is Wi-Fi availability .
Streaming video apps chew through data .
So you ’re paying for a service to access the shows , then paying again with your data allotment to watch them .
If you do n’t have regular access to Wi-Fi where you typically use your phone , we recommend passing .
The one exception to this is carriers that offer promotions in partnership with bigger companies like Netflix or Spotify .
It ’s not uncommon to see carriers offer new lines with a few months of service with one of these popular streaming services included .
And you can use the service on all of your devices -- not just your phone .

Why trust us ?
A career as a Cobol programmer might not be as sexy as slinging Java code or scripting in Ruby , but if you buckle down and learn hoary old Cobol , you could land one of the safest , most secure jobs in IT .
Analyst reports indicate that Cobol salaries are on the upswing .
The language is easy to learn , there 's a healthy demand for the skills , and offshore Cobol programmers are in short supply -- plus , the language itself holds the promise of longevity .
All that loose talk about mainframes going away has subsided , and companies committed to big iron need Cobol pros to give them love .
[ To learn about other skills in high - demand during tight times , read " Recession - proof IT jobs . " ]
In a troubled economy , with analysts forecasting IT spending slowdowns , secure IT positions could quickly become scarcer than they are today .
Seasoned Cobol programmers , in contrast , " should be in pretty good shape job - wise .
If they have a position at an organization that intends to keep its legacy Cobol apps , then they are probably set for life , " says industry analyst Jeff Gould , director of research at Interop Systems .
" Many mainframe customers with large mission - critical Cobol apps are locked into the mainframe platform .
Often there is no equivalent packaged app , and it proves to be just too expensive to port the legacy Cobol to newer platforms like Intel or AMD servers . "
Why Cobol is alive and well
William Conner , a senior manager in Deloitte 's technology integration practice , comments that " salaries for Cobol programmers have been rising in recent years due to a lack of supply .
Demand is outstripping supply because many Cobol programmers are reaching retirement age and college leavers tend to focus on Java , XML , and other modern languages . "
Deloitte also found that three - fifths of respondents are actually developing new and strategic Cobol - based applications .
Yes , right here in 2008 .
Retired Cobol programmer William C. Kees , who coded in Cobol for 25 years , says that the language is easy to learn and that he mastered it without taking any classes .
Another career Cobol programmer requesting anonymity seconds that sentiment : " It 's easy to learn , read , and follow .
After looking at code for .
Net or VisualBasic , give me Cobol any day .
At least it 's readable . "
What 's more , Cobol programmers are not as prone to having their job outsourced , according to Brian Keane , CEO for Dextrys , an outsourcing company based in China and the United States .
" The Chinese do n't have mainframe experience .
Because Chinese computer science graduates have come late to the technology table they are starting with the latest architectures and systems and do n't have the experience with legacy languages and systems , " he says .
Latin American countries are in a situation similar to that of the United States , according to Gabriel Rozman , executive vice president for emerging markets at Tata Consultancy Services .
" Many Latin countries are still stuck with legacy mainframes where Cobol is a common skill , " says Rozman , " so that anyone who has [ that and ] the latest Java skills , for example , would be sought after . "
Bridging the old and the new
Mainframes are n't going anywhere mainly because they do an extremely reliable job with high - volume transaction processing .
But increasingly , companies are benefiting from integrating legacy mainframe Cobol applications with the rest of the enterprise , to leverage their power and work toward real - time business operations .
SOA , for instance , opens all sorts of opportunities to expose Cobol apps to the wider world .
" Many mainframe users are actively pursuing SOA as a way to integrate their legacy Cobol apps with newer nonmainframe apps , " explains Jeff Gould of Interop Systems .
" There 's a new kind of job emerging for which people need to have ' bridging skills , ' where they understand the importance of existing systems and how to integrate those with modern systems and deploy Cobol into modern architectures , " points out Arunn Ramadoss , head of the Micro Focus Academic Connections Program , which partners with colleges , universities , and other institutions to teach Cobol to students .
By 2007 , the number of universities and colleges offering Cobol classes was dwindling .
But that has reversed dramatically .
In May of last year , Micro Focus launched its academic program to focus on Cobol as well as other core IT skills by providing member universities with free access to requisite technology and teaching tools .
[ Ca n't get enough Cobol ?
Try Neil McAllister 's take on California 's Cobol conundrum . ]
Since last May , Micro Focus has signed up at least one college or university every week ; in late September , it surpassed 50 U.S. academic institutions .
" We 're expecting 7,500 students to graduate with Cobol skills next year , and in the years after we hope to boost that number to 10,000 or 15,000 , " Ramadoss says .
While Micro Focus boasts what appears to be the largest university program , would - be Cobol programmers do have other options , including community colleges , private so - called business schools , and IT training classes .
Landing a job in a Cobol shop
Deloitte 's Conner says that the firm is " already seeing significant demand for Cobol expertise , " especially in financial services firms , where Cobol continues to be prevalent .
So what does it take to get a position at a company that needs Cobol skills ?
No , you do n't need to get a crew cut .
In fact , the desired qualifications match those for many other IT jobs .
Prospective employers are looking for Cobol people who understand business , have a diverse skill set , and possess the ability to learn new technologies as necessary , according to Lou Washington , a senior marketing manager in Cincom 's control manufacturing business solutions group .
J.D. Williams , a U.K. - based direct home shopping company , considers Cobol an essential skill when hiring programmers , according to IT training manager Mike Madden : " We 've got a development shop of about 100 people , and 60 of them know Cobol .
They 're all actively coding in it or using it in their analysis . "
The company has a huge legacy system built on Cobol and Assembler that includes more than 5,000 programs .
There 's even work for those who prefer -- or are at least willing to take -- short - term gigs .
Andrew Larkin , an IT project manager in the legal field , learned Cobol in 1998 to leverage the boom in IT jobs due to the Y2 K craze ; since then , he 's found that " the primary suppliers of Cobol jobs are either very large companies looking for maintenance hires or head hunting firms with contract positions to fill , most of which last less than a year . "
J.D. Williams ' Madden contends that contract work is a solid fallback plan for Cobol programmers .
" I would quite happily go back to being a freelance Cobol programmer because that 's quite secure , too , " the IT training manager says .
Retired programmer
Kees believes that IT shops " could very well still have Cobol shreds existing " decades into the future .
" Cobol will be around for some time -- maybe till 2050 , I do n't know , " Kees adds .
" But I would bet it will still be in use when I croak . "

It is one of evolution 's crowning achievements - a mini green power station and organic factory combined and the source of almost all of the energy that fuels every living thing on the planet .
Now scientists developing the next generation of clean power sources are working out how to copy , and ultimately improve upon , the humble leaf .
The intricate chemistry involved in photosynthesis , the process where plants use sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugar , is the most effective solar energy conversion process on Earth .
And researchers believe that mimicking parts of it could be the ticket to a limitless supply of clean power .
The untapped potential for using the sun 's rays is huge .
All human activity for a whole year could be powered by the energy contained in the sunlight hitting the Earth in just one hour .
Harnessing even a small amount of this to make electricity or useful fuels could satisfy the world 's increasing need for energy , predicted to double by 2050 , without further endangering the climate .
Most solar power systems use silicon wafers to generate electricity directly .
But although costs are coming down , these are still too expensive in many cases when compared with fossil fuels such as coal , oil and gas .
Scientists are keen to develop more efficient and cheaper alternatives sources of energy .
At Imperial College London , researchers have embarked on a £ 1 m project to study , and eventually mimic , photosynthesis .
Part of a project called the " artificial leaf " , involves working out exactly how leaves use sunlight to make useful molecules .
The team then plans to build artificial systems that can do the same to generate clean fuels such as hydrogen and methanol .
These would then be used in fuel cells to make electricity or directly to power super - clean vehicles .
Similar projects are gathering pace around the world : the US is poised to approve a federal research budget of around $ 35 m a year for ideas that could create fuels from sunlight and the Dutch government has allocated € 40 m for similar research .
According to James Barber , a biologist at Imperial College London and leader of the artificial leaf project , if artificial photosynthesis systems could use around 10 % of the sunlight falling on them , they would only need to cover 0.16 % of the Earth 's surface to satisfy a global energy consumption rate of 20 terawatts , the amount it is predicted that the world will need in 2030 .
And unlike a biological leaf , the artificial equivalent could be placed in the arid desert areas of the world , where it would not compete for space agricultural land .
Ultimately , Barber hopes to improve on nature 's own solar cell .
" If the leaf can do it , we can do it but even better , " he said .
" [ But ] it does n't mean that you try to build exactly what the leaf has .
Leonardo da Vinci tried to design flying machines with feathers that flapped up and down .
But in the end we built 747s and Airbus 380s , completely different to a bird and , in fact , even better than a bird . "
Photosynthesis starts with a chemical reaction where sunlight is used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen .
The oxygen is released into the atmosphere while the hydrogen is used to create sugars and other organic molecules for the plant .
The aim of Barber 's artificial leaf project is to find an efficient way of mimicking that water - splitting reaction to create a clean and limitless source hydrogen .
Unlike normal leaves , the new devices would not suck CO2 out of the atmosphere .
Hydrogen is a clean , energy - rich fuel that could be used in fuel cells to make electricity or else combined with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere ( or from the exhaust of fossil - fuel power stations ) to make methanol , a fuel that could be dropped into vehicles without the need for any engine modifications .
" The challenge is to get hydrogen out of water using a ready supply of energy , " said Barber .
For domestic purposes , Dan Nocera , a chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , has calculated that using artificial leaf to split a few litres of water a day into hydrogen and oxygen would be enough to supply all a home 's energy needs .
Scientists can already produce hydrogen by splitting water but current techniques are expensive , use harsh chemicals and need carefully controlled environments in which to operate .
The critical part of the artificial leaf project is developing catalysts made from cheap materials that can be used to split water in everyday conditions .
John Loughhead , executive director of the UK Energy Research Centre , described the artificial leaf idea as very promising because " we know that plants have already evolved to do it and we know that , fundamentally , it 's a workable process on a large scale . "
He added : " Ultimately , the only sustainable form of energy we 've got is the sun .
From a strategic viewpoint , you have to think this looks really interesting because we know we 're starting from a base of feasibility . "
Barber 's colleagues at Imperial , led by chemist James Durrant , have recently developed a catalyst from rust that carried out part of the water - splitting reaction .
So far the process is not very efficient , so Durrant 's team is looking at improving this by engineering the surface of the rust .
" We 're looking at adding small catalytic amounts of cobalt onto the surface of the iron oxide to make it more efficient . "
Nocera is also working on a catalyst made from cobalt and phosphorus that can split water at room temperature .
Speaking last year , when he published his preliminary results in the journal Science , he said efficient water - splitting technology would be useful as a way of storing solar energy , which is a major problem for anyone who wants to use large amounts of solar power .
During the day , an artificial leaf could use sunlight to split water and , at night , the stored hydrogen would be used to make electricity as it was needed .
Chemical fuels such as hydrogen can store far more energy per unit mass than even the most advanced batteries .
Both Durrant's and Nocera 's catalysts are many years from becoming commercial products .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
It 's nearly one year after the big crash , and the financial system is still functioning .
Most banks did n't go out of business or get taken over .
Your ATM still spits out cash , and Wall Street seems to be returning to some sense of normalcy .
That 's obviously good news .
And what 's even more encouraging is that the age of big bank bailouts is hopefully coming to a close .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Thursday in an appearance before the Congressional Oversight Panel that it is time to " begin winding down some of the extraordinary support we put in place for the financial system . "
Extraordinary support is an understatement .
AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) has become a ward of the state .
Taxpayers now own a third of Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) .
And Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) has received $ 45 billion in funding from the Troubled Asset Relief Program , or TARP .
But as we all look back on the events of the past year , it 's important to remember that not all banks and financial firms got blinded by greed and stung by reckless behavior .
It 's tempting to demonize the entire banking world .
But there are several regional and community banks that had the guts to tell the government that they did n't want any bailout money because they did n't want to be beholden to the Treasury Department .
And , perhaps more importantly , they simply did n't need it .
I 've dug up , with the help of research available on TARP tracker Bailoutsleuth.com , at least 54 publicly traded banks that explicitly refused to take part in TARP .
And it 's worth pointing out that several of them are decent - sized .
Hudson City Bancorp ( HCBK ) and People 's United Financial ( PBCT ) are both in the S&P 500 .
Commerce Bancshares ( CBSH ) , BOK Financial ( BOKF ) and NY Community Bancorp ( NYB ) are among the 50 largest banks in the country as ranked by assets , according to figures from the Federal Reserve .
That 's interesting considering many big - bank executives argued that they only took TARP funds because they were strong - armed into do it and thought not taking the cash would make them look weak and unworthy of government support .
That justification sounds pretty bogus now .
Consider this :
Shares of the 54 banks that did n't want a bailout are , on average , down just 16 % since last September .
That 's compared to a 30 % drop for the KBW Bank Index and 36 % plunge for the S&P Regional Bank Index .
And why did these TARP - shunning banks hold up better than their peers ?
They did n't get involved in as much risky subprime lending as other banks .
In fact , only three of these 54 banks reported a loss over the past four quarters .
What 's more , the banks that just said no are , on average , expected to report a 17 % increase in profits this year .
And the average dividend yield for the group is an impressive 3.3 % -- a testament to the fact that many of these banks were not forced to slash their dividends to preserve capital .
Now do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not suggesting that TARP was a mistake and that the government should have simply let the free markets run amok .
I argued a year ago that the bank bailouts were a necessary evil to save the financial sector from a complete meltdown .
I took a lot of flack for that stance , but I still think that the government had no choice but to launch TARP and other government alphabet - soup programs in the wake of Lehman Brother 's collapse .
That does n't mean I am happy to be putting taxpayer dollars at risk to undo the mistakes that were caused by greed and recklessness .
And the handling of the bailouts by both the Bush and Obama administrations has been , to put it mildly , sloppy .
But instead of focusing so much attention on what went wrong , the one - year anniversary of Lehman 's death is also a good time to remember that many regional banks did the right thing .
They stuck to sound lending practices and did n't wind up needing you and me to bail them out .
And they did n't get punished for refusing to bow down to Wall Street 's myopic short - term obsession with the next quarter 's results .
By sticking to their guns , they not only continued to make a profit and stay off the government dole , they also rewarded shareholders .
Hopefully the banking giants will take notice .

McCain ’s Transit Hit List : Get the Details
Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) , a self - styled foe of what he labels wasteful government spending , has launched a broadside against transit projects in the U.S. DOT ’s 2010 spending bill , which is slated for a vote this week in the upper chamber of Congress .
McCain had proposed more than 20 amendments to the legislation as of Friday — all but one of them to prohibit fellow lawmakers from earmarking Federal Transit Administration aid for local transit systems .
The GOP ’s 2008 presidential nominee frequently targets earmarks that span a broad variety of issues , although his efforts rarely succeed in peeling off more than a handful of Democrats .
Still , his target list for the 2010 spending bill that funds the DOT and the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) is notable for its focus on stifling transit .
McCain included one federal highway project on his hit list , one that appeared deliberately chosen from his home state : a $ 4.25 million earmark for the Hoover Dam bypass bridge , requested by his fellow Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl ( R ) .
Even if McCain ’s amendments fall short , as is likely , the U.S. DOT still could be blocked from spending money on clean transportation .
Sen .
Tom Coburn ’s ( R - OK ) seven proposed amendment to the 2010 bill include one that would " prohibit the use of funds for
roadkill reduction programs , transportation museums , scenic
beautification projects , or bike and pedestrian paths " until the nation ’s highway trust fund is on a firmer financial footing , according to a report in Friday ’s CQ .
After the jump , check out a full list of the transit projects that McCain aims to strike this week .

The unemployment Police pulled Claude Menard over Wednesday night for a traffic offense .
The man , in looking for his license ended up giving the police a small bag of marijuana .
That was enough for a search , and the police officer found another bag of marijuana in the car and two open bottles of beer .
Menard is charged with possession with intent to traffic and driving a motor vehicle with an open bottle of alcohol .

Why Is There so Much Horse - Race Coverage ?
Paul Krugman wonders why the media is dominated by horse - race reporting rather than substantive inquiries into policy .
His hypotheses , however , all assume agency on the part of the reporter : Maybe horse races are easier to research , he wonders , or simpler to write about .
But I 'd suggest that the problem lies more with the reader .
The media likes having an audience .
And the audience likes horse - race coverage .
One way to see this is to note that the more competitive the market , the more the focus will be on horse races , outrage , personalities , gaffes and , generally speaking , political entertainment .
PBS , for instance , has just about none of that .
Cable news , however , is entirely based around horse races and scandal .
Newspapers have a relatively high level of substance , as you might expect from institutions that long enjoyed local monopolies .
But online offerings -- think Politico , Huffington Post , or even the blogosphere -- trend toward horse races , outrage , and entertainment .
NPR is sober stuff .
Talk radio is n't .
And so it goes .
Moreover , these markets are merging .
Everyone competes online .
CNN has to fend off Fox .
The Washington Post is conscious of the challenge from Politico .
Back in the day , you could ignore audience preferences or enjoy a comfortable ignorance about them .
Today , political obsessives can waste their time anywhere .
If your outlet is n't as much fun as another outlet , they 'll abandon you .
This is the market getting more efficient .
This is the market learning how to deliver more of what people want ( Sarah Palin ) and less of what they do n't want ( the difficulties of adjusting Medicare payment rates ) .
If policy stories begin swamping servers , people will hire more policy reporters .
But there 's not much evidence of that happening .
That 's not to say there 's no room for substantive policy coverage .
But the more eyeballs matter , the less substantive coverage there 'll be , and I do n't think it 'll be the fault of reporters .
A lot of the policy coverage that happens right now exists not because the audience wants it , but because the media decides they need it .
As the market becomes competitive , that type of reportorial paternalism will become less and less viable .
Norman Borlaug speaking at the Ministerial Conference and Expo on Agricultural Science and Technology in Sacramento , California , in 2003 ( Image : US Department of Agriculture )
They do n’t make ’em like Norm Borlaug anymore .
The father of the green revolution finally lost his long battle with cancer over the weekend at the age of 95 .
I was n’t surprised : he was looking frail when I saw him last year in Ciudad Obregón , Mexico , where he had launched the revolution .
That afternoon he managed a spirited speech , in fluent Mexican Spanish , to local farmers .
But later , when I was allowed to ask him questions , he was flagging .
He complained that using crops for biofuel was pushing up world food prices and hurting the poor .
“ We had other kinds of alternative energy but we stopped developing it , ” he fumed .
“ But now I do n’t have enough energy to keep talking . ”
He was a giant of the scientific and technological revolution of the 20th century .
He probably saved more lives than the more famous names behind polio vaccines or DNA : Norm Borlaug ended famine in much of the world .
Advertisement
What an epitaph .
“ I personally cannot live comfortably in the midst of abject hunger and poverty and human misery , ” Borlaug famously said .
Some people go into science thinking they might help save the world .
Norm ’s your proof that it ’s possible .
Global shortages
Of course , there was more scope in his day .
In the 1930s , people starved in the US .
In the mid-20th century the world ’s human population soared , and there were widespread food shortages .
The answer was to apply science to increase crop yields .
Many people helped do that , but Borlaug was unique .
In 1944 the US government sent him to Mexico to fight the age - old enemy of wheat , stem rust fungus , after Mexican outbreaks had rampaged into the US breadbasket .
Borlaug devised an ingenious system to accelerate the breeding of disease - resistant wheat and beat stem rust – but he did n’t stop in Mexico .
His plants went on to vastly boost food production elsewhere , notably India and its neighbours , as famine - wracked then as Africa is now .
Hard to imagine ?
That ’s why .
Then Borlaug helped convince the big donors of his day that if one scientific advance in crop science could make that much difference , surely we needed more .
The donors listened , and the defeat of wheat rust was followed by the green revolution – similar leaps in rice and other crops , with a systematic introduction of irrigation , fertiliser and high - yielding varieties to farms worldwide .
Borlaug ’s lab in Mexico is now CIMMYT , the world centre for wheat and maize research , and part of a worldwide network of labs that continue the revolution .
Price of revolution
That ’s why some think ill of Borlaug .
The green revolution was social as well as technological , as changing farming technology meant changing land ownership and social relationships , and inevitably winners and losers .
A faction of economists has long charged that the green revolution was wrong because of these ills .
The ills surely need sorting , especially the fact that modern crops ’ thirst for water and land is not infinitely sustainable .
But I have no patience for arguments that the green revolution was a selfish capitalist plot .
Famine used to stalk the Indian subcontinent regularly : in 1943 two and a half million people starved to death in Bengal .
The green revolution stopped that .
Would continuing starvation have been better ?
The green revolution was n’t the final answer to our problems , but it was the start of the answer .
All solutions engender more problems , but it ’s scary to imagine what our world would have been without what Borlaug ’s science started .
When he got his Nobel in 1970 – he was out in the field when he got a frantic message from his wife , which he thought was a joke – it was the peace prize .
Continuing struggle
But the revolution is n’t over .
In 2007 , Borlaug was battling cancer , but not yet frail – and he was angry .
A stem rust called Ug99 had evolved to evade the rust resistance he discovered , but in the intervening years of plenty , the system for applying science to food production had become underfunded and atrophied , and was slow to respond .
“ We have been too complacent , ” he thundered over the phone .
“ We do n’t train people to keep monitoring and improving the crop anymore , and the system broke down . ”
In 2002 when Ug99 hit Kenya , Borlaug started to agitate .
“ People were paying no attention , and I got nervous .
Even though I was retired I could n’t hold my tongue . ”
The agitation helped launch work on the problem , and now progress is being made – but Ug99 is already in Iran and poised to strike beleaguered Afghanistan and , worse , the breadbaskets of India .
“ We started three years too late , ” said Borlaug .
“ We ’ll need some luck as well .
This thing could cause major human and social destruction . ”
Norm Borlaug never stopped fighting that spectre .
“ We can do another green revolution , by doing what we did before , with common sense , ” he said the last time we spoke .
He lamented the replacement of much field research by lab science , but still hoped genetic engineering will provide new disease resistance to rescue wheat and other staples .
Borlaug had harangued me before about the need for science journalists , “ because most scientists are miserable communicators ” , so just before I left him to his carers in Ciudad Obregón , I said , “ We ’ll keep telling the story . ”
He looked me in the eye and replied , “ Thank you . ”
So we will .
Rep . Ron Paul ‘s proposal to fully audit the Federal Reserve system by the end of 2010 appears likely to find its way into legislation in some form .
Mr. Paul and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank plan to meet with other lawmakers in the coming weeks to determine how the Government Accountability Office would conduct the audit and what information would be released .
What does the GAO audit now ?
The GAO ’s oversight of the Fed system is limited to areas outside of monetary policy .
That includes everything from bank supervision to consumer issues to payment systems .
The Fed ’s annual report covering the calendar year 2008 listed seven completed GAO reports and eight projects underway .
Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn testified this summer that the GAO , as of June 29 , had 19 projects underway involving the Fed , including 14 launched at the request of Congress .
What is excluded from GAO oversight ?
The GAO ca n’t review most of the Fed ’s monetary policy actions or decisions , including discount window lending ( direct loans to financial institutions ) , open - market operations and any other transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee .
It also ca n’t look into the Fed ’s transactions with foreign governments , foreign central banks and other international financing organizations .
( The GAO in 1993 produced this report on its limitations .
The Federal Banking Agency Audit
Act of 1978 put other parts of the central bank ’s operations under GAO purview , as they had been for a decade until 1933 . )
Who else audits the Fed ?
The Federal Reserve Board ’s Office of Inspector General retains an outside auditor — a private accounting firm — to review the Board ’s financial statements and compliance with laws affecting those statements .
Deloitte & Touche LLP served as the outside auditor of the Fed Board in 2007 and 2008 .
The Board selects outside auditors to audit the 12 regional reserve banks .
What would Ron Paul ’s bill do ?
H.R.1207 , called the Federal Reserve Transparency
Act of 2009 , simply directs the Comptroller General ( who heads the GAO ) to complete an audit of the Federal Reserve system — the Board and reserve banks — before the end of 2010 and report his findings to Congress .
Mr. Paul , in an interview , said he expects the audit to detail who the Fed lends to , how much it lends and what agreements it has made with foreign central banks and financing organizations .
While the bill only seeks a one - time audit , he said he wants the Fed to be audited at least annually with the report — and details of its transactions — disclosed publicly .
Where does the bill stand ?
The bill has attracted 282 House lawmakers as co-sponsors , or almost two - thirds of the chamber .
It ’s expected to receive a vote in some form by October .
Mr. Paul said in the interview that Mr. Frank , the Financial Services Committee chairman , is leaning toward incorporating the provision into broader legislation overhauling financial regulation .
But , Mr. Paul added , “ when you have that many cosponsors , there might be an opportunity to actually bring it straight to the floor . ”
A companion measure in the Senate , S.604 , is called the Federal Reserve Sunshine Act of 2009 and includes language nearly identical to the House version .
The bill , written by Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont , has 23 co-sponsors .
Xu Zhiyong , a 36 - year - old Beijing lawyer , is renowned for his spirited defense of Chinese citizens victimized by unfair arrest or consumer fraud .
Nowadays , the founder of the Open Constitution Initiative law firm will be lucky if he is able to defend himself .
Xu was seized from his home at 5 a.m. on July 29 .
His family and colleagues were given no official notice and only after a week of inquiries learned secondhand that he was arrested on charges of tax evasion .
His detention has sent a chilling message not only to China ’s lawyers but to citizens who have found themselves in need of legal representation .
“ If even a famous lawyer gets arrested , what can we ordinary little people do ? ” said Tong Zhongjun , 28 , a migrant worker whose infant son developed kidney stones from drinking tainted baby formula .
Xu ’s law firm was one of the few in China willing to represent the parents of the nearly 300,000 children sickened and the six who died last year as a result of dangerous milk additives .

Since its founding in 2003 , the firm , also known as Gongmeng , has not shied away from sensitive topics .
It challenged China ’s secret detention centers , the so - called black jails , after a 27 - year - old graphic designer who was arrested for failing to carry his identification card died in custody .
Xu represented an editor of the hard - hitting newspaper Southern Metropolis Daily who was arrested in 2004 on what were widely seen as politically motivated bribery charges .
This summer , Xu ’s firm joined the chorus of voices opposing a requirement that all computers sold in China come preinstalled with software that would filter out pornographic or controversial content .
But Xu is by no means a dissident , preferring to work within a system he has hoped to improve , not overthrow .
His pedigree is impeccable :
He earned his doctorate in law at prestigious Peking University , taught law at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and served as a representative to the People ’s Congress for the Haidian District of Beijing , where he lives .
He also was a visiting scholar at Yale Law School .

“ He had such confidence in the legal system , ” said Yang Huiwen , the only lawyer still in the offices Wednesday .
Yang said he had wanted to quit the law because of hassles by authorities , but Xu talked him out of it .
“ He always talked about how the rule of law would help China advance . ”
This has been a singularly grim year for China ’s lawyers , with some of the country ’s leading human rights advocates under arrest or denied the right to practice law .
Last month , the Beijing Justice Bureau stripped 53 lawyers of their licenses , mostly on administrative technicalities .
Xu ’s troubles began last month when the firm got a tax bill for more than $ 200,000 , an assessment made on donations it received from supporters , including Yale Law School .
Just three days later , before the firm had time to file a response , the police came and confiscated most of its computers , furniture and files .
Advertisement
Even after that , Xu was optimistic he could beat back the charges of tax evasion .
In China , civic groups such as Xu ’s cannot legally register as nongovernmental organizations , so disputes about whether they should be taxed as charities or businesses are commonplace .
The evening of July 28 , Xu met late into the night at a cafe with other lawyers , planning his defense .
But the next morning , when he failed to show up for work , colleagues became worried .
“ We were calling all his friends .
We went to the university to look for him , ” said Tian Qihuan , the firm ’s general manager .
It was n’t until the next day that they found the night guard at Xu ’s apartment complex , who confirmed that the lawyer had been arrested .
Another week went by before Xu’s brother learned from the Communist Party secretary at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications that his brother had been charged with tax evasion .
Advertisement
“ We still have n’t heard anything officially .
Under Chinese law , family members are supposed to get notification within 48 hours , but they ’ve heard nothing , ” said Tian in an interview at the law offices on Wednesday .
The offices are now virtually bare .
The files have all been seized except for those relating to the tainted - milk cases , which are still wending their way through the courts .
One of the senior lawyers at the firm , Teng Biao , managed to save those files by appealing to the conscience of the police officers as parents .
( “ How will you be able to face your kids if you take those files ? ”
Teng asked the police , the office manager said . )
Sisi Liu of Amnesty International in Hong Kong said someone of Xu ’s stature suspected of tax evasion would normally be released on bail pending formal charges .
“ Clearly , this is a politically motivated prosecution , ” she said , “ and if there is such strong political motivation , we doubt that legal procedure will be followed . ”

No one knows how long
Xu might be held without formal charges , but recent history is n’t encouraging : Gao Zhisheng , a maverick lawyer who represented members of the banned Falun Gong movement , has been held incommunicado for more than six months .

9/11 panel distrusted Pentagon testimony Commissioners considered criminal probe of false statements
The wreckage of the World Trade Center after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS September 11 attacks Pentagon Washington or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A member of the 9/11 commission said Wednesday that panel members so distrusted testimony from Pentagon officials that they referred their concerns to the Pentagon 's inspector general .
The panel even considered taking the matter to the Justice Department for a possible criminal probe , commission member Tim Roemer said .
" We were extremely frustrated with the false statements we were getting , " Roemer told CNN .
" We were not sure of the intent , whether it was to deceive the commission or merely part of the fumbling bureaucracy . "
The issues concerned Pentagon officials ' testimony about the timeline of events on September 11 , 2001 , when terrorists hijacked four U.S. airliners and crashed them into the World Trade Center , the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania .
The DOD inspector general 's probe found mistakes and has since corrected the record but found " nothing in the course of their review that indicates testimony by DOD was knowingly false , " a Pentagon spokesman said .
The Washington Post and Vanity Fair both published stories about the commission 's debate , and ABC News on Tuesday aired excerpts of military audiotapes .
" For more than two years after the attacks , officials with NORAD [ the North American Aerospace Defense Command ] and the FAA provided inaccurate information about the response to the hijackings in testimony and media appearances , " The Washington Post reported Wednesday .
" Authorities suggested that U.S. air defenses had reacted quickly , that jets had been scrambled in response to the last two hijackings and that fighters were prepared to shoot down United Airlines Flight 93 if it threatened Washington .
" In fact , the commission reported a year later , audiotapes from NORAD 's Northeast headquarters and other evidence showed clearly that the military never had any of the hijacked airliners in its sights and at one point chased a phantom aircraft -- American Airlines Flight 11 -- long after it had crashed into the World Trade Center , " according to The Washington Post .
CNN 's Barbara Starr and Pam Benson contributed to this report .

In this era of global finance the United States and China have common interests regarding trade and debt .
However , the essential character of a state is revealed not in its economic circumstances , but in its respect for human rights .
In this field the U.S. and China have little in common — as illustrated by the harrowing and heroic story of Fang Zheng .
In 1989 , Mr. Fang was among the 100,000 Chinese who flooded into Beijing 's Tiananmen Square to demonstrate for democratic rights .
He was then a Communist Party member , a student ...
Diving in Wellington Harbour in midwinter takes commitment
A New Zealand man who promised his wife he would find his wedding ring after it fell into the capital 's harbour has been successful - 16 months later .
Ecologist Aleki Taumoepeau was working in Wellington harbour last year when the ring went into just over three metres ( 10 feet ) of water .
He threw an anchor in to mark the spot , insisting he would find it .
Friends now call him Lord of the Ring , in a play on the Tolkien novel , the film of which was made in New Zealand .
" It flew off into the air and everyone on the boat was looking at it and said it was like a scene from " Lord of the Rings " in slow motion , " Rachel Taumoepeau told the Dominion Post newspaper .
The couple had been married just three months when the ring took its dive .
An initial search three months after the loss failed , but Mr Taumoepeau was determined .
He returned again recently for another dive , risking chilly midwinter temperatures .
" I was getting cold and tired so I said to God it would be really good to find the ring about now , " he said , also using new global positioning co-ordinates .
He spotted the anchor - with the ring lying just inches away .
" I could n't believe that I could see the ring so perfectly , " he said .
" The whole top surface of the ring was glowing . "
Keyboard is an Input Device – Wrong !
Asus has taken pledge to re-define the old - definition .
After their cool line - up of Eee Netbooks , they are here to revolutionize & invade the keyboards .
Specs :
This sleek device has a remarkable 5 - inch touchscreen and Ultra Wideband HDMI ( with receiver ) to connect to your HDTV .
The Eee Keyboard ’s netbook - like specs also include a 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor , 1GB of DDR2 RAM , 16 - or 32 GB solid - state hard disk , 802.11n Wi -Fi , Bluetooth , HDMI , Wireless HDMI , a USB 2.0 and ofcourse battery ( of unknown capacity ) .
And of course standard stuff – Ethernet , audio , etc .
It would be priced bit on the higher side – $ 400 - $ 500 .
And with Windows 7 debuting on October 22 , hopefully the Eee Keyboard will ditch XP altogether or may be Linux to cut costs ont hat front .
A PC in a Keyboard ?
The idea is new and will prevail for a new segment in the market .
A segment which would go mainly with the multimedia and Internet freeks .
Playing a HD movie wireless from your keyboard ( oops PC ) to HDTV , streaming online content , browsing the web would be a new experience altogether .
The built in screen is good , features full 16 bit colors , though resolution is still unknown .
It should n’t be less than that of iPhone ( 320×480 ) .
Though you ca n’t do much over the 5 ″ touch display , Asus has still smartly added a Cellphone like interface which runs apps like Doc , Facebook , browser just like your iPhone .
I ’m not sure how much will that be of utility , since it ’s not a phone - like gadget .
But still , it will primarily serve as Info and Media controller .
Fair deal .
The only thing that remains in question is How far will battery ’s juice last when you are streaming HD movies to your TV ?
If Asus does well over this , we are sure , they got it all .
The October launch is set for U.S and Europe .
Meanwhile , get the feel by watching this Hands - on Video ( via netbooknews.com )
Let us know what you think .

Earthworm castings provide many special benefits beyond what farmers or gardeners can expect from just manure or compost .
In fact , most specialists recommend that castings be used as a top dressing or supplement .
In this way , castings help make the most effective use of all your bulk soil amendments .
" A little goes a long way " because the benefits of castings are so concentrated .
In nature , composting worms tend to be highly localized , thriving in pockets of highly enriched , organic materials .
They will consume a great variety of organic wastes and excrete " worm castings " a highly valued soil conditioner .
Composting worms also tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions , which helps explain their adaptability .
Here are the results of research conducted by leading researchers around the world :
· “ Scientific studies show that worm - worked composts have better texture and soil - enhancing properties ; hold typically higher percentages of nitrogen , potassium , and phosphorous ; and may offer plants disease - fighting properties . ” [ Edwards , 1988 ] .
· " Earthworm excreta ( castings ) are an excellent soil - conditioning material with a high water holding capacity and a natural time release ' for releasing nitrogen into the soil . "
[ Harris , et. al. , 1990 ] .
· “ Vermicompost ( castings ) is a finely divided peat like material with excellent structure , porosity , aeration , drainage and moisture - holding capacity . "
[ Dominguez , et. al. , 1997 ]
· " Among the blessings of castings , vermiphiles count a smaller particle size than thermophilic compost , lower odor , enhanced microbial activity , and as a bonus , the vermicompost often contains worm cocoons , meaning a free work force for the future . "
[ Riggle and Holmes , 1994 ]
· " Through vermicomposting the humic substances showed an increase of 40 to 60 percent which was higher than the value obtained for the composting process . "
[ Dominguez , 1997 ]
· “ An important feature is that during the processing of the wastes ( manure ) by earthworms , many of the nutrients they contain are changed to forms more readily taken up by plants , such as nitrate nitrogen , exchangeable phosphorus and soluble potassium , calcium , and magnesium .
The most surprising result [ of our research ] was that even 5 % of worm - worked animal waste in the worm - worked waste / commercial mixture had a significant effect on the growth of plants . "
[ Edwards and Lofty , 1977 ]
· In a study for the EPA , researchers reported , " Passage of organics through the earthworm 's gut significantly alters the physical structure of the material .
Large particles are broken down into numerous smaller particles , with a resultant enormous increase in surface area .
As a result of the increase in surface area , any remaining odor - producing sulfides are completely oxidized , microbial respiration is accelerated by a factor of 3 , and Salmonella bacteria are destroyed at a higher rate " [ Camp , Dresser and Mckee , 1980 ] ,
· “ The results obtained for the germination index showed a beneficial effect of earthworms and the highest values of this index were recorded at the final stages of the process .
The germination index was 65 to 70 percent higher in the treatments with earthworms than in the control ( no earthworms ) . "
Regarding heavy metals : " We found a decrease of between 35 percent and 55 percent of the bioavailable metals in two months . "
[ Dominguez , 1997 ]
· " By shredding organic matter and contributing nitrogen , earthworms stimulate microbial decomposition .
Soil microorganisms live in the worm 's gut as well as the surrounding soil and so the microbial content of casts is usually more concentrated than in surrounding soil .
Microbial activity in casts improves soil structure by encouraging aggregation of particles .
Microbial secretions ( gums ) and growth of fungal hyphae stabilize the worm cast .
Worm - worked soil is relatively water - stable and will resist soil compaction and run-off due to rains . ”
[ Edwards and Lofty , 1977 ]
· “ In sum , earthworms must be seen not as a ‘ miracle pill , ’ a panacea for better soil and crop yields , but as an integral part of intelligent organic soil management practices .
As earthworms are dependent upon organic matter for food , and mulches for protection from heat cold , and drought , so do growing plants depend upon the earthworm , in combination with bacteria and other microorganisms , to maintain and improve soil structure and fertility .
When earthworms are seen as part of a living soil , existing in and contributing to a vital ecosystem , then the question of " whether earthworms create good soil , or good soil creates earthworms " becomes essentially meaningless .
Our aim is to improve our soils and grow higher yields of healthy crops , not to banter about academic questions .
In this pursuit , the earthworm has - beyond doubt - found a treasured place in the organic scheme of gardening and farming . "
[ Minnich , 1977 ]

“ All children are artists .
The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up . ” – Pablo Picasso
By Leo Babauta
Sometimes I lounge lazily in bed , in the middle of the day , with a couple of my kids and just abandon my worldly concerns , and just play .
Or I ’ll sit and just watch them play , pretending they ’re superheros or princesses or playing house or shooting each other with stick guns .
It never fails to leave me with a sense of wonder , of pure joy , of a return to innocence and a simpler time .
As grown ups , we ’ve lost this childlike sense of life .
And that ’s actually a sad thing .
It ’s not just about happiness and innocence either — being more childlike also helps us to be more creative , more imaginative , more innovative and open to worlds of possibilities .
Consider : as children , we are naturally imaginative , curious , able to play without a worry in our minds .
Some qualities of young children that happen naturally :
they live in the present
they have no concerns about money , productivity , or being cool
there are no limits to their imagination , except what they ’ve been exposed to
they play and lose themselves in play
they create with abandon
they are endlessly curious , and ask questions … without end
they love showing off to their parents
We could learn a lot from children .
Sure , they have qualities we might not want , but in my eyes , they are already perfect .
We do n’t need to mold them into people , we need to be more like them .
We lose this childlike nature , the nature we ’re born with , because of society — it has certain institutions and systems in place that beat childishness out of us , so we can be more productive citizens and consumers .
I think it ’s unfortunate .
We should n’t abandon all responsibilities , but we can learn a lot from children and be more like them in some ways .
How to be childlike
We must first acknowledge that no change is instantaneous , that any change worth keeping takes time .
But you can start today .
Start by deciding to abandon caution and to give this a try .
Start by identifying the qualities of children you ’d like to emulate : curiosity , play , living in the moment , abandoning worries , imagination , creativity , pure joy .
Observe children .
Watch how they play , how they live , how they create , how they ask questions .
Sure , sometimes they do dumb things like throw tantrums , but even in that you can see their pure abandonment of everything but what is happening to them right now .
Watch and learn .
Play with children .
If you have some of your own , great .
If not , play with children of friends and family .
Lose yourself in the play .
Be a dinosaur , or a gorilla , or a villain .
Have a joyous time .
Make them squeal in delight , and feel free to do the same yourself .
Talk with children .
Ask them questions .
Answer theirs .
Do n’t talk down to them with baby talk , but do n’t be too grownup either .
Play by yourself .
Go outside and run around , jump , slide , kick a ball around , pretend .
Forget about who might be watching .
Create like a child .
Do n’t be constrained with what people expect , what you ’re used to .
Be wild and have fun .
Imagine that things can be different , that there are no limitations , and see what happens .
Most of your childlike drawings will be tossed in the trash , but some might be put up on the fridge .
Be curious like a child .
Look at things with a child ’s eye , and ask questions you ’ve never asked before , explore with a beginner ’s mind .
Do n’t be afraid to ask why , and what if , and why not ?
Live in the moment .
Forget about all you have to do .
Forget about what happened yesterday , or that conversation you had .
Forget about that meeting that ’s coming up , or those deadlines .
Just do , and be .
See the world with new eyes .
It is a wondrous place , a miracle happening every second , a source of immense fascination that can knock you on your ass if you let it .
You are a miracle , and every moment you have is a gift .
What will you do with that gift ?
And last , if you have children , let them be childlike .
Stop trying to make them grow up .
Stop trying to shape them , criticize them , make them your own piece of clay , as Marvin Gaye said .
Let them be , and enjoy the beautiful way they already are .
FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
Sarah Palin found being governor of Alaska was too difficult and quit halfway through her first term .
But she has managed to write her memoir in just four months .
Truly amazing by any literary standards I 'm familiar with .
The title of Mrs. Palin 's book … due out a scant four months after the book deal was announced , is " Going Rogue : An American Life . "
The publisher , Harper , is moving up the release date of the 400 - page book to November 17 , so it can be on the shelves in time for the holiday book - buying season .
Harper says , " Governor Palin has been unbelievably conscientious and hands - on at every stage , investing herself deeply and passionately in this project . "
What they do n't say is that she wrote the book .
She did spend several weeks with a " collaborator " in San Diego after she quit the governor 's job .
The publisher is expecting big things of Palin 's book - ordering a first printing of 1.5 million copies .
The former vice presidential nominee was roundly criticized during the campaign for being inexperienced ; and toward the end , John McCain aides complained she was not sticking to the campaign 's plans … and had become a diva .
Since the election , Palin has been the subject of several ethics probes in Alaska , given speeches in the U.S. and overseas , and of course , has had her family drama sprayed all over the media .
The thing I 'm most interested in is whether she will go on the CBS Evening News with Katie Couric to promote the book when it comes out .
Here ’s my question to you :
What would you like to read about in Sarah Palin 's memoir ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
B. from Maine writes :
Betcha she had someone write it for her .
Betcha it was someone who speaks English , puts sentences together , and was an English major .
Let 's hope she makes a mint of money from all the ignorant conservatives out there and then retires forever and ever .
Amen
Jim writes :
Jack ,
If I wanted to even spend one minute of my life reading something shallow , trite , self - serving , poorly written and generally useless , I 'd get a transcript from any news program on Fox .
Nancy writes :
Mr. Cafferty ,
Do you suppose Sarah Palin is much more intelligent than you are ?
Perhaps that 's why she was able to write her memoirs in less time than you .
She probably did n't need all the help that you did in getting published .
John writes :
" Going Rogue : An American Life " … I think someone put an extra " f " in the title .
Brett from Denver writes :
I would like to know what it 's like for a 1950s librarian / secretary - type to live in the 21st century .
I get the impression she 's having a hard time of it .
Sue from Los Angeles writes :
How she really felt about the biased treatment she received from the media , especially Charlie Gibson and Katie Couric .
What she really thought about McCain and how he ran the campaign .
How she felt about SNL 's portrayal of her .
How she felt about the constant flow of lies regarding her family .
Isaac writes :
I just can't wait to color the pretty pictures .
Matthew from Orange , California writes :
I 'd like to read the " 75 % off " sticker on the cover of the book in January .
Inflation is caused by printing more money .
The government 's monetary policies are responsible for this .
Keynesian spending policies and ideology and the abolishment of the gold standard have permitted the government to depreciate our currency .
The answer is to eradicate state control of the money supply .
We need to divest government of its power to arbitrarily increase or decrease the money supply .
In addition , we must build in pressures toward fiscal responsibility by the government with respect to the production of balanced budgets and reduction of debt .
The federal government must learn to live within its means  government deficits must be prevented .
The establishment of the gold standard will stifle the hidden and deceptive tax of inflation .
Inflation could be controlled if government were not able to monetize debt or manipulate reserve requirements .
Defining inflation
Money is a commodity the value of which stems from its usefulness as a medium of exchange .
The best money is the one developed through the market system .
Since barter has obvious limitations , one commodity ( e.g. , gold ) arises as easier to trade and more useful as a medium of exchange .
Exchange rates ( i.e. , prices ) are established between this one commodity and each of the other goods .
Historically and pragmatically , a commodity 's ability to function as money has been transferred to money substitutes ( e.g. , the dollar ) .
Honest money is fully backed by commodities like gold .
Inflation , a monetary phenomenon , is an increase in money and credit .
Its major consequence is rising prices .
Inflation occurs when the economy 's aggregate volume of money expenditures grows at a faster rate than its total real output grows .
Inflation is thus an increase in the supply of money without a corresponding increase in the supply of goods and services .
Inflation consists of expanding a nation 's money supply by adding something other than real money ( e.g. , gold ) .
Such fiat money , backed only by government decree , produces inflation .
If the quantity of money is increased , the purchasing power of the monetary unit declines and the quantity of goods and services that can be purchased for one unit of this money also decreases .
When government expands the quantity of paper money , the purchasing power of the monetary unit drops and prices rise .
After the new money has been added to the economy , the total wealth produced is not any greater than it was previously .
With added money now being spent , but with no additional goods and services to spend it on , prices will rise .
In the U.S. , it is only the federal government and government recognized banks that can print money and / or create new dollar credit .
Why does the government inflate ?
Inflation is a dishonest and deliberate policy and tool of politicians who do not wish to reduce their spending .
The government « creates » new money in order to cover what it spends in excess of its income .
The existence of an unbalanced budget is a frequent reason for the government to print more money .
When more is spent than is raised by taxes , the government makes up the difference with fiat money .
The basic cause of inflation is the government 's unwillingness to cut its spending plans or to raise the funds it desires by increasing taxation or by borrowing from the public .
Politicians want to spend but they do not want to raise taxes .
Because higher taxes are unpopular , inflation commonly becomes the answer to deficit financing .
When the government prints more money , people do n't have to pay additional taxes , but ultimately they realize that dollars are not worth what they were previously .
Monetary debasement is a scheme in which government force is used to take wealth from people and spend it .
When the government makes new money and spends it , the effect on prices and the supply of goods and services is no different than when a private counterfeiter does so .
Exorbitant government expenditures are often the result of government efforts to redistribute income and wealth .
Inflation can be connected to the appearance of the welfare state .
Political leaders , confident in their own abilities , rationality , ability to control nature and society , and to produce continual progress , use government force to redistribute wealth in their compassionate efforts to achieve economic equality .
Additional dollars , created through the printing press and credit expansion , enable the government to spend more and support more « deserving » non-producers than it could otherwise .
Inflation transfers wealth from creditors to debtors of which the federal government is the largest .
Debtors make payment with currency that is worth less than when the debt was assumed .
Inflation repudiates government debt at the same time that it depreciates the purchasing power of the debt .
How the government inflates
The government has several ways of increasing the money supply .
Expansion of the money stock is carried out by monetizing federal debt , by Federal Reserve « ope n market operati ons , » and by credit expansion through commercial bank loans to private borrowers .
In America , the Federal Reserve System currently has control of the issuance of unbacked currency .
The government 's demonetization of gold established government - sanctioned paper as the exclusive medium of exchange .
The government blocked holders of paper money from protecting themselves from the ravages of inflation when it denied American citizens the freedom to select gold in preference to inflatable fractional reserve money .
Essentially , all the government has to do when it wants to spend more money than has been collected in taxes is to borrow non-existent money from the Federal Reserve through the issuance of government securities .
This new money is spent and deposited in banks thereby becoming the fractional reserve for even more unbacked money .
New money creation builds on itself and snowballs .
The only limits to the money supply are arbitrary reserve requirements on banks ( i.e. , the reserves in cash that a commercial bank holds against deposits ) and debt limits established by Congress .
The Treasury seldom sells government bonds directly to the Federal Reserve .
Rather , the Federal Reserve purchases bonds on the open market thus giving the Treasury room to sell its bonds on the market .
The result is the same even though the mechanics make the process a bit less obvious .
When the Federal Reserve buys government securities on the open market it expands the supply of money and credit .
Using a cashier 's check , the Fed pays for the securities with its private holdings .
The seller , in turn , deposits the check in a commercial bank .
This increases the bank 's reserve balance of cash thus enabling it to lend out several times the amount of the deposit .
Production of fractional reserve money merely requires a journal entry crediting a borrower with a sum of money and issuing a deposit receipt in this amount .
Commercial banks thus can increase the quantity of money by lending several times as much as the amounts deposited by their customers in their accounts .
The use of fractional reserves clearly demonstrates the fraudulent nature of lending claims to mythical property .
« Inflation is a dishonest and deliberate policy and tool of politicians who do not wish to reduce their spending .
The government " creates " new money in order to cover what it spends in excess of its inc ome . »
Money should be backed by a 100 percent reserve of what is used to back it .
If the government were unable to monetize its debt or manipulate reserve requirements , then obstacles to inflation would be in place .
Under a 100 percent gold reserve standard or system , there would be little or no inflation since prices would depend on the existing supply of gold .
With the inability to expand the volume of money and credit at will , the political evil of inflation would no longer be able to be perpetrated by agents of the U.S. Treasury and officials of the Federal Reserve System .
Losers and winners
Inflation is a type of tax that falls on each citizen in the form of higher prices for what he purchases .
It is analogous to a sales tax on all goods and services .
Inflation levies a tax on all who have money or have money owed to them .
Like taxes , inflation distorts prices , changes production patterns , transfers wealth from savers to spenders , discourages saving and investment , and stifles individual initiative .
A particularly evil form of taxation , inflation does not affect people in proportion to their income or wealth .
Its incidence depends on the business or industry in which one works , the elasticity of demand for different commodities , the specific forms in which a person holds his assets and debts , etc .
There is no way for the government to create new dollars or bank credit so that each person will benefit equally and simultaneously .
Inflation starts with government expansion of the money supply that immediately creates benefits for some persons while producing losses for others .
Commonly , individuals on fixed incomes and owners of bonds , loans , and savings accounts suffer losses while borrowers and property owners enjoy gains .
Some individuals have the advantage of receiving the newly created currency and bank credit sooner than others .
Such persons are able to buy more than they could previously or to offer higher prices for goods and services they desire .
People who receive the new money and credit first receive a temporary benefit at the expense of others who receive the new money or credit later .
Those receiving the new money or credit first have greater income and thus can purchase many goods and services at prices that existed at the beginning of the inflation .
The first groups spend their money when prices have gone up least ( or not at all ) and the last groups consume and pay when prices have increased the most .
When the first recipients of the new dollar offer higher prices , prices tend to be raised by the suppliers of the goods and services for which higher prices had been offered .
Shifts in income and wealth are generated by the increased number of dollars .
Those who receive unexpectedly high prices for their commodities benefit from the inflation .
They experience « windfall » profits at the expense of holders of monetary assets ( i.e. , dollars and assets fixed in number of dollars ) .
The influx of new fiat money permits people who gain access to it early to buy at yesterday 's prices .
However , there are others to whom the new money arrives much later .
They are forced to pay higher prices than they did previously for some or nearly all of the goods and services they desire to buy .
The last recipients of the new money pay higher prices while their incomes remain constant or do not go up proportionately with prices .
Inflation tends to initially create more employment .
It is likely to at first increase sales and selling prices at a faster rate than it increases expenses .
Nevertheless , this effect is fleeting and occurs only when and if inflation is unanticipated .
When individuals begin to expect inflation , they will make compensating adjustments and demands thus causing costs to catch up with selling prices .
Wages , interest , and raw materials prices increase as fast ( if not faster ) than a product 's retail price , profit margins narrow , and the businessman realizes that his profits have been illusory .
At each stage of the sequence of transactions by which the new money works its way through the economy , the advantage of receiving additional dollars declines .
Those who receive it much later must adapt to a situation in which the items they want are increasingly more expensive .
Inflation produces false market signals
Inflation falsifies economic calculations and accounting profits and leads businessmen to make errors .
Inflation misdirects production so that scarce resources are dedicated to inappropriate projects .
Illusory profits deceive producers , invite malproduction and malinvestments and make planning a nightmare .
The initial aura of prosperity dissipates as prices go up , wages lag , and business decisions brought about by false market signals produce bad results .
Inflation dampens producers ' incentives to save and invest in production facilities .
As a result , less is produced .
Furthermore , since there has been less production , there is less to consume , save , and invest .
What 's more , with less saved and invested currently , there will be less produced in the future for individuals to consume , save , and invest .
The increasing uncertainty of profits discourages new investment to a greater degree than what the overall increase in profits due to inflation does to encourage investments .
Investment , employment , and production are misdirected by inflation , and ultimately they are all discouraged by it .
When the government expands the money supply to finance its debts or to create economic prosperity , the result is higher prices .
People have more dollars but the dollar loses its purchasing power .
Inflation reduces the value of the currency and the amount of that reduction is used by the government to pay its debts .
When monetary authorities inflate and depreciate money , people are forced to accept it at face value and in full payment .
The federal government , as a huge debtor , benefits greatly from monetary depreciation .
When monetary value declines , lenders suffer losses in purchasing power while borrowers ( like the government ) gain a like amount .
Creditors are defrauded when debtors discharge their debts by exchanging inferior money .
When progressive tax rates are unadjusted for inflation , the increase in the nominal value of wages places individuals in progressively higher tax brackets thus permitting the government to collect a larger proportion of income and assets .
By denying inflation adjustments , the state can also exact more taxes from businesses .
Higher taxes are paid when depreciation and other production costs are understated and profits are overstated .
Oftentimes , when the government wants to stimulate the economy , it gets the Federal Reserve System to reduce interest rates .
To do this , it must create more spendable money .
Interest rates are decreased by increasing the supply of loanable funds .
This can be done by getting the central bank to purchase government securities or by directly monetizing debt ( i.e. , by simply printing more money ) .
When monetary authorities expand the quantity of money and credit , they cause interest rates to initially fall .
Businesses are lured into expanding by the lower interest rates .
As a result land , labor , and capital are bid up .
After a while , lenders will catch on and want a real return .
After the new money has flowed through the economy , rates will return to normal and mistakes will be evident .
Inflation deters saving and investment and promotes a search for alternatives to saving during the inflation .
Why work hard , save , and invest if the purchasing power of dollars saved is expected to fall ?
People attempt to identify and acquire a real store of value in the form of non-monetary or hard assets such as precious metals , diamonds , real estate , machinery and equipment , and rare items such as stamps , antique furniture , art works , books , coins , firearms , etc .
People will save and invest little , if any , unless they are confident that their property will be safe and that their savings and money will retain its purchasing power .
Not recognizing the government 's own responsibility for inflation , politicians assign the blame to the private sector and advocate the use of price controls to fight inflation .
They fail to understand that price controls cannot stop or even slow down inflation .
All these controls can do is reduce profit margins , discourage production , and create shortages .
Furthermore , and most importantly , they do not understand that price controls represent the antithesis of economic freedom .
Real monetary reform
Traditionally , the gold standard has been used to tie the value of money to something more constant and stable than the capricious desires of government officials .
Such an impersonal protection is needed to restrain the actions of those who hold a legal monopoly on the creation of money .
Under the gold standard , the quantity of the money supply is independent of the policies of government bureaucrats and politicians .
Gold represents value uncontrolled by government .
The gold standard takes decisions regarding the quantity of money out of the hands of politicians .
Making paper money redeemable in gold keeps the government from arbitrarily increasing the money supply .
Not only does full redeemability of the currency unit restrict government power , it also supports public confidence in money , allows market forces to work , and protects citizens from disguised taxation through monetary inflation .
The gold standard provides a market - based medium of exchange and stable monetary system through which men can exchange and save the results of their labor .
This monetary stability will force the government to abstain from monetary depreciation .
Not only would the government have to stop inflating , it would also be forced to balance its budget and eliminate many welfare programs .
Under a gold standard , politicians cannot spend more unless they raise taxes .
Under the gold standard , all claims to gold ( i.e. , dollars ) are receipts for gold and are fully convertible into a specific amount of gold .
