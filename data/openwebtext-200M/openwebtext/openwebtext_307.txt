I remember from some swift water search and rescue classes that women naturally have higher rate of survival compared to males .
Boobs are n't always a bane .
They increase the probability that a person will float chest side up .
There is a major flaw in this design , aside from being silly .
If one really wanted to improve survivability , one would have the front of the bikini bottom inflate , not the bottom .
This just going to pop off leaving the wearer naked , with out a flotation device .
Better wear the unfashionable PFD .
Before getting up on stage at a club in Oslo , 50 Cent gave an interview .
In it he denied taking coke on live TV in Zagreb and then dropped a file - sharing bombshell : " What is important for the music industry to understand is that this really doesn`t hurt the artists ! "
Wow .
No -one cares about the coke now .
Curtis James Jackson III , aka 50 Cent has been a drug dealer , he ’s been shot , he ’s a hugely successful artist – selling over 20 million albums – and he even has his own label , G - Unit Records .
Thirty minutes before getting up on stage at a club in Oslo , 50 Cent gave an interview with PÃ¥l Nordseth .
Most of the interview was spent with him denying using cocaine on live TV in Zagreb .
PÃ¥l asked 50 Cent : “ How are G - Unit Records doing in these times of file - sharing ?
“ Not so good . ” he responded .
“ The advances in technology impacts everyone , and we all must adapt .
Most of all hip - hop , a style of music dependent upon a youthful audience .
This market consists of individuals embracing innovations faster than the fans of classical and jazz music . ”
“ What is important for the music industry to understand is that this really does n’t hurt the artists . ”
Thats quite a statement .
Organizations like the RIAA are always talking about how the artists get hurt by file - sharing but 50 Cent clearly does n’t agree .
In fact , he appears to appreciate the value of a good fan , whether he buys or file - shares his music , as he explains :
“ A young fan may be just as devout and dedicated no matter if he bought it or stole it . ”
Indeed .
It ’s been said time and time again – get the music out there by any which way , fill the gigs and capitalize on the merchandising and ends will meet .
50 Cent agrees :
“ The concerts are crowded and the industry must understand that they have to manage all the 360 degrees around an artist .
They , ( the industry ) , have to maximize their income from concerts and merchandise .
It is the only way they can get their marketing money back . ”
He finishes up : “ The main problem is that the artists are not getting as much help developing as before file - sharing .
They are now learning to peddle ringtones , not records ” he said .
“ They do n’t understand the value of a perfect piece of art . ”
A huge thanks to RayJoha for his great work on this piece
The Onion ’s deadpan photography plays second funny fiddle to its stories , and therein lies a tiny problem that emerged this week :
The words are completely made up , but the pictures are very real .
This week , one of fake newspaper ’s earnest - looking everymen of 2006 ( see : “ Hero Firefighter Loses Lifelong Battle With Fire “ ) turned out to have a name and a problem .
From the CBC ’s interview with Rudy Lindia , Ottawa firefighter :
“ My 82 - year - old mother was n’t very , very impressed when she saw it — that her son , who ’s alive and well in her living room , is on some website , dead , ” said Lindia , whose colleagues now sometimes jokingly refer to him as “ dead man talking , dead man walking . ”
For using his image without asking permission , Mr. Lindia said earlier this week that The Onion should apologize .
And the satirical newspaper responded quite seriously today , according The Ottawa Citizen :
“ We feel really crummy about it and we apologize to the firefighter in question , ” said Chet Clem , a spokesman for the website .
“ But at the same time , we subscribe to a number of photo services and we have to trust that the images we buy from these photo sites are properly licensed . ”
Mr. Clem has a point , no matter how displeased Mr. Lindia may be .
In 2002 , Mr. Lindia posed for a photographer visiting his firehouse , signing a waiver in the process .
The images eventually landed at a stock photography Web site , where anyone can have them for a price .
Privacy concerns aside , the dispute may have answered a question that never needed to be asked .
As one blogger wrote in the opening line of a post on the subject , “ Ever wonder where some of those Onion pictures come from ? ”
Like Santa , the truth about these Onion regulars was meant to be hidden .
Here ’s to hoping that they do n’t start complaining , too .

Since the Six Day War , US presidents and presidential candidates have tended to speak of the US and Israel as great friends and allies .
They have also tended to favor the shrinking of Israel 's borders .
This has reached a low point under the Bush administration ,
The US alliance with Israel has been a decidedly mixed blessing .
The US alliance with Israel has been a decidedly mixed blessing .
Israel receives military and financial assistance , and also some diplomatic support at the United Nations , but the US puts pressure on Israel to surrender parts of the homeland .
Even worse , this relationship seems to foster a mentality of dependence amongst many Israelis who , it seems , cannot imagine Israel defying the United States in any major way .
In the upcoming presidential election , however , there is a chance to change this dramatically , by electing Congressman Ron Paul , a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination .
Dr. Paul favors a non-interventionist foreign policy .
He has written :
" Yet , while we call ourselves a strong ally of the Israeli people , we send billions in foreign aid every year to some Muslim states that many Israelis regard as enemies .
From the Israeli point of view , many of the same Islamic nations we fund with our tax dollars want to destroy the Jewish state .
Many average Israelis and American Jews see America as hypocritically hedging its bets ....
It is time to challenge the notion that it is our job to broker peace in the Middle East and every other troubled region across the globe ....
' Peace plans ' imposed by outsiders or the UN cause resentment and seldom produce lasting peace ....
The fatal conceit lies in believing America can impose geopolitical solutions wherever it chooses . "
In this , Dr. Paul is hearkening back to what George Washington counseled in his famous farewell address :
" The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is , in extending our commercial relations , to have with them as little political connection as possible . "
The Republican Jewish Coalition ( a fervent supporter of the Bush administration , which it claims is a great friend of Israel ) refused to invite Dr. Paul to its candidates forum because he opposes aid to Israel .
But , as we can see , Dr. Paul 's position is based upon a principled , modest , non-interventionist foreign policy - not upon anti-Zionism .
Indeed , in a way , his foreign policy is mirrored by his small government domestic policy .
Both recognize there are real limits to what a government can usefully do .
It is true that Israel is a small state in a highly dangerous neighborhood , but it is an economically and technologically vibrant country - even more so recently , as the shackles of socialism have been somewhat loosened .
Cutting the apron strings to the US would , I think , make Israel become more maturely self - confident , because it would be more self - reliant .
A Ron Paul presidency would be healthy for Israel in yet another way .
Dr. Paul is opposed to organizations like the United Nations and the International Criminal Court that dilute national sovereignty .
If the United States , in a Paul administration , withdrew from the UN and similar institutions , imagine what a blow this would deliver to their power and
Dr. Paul 's position is based upon a principled , modest , non-interventionist foreign policy - not upon anti-Zionism .
Dr. Paul 's position is based upon a principled , modest , non-interventionist foreign policy - not upon anti-Zionism .
Now , I do not support Ron Paul only for Zionist reasons , nor do I think US pressure is the primary cause for the current politically and culturally debilitated conditions of Israel .
The primary cause , in my opinion , is the self - debasement of the Hebrew nation both in the homeland and abroad .
This manifested itself most severely in the Israeli government 's expulsion of Jews from Gaza and northern Samaria , and in the almost total lack of opposition that greeted this from the Jewish Diaspora .
It seems to me a Ron Paul presidency would be good for Israel and for the United States .
Its foreign policy non-interventionism and its concern to protect national sovereignty would provide Israel with a greater impetus to increase its own independence and sense of national honor .
I hope American Zionists will resist the immediate , meretricious attractions of American financial assistance for Israel .
Ron Paul would both end this infantilizing , and even corrupting , aid and respect Israel 's national sovereignty .
Chatty Zuckerberg Tells All About Facebook Finances
Want to know about how privately held Facebook is doing from a financial point of view ?
Well , just ask Mark Zuckerberg !
This afternoon , at an all - hands meeting held in a Palo Alto , Calif. , theater near the social - networking site ’s headquarters , the 23 - year - old founder was quite voluble on that topic , outlining numbers that a more experienced CEO might think twice about unveiling to a large audience .
With an open dial - in number !
Many employees , in fact , were horrified that Zuckerberg would be so blabby about such important financial information .
Others loved it .
Most were simply surprised ( although , to be fair , Google Co-Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin used to give a lot of detailed company info to their employees before going public , but in coordination with other execs ) .
“ I ca n’t believe he was doing it , ” said one .
“ It was really unbelievable . ”
Believe it !
Some highlights ?
Revenue for Facebook for 2007 will be $ 150 million , as has been widely reported .
But for 2008 , Zuckerberg projected revenue to be increased to $ 300 million to $ 350 million .
More interesting was the news that Facebook would spend $ 200 million next year on capital expenditures , which is a whole lot of servers .
By the way , more expenses , noted chatty Mark , those employee levels would rise to more than 1,000 in 2008 from 450 now .
And Zuckerberg also said the company ’s EBITDA–earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization and a number widely used by Wall Street as an indication of operating performance –would be $ 50 million in 2008 .
That means the company would have a negative cash flow of about $ 150 million ( EBITDA minus CapEx ) , rather than break even , as it does now .
But who ’s counting ?
Zuckerberg apparently said he did not care about maintaining EBITDA anyway .
That ’s because Facebook collected $ 300 million in investments recently from Microsoft and other investors , which pegged the valuation of the company at $ 15 billion .
Vallejo is on the brink of a dubious distinction - becoming the first city in California to declare bankruptcy .
The fiscal crisis , which comes more than three years after the state took over the city 's debt - ridden public schools , is a result of snowballing police and firefighter salaries and overtime expenses coupled with plummeting tax revenue from the weak housing market , officials say .
In response , the City Council is considering cutbacks at the city 's library , its public swimming pool and its history museum as the city faces the prospects of running out of cash in the coming weeks , officials said Wednesday .
" It 's very , very serious .
We 're at the point now where there 's no more wiggle room , " said Councilwoman Stephanie Gomes .
" It 's pretty dire , and we need to start being honest about what this means . "
The Solano County city began the fiscal year with a $ 4 million surplus .
But it is spending $ 10 million more than it is receiving in revenue and will face a budget deficit of $ 6 million by the end of the fiscal year , in June , according to City Manager Joseph Tanner .
By mid-April , the city will be unable to pay its employees , Tanner said .
The council is scheduled to address the crisis at its meeting on Tuesday .
Tonight , Vallejo residents are expected to pack a town hall meeting hosted by Gomes and Councilwoman Joanne Schivley to learn how bankruptcy would affect the city of 120,000 residents .
Vallejo is hardly alone in its struggles with spiraling public safety costs .
Most cities in California spend about half their general fund on public safety , including salaries , fire engines , police cars , weapons and other supplies , said James Keene of the International City and County Management Association , based in Washington , D.C .
Cities spend about 75 percent of their general funds on personnel , while the rest goes to libraries , parks , recreation and other services , said Keene , former city manager of Berkeley .
" It 's not just Vallejo .
California has some of the highest public safety costs in the nation , " Keene said .
" In the future , as we enter a downturn , I 'd be surprised if we do n't see significant changes to that . "
Since the federal government allowed municipalities to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy during the Depression , fewer than 500 cities have taken the action , according to federal court data .
Declaring bankruptcy allows a city to reorganize its debt and still meet basic operating costs .
The highest - profile bankruptcy case in California was that of Orange County , which declared bankruptcy in 1994 after bad investments led to a $ 1.6 billion loss .
Faced with a similar fate , Vallejo is in emergency negotiations with police and fire unions in an attempt to agree on pay cuts .
The city also is considering :
-- Reducing maintenance and supplies at the Vallejo Naval and History Museum , Cunningham Pool and public library .
-- Rescinding 15 percent pay raises for police and firefighters .
-- Laying off 16 city employees .
-- Rotating closures of fire engine companies .
-- Cutting funding to all community groups .
Gomes and others have blamed much of the city 's financial woes on police and fire contracts , which she says comprise 80 percent of the city 's $ 80 million budget .
The starting salary for a Vallejo firefighter is about $ 70,000 a year , among the highest in the state .
Ten firefighters earned more than $ 200,000 each last year , including overtime , city officials said .
" Of course we value our police and firefighters and the risks they take , but their salaries are simply too high , " Gomes said .
" They can afford to live in Marin and Napa , and it 's the very hard - working , blue - collar residents of Vallejo who are bearing the repercussions .
It 's unfair . "
Firefighters say their earnings are high because the department is so short - staffed they 're forced to work huge amounts of overtime .
Since 2001 , 30 firefighters have retired or left the department , and only three have been hired , said Vallejo fire Capt .
Jon Riley , vice president of Fire Fighters Union Local 1186 .
And after rumors of bankruptcy began circulating , 14 more retired , fearing that their benefits and salaries would be cut , he said .
" We 're having to work an extraordinary amount of overtime , " he said .
" We make great salaries , but if you 're not able to see your family , what good is it ? "
Firefighters typically work 48 - hour shifts with four days off between shifts .
Many Vallejo firefighters are now forced to work 96 - hour shifts with two days off , he said .
Sleep deprivation , divorce and child - care complications are common , he said .
" I 'd say morale has hit rock bottom , " he said .
" But we 're still committed to providing the highest level of service to the citizens of Vallejo . "
Vallejo residents , meanwhile , are outraged at the city 's economic straits .
The problem should have been addressed years ago , when it first became apparent , said community activist Marc Garman .
" We 've been screaming about this for a long time , " he said .
" It 's a mess .
It 's chaos .
It 's a disaster .
Vallejo's become the poster child for mismanagement .
And this may happen throughout California . "
How to get involved --
Two city councilwomen will host a community meeting with a bankruptcy lawyer tonight at 7 p.m. , 733 Tennessee St. , Vallejo . --
The City Council meets at 7 p.m. Tuesday at City Hall , 555 Santa Clara St. , Vallejo . --

We 're left with 88 screws and lots of parts .
It 's hard to believe everything here weighs in at only three pounds .
A high - resolution image is available here .
This is the kind of thing , I imagine , that turns people into right - wing lunatics .
Walking the dog today I saw the front page headline of the San Francico Chronicle , “ Homeschoolers suffer setback : Appeals court rules parents who teach children at home must be credentialed . ”
Uh-oh .
Our daughter is only a year and a half old so we ’ve got a few years before we have to officially decide whether we ’re going to home school but that ’s the current plan .
Except that all the sudden that may no longer be an option unless this appeals court ruling is overturned , the legislature defies the teachers unions and changes the state ’s education laws to specifically allow home schooling by uncredentialed parent - teachers , or we leave the state .
Equally suddenly , I ’m on the side of the right - wingers ranting about judges legislating from the bench and the nanny state trying to take over our lives .
Heck , suddenly James Dobson of Focus on Family , who spent his radio show today decrying the ruling , is my ally .
We are not religous so that ’s not our motivation for wanting to home school , but we are not really all that different from the homeschoolers who are .
While we do n’t object to the secularism of public schools — that ’s one of their good points as far as I ’m concerned — we object to other parts of mainstream culture : the relentless consumerism , the regimentation of academic instruction , and the emphasis on competition and working for extrinsic rewards .
I ’m sympathetic to the need for society ( i.e. the state ) to look out for the welfare of kids whose parents are n’t taking proper care of them .
But to have the state tell me I have to send my daughter to the schools the state has approved and to be taught only in the way the state thinks is best makes me start thinking about holing up in a compound somewhere with too many guns and a couple years worth of canned food in the root cellar .
The quote from the Chronicle story that really killed me was from Leslie Heimov , the executive director of the Children ’s Law Center of Los Angeles .
She said her organization was mostly concerned that children be “ in a place daily where they would be observed by people who had a duty to ensure their ongoing safety . ”
Uh , would n’t parents have a duty to ensure the safety of their children .
To say nothing of looking after their education and moral development .
Hmmm , I really must be turning into a crazy right - wing nutjob .

BBC News , Baghdad
Thallium has been described as an ideal assassin 's tool ( Photo by Daniel Schwen / CC - BY - SA )
Two of the victims , both children , died after eating cake delivered to a military club in Baghdad .
Others are being treated in hospital in the Jordanian capital , Amman .
It is the first time the deadly toxin has been used since the downfall of Saddam Hussein , whose regime used it to kill its opponents .
At least two of the poison victims , the secretary of the Iraqi air force club and his daughter , are critically ill in Amman .
They and half - a- dozen other patients suffering from thallium poisoning were flown from Baghdad to Amman as the necessary treatments and antidotes were not available in Iraq .
Britain responded to a request for help from the World Health Organization and medication was flown out .
Lethal poison
Thallium was much used by Saddam Hussein 's regime against its opponents .
It has not surfaced since his overthrow .
It is an ideal assassin 's tool , being tasteless and easy to administer , and its effects take some time to appear .
It then causes a lingering and painful death .
An antidote known as Prussian Blue can be effective if taken quickly .
An investigation is under way in Baghdad , but the affair remains shrouded in mystery .
The manager of the air force club told the BBC he believed it was carried out by conspirators with a grudge against the club 's administration .
In what appeared to be a goodwill gesture , a former official delivered two cakes laced with thallium .
They were taken home by two officials and eaten by their families , who all fell ill .
For over 150 years , scientists have known that fires can be extinguished with sound waves , but they still do n't know how

You cannot really understand America without Walt Whitman – Mary Smith Whitall Costelloe , friend of the poet .
He is America ’s poet … .
He IS America – Ezra Pound
The greatest American poet is Walt Whitman .
He is often referred to as the “ poet of democracy ” and as “ the chronicler of the American character . ”
No other American poet matches him for breadth of vision about our country , nor for exploration of the political and social divisions of the United States .
One may not always agree with his vision , but one never doubts the open mindedness and basic truth in it .
As we fumble our way toward the election of a new President who must lead our country through what may well be one of its most trying periods , it would do us well to ponder some of that Whitmanesque insight .
First , for those who , like Romney , Edwards , Thompson , and Kucinich have fallen by the way ;
Have you heard that it was good to gain the day ?
I also say it is good to fall , battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won .
The Republicans , McCain and Huckabee , the poet might admonish to remember that they are Americans as well as members of their party or its more strident elements .
To John McCain he might say :
Have you learned the lessons only of those who admired you , and were tender with you , and stood aside for you ?
Have you not learned great lessons from those who braced themselves against you , and disputed passage with you ?
Judging from the main portions of the history of the world , so far , justice is always in jeopardy .
All faults may be forgiven of him who has perfect candor .
To Mike Huckabee , he might suggest this :
Be not curious about God .
For I , who am curious about each , am not curious about God – I hear and behold God in every object , yet understand God not in the least .
I say that democracy can never prove itself beyond cavil , until it founds and luxuriantly grows its own forms of art , poems , schools , theology , displacing all that exists , or that has been produced anywhere in the past , under opposite influences .
Be curious , not judgmental .
He might speak to the Democrats equally frankly .
Hillary Clinton might hear this :
The genius of the United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures , nor in its ambassadors or authors or colleges , or churches , or parlors , nor even in its newspapers or inventors , but always most in the common people .
Wisdom is not finally tested in the schools , Wisdom cannot be pass ’d from one having it to another not having it , Wisdom is of the soul , is not susceptible of proof , is its own proof .
Barack Obama would certainly be told this :
There is no week nor day nor hour when tyranny may not enter upon this country , if the people lose their roughness and spirit of defiance .
And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero .
To us , the American people , Whitman could been especially direct :
Other lands have their vitality in a few , a class , but we have it in the bulk of our people .
Produce great men ( and women ) , the rest follows .
Re-examine all that you have been told … dismiss that which insults your soul .
In these days of consideration and decision that lie before us , we would do well to remember this poem :
A Noiseless Patient Spider A NOISELESS , patient spider ,
I markâ€™d , where , on a little promontory , it stood , isolated ;
Markâ€™d how , to explore the vacant , vast surrounding ,
It launchâ€™d forth filament , filament , filament , out of itself ;
Ever unreeling themâ€ ” ever tirelessly speeding them .
And you , O my Soul , where you stand ,
Surrounded , surrounded , in measureless oceans of space ,
Ceaselessly musing , venturing , throwing , â€ ” seeking the spheres , to connect them ;
Till the bridge you will need , be formâ€ ™dâ€ ” till the ductile anchor hold ;
Till the gossamer thread you fling , catch somewhere , O my Soul .
Let us fling our gossamer threads so that they help knit our countryâ€™s tattered soulâ€¦ .
COLUMBUS -
The head of a company vying to sell voting machines in Ohio told Republicans in a recent fund - raising letter that he is " committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year . "
The Aug. 14 letter from Walden O'Dell , chief executive of Diebold Inc. - who has become active in the re-election effort of President Bush - prompted Democrats this week to question the propriety of allowing O'Dell 's company to calculate votes in the 2004 presidential election .
O'Dell attended a strategy pow - wow with wealthy Bush benefactors - known as Rangers and Pioneers - at the president 's Crawford , Texas , ranch earlier this month .
The next week , he penned invitations to a $ 1,000 - a- plate fund - raiser to benefit the Ohio Republican Party 's federal campaign fund - partially benefiting Bush - at his mansion in the Columbus suburb of Upper Arlington .
The letter went out the day before Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell , also a Republican , was set to qualify Diebold as one of three firms eligible to sell upgraded electronic voting machines to Ohio counties in time for the 2004 election .
Blackwell 's announcement is still in limbo because of a court challenge over the fairness of the selection process by a disqualified bidder , Sequoia Voting Systems .
In his invitation letter , O'Dell asked guests to consider donating or raising up to $ 10,000 each for the federal account that the state GOP will use to help Bush and other federal candidates - money that legislative Democratic leaders charged could come back to benefit Blackwell .
They urged Blackwell to remove Diebold from the field of voting - machine companies eligible to sell to Ohio counties .
This is the second such request in as many months .
State Sen. Jeff Jacobson , a Dayton - area Republican , asked Blackwell in July to disqualify Diebold after security concerns arose over its equipment .
" Ordinary Ohioans may infer that Blackwell 's office is looking past Diebold 's security issues because its CEO is seeking $ 10,000 donations for Blackwell 's party - donations that could be made with statewide elected officials right there in the same room , " said Senate Democratic Leader Greg DiDonato .
Diebold spokeswoman Michelle Griggy said O'Dell - who was unavailable to comment personally - has held fund - raisers in his home for many causes , including the Columbus Zoo , Op era Columbus , Catholic Social Services and Ohio State University .

Ohio GOP spokesman Jason Mauk said the party approached O'Dell about hosting the event at his home , the historic Cotswold Manor , and not the other way around .
Mauk said that under federal campaign finance rules , the party cannot use any money from its federal account for state - level candidates .
" To think that Diebold is somehow tainted because they have a couple folks on their board who support the president is just unfair , " Mauk said .
Griggy said in an e-mail statement that Diebold could not comment on the political contributions of individual company employees .
Blackwell said Diebold is not the only company with political connections - noting that lobbyists for voting - machine makers read like a who 's who of Columbus ' powerful and politically connected .
" Let me put it to you this way :
If there was one person uniquely involved in the political process , that might be troubling , " he said .
" But there 's no one that has n't used every legitimate avenue and bit of leverage that they could legally use to get their product looked at .
Believe me , if there is a political lever to be pulled , all of them have pulled it . "
Blackwell said he stands by the process used for selecting voting machine vendors as fair , thorough and impartial .
As of yesterday , however , that determination lay with Ohio Court of Claims Judge Fred Shoemaker .
He heard closing arguments yesterday over whether Sequoia was unfairly eliminated by Blackwell midway through the final phase of negotiations .
Shoemaker extended a temporary restraining order in the case for 14 days , but said he hopes to issue his opinion sooner than that .

Maybe they should call her a whoppet - after all , she 's a whopper of a whippet .
This is Wendy , the dog whose appearance is a long way from the usual long , lean and sleek look of her breed .
Scroll down for more ...
She was born with a genetic defect which has left her looking like the Incredible Hulk of Hounds .
While her head , heart , lungs and legs are the size of those of a normal whippet , her gene defect means she is " double muscled " .
She weighs 4st4lb - twice as much as she should - and has bulging neck muscles , burly shoulders and haunches like a baboon .
And unlike ordinary whippets known for their lithe and narrow frame , this four - year - old pedigree does n't just have a sixpack stomach , she has a 24 - pack .
Scroll down for more ...
Sadly , her mixed - up genes mean she may have a shorter life expectancy than most breeds .
But while she may look oddly menacing , her doting owner Ingrid Hansen claims the giant pooch likes nothing better than clambering up on to your lap to have her back scratched .
" People have referred to her as Arnold Schwarzenegger , " she said .
" She 's healthy and happy .
That 's all that counts .
" She does n't know she 's got a genetic defect .
She might give you a nasty lick , that 's all . "
Scroll down for more ...
The whippet , who lives on a farm in Victoria , Canada , has been the subject of an American genetics study .
Although the dogs are customarily bred for hunting , racing and showing , Wendy enjoys a slower pace of life .
She spends her days prowling around the fields , chasing other dogs and horses and sleeping on her owner 's bed .
This week the Daily Mail reported on another canine phenomenon , 19st10 lb Samson .
A cross between a Great Dane and a Newfoundland , the dog from Boston , Lincolnshire , is 37in at the shoulder and stands 6ft5 in on his hind legs .
THE RACE FOR DELEGATES THE RACE FOR DELEGATES USA TODAY 's interactive delegate tracker shows where the presidential candidates stand as they seek their party 's nomination .
WASHINGTON  While Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama wage an intense contest to win the support of " super delegates " who may decide the party 's nomination , getting an exact count of those elected officials and party insiders depends on the day of week .
Vacancies , deaths , elections and even moving from one state to another can alter the super - delegate rolls .
Consider New York .
When Eliot Spitzer officially departs as governor Monday , the state will be down one super delegate .
His successor , Lt. Gov. David Paterson , is already a super delegate as a member of the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) , but Paterson will not get two presidential votes .
Spitzer and Paterson had announced support for Clinton .
All super delegates are free to back whomever they choose at the national convention .
As of Wednesday afternoon , there were 796 super delegates , said DNC spokeswoman Stacie Paxton .
" On Monday , I 'm guessing it will be at 795 again , " she said .
" It 's a floating crap game , " Democratic strategist Peter Fenn said of the ever - shifting count .
" The rules are so arcane and wacky , you 'd have to have a Ph.D. in math and political science to figure it out . "
Kenneth Curtis , a former two - term Maine governor , has found himself on the short end of the delegate math .
Curtis is a Democratic super delegate by virtue of his position as a former DNC chairman .
Two years ago , he left Maine and moved to Sarasota , Fla. , " for the weather . "
Now , Curtis is out in the cold because the DNC has stripped Florida — along with Michigan — of all its delegates as punishment for moving its primary earlier .
Clinton won the primary Jan. 29 .
Neither Democrat campaigned in the state , and the candidates and state officials are squabbling over how to count Florida 's 211 delegates , which include the state 's 26 super delegates .
Michigan has 156 delegates , including 28 super delegates .
Curtis , a Clinton supporter , said he finds the DNC 's sanctions " troubling " and will skip the national convention in Denver if the Florida primary is n't resolved .
" Unless my vote counts , I do n't think I can go through all the hoopla of a national convention again , " said Curtis , 77 .
In addition , special elections this week that put two new Democrats in Congress also jumbled the count .
André Carson , 33 , is the nation 's newest super delegate .
He has to decide which candidate to support .
The Indiana Democrat was elected to Congress on Tuesday to fill the House seat of his late grandmother , Julia Carson .
Clinton and Obama both called to congratulate him late Tuesday night — and in the weeks leading up to the election , their surrogates pressed for his endorsement , spokeswoman Kyra Jennings said .
Jennings said Carson , who will be sworn in to office today , does n't know when he 'll make up his mind .
" He 's just focused now on getting to Congress , " she said .
New Illinois Rep. Bill Foster , who was elected Saturday , has made his choice .
He supports Obama , his home state senator .
Super delegates such as Foster represent roughly one - fifth of all delegates to the party 's national convention Aug. 25 - 28 in Denver .
Their ranks include Democratic members of Congress , Democratic governors , more than 400 DNC members and a small cadre of " distinguished party " leaders , such as former presidents and DNC chairmen .
Paxton said the super delegate numbers " always fluctuate " because the DNC does n't have a fixed number of super delegates .
There are four more special elections to fill vacated House seats scheduled in the coming months , so the numbers could shift yet again .
Few people ever paid close attention to super - delegate counts before this year , Fenn noted .
But the presidential race is so close , neither Democrat is likely to secure the nomination without the support of these party insiders .
" In the hand - to - hand combat for every single delegate , " Fenn said , " these numbers matter . "

McCain's Consistent Folly on Iraq
On the campaign trail , John McCain has retreated on immigration , changed his mind on tax cuts and admitted economics is not his strong suit .
But all that 's unimportant , we are told , because he was Right On Iraq -- back at the beginning , when he endorsed the invasion , and again over the past year , when he has stoutly supported the surge .
So , whichever Democrat he faces , the November election could be a referendum on the Iraq war and his support for it .
If so , that may not be a plus for McCain .
McCain has been consistent about Iraq , in the sense of being consistently wrong .
If the American people get a long look at what he 's said and a clear picture of our fortunes in Iraq , he may yearn for the days when he was being pilloried for offering " amnesty " to illegal immigrants .
McCain portrays himself as uniquely clear - eyed about the war .
In fact , those eyes have often been full of stars .
When Army Gen. Eric Shinseki forecast that more troops would be needed for the occupation , McCain did n't fret .
Shortly before the invasion , he said , " I have no qualms about our strategic plans . "
As the online magazine Salon reports , he predicted the war would be " another chapter in the glorious history of the United States of America . "
He brags now that he criticized Donald Rumsfeld 's handling of the occupation .
But McCain did n't declare " no confidence " in him until a year and a half after the invasion .
And let 's not forget the day he took a stroll through a Baghdad market , guarded by attack helicopters and 100 soldiers in full combat mode , to prove how safe Iraq was .
The following day , 21 Iraqis were abducted from the market and murdered .
McCain 's attempts to show off his expertise often turn into banana peels .
Recently he attacked Barack Obama for saying that in the future , he might send forces back in " if al - Qaida is forming a base in Iraq . "
Jeered the Arizona senator , " Al - Qaida already has a base in Iraq .
It 's called al - Qaida in Iraq . "
But al - Qaida in Iraq has about as much to do with al - Qaida in Afghanistan as the San Diego Padres have to do with the Catholic Church .
It 's a separate , independent and largely homegrown group that is focused on slaughtering Iraqi Shiites , not targeting American cities .
And here 's a newsflash for McCain :
It did n't exist until our invasion created conditions favorable to violent insurgency .
It 's true that eventually , McCain did call for more troops , and eventually , President Bush agreed .
Last January , he announced that he was boosting forces to quell violence -- while telling the Iraqi government to move promptly toward internal reconciliation and power - sharing .
All this would produce a stable , democratic Iraq and " hasten the day our troops begin coming home . "
More than a year later , security is better .
But nothing else is .
The Baghdad government has failed to do the things Bush called for , and there is no sign that our troops will be coming home anytime soon , if ever .
Provincial elections , which were supposed to be held last year , remain somewhere over the rainbow .
A landmark de-Baathification law turned out to be a scam , with the purported beneficiaries complaining it was even worse than the old policy .
Bush said the Iraqi government would assume responsibility for security across the entire country by November 2007 .
We 're still waiting .
The point of the surge was to catalyze rapid progress that would facilitate our departure .
But now the Pentagon says that come July , we 'll still have more troops than the 132,000 we had before .
When Lt. Gen. Carter Ham was asked if the number will fall below 132,000 by the time Bush leaves office , he replied , " It would be premature to say that . "
McCain says the current " strategy is succeeding in Iraq . "
His apparent definition of success is that American forces will stay on in huge numbers as long as necessary to keep violence within acceptable limits .
We were told we had to increase our numbers so we could leave .
Turns out we had to increase our numbers so we could stay .
Five years after the Iraq invasion , we 've suffered more than 30,000 dead and wounded troops , incurred trillions in costs and found that Iraqis are unwilling to overcome their most basic divisions .
And no end is in sight .
If you 're grateful for that , thank John McCain .
Bozeman â€ “ Research from ancient sediment cores indicates that a warming climate could make the worldâ€™s arctic tundra far more susceptible to fires than previously thought .
The findings , published this week in the online journal , PLoS ONE , are important given the potential for tundra fires to release organic carbon â€ “ which could add significantly to the amount of greenhouse gases already blamed for global warming .
Montana State University post - doctoral researcher Philip Higuera is the lead author on the paper , which summarizes a portion of a four - year study funded by the National Science Foundation .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
Higuera and his co-authors examined ancient sediments from four lakes in a remote region of Alaska in and around Gates of the Arctic National Park to determine what kind of vegetation existed in the area after the last ice age , 14,000 to 9,000 years ago .
By looking at fossilized pollen grains in the sediment cores , Higuera and his co-authors determined that after the last ice age , the arctic tundra was very different from what it is now .
Instead of being covered with grasses , herbs , and short shrubs , it was covered with vast expanses of tall birch shrubs .
Charcoal preserved in the sediment cores also showed evidence that those shrub expanses burned â€ “ frequently .
â€ œThis was a surprise , â€ Higuera said .
â€ œModern tundra burns so infrequently that we donâ€™t really have a good idea of how often tundra can burn .
Best estimates for the most flammable tundra regions are that it burns once every 250 - plus years.â€ 
The ancient sediment cores showed the shrub tundra burned as frequently as modern boreal forests in Alaska â€ “ every 140 years on average , but with some fires spaced only 30 years apart .
Higueraâ€™s research is important because other evidence indicates that as the climate has warmed in the past 50 to 100 years , shrubs have expanded across the worldâ€™s tundra regions .
â€ œThere is evidence of increasing shrub biomass in modern tundra ecosystems , and we expect temperatures to continue to increase and overall moisture levels to decrease .
Combine these two factors and it suggests a greater potential for fires , â€ Higuera said .
â€œThe sediment cores indicate that itâ€™s happened before.â€ 
The worldâ€™s high latitude tundra and boreal forest ecosystems contain roughly 30 percent of the planetâ€™s total soil carbon .
Currently , much of the carbon is locked in permafrost .
But a warming climate could cause the permafrost to melt and release its carbon stores into the atmosphere where it would contribute to the greenhouse effect .
â€ œVegetation change through an increase in shrub biomass and more frequent burning will change a great deal of the carbon cycle in these high latitudes , â€ Higuera said .
â€œWe donâ€™t fully understand the implications , except that itâ€™s reasonable to expect that carbon that was previously locked up could enter the atmosphere.â€ 
The paper is the first in a series Higuera expects to publish from his field work .
Future papers will examine how climate , vegetation , and fire regimes have interacted over the past 15,000 years in the region .
If the last energy bill was about squeezing remaining drops of oil from US soil , the newest is still a nascent , muddy legislative donnybrook over one question :
Who will pay to shift the US energy mix to green and lean ?
Energy - conservation measures in House and Senate bills approved earlier this year could by 2030 save the US twice as much oil as it now imports from the Persian Gulf , slash greenhouse - gas emissions by 40 percent , and reduce electricity use by at least 10 percent .
If key elements of the two bills now being reconciled behind closed doors make it into the final version , the result would be the biggest shift in US energy use since the 1970s – and underpin larger greenhouse - gas cuts in future legislation , observers say .
" We have n't seen any plan this significant in terms of oil savings since the 1970s , " says Bill Prindle , deputy director of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy in Washington .
While electric - efficiency gains would be more modest , they would save consumers billions of dollars on utility bills and eliminate the
need for dozens of new power plants .
Senate majority leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are pushing to give the president a bill to sign no later than Christmas – before the 2008 election cycle hits .
To do that , they must reconcile two starkly different energy bills – and avoid a White House veto .
Two key but controversial measures hang in the balance : tougher Corporate Average Fuel Economy ( CAFE ) standards for cars and trucks as well as a national Renewable Portfolio Standard ( RPS ) for utilities to require more green power .
Three other important pieces enjoy broad legislative support : the " Renewable Fuels Standard " requiring more ethanol use in gasoline , tougher electrical efficiency standards for appliances and lighting , and a production tax credit for renewable energy .
But industry groups – oil , coal , auto , and electric utilities – worry that they will have to foot most of the cost of any new energy legislation , which could run up to $ 32 billion .
Most new green measures would be paid for by repealing tax incentives of $ 16 billion ( House bill ) to $ 32 billion ( Senate version ) that now flow to the oil and gas industry .
" Neither of those bills answers the question of how we produce more energy or how we get more energy into this country , " says Mark Kibbe , senior policy analyst for the American Petroleum Institute , a Washington trade association representing large oil companies .
" While there might be some good in these bills , the negatives outweigh it . "
Even those not hit by tax break repeals worry over anticipated higher costs of compliance .
The House bill , for instance , includes a new national RPS , requiring all electric utilities by 2020 to generate at least 15 percent of their power from renewable energy sources , such as biomass , wind , or geothermal .
Although 25 states already have such requirements – many of them far tougher than the proposed national RPS – utilities in the Southeast and elsewhere oppose a federal standard that does n't take geography into account .
" We oppose any federal legislation that does not recognize regional differences because it would be an unfair burden , " says Mike Tyndall , a spokesman for the Southern Company , an Atlanta - based utility serving the Southeast .
" We have extremely limited cost - effective solar and wind resources compared with other parts of the country . "
A recent compromise plan in the House - Senate negotiations would permit utilities to count energy - efficiency gains for roughly a quarter of the 15 percent mandate .
That could broaden support for the measure , which is considered likely to survive in the energy bill despite a presidential veto threat , observers say .
The leadership in both the Senate and House favor it and it has passed the Senate three times since 2002 .
" I think it 's most likely there will be an RPS , " says Leon Lowery , a staffer on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources .
" The South has one of the best renewable - energy sources in the country , and it's not wind , it 's biomass . "
Mr. Tyndall agrees biomass is promising but says its immediate prospects are small .
" To attain a 15 percent level with biomass would be very difficult to achieve as a practical matter , " he says .
A key part of the legislation is the Senate 's provision for new CAFE standards in which cars and light trucks achieve a fleet average of 35 miles per gallon ( m.p.g. ) by 2020 , a 40 percent increase that would slash greenhouse - gas emissions from cars by about 15 percent , experts say .
Automakers support a softer bill pending in the House that would keep the dual auto and truck mileage system , while raising fuel economy by a combined fleet average of 32 to 35 m.p.g. by 2022 .
The automakers may hold a trump card .
In a shot across Congress 's bow , Allan Hubbard , director of the president 's National Economic Council , wrote Speaker Pelosi Oct. 18 threatening a presidential veto if a final energy bill did not meet a laundry list of concerns and " maintain separate attribute - based standards for cars and light trucks . "
Some observers see a compromise brewing .
" What we 're seeing is probably the auto industry 's best break in a generation for how things could come out for them , " say Kevin Book , a senior vice president at FBR Capital Markets , an Arlington , Va. , investment firm .
While Mr. Hubbard 's letter also includes a threat to veto any bill with an RPS mandate , Mr. Lowery and others see some wiggle room .
" It was a very carefully worded letter , " Lowery says .
" It said that senior advisers would recommend veto – not that the president himself would veto this bill . "
It wo n't be as easy as a tiny vowel change .
On Sunday the new Republic of Kosova ( formerly Kosovo ) declared itself independent , the world 's newest country , but several countries are refusing to recognise it - perhaps unsurprisingly , mainly countries that have most to lose from emboldened secessionist movements , such as Russia , Spain and Greece .
There are hundreds of secession movements across the world ( as many as 30 US states including Vermont , Texas and Alaska have groups wanting to form breakaway republics ) .
" For many it 's a chance to express their culture , language or religion more freely , " says Andrew Swan of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation , which was set up to represent indigenous people , minorities and unrecognised or occupied territories .
Are there economic advantages ?
" There can be .
The Ogoni , for instance , live in a region in the major oilfield areas of Nigeria .
Even though it is one of the richest areas of Nigeria , they remain the poorest people in the country . "
The UNPO has 69 members , from Abkhazia ( seeking independence from Georgia ) to Zanzibar ( Tanzania 's semi-autonomous islands ) , representing 150 million people .
It promotes nonviolent self - determination , which , given that violence is almost always a feature of secession , excludes many potential members .
Here in the UK , Scottish and Welsh independence is not inconceivable in the future .
The territory of Western Sahara , currently under Moroccan control , has been in talks with the UN .
John Donaldson , research associate at the International Boundaries Research Unit at Durham University , thinks South Sudan is a region to watch .
" In 2011 , it will have a referendum on independence , " he says .
Other states , such as Somaliland , have claimed independence without being recognised by the international community .
" Northern Cyprus has also declared itself independent , " says Donaldson , " but only Turkey has recognised it as an independent state .
Politically , it can be very complicated , and there are no fixed rules on which states should be recognised as independent and which cannot . "

Our Third World America
I 've found when you talk to oil company types about the mideast that they barely recognize any possibility they 're exploiting anyone .
" Before we showed up , " they 'll say , " these countries were n't even doing anything with all that oil .
And they could never have used it properly without us . "
Whatever the moral merits of this perspective , it 's always the case that third world countries fail to capture the value of their own resources .
That 's almost the definition of being third world .
The important profits do n't flow to the people on whose land the resources are found ( who often get some low fixed price rather than a meaningful percentage ) , but to the companies from elsewhere which understand how to exploit the resource .
That makes perfect sense to us when it involves " American " oil companies operating in the mideast .
I wonder how much sense it will make to us in the future ?
SWEETWATER , Tex. —
The wind turbines that recently went up on Louis Brooks ’s ranch are twice as high as the Statue of Liberty , with blades that span as wide as the wingspan of a jumbo jet .
More important from his point of view , he is paid $ 500 a month apiece to permit 78 of them on his land , with 76 more on the way ...
Texas , once the oil capital of North America , is rapidly turning into the capital of wind power ... Supporters say Texas is ideal for wind - power development , not just because it is windy .
It also has sparsely populated land for wind farms , fast - growing cities and a friendly regulatory environment for developers ...
“ Texas could be a model for the entire nation , ” said Patrick Woodson , a senior development executive with E.On , a German utility operating here .
Much of the boom in the United States is being driven by foreign power companies with experience developing wind projects , including Iberdrola of Spain , Energias de Portugal and Windkraft Nord of Germany .
Foreign companies own two - thirds of the wind projects under construction in Texas .
It would be interesting to read really serious business journalism about where the money from wind power goes .
Certainly as it's presented in this article , this phenomenon does n't bode well .

An artist 's impression of the Great Pyramid It sounds like an absurd idea .
The plan is to build a massive pyramid , filled with human remains , on a windswept field near the city of Dessau , eastern Germany .
But the organisers of the project are adamant that this is not a PR stunt .
There were pyramids in ancient Egypt , so why not in modern - day Germany , they argue .
" We 're doing this because the world wants it , " said Jens Thiel , one of the initiators of the project .
See how the pyramid could grow " The new Great Pyramid would be a very efficient cemetery .
It would have a huge capacity .
A 150 m - high pyramid could contain five million stones , it would be the size of six football fields and millions of people could be buried there . "
Mr Thiel , an economist , has teamed up with a writer , Ingo Niermann , to develop the project and they have managed to secure a government grant .
It 's the first cemetery for people of all nationalities and all religious beliefs
Jens Thiel
Friends of The Great Pyramid
They say more than 700 people from all over the world have already reserved a stone , keen to have their ashes kept in the giant structure .
In the future , these people will be able to buy a stone , which would cost up to 700 euros ( £ 535 ; $ 1,070 ) each .
" Lots of people do n't like normal cemeteries .
In Britain , 50 % of people want their ashes to be scattered , in the US it is about 40 % , " said Mr Thiel .
" The new Great Pyramid is a global monument .
It 's the first cemetery for people of all nationalities and all religious beliefs .
It is a very beautiful , peaceful idea . "
Each concrete block would house an urn containing ashes , or memorabilia of the deceased .
Architectural competition
The organisers say the pyramid would grow gradually over the years .
It 's a very graphic way of dealing with the topic of death
Rem Koolhaas
architectural competition chief " I 've reserved a stone in the new pyramid because I want to be part of the project .
It 's very simple , I want to be cremated and I want my ashes to be buried there , " said Jonas Obleser , a neuroscientist from Leipzig .
" The new pyramid is not a monument built for one king , it will be there for people of all faiths , for atheists , for everyone .
It will grow for thousands of years .
I would like to be one of the first people to be buried there . "
The organisers launched an architectural competition for the construction of the pyramid last September .
Architecture firms submitted their plans .
and the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas headed the jury to select the final concept .
On Monday , several hundred people attended a gala evening in Berlin to hear the latest developments .
" We have seen four different interpretations of the pyramid - they are all interesting concepts , " Rem Koolhaas said .
" In the West , we have been very phobic about death , but because of demographics , death will be imposed on all of us .
" There is a constant ageing process - it 's important that this issue is addressed and it's a very graphic way of dealing with the topic of death .
I 'm curious to find out what happens in the end , " Mr Koolhaas said .
' Taboo '
Originally , the plan was to build the pyramid on a derelict site near Dessau .
The organisers say the pyramid would act as a catalyst for job creation and economic growth - but many local residents are not so enthusiastic about the project .
" Death is such a taboo , " said Mr Thiel .
" We 're looking at different sites .
We could build the Great Pyramid anywhere in the world .
It would be a kind of theme park about life and death . "
Supporters are hoping the pyramid will find its resting place in Dessau .
" It would be beautiful if the pyramid could be built here in Germany , " said Mr Obleser .
Sceptics will argue that this is a far - fetched idea and opponents are bound to come up with a reactionary " not - in - my - backyard " response .
The odds seem to be stacked against them , but organisers are determined to prove that they can fulfil their dreams .

What are these ?
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - European Union leaders agreed on Friday to consider at the request of Britain and France how sales tax breaks for environmentally friendly products could help fight global warming , a British official said .
The leaders added a clause to their summit declaration inviting the European Commission “ to examine how Value Added Tax can play a positive role in combating climate change ” , even though Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso made clear on Thursday he did not favor the idea and there was no consensus .
“ It ’s a polite way of saying ‘ No ’ , ” an EU diplomat said , noting that all EU tax decisions have to be taken by unanimity .
“ It ’s a way of saving face on both sides . ”
In a move to boost national security and make key identity documents harder to forge , Germany will require fingerprints on all passports issued as of Nov. 1 , 2007 .
The electronic fingerprints , as well as the biometric digital photograph already required , will be stored on an invisible , electronically scannable data chip on the inside flap of the document .
The new technology aims to make the passport more secure .
By using biometric data , border guards can see whether passport and carrier actually belong together .
Testing was positive , authorities say
" Security has taken a quantum leap , " Matthias Merx of the Government Printing Office in Berlin told the AP news service .
The printing office is issuing the new passports .
German passports are already hard to forge , some argue
Authorities say test runs with the new passports , whereby the passport - holder 's two index fingers are electronically scanned , have gone smoothly so far .
They are n't expecting a great outcry from opponents on the issue , Martin Schallbruch , IT director in the German Interior Ministry , told reporters .
" The fingerprinting ( in the test phase ) went off without a hitch , " Schallbruch said .
" The citizens were very relaxed about it . "
Germany is the first EU country to add the fingerprints to its passport -- part of a plan put forth by the previous German government in response to growing terrorism concerns .
The plan was eventually passed as an EU guideline .
Opponents label move " security risk "
But data protection activists have raised the alarm , saying the change is an infringement on personal liberties and a poor security measure to boot .
The Chaos Computer Club , a nonprofit group aimed at bringing attention to problem spots in modern electronic security , has labeled the new passport a " security risk . "
The group worries the data could be read secretly , using long - distance scanners .
It recommends carrying an electronic - chip passport in a protective envelope .
But passport expert Schallbruch said long - distance data reading is highly unlikely , considering the complex security mechanisms built in .
Data can only be read with certain equipment , and then only from a distance of 10 centimeters .
Uncertainty about data files
Opponents of the new documents also were alarmed that the fingerprints are to be kept on file at local identification registry offices until the passports are issued and mailed out -- a process that can take up to six weeks .
The future is now ?
Scanning devices can raise privacy issues
Meanwhile , even Schallbruch acknowledged it is " technically possible " for the police to access those files during the waiting period .
But the fact that the prints are not centrally registered means access to them is difficult , and most likely illegal , he said in a conversation with Berlin 's taz newspaper .
Still , there are still exceptions .
For instance , in a criminal case , the court can seize the registry office fingerprint records of a suspect .
" Fingerprints are easy to counterfeit "
Furthermore , data - protection activists also question whether passport offices will actually erase the personal data on file in a timely manner .
Other activists call into question the logic behind the plan overall .
According to authorities , the fingerprints are supposed to make it harder for criminals to forge passports .
But Thilo Weichert , who is in charge of data - protection for the northern German state of Schleswig - Holstein , said the chances of passport forgery in Germany were quite small in the first place .
Unlike this one , the passport prints are electronic and ink-free
The idea that electronic fingerprints make counterfeiting passports more difficult is " nonsense , " he said , and added : " There is hardly a passport that is already as difficult to copy as our German one . "
Frank Rosengart , a spokesman for Chaos Computer Club , agreed .
" Fingerprints are some of the easiest things to counterfeit , " he said .
His group has produced a video showing how easy it is to create false prints with " a little glue and a digital camera . "
Weichert added that anyone using their passport as identification outside of Germany , say at a hotel desk , runs the risk of having their identity stolen .
" It is a big danger in the USA and Great Britain .
In other countries , identity theft is very , very advanced .
In my opinion , the new passport raises the possibility that this will increase in Germany as well . "

2007 has seen all kinds of evolutions on the experience of gaming , and while we perhaps have n't hit yet on that elusive formula for true emotional engagement , this year 's offering feels a lot like nudging up against the boundary of everything we 've previously believed games are capable of being , in terms of the ways they can affect , immerse and even permanently change us .
As the industry struggled to find that magic balance between story and gameplay , compelling characters took front and center .
The reasons we play span from getting the opportunity to be a hero - or a villain - to experiencing a new perspective , a different ability , a new angle on the world , a new sense of a self that is not us .
It can be argued that the key to a game experience is a lucky cocktail of features that make us love - or loathe - our characters , that our final impression will hinge on what that character was , or was not able to do .
With that in mind , we take a look this week at five of the year 's most aberrant , interesting , compelling and effective characters in games .
Minor spoilers .
Aside from some pretty colors and lovely music , as an RPG , was ordinary in most ways - and that 's the remarkable thing .
That one of the most derivative genres in console gaming could so seamlessly integrate the life , history and musical work of a real - life composer in such a facile , cavalier way stands out as one of those examples of the kind of engagement that games can make possible .
After all , Fr�d�ric Chopin isa fictional character , and the interpretation of his life as a dream in a fantasy game encouraged more than a few RPG fans to learn about him , maybe play a piano tune or two .
And a character becomes much more thought - provoking given the concept that everything you are playing and seeing might just be a dream in the head of a man as he dies .
The firstmade a compelling anti-hero of the haunted soldier , andbrings us Kratos as a God .
With character conventions that could serve as a primer on Greek tragedy , the piquant conflict between Kratos ' condition of power and his inner torment and powerlessness gives greater relevance to the almost artful , ravenous violence that characterizes the gameplay , with each brutal stroke conveying the desperation of bitterness and a quest for redemption and absolution that remains ever out of Kratos ' reach .
The architect of 's Rapture serves as a cautionary example of the danger of pure philosophy .
Though he 's introduced as an antagonist , Ryan quickly becomes as sympathetic as he is so bitterly wrong - despite his hard - line objectivist - influenced ideals that delineate artists from parasites , men from slaves , his greatest crime save for fatal arrogance was perhaps believing in humankind too much .
When the ensuing conflict forced him to compromise , over time , his ideals , that uncompromising faith in his beliefs were worth sacrificing his life to attempt to convey to his son .'s one weakness was that , as that son , the player could n't elect to adopt that philosophy to thwart his own abuse .
The sleeper hit of the year , , could n't have brought phrases like " I 'm doing science " into common parlance without GLaDOS , the decaying mainframe computer with a personality disorder .
The relationship between GLaDOS and the protagonist has been called everything from passive - aggressive to maternal to an out - and - out feminist manifesto .
An antagonist who joyfully lies and then admits it , and then contradicts it again , who praises and then excoriates , threatens and begs , who sings you a song when you defeat her -- is undoubtedly an excellent game , but GLaDOS is what really makes it happen .
This year 's trends showed us clearly that networked gaming is here to stay .
Social virtual worlds inspired by game concepts did a tentative introductory dance around gaming itself , and social networking , communication and personalization quickly distinguished themselves as lynchpin features that suddenly no game can do without .
Blizzard 's unshakablenation seems invincible , allowed players to customize the protagonist to an unprecedented degree -- from every response he or she has , right down to the width of the eyes .
Much was also made this year of choice in games as an absolute necessity - the player wants to personalize the experience , see themselves reflected in it .
After chafing for years under conventions that forced film - like linear stories on players perhaps too hard , gamers have quickly declared that they 're quite happy to make their own stories , to place their preferences and their own character concepts front - and - center in an open world .
The audience has set a new bar for the year to come , as gamers begin demanding game experiences where their own will is the star .

Early humans may have dug potato - like foods with tools , say anthropologists from USC , UC San Diego and UW - Madison
Chimpanzees crave roots and tubers even when food is plentiful above ground , according to a new study that raises questions about the relative importance of meat for brain evolution .
Appearing online the week of Nov. 12 in the early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the study documents a novel use of tools by chimps to dig for tubers and roots in the savanna woodlands of western Tanzania .
The chimps ' eagerness for buried treats offers new insights in an ongoing debate about the role of meat versus potato - like foods in the diet of our hominid ancestors , said first author Adriana Hernandez - Aguilar , who collected the field data for her doctoral research at the University of Southern California .
The debate centers on the diet followed by early hominids as their brain and body size slowly increased towards a human level .
Was it meat - and - potatoes , or potatoes - and - meat "
" Some researchers have suggested that what made us human was actually the tubers , " Hernandez - Aguilar said .
Anthropologists had speculated that roots and tubers were mere fallback foods for hominids trying to survive the harsh dry season in the savanna 3.5 million years ago and later ( hominids are known to have consumed meat at least as early as 2.5 million years ago ) .
But the study found that modern chimps only dig for roots during the rainy season , when other food sources abound .
The finding suggests , but does not prove , that hominids behaved the same way .
Researchers view modern chimps as proxies for hominids because of similarities in habitat , brain mass and body size .
" We look at chimps for the way that we could have behaved when our ancestors were chimp - like , " Hernandez - Aguilar said .
Corresponding author Travis Pickering , of the University of Wisconsin - Madison , said : " Savanna chimps , we would contend , are dealing with environmental constraints and problems - evolutionary pressures - that our earliest relatives would have dealt with as well . "
The tuber - digging chimps " suggest that underground resources were within reach of our ancestors , " added co-author James Moore of the University of California at San Diego .
The study was based on observation of 11 digging sites in the Ugalla savanna woodland of western Tanzania .
Chimpanzees were linked to the excavated tubers and roots through knuckle prints , feces , and spit - out wads of fibers from those underground foods .
Seven tools were found at three of the sites , with worn edges and dirt marking implying their use as digging implements .
Because chimpanzees in the area are not habituated to humans , Hernandez - Aguilar was unable to observe them directly .
She plans to conduct further observations in the area and to advocate for greater protection for the savanna chimps .
" Chimpanzees in savannas have not been considered a priority in conservation plans because they live in low densities compared to chimps in forests , " she said .
" We hope that discoveries such as this will show the value of conserving the savanna populations . "
Hernandez - Aguilar conducted her thesis work under Craig Stanford , professor of anthropology at USC .

The research was funded by the LSB Leakey Foundation , the National Science Foundation , the Jane Goodall Center at the University of Southern California , the University of California Committee on Research , the Palaeontology Scientific Trust and the Ugalla Primate Lab from UCSD .

Wikipedia , the free online encyclopaedia , is refusing to remove medieval artistic depictions of the Prophet Muhammad , despite being flooded with complaints from Muslims demanding the images be deleted .
More than 180,000 worldwide have joined an online protest claiming the images , shown on European - language pages and taken from Persian and Ottoman miniatures dating from the 14th , 15th and 16th centuries , are offensive to Islam , which prohibits any representation of Muhammad .
But the defiant editors of the encyclopaedia insist they will not bow to pressure and say anyone objecting to the controversial images can simply adjust their computers so they do not have to look at them .
The images at the centre of the protest appear on most of the European versions of the web encyclopaedia , though not on Arabic sites .
On two of the images , Muhammad 's face is veiled , a practice followed in Islamic art since the 16th century .
But on two others , one from 1315 , which is the earliest surviving depiction of the prophet , and the other from the 15th century , his face is shown .
Some protesters are claiming the pictures have been posted simply to ' bait ' and ' insult '
Muslims and argue the least Wikipedia can do is blur or blank out the faces .
Such has been the adverse reaction , Wikipedia has been forced to set up a separate page on its site explaining why it refuses to bow to pressure and has also had to set up measures to block people from ' editing ' the pages themselves .
In a robust statement on the site , its editors state : ' Wikipedia recognises that there are cultural traditions among some Muslim groups that prohibit depictions of Muhammad and other prophets and that some Muslims are offended when those traditions are violated .
However , the prohibitions are not universal among Muslim communities , particularly with the Shia who , while prohibiting the images , are less strict about it .
' Since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia with the goal of representing all topics from a neutral point of view , Wikipedia is not censored for the benefit of any particular group .
' So long as they are relevant to the article and do not violate any of Wikipedia 's existing policies , nor the law of the US state of Florida where Wikipedia 's servers are hosted , no content or images will be removed because people find them objectionable or offensive . '
The traditional reason given for the Islamic prohibition on images of prophets it to prevent them from becoming objects of worship in a form of idolatry .
But , say the editors , the images used were examples of how Muhammad has been depicted by various Islamic sects through history and not in a religious context .
Still , as its most recognizable face , MSNBC has marshaled behind Mr. Olbermann , who on July 3 , in an eight - minute “ special comment ” at the close of his show , addressed President Bush directly and called on him to resign .
Two months later , the channel chose Mr. Olbermann to serve as the principal host of its coverage of a major prime - time address by Mr. Bush .
Mr. Olbermann ’s “ special comments ” — more than 20 in the last 12 months , and nearly all of them first - person editorials that find some fault with the administration — have helped increase the ratings of his program by 33 percent in just the last year , to about 773,000 viewers a night , according to Nielsen .
With those ratings , Mr. Olbermann ’s program surpassed “ Paula Zahn Now ” on CNN , which was canceled last summer .
Image Rosie ODonnell , known for her liberal views , has been mentioned as a possible host for a talk show on MSNBC .

Mr. Olbermann comes on after “ Hardball ” with Mr. Matthews , whose longtime opposition to the war — and to what he describes as Vice President Dick Cheney ’s outsize role in the administration — has become only more pointed since he took on the title of managing editor of his broadcast over the summer .
Since then , he has talked , both on the air and off , about the “ criminality ” of the Bush White House , as epitomized , he says , by the role of I. Lewis Libby Jr. , the vice president ’s former chief of staff , in the C.I.A. leak case .
Mr. Matthews ’s overall ratings have edged up in the process , though not on the scale of Mr. Olbermann’s .
Even Joe Scarborough , once a conservative congressman from Florida who stood behind President Bush during a campaign rally in 2004 , has seemed to have a change of heart about his fellow Republicans in recent months , as is obvious to viewers of “ Morning Joe , ” his new morning show on MSNBC .
In recent weeks , he could be heard praising Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s outreach to the military and her husband ’s accomplishments as an ex-president , sentiments that , he acknowledged , had surprised even him .
In a telephone interview yesterday morning , hours before the news of the O’Donnell negotiations surfaced , Mr. Scarborough sounded more like Mr. Olbermann than vintage Newt Gingrich .
People of all religious denominations will be overjoyed to learn that a statue of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was installed on the Cumberland County Courthouse Lawn in Crossville , Tennessee today .
All Pastafarians , Rejoice !
Statement at Installation Ceremony
March 21 , 2008
We are lucky enough to live in a country that allows us , its citizens , the freedom of speech .
I have chosen to put up a statue of the Flying Spaghetti Monster to represent the discourse between people of all different beliefs .
The many faiths , ethnicities and backgrounds of Cumberland County 's residents make our community a stronger richer place .
I respect and am proud that on the people 's lawn , the county courthouse , all of these diverse beliefs can come together in a positive dialogue .
Here , we are all able to share the issues close to our hearts whether it is through a memorial to the soldiers killed fighting for our country , the Statue of Liberty honoring our nations welcoming promise to all , a group 's fight to stop homelessness , or powerful symbols of faith .
I greatly treasure this open forum between everyone in the community .
The Flying Spaghetti Monster is a pile of noodles and meatballs , but it is meant to open up discussion and provoke thought .
Being able to put up a statue is a celebration of our freedom as Americans ; a freedom to be different , to express those differences , and to do it amongst neighbors -– even if it is in a noodley way .
Bavarian Suicide Bomber ?
German Police Investigate Afghan Blast
The Islamist Cüneyt C. is possibly the first suicide bomber to come from Germany .
That at least is what the Web site of the Islamic Jihad Union claims .
It says the German - born Turkish citizen died in Afghanistan on March 3 in an attack that killed two US soldiers and two civilians .
When Senator John McCain spoke of less jobs and more war , no one could have predicted it would lead to this :
From the Kansas Democratic Party :
Yesterday , John McCain defended the Air Force decision to overlook Wichita - based Boeing Co. for a $ 35 billion contract to build airborne refueling planes , saying he would not work to overturn the decision and saying that military decisions should not be about creating jobs .
[ McCain Town Hall Meeting , Waco TX , 3/3/08 ; AP , 3/3/08 ]
Unfortunately for American workers , McCain has the record to back his statement up .
In 2003 , Sen . McCain authored an amendment undermining “ Buy American ” rules requiring U.S. military equipment , defense systems and components to be manufactured in the United States .
By allowing the Department of Defense to purchase American military equipment from foreign companies , the McCain amendment laid the groundwork for the Air Force ’s decision to outsource the production of refueling tankers for the American military .
The amendment passed along party lines with Kansas Senators Roberts and Brownback voting in its favor .
[ Vote 191 , 5/21/03 ]
“ McCain ’s refusal to question the Air Force ’s decision gives us a glimpse into the kind of economic policy we can expect from a McCain presidency . ” asked Kansas Democratic Party Executive Director Mike Gaughan .
“ His track record clearly demonstrates a lack of commitment to investing in the American economy .
In fact , the only economic plan we ’ve heard from John McCain so far is making George W. Bush ’s tax cuts for the wealthy permanent in 2010 . ”
Read on ...
McCain 's amendment bolstered by GOP support cost some 44,000 jobs nationwide and took hundreds of millions of dollars out of the U.S. economy -- which has made a LOT of people VERY angry and Congress may be looking into the deal .
If you look at the roll call on McCain 's amendment you 'll see that only one Democratic Senator voted for the amendment .
Less jobs , more war , indeed ...

To Scotland , it is as important as Parmesan is to Italy and champagne is to France .
Now the national dress , the kilt , could soon get the same type of brand protection as its European counterparts .
Just as Parmesan if it is made in certain regions of Italy and sparkling wine can only be called champagne if it is made in the area of the same name in France , the traditional kilt is at the centre of a campaign which , if won , would mean that only those made in Scotland could call themselves Scottish kilts .
The campaign is the idea of an Edinburgh - based kilt - maker , Howie Nicholsby , who , exasperated by the influx of cheap , foreign imports calling themselves Scottish kilts , got in touch with the Scottish Member of European Parliament Alyn Smith to see if they could persuade the European Commission to give the Scottish kilt protected designation of origin ( PDO ) status .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
If their attempt is successful it would mean that only kilts that were hand sewn , made in Scotland and made from pure wool could be known as a Scottish kilt .
Those that did not meet the three criteria would simply have to be known as kilts .
Mr Nicholsby , 29 , said : " This campaign has come about through years of frustration .
I grew tired of seeing poor quality kilts selling in shops on the high street for £ 20 and calling themselves Scottish kilts .
" They look terrible – it's like someone wearing a dishcloth .
People should feel pride in wearing a real Scottish kilt , but people are being put off kilts completely because the cheap ones look so bad .
The PDO is something we need to protect our industry because it 's under siege . "
The Scottish Nationalist Party MEP
Alyn Smith said : " What 's happening is that tacky shops have started to sell cheap kilts that they are prefixing with the word Scottish .
They are essentially tartan skirts imported from India and China .
They look crap and are an embarrassment to our culture and our country .
" A real Scottish kilt is like a designer item these days ; I see more and more men wearing them .
It 's a quality item and a proper one will cost upwards of £ 150 .
These £ 20 things are degrading our national dress . "
Mr Smith has sent a letter to the European Commissioner for consumer protection , Meglena Kuneva .
He is hopeful she will back the granting of PDO status .
If she does , the Scottish kilt could join a list of other famous products with similar status , such as feta cheese , which can only be so called if it was made in Greece , and Edam cheese whose name can only be applied if it was made in The Netherlands .
The kilt revealed
The kilt was first seen in the 16th century , as a long piece of cloth wrapped around the torso and waist .
The version we see today , patterned with tartans said to represent specific clans , did not emerge until the 1800s .
In recent years , other Celtic nations such as Ireland and Wales have adopted versions of the kilt .
The name comes from the Scandinavian word kilt , meaning to tuck clothes up around the body .
A typical adult Scottish kilt uses about eight yards of tartan wool and the hem sits just below the knee .
It is usually teamed with a belt , a jacket , a sporran and a sgian dubh , a small knife worn in the top of the sock .
Folklore maintains that a true Scotsman should wear nothing under his kilt .
Traditionalists insist that the plural of kilt is also kilt , rather than kilts .

Despite a well - financed , aggressive opposition campaign and the distractions of a failed presidential bid , Rep. Dennis Kucinich appears to be headed back to Congress .
With 204 of 641 precincts reporting , Kucinich had 26,845 votes to his nearest challenger , Cleveland Councilman Joe Cimperman , with 16,6144 votes .
Other challengers : Barbara Ann Ferris , 3,192 votes ; Thomas O'Grady , 2,694 , and Rosemary Palmer , 1,941 .
The 10th District Democratic congressman was facing his first threat of losing the seat he has held for 12 years .
Kucinich spent thousands of dollars on television ads and agreed to debate his opponents , chief rival Joe Cimperman and three other candidates .
The 61 - year - old former Cleveland mayor said he was encouraged by the results .
" I am also encouraged because I know of all the hard work you have all put in , " he told supporters at the North Shore AFL - CIO Federation of Labor union hall .
Cimperman hammered away at Kucinich 's second long - shot presidential bid , constantly citing votes he missed in Congress while running for the White House and the financial support he received from Hollywood stars like Sean Penn .
Cimperman , 37 , spent at least $ 500,000 trying to win the seat and gained the endorsement of Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson .
We took someone who ignored the district for 12 years and made him pay attention , " said Cimperman , speaking from Around the Corner in Lakewood .
Cimperman , who lives outside the district , said it was too early to say whether he would consider another run for the 10th District seat .
The district encompasses Cleveland 's West Side and Cuyahoga County 's western suburbs .
While Cimperman said he always considered the campaign a two - way race , the crowded field did not help his chances .
Rosemary Palmer , campaigning in the HopeMobile bus , entered the race after her son , Marine Lance Cpl. Edward " Augie " Schroeder , was killed in Iraq .
Barbara Ferris , president and founder of the International Women 's Democracy Center , was trying for a third time to unseat Kucinich .
During the campaign , North Olmsted Mayor Thomas O'Grady cited his military career and blasted Cimperman .
Kucinich probably will face Republican Jim Trakas , a former state representative from Independence who had to give up his seat because of term limits .
After 36 years , residents of the 16th Congressional District will have a new representative in November with Republican Ralph Regula 's decision to step down .
State Sen. Kirk Schuring and Ashland County Commissioner Matt Miller were in a close race for the Republican nomination .
Democrat John Boccieri , a state senator , was leading .
The 16th District covers all of Stark and Wayne counties and parts of Ashland and Medina counties .
Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton , who represents the 13th District , appears headed to a race against David Potter in November .
Rep. Steve LaTourette , a Republican in the 14th District , will face Bill O'Neill , a former appeals court judge .
Reporter Michael Sangiacomo contributed to this report .
The Drake equation , developed in the 1960s by the astronomer Frank Drake , laid the foundation for the scientific search for extraterrestrial life .
This equation provides a way to estimate the number of intelligent , communicating civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy by combining all the prerequisites for the existence of such civilizations .
The remarkable thing about the Drake equation is that even seemingly conservative values for its various factors tend to predict a galaxy overflowing with life and intelligence , with tens , hundreds or even thousands of extraterrestrial civilizations .
( Try it out and see for yourself . )
Yet , indisputably , the observational evidence does not match that expectation .
We know of no convincing evidence that there are any other intelligent species in the cosmos .
This is Fermi ’s paradox , named after the physicist Enrico Fermi who is said to have first posed it , and it cries out for an explanation .
Some people have proposed that intelligent life is much harder to develop than we think , and we are indeed the only sentient species in the galaxy .
Others hypothesize that intelligent life arises frequently , but tends to destroy itself through resource exhaustion or planetary war just as quickly .
Personally , I doubt that either of these are the case .
We now know that planetary systems are abundant in our galaxy .
The geologically rapid appearance of life on Earth , dating back to within a few hundred million years after the world had cooled enough to make it possible , suggests that on a planetary scale life is not so hard to come by .
And once life exists , intelligence seems like a fairly obvious adaptation – a “ Good Trick ” , as Daniel Dennett puts it , one that has utility in a wide variety of contexts and would be likely for evolution to stumble upon eventually .
Perhaps some intelligent species destroy themselves , but surely not all of them do ; there must be at least a few who are intelligent enough to recognize their danger and avert it .
Both these hypotheses seem unlikely to me on statistical grounds .
But then , why have we not detected signals from other intelligent life ?
I ’ll survey a few explanations that seem at least possible :
The “ we came first ” hypothesis .
No matter how many intelligent species there are , one must come first .
It may be that , by some astonishing stroke of luck , humanity is the first .
Or , a slightly weaker alternative : we are not the first but one of the first , and other civilizations have not existed long enough for their signals to traverse the vast distances of interstellar space to reach us .
I am well aware that many other hypotheses which granted humanity a special or privileged place in the grand scheme of things have been disproven .
This explanation might seem to be another suspiciously anthropocentric speculation .
Especially , given the vast periods of cosmic time that elapsed prior to our appearance and the exponentially rapid development of high technology and culture in our own species as compared to geological time , it might seem that there have been ample opportunities for others to precede us .
However , that need not be the case .
There could , for instance , be some previously undiscovered property of the universe that only makes the existence of complex , intelligent life feasible after a certain point in time , and so our appearance as one of the first sentient species would be no coincidence .
The smoke - signal hypothesis .
Imagine that at some point in the distant past , before European contact and the age of colonialism , a native civilization in the Americas or the Pacific islands wondered if they were the only human society in the world , or if there might be other , more advanced civilizations across the vast and uncharted oceans that surrounded them .
Imagine that this society was accustomed to communicating over great distances with smoke signals , and assumed that a more advanced society would do the same thing , only on a larger scale .
Accordingly , they dispatch watchers to the peak of a nearby mountain to search the horizon for vast columns of smoke that these hypothetical societies might be using to signal across oceans .
Finding none , the watchers return and report that as far as they can tell , their civilization is alone in the cosmos .
This analogy may apply to our own situation .
We are searching the sky for radio waves and other forms of electromagnetic radiation , assuming that this is how a more advanced species would communicate .
However , it may be that there are advanced civilizations using something else far superior , something which we do not even know about yet , and that these civilizations have no pressing interest in making contact with a species at such a primitive stage of development that they do not know about this other means .
The zoo hypothesis .
One suggestion I find particularly ironic is that there are advanced civilizations that are well aware of our existence , but are deliberately choosing to conceal themselves from us so as not to panic a species at an insufficient level of intellectual development to handle such a discovery wisely .
We could imagine this as something like the “ Prime Directive ” of Star Trek , the rule that forbids advanced spacefaring civilizations from disrupting the normal course of development of those that have not yet attained this technological level .
Less charitably , we could interpret it in the way the term “ zoo hypothesis ” implies – to them , we are like animals in a zoo , living out our lives placidly with no clue that we are being gawked at by watchers on the other side of the one - way glass .
The infeasibility hypothesis .
Futurists often predict that technology will increase without limit .
The astronomer Nikolai Kardashev , for example , proposed a three - point scale for species able to harness all the power available in a single planet , star , or galaxy respectively .
A Type III Kardashev civilization would be advanced beyond imagining , and even a Type II would be vastly superior to anything humanity can currently hope to match .
However , perhaps the error is in assuming that this is an inevitable or even possible progression .
Perhaps it is just too hard to become the kind of planet - shaping society many futurists envision .
The laws of physics may not allow it : perhaps the materials that can possibly be created are too weak , the energy we can usefully collect too small .
If that is the case , technology levels equal to or slightly above that which is currently possessed by humanity may be the limit dictated by the cosmos , and interstellar communication and travel may never occur because it is impossible to engage in the kind of engineering that such an endeavor would require .
The missed signal hypothesis .
Intelligent aliens do exist , they are trying to make contact , and they are transmitting the right kind of signal – but we ’re not listening .
Programs such as SETI have been mocked by politicians as frivolous wastes of money ( meanwhile , those same politicians almost always vote for the development of powerful new destructive weapons systems ) , and at the moment depend largely on private sources of funding .
As a result , there are large sections of the sky whose radio coverage is poor or nonexistent , and there is no way of knowing until we look if there are signals arriving from those regions that we are missing .
The cosmos could be awash in intelligent signals that we , in our inward - looking myopia , have completely failed to see .
A fossil jawbone , rudimentary tools and animal skeletons from a cave in Spain extend the earliest occupation of Europe by human ancestors back to as much as 1.3 million years ago , half a million years earlier than previously believed , researchers reported Wednesday .
The findings suggest that early hominids swept out of Africa , through the Near East and into Europe much more rapidly than previously believed , said Spanish researchers who reported the find in the journal Nature .
The speed with which these hominids spread has been a subject of great debate among archaeologists , but the new relics and others previously found in the region put the idea of a rapid migration on a firm foundation , experts said .
The find indicates that “ the occupation of Europe happened very early and much faster than we had thought , ” said archaeologist Eudald Carbonell of the Catalan Institute of Human Paleo - Ecology and Social Evolution , the lead author of the report .

The two - inch fragment of jawbone and teeth was found last year in a massive cave called Sima del Elefante in the Atapuerca hills near Burgos in northern Spain .
Three types of dating confirm that the fossil is 1.1 million to 1.3 million years old .
The site also yielded flint blades , flakes that were a byproduct of blade production , and skeletons of long - extinct species of weasels and mice that showed cut marks and other evidence of processing by the hominids .
The location has proved to be a rich trove of fossils .
The cave is 200 yards away from a site called Gran Dolina , where Carbonell and his colleagues had previously found 800,000 - year - old remains of a hominid called Homo antecessor , or Pioneer Man .
Those were previously the oldest known hominid remains in Europe .
Before that 1997 find , the oldest known hominid relics in the region were 500,000 years old .

The cave is also about 1,000 yards away from a site where researchers have uncovered more than 6,000 remains of the related species Homo heidelbergensis .
Carbonell and his colleagues have tentatively identified the new find as Homo antecessor , which they believe is an ancestor of both the Neanderthals and modern humans -- Homo sapiens .
But experts including Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London said that identification may be premature , because the piece of jawbone found at Sima del Elefante is from a different area of the jaw than the pieces found at Gran Dolina , making an absolute match impossible .
Carbonell said the new fossil was very similar to a 1.8 - million - year - old hominid fossil found in the Caucasus at Dmanisi , Georgia .
He believes early hominids migrated from Africa into the Caucasus , then swept west into Europe , where they evolved into Homo antecessor .
Advertisement
He predicted that researchers would eventually find fossil evidence of hominids in Europe dating from 1.6 million to 1.8 million years ago .
If his ideas about migration are correct , however , then it is more likely that Homo antecessor is an evolutionary dead end rather than a direct ancestor of modern humans .
Most researchers now think that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa and migrated out about 60,000 years ago .

The good folks over at Superherohype have scored what appears to be our first look at Hulk and Abomination pictures .
Well , at least what Hulk and Abomination will look like in the upcoming Incredible Hulk film .
Seems the toys are already to be shipped and sold .
Ok , now for the Hulk , I think they nailed it .
Very classic look of the character and I think that ’s going to score well with a lot of the people who did n’t like the look of the Hulk in he last incarnation ( the Ang Lee film that so many people , except me , hated ) .
But Abomination … who is the film is supposed to be even a little stronger than The Hulk … looks WICKED !
I love it !
I do n’t want to get too hyped up , because it is just a toy , and I do want to see it on screen … but in principle the design of the character is fantastic .
Nightmarish , yet tangible .
Holding a giant pipe in his hand for good measure is top notch too !
I can’t wait for this movie .
I think Hulk will end up being the surprise film of the summer .
ANNE SAXELBY had what she calls an “ aha moment ” a couple of years ago when she drove upstate to try the cultured butter made by Evans Farmhouse Creamery in Chenango County .
Ms. Saxelby , who owns Saxelby Cheesemongers in Manhattan , said that for all the butter she had eaten in her life , “ I had really never had butter before  this is butter . ”
More and more people across the country are being treated to the same aha experience as they find a burgeoning variety of fresh dairy products made in small batches on little farms and in small creameries .
And it ’s worth the extra money .
These artisanal operations are turning cow , goat or sheep milk into simple , straightforward foods like crème fraîche , butter , buttermilk , ice cream , puddings , custards , yogurt , yogurt - based sauces and yogurt drinks .
Many of these dairies also sell unhomogenized , and in a few cases even unpasteurized , milk with an old - fashioned farmhouse flavor .
The movement is , in some ways , an offshoot of the American cheesemaking revival that began 15 to 20 years ago , and some of the creameries make fresh cheeses like mascarpone , mozzarella and ricotta that let the quality of the milk speak for itself .

“ I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state .
Apart from practical consideration , my awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders , an army , and a measure of temporal power no matter how modest .
I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain — especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks , against which we have already had to fight strongly , even without a Jewish state . ”

A NTI - SOCIAL B EHAVIOUR O RDERS A NALYSIS OF THE F IRST S IX Y EARS ( a ) Introduction
Anti-social Behaviour Orders were introduced in April 1999 as part of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 .
It is a community based order which can be applied for by the police or local authorities in consultation with each other against an individual , or several individuals , whose behaviour is anti-social .
The behaviour must cause alarm , distress or harassment to one or more people not in the same household as the offender .
Applications are made to the Magistrates Court acting in a civil capacity .
The court , if the order is made , can impose additional restrictions .
However , controversially , breach of an order without reasonable excuse is a criminal offence tryable either way with a maximum penalty of five years in prison .
Home Office notes published at the time the Act was introduced state , " the prohibitions and the order must be such as are necessary to protect people from further anti-social acts by the defendant in the locality .
It is intended that the order will be targeted at criminal , or sub criminal , behaviour , not minor disputes between neighbours or matters which can be dealt with effectively under existing legislation . "
( b) Orders made
The number of orders made has escalated over the six - year period that ASBOs have been available .
During the first eight months in 1999 , only 104 orders were made .
However , there has been a significant escalation with more than 2,600 orders made since November 2003 .
The Parliamentary Answers reveal that the breach rate has been 39 % for 10 - 15 - year - olds , 38 % for 16 - 20 - year - olds , and 31 % for those aged over 21 .
However , figures are only available on numbers jailed for the years 2001 and 2002 .
In 2001 , 114 persons breached by the courts following the imposition of an ASBO were jailed out of 322 issued .
In 2002 , 212 were jailed out of 403 issued .
These figures would suggest that around 50 % of those who are the subject of an ASBO eventually end up in jail .
( c) Abuse of intention
Napo believes that the original purpose of the ASBO has been abused in some areas .
In many incidents , individuals are receiving a custodial sentence where the original offence was not itself imprisonable .
This includes people banned from begging or prostitution .
The ASBO is clearly , therefore , moving offenders up tariff and resulting in the inappropriate use of custody .
ASBOs are being used against young people whose behavour may be anti-social but not necessarily threatening .
It is being used to deal with nuisance which could be dealt with in other ways .
There is also ample evidence that the ASBO merely moves the anti-social behaviour to a different district .
There is also evidence to suggest that many of the young people involved eventually end up in Young Offender Institutions .
In Napo 's view , it is time the Home Office thoroughly reviewed the role and purpose of the ASBO and sentencing discrepancies .
An individual is far more likely to be the subject of an ASBO in Greater Manchester than in Merseyside .
In the first six months of 2004 , 155 persons were the subject of an ASBO in Greater Manchester compared with just 27 in Merseyside .
Similarly the number of individuals subject to an ASBO in West Yorkshire , during the same period , was 128 compared with just 22 in South Yorkshire .
Again , during the first six months of 2004 , 38 ASBOs were issued in Lancashire compared with just four in Leicestershire .
INCONSISTENCIES IN USE OF ASBOs 2003-04

(d) Case studies
Napo has collected a number of case studies over the last 12 months which illustrate the difficulties :
1. Earlier this year an application was made in Manchester for an ASBO on a female prostitute .
It was alleged she was causing a nuisance in Manchester by accosting men and generally causing offence .
The Magistrates agreed to an ASBO .
One of its conditions was that she was prohibited from carrying condoms within the given area .
Unfortunately her drug clinic was within the restricted area and one of the services it provided was the provision of free condoms as part of its harm - reduction strategy .
She has now breached the order , has been put on probation and is facing the possibility of prison .
2 . An 18 - year - old youth was recently made the subject of an ASBO in the same city with a condition not to congregate with three or more other youths .
He was subsequently arrested for breach of his order when he was entering a local youth club on the grounds that there were more than three youths in the premises .
This was a successful club with a good reputation providing a valuable service to young people locally , and on the particular evening the session scheduled for the youths was how to deal with anti-social behaviour .
3 . Again this year , in Manchester , the Council used its powers to obtain an ASBO to stop mobile soup vans operating in the city centre .
These vans provide food and assistance regularly each evening to about 100 homeless people .
The Council however argued that after the vans had left there was a mess all over the place and people had complained .
Probation staff argued that the same could be said about every kebab shop , pub , chip shop and off - licence in the city .
4 . A probation officer recently visited a 20 - year - old , long term , prisoner in the North East to finalise his release plan .
He expressed the wish to return to his grandmother 's flat two weeks hence .
He had been her registered carer since he was about 12 years old .
She was n't well and needed assistance .
However , the day before his release the Council obtained an ASBO on him which included a condition that he was banned from entering the estate where his grandmother lived because of previous activities in the area .
5 . A drug addict faced jail if he was caught sleeping in the street or begging in " an earnest or humble way " .
Greater Manchester police obtained an ASBO against Peter Broadbent aged 36 after he pleaded guilty to rough sleeping under the Napoleonic Begging Laws .
He was found under the Mancunian Way surrounded by needles and now faces up to five years jail if he breaches .
During the year , another homeless man , Leonard Hockey , who begged in a non-aggressive way in Kendal 's car park was ASBOed .
He was later breached and jailed and died before finishing his sentence .
Broadbent 's ASBO prevents him from sleeping rough contrary to Section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824 and asking " earnestly or humbly " for money in a place to which the public have access .
He is also banned from selling the Big Issue without a license .
6 . A youth recently appeared in Court in Manchester for breach of his ASBO .
The Order had been made in the youth 's absence without his being able to give his side of the story ( one of the main concerns about ASBOs and one that can lead to misuse ) .
The day after the Order was made someone came to his house to " serve " it on him .
This consisted of his being handed a copy of what was a fairly bulky document running to several dozen pages with no attempt to explain it or even to ascertain if he was literate enough to read it .
The Order included an restriction preventing him entering a particular estate nearby and another preventing him from associating with certain others .
Unfortunately , he went out before reading the Order and beached it twice that day .
The next day he went out again and breached it three times by mistake as he had not read the part covering the particular restriction .
He now faces possibly custody although he has never been convicted of a criminal offence .
7 . A 40 - year - old woman made over seven hundred 999 calls from various phone booths in her town over a four to five month period .
The police applied for and obtained an ASBO banning her from the booths and from making 999 calls .
She made a further 999 call within days of the ASBO being made and was subsequently given two weeks imprisonment .
8 . A 26 - year - old homeless beggar from Birmingham was banned from begging in various car parks in Birmingham .
He breached almost immediately and was , according to his solicitor , given 24 months custody .
He was discharged earlier this year having served about eight months and was breached again for returning to begging and on this occasion got three years ' jail .
His solicitor , therefore , says he received a total of five years ' imprisonment for an offence that itself is non imprisonable .
9 . A 50 - year - old man with numerous convictions for shoplifting , clearly ill and a kleptomaniac , was banned from going into certain shops .
If he entered other shops the condition of the ASBO was he told the shopkeepers of his conviction and the condition .
10 . A teenage boy in the Oldham area has been banned from displaying the name of a gang anywhere on his body .
The ASBO was issued to Damien White which banned him from the district of Sholber .
The order prevents him from displaying a gang name " Mayhem " on any part of his body or publicly displaying any mark or words to identify himself with any gang or group of youths causing a criminal act or anti-social behaviour .
11 . A 13 - year - old was served an order banning him from using the word " grass " anywhere in England and Wales .

In September 2004 , on the same day as he was released from prison , a 21 - year - old found himself back in court being served with an interim order which banned him from entering any car park in England and Wales , touching any car without the owners permission , and riding a bicycle .
On the full application hearing , the Council also managed to have him banned from wearing all forms of headwear in public .

The oldest recipient of an order to date is an 87 - year - old who among other things is forbidden from being sarcastic to his neighbours ( July 2003 ) .
He was subsequently found guilty of breaking the terms of his order on three separate occasions .
He awaits sentencing but the judge has already made it clear that " there will be no prison for an 88 year old man " .

In December , Brian Hagan from Norfolk became the first farmer to be the subject of an ASBO when he was ordered to keep his swine and geese under control after people living near to his farm complained of damage .
The order was made on Monday of the week beginning 13 December , but on Tuesday he was charged with allegedly breaching the order after reports that his pigs had escaped again .
A breach of the order could lead to up to five years in jail .
27 . A 26 - year - old West Lothian man has been made the subject of an ASBO after playing the Band Aid single " Do they know it 's Christmas " dozens of times daily to the annoyance of neighbours .
He has been banned from " playing loud music , stamping his feet and dropping objects . "

The endless blazing rows of a couple in Blackburn led to their being made the subject of an ASBO barring them from contacting each other .
The 47 - year - old man was additionally ordered not to go within 50 m of his fiancé 's home .
He argued this was completely over the top and Blackburn magistrates eventually backed down and overturned the order .

A West Midlands woman was the subject of an ASBO banning her from using a pay as you go mobile , using a mobile phone that is not in her name , or using a mobile to make nuisance calls for five years after she tried to convince the parents of a former school friend that their daughter had been kidnapped and forced into prostitution .
Police said an investigation into the kidnapping allegations had used 640 hours of police time before the young woman was tracked down .

A 43 - year - old Port Talbot woman was also made the subject of an ASBO after making 765 nuisance calls to the emergency services in less than a year .
On one occasion she complained she was having difficulty tuning in her television .
She received an interim ban stopping her from calling the emergency services unless there really is a crisis .

In Harrogate , police wanted to ban persistent criminals from entering the town .
They asked magistrates to consider an ASBO preventing known offenders for crimes like burglary from setting foot in the town .
( Source BBC News ) ( e ) Conclusion
The number of anti-social behaviour orders has escalated markedly since November 2003 .
There is ample evidence of the issuing of ASBOs by the courts being inconsistent and almost a geographical lottery .
There is great concern that people are being jailed following the breach of an ASBO where the original offence was itself non-imprisonable .
There is also evidence that ASBOs have been used where people have mental health problems where treatment would be more appropriate .
In Napo 's view the time is right for a fundamental review of the use and appropriateness of Anti-social Behaviour Orders by the Home Office .

This is awkward … during the testing phase for the Shark Shield , an electronic device that is designed to go on the back of surfboards to keep sharks away , one of the devices was actually eaten by a shark .
Advertisement
Yeah , not only did this thing not keep sharks away , but it actually attracted the attention of a 12 - foot great white enough that it mistook it for a tasty snack .
Luckily , it was on a buoy and not a surfboard at the time .
The device uses electrical waves to give sharks some uncomfortable muscle contractions , at least in theory .
The problem is , there 's speculation afoot that the electrical waves designed to repel sharks actually attract them .
Yeah , that 's no good .
The manufacturer claims that it 'll work just fine as long as you are n't surfing , paddling , or moving at all , however .
Uh , sold ?

VATICAN CITY ( Reuters ) - Pope Benedict said on Thursday that embryonic stem cell research , artificial insemination and the prospect of human cloning had “ shattered ” human dignity .

In an address to members of the Vatican department on doctrinal matters , Benedict said the Church had a duty to defend the “ great values at stake ” in the field of bioethics .
The speech was the latest in a series in which the conservative Pope has told his listeners that scientific progress should not be accepted uncritically .
Benedict , who headed the same department for years before his election in 2005 , said the Church was not against scientific progress but wanted it based on “ ethical - moral principles ” .
He said this included total respect for the human being as a person “ from conception until natural death , ” and respect for the natural transmission of life through sexual intercourse .
Practices like freezing embryos , suppression of embryos in multiple pregnancies , embryonic stem cell research , the prospect of human cloning and artificial insemination outside the body had “ shattered the barriers meant to protect human dignity ” , he said .
“ When human beings in the weakest and most defenseless state of their existence are selected , abandoned , killed or used as pure ‘ biological material , ’ how can one deny that they are being treated not as ‘ someone ’ but as ‘ something , ’ ” he said .
Such practices “ questioned the very concept of the dignity of man , ” he said in the speech to the department known as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith .
Widespread interest in medicine by the general public , who get most of their information from the media , had made it even more imperative for the Church to take a stand , he said .
Embryonic stem cell research involves the destruction of embryos .
Scientists hope to use stem cells to transform medicine , providing regenerative treatments for injuries and seeking new insights into diseases like cancer and AIDS .
Last year scientists reported they had tricked ordinary skin cells into behaving like embryonic stem cells .
The Pope said the Church “ appreciates and encourages ” research on stem cells that come from other parts of the body and do not involve embryos or their destruction .
He rejected accusations from critics who say the Church is an obstacle to science and human progress , saying growing concern about cloning and other practices showed it was right to raise the alarm .
It was the Pope ’s latest foray into scientific issues .
On Monday he warned against the “ seductive ” powers of science , saying it was important that science did not become the sole criteria for goodness .
U.S. Cardinal William Levada , Benedict ’s successor as head of the doctrinal department , said it was mulling the possibility of preparing a new Vatican document on bioethical issues .
Google ’s long list of powerful partners illustrates the substantial inroads that the company has made in the highly competitive industry as well the challenges still facing the giant search engine firm .
For example , the two largest cellular carriers in the United States , AT&T and Verizon Wireless , which together account for 52 percent of the market , are not part of the alliance .
Still , alliance members , which contributed technology to the project , said they had high hopes for it .
“ Just like the iPhone energized the industry , this is a different way to energize the industry , ” said Sanjay Jha , chief operating officer of Qualcomm , which makes chips used in wireless phones .
Mr. Jha said the Google technology would bring better Internet capabilities to moderately priced phones .
He also said that innovation could accelerate , as developers would be able to enhance the software as they saw fit .
Users would have the ability to load up their phones with new features and third - party programs .
“ Today the Internet experience on hand - held devices is not optimized , ” said Peter Chou , chief executive of HTC , one of the largest makers of smartphones .
“ The whole idea is to optimize the Internet experience . ” Mr. Chou , whose company makes several phones based on Microsoft ’s software , which are largely aimed at business users , said the phones based on Google ’s technology would probably be marketed primarily to consumers .
The alliance represents a bold move by Google and its partners that mirrors the company ’s efforts in the desktop computing industry to give away software and services and gain revenue through targeted advertising .
As such , the new software strategy is a potential competitive threat to Microsoft and other mobile software and hardware designers .
John O’Rourke , general manager of Microsoft ’s Windows Mobile business , said he was skeptical about the ease with which Google will be able to become a major force in the smartphone market .
He pointed out that it had taken Microsoft more than half a decade to get to the stage where the company now does business with 160 mobile operators in 55 countries around the world .
“ They may be delivering one component that is free , ” he said .
“ You have to ask the question , what additional costs come with commercializing that ?
I can tell you that there are a bunch of phones based on Linux today , and I do n’t think anyone would tell you it ’s free . ”

Only about 4 % of the world 's oceans remain undamaged by human activity , according to the first detailed global map of human impacts on the seas .
A study in Science journal says climate change , fishing , pollution and other human factors have exacted a heavy toll on almost half of the marine waters .
Only remote icy areas near the poles are relatively pristine , but they face threats as ice sheets melt , it warns .
The authors say the data is a " wake - up call " to policymakers .
I think the big surprise from all of this was seeing what the complete coverage of human impacts was
Dr Mark Spalding , The Nature Conservancy
" In the past , many studies have shown the impact of individual activities , " he said .
" But here for the first time we have produced a global map of all of these different activities layered on top of each other so that we can get this big picture of the overall impact that humans are having rather than just single impacts . "
Co-author Dr Mark Spalding told BBC
News that the map was the first attempt to describe and quantify the combined threats facing the world 's oceans from human factors , ranging from commercial shipping to over - fishing .
" There 's an element of wake - up call when you get maps like this , " he said .
" Human threats are all pervasive across the world 's oceans .
" The map is an impetus for action , I think that it is a real signal to roll up our sleeves and start managing our coast and oceans . "
Complex model
The international team of 20 scientists in the US , Canada and UK built a complex model to handle large amounts of information on 17 different human threats .
The map reveals the most and least heavily impacted areas
The researchers divided the world 's oceans into 1 km - square sections and examined all real data available on how humankind is influencing the marine environment .
They then calculated " human impact scores " for each location , presenting this as a global map of the toll people have exacted on the seas .
The scientists say they were shocked by the findings .
" I think the big surprise from all of this was seeing what the complete coverage of human impacts was , " said Dr Spalding , senior marine scientist for international conservation group The Nature Conservancy .
" There 's nowhere really that escaped .
It 's quite a shocking map to see . "
He said the two biggest drivers in destroying marine habitats were climate change and over - fishing .
" Out on the high seas , climate change and fishing were far and away the strongest influences , " he explained .
" The least impacted areas are the polar regions but they are not untouched . "
Clear message
The scientists hope the map will be used to prioritise marine conservation efforts .
Andrew Rosenberg , a professor of natural resources at the University of New Hampshire , US , who was not part of the study , said policymakers could no longer focus on fishing or pollution as if they were separate effects .
" These human impacts overlap in space and time , and in far too many cases the magnitude is frighteningly high , " he said .
" The message for policymakers seems clear to me : conservation action that cuts across the whole set of human impacts is needed now in many places around the globe . "
The findings of the study were presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) in Boston , US .
The U.S. economy is sliding toward a recession -- if it ’s not already in one -- with at least three serious strikes against it : shrinking employment , plunging home prices and a financial sector at risk of paralysis .
The latest piece of bad news landed Friday , when the government said payrolls fell by 63,000 jobs in February after losing 22,000 in January .
Private - sector positions sank by more than 100,000 last month .
The news sent the already depressed stock market sliding further .
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.2 % , dropping well below 12,000 points to its lowest level since 2006 .
President Bush and the major presidential candidates each responded to the report with sympathetic remarks as well as confidence that he or she would be able to reverse the downturn .

As recently as the fall , the Bush administration predicted moderate economic growth for this year .
But Friday the president ’s top economic advisor conceded that economic output could decline in the first three months of this year .
“ We do n’t really know whether it will be negative or not , ” Edward Lazear , chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors , said of first - quarter growth .
“ We have definitely downgraded our forecast . ”
Other analysts were not nearly as tentative .
“ We now think the economy can be described as having entered a recession in early 2008 , ” said Bruce Kasman , chief economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York .

David M. Jones , chief economist at Investors Security Trust in Fort Myers , Fla. , had a similar response .
“ You almost never have back - to - back payroll declines without a recession , ” he said .
The Labor Department report was the latest twist of the vise closing in on the Federal Reserve , which must worry not only about shrinking employment but also a financial sector that ’s spooked about the safety of investments across the board and therefore deeply reluctant to spend or lend .
The central bank must cope with these problems without kindling inflation , which some analysts believe it is coming perilously close to doing .
To keep the credit markets from freezing up , the Fed said Friday that it would pump at least $ 100 billion into the financial system through short - term loans to bond dealers .
Fed staffers said mortgage - backed securities that have lost value would be accepted as collateral .

The central bank also said it would boost the amount of money it would lend to banks in special auctions this month to $ 100 billion from $ 60 billion , and keep running the auctions for at least six more months .
Staff members said the Fed ’s actions were prompted not by the job data but by signs that key parts of the financial system once again may be nearing a crisis , which has occurred repeatedly since the summer as the mortgage meltdown intensified .
The Fed already has slashed its benchmark interest rate by 2.25 percentage points since September , to 3 % , and is expected to cut at least half a point more at its March 18 meeting , if not sooner .
Politically , job losses and the near - certainty of a recession make it more likely than ever that the economy will trump national security as voters ’ chief concern in the presidential contest .

“ Exit polls are showing that the economy is the No. 1 issue , and that is not likely to change as long as we have bad economic numbers , talk of recession and worries of inflation , ” said Stuart Rothenberg , editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report .
And the worse the economic news , the bigger the challenge for the Republican nominee , said Charles Cook , editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report .
“ While the situation in Iraq has gotten better , the worsening economy has displaced it on the top of the public ’s issue agenda , ” he said .
“ Either one hurts Republicans in the fall . ”
The Democratic contenders seized on the job numbers to denounce Bush ’s leadership and , by extension , the competence of presumptive GOP nominee Sen. John McCain .

Americans “ ca n’t afford John McCain ’s promise of four more years of the very same failed Bush economic policies , ” Sen. Barack Obama said in a statement Friday .
“ We have to fix the economy , ” Sen . Hillary Rodham Clinton said during a rally in Cheyenne , Wyo .
Even McCain said it was clear Republicans would “ have a lot of work to do ” to convince the electorate that they offer a path to an economic turnaround .
“ Obviously the news was disturbing , ” the senator from Arizona said in an interview from his campaign plane .
“ We ’re going to have to take serious measures to get our economy under control . ”

“ I think we ’ve got a lot of work to do .
There ’s no doubt about that , ” he said .
For his part , the president said a recently enacted stimulus package including tax rebates would help .
“ Losing a job is painful , and I know Americans are concerned about our economy , ” Bush said .
“ But we recognized the problem early and we provided the economy with a booster shot . ”
The question of whether the economy has entered a recession -- often defined as a broad , significant decline in economic activity lasting more than a few months -- is likely to take many months to be answered definitively .

Economist Robert Hall , chairman of the committee responsible for declaring a recession ’s starting and ending dates , said Friday that despite many signs of stress , the National Bureau of Economic Research panel was not ready to act .
The measures it uses to make its decision “ have not declined anywhere near enough ” to declare a recession , Hall , of Stanford University , said in an interview .
He also questioned whether the Fed ’s latest steps would do much to help the country ’s banks because they do n’t address the fact that huge losses on mortgage - backed securities have depleted the institutions ’ capital , limiting their ability or willingness to lend .
Hall ’s doubts about the central bank were echoed by the National Assn. for Business Economics , a group of corporate economists .
The group said Friday that in a survey of its members , 48 % called the Fed ’s handling of the economy “ about right , ” down from 72 % in August .
In releasing the job data , the Labor Department said the unemployment rate fell by 0.1 % in February to 4.8 % , reflecting the fact that many people had given up looking for work .

The job losses cut across a wide swath of the economy , including manufacturing , construction and retail trade .
Temporary help services , which often signal the trend in employment , also lost jobs .
Showing gains were government , educational and health services , and the leisure and hospitality industries .
The report seems certain to further discourage Americans , many of whom are already telling pollsters that they are deeply pessimistic about the economy ’s prospects and therefore less likely to spend .
“ With the consumer ’s only source of support for spending coming from job - related income growth , ” said Joshua Shapiro , the chief U.S. economist at forecasting firm MFR Inc. , “ a rapidly weakening labor market is the worst possible news for the economy . ”

High vitamin E doses were found to increase risk
The US study of 77,000 people found taking 400 milligrams per day long - term increased cancer risk by 28 % - with smokers at particular risk .
It follows warnings about similar risks of excessive beta - carotene use .
Writing in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine , an expert said people should get their vitamins from fruit and veg .
The jury 's still very much out on whether vitamin and mineral supplements can affect cancer risk
Henry Scowcroft , Cancer Research UK
Dr Tim Byers , from the University of Colorado , said a healthy , balanced diet meant people took in a whole range of beneficial nutrients and minerals , which might help to reduce cancer risk .
The researchers followed people aged between 50 and 76 for four years and looked at their average daily use of vitamin C and folic acid , and vitamin E supplements .
Over the course of the study , 521 people developed lung cancer .
Smoking , family history and age all had unsurprisingly strong links to cancer risk .
And while neither vitamin C or folic acid use had any effect on lung cancer risk , vitamin E use did .
The researchers extrapolated their findings , and concluded that over a decade , there was an additional 7 % increase in risk for every 100 milligrams taken per day .
The vitamin E trend was most prominent among smokers , but was not confined to them .
Vitamin E is known to be an antioxidant - protecting cells from molecules called free radicals .
But the US researchers speculate that , in high doses , it may also act as a pro-oxidant - causing oxidation and therefore damage to cells .
' Toxic effects '
Dr Christopher Slatore of the University of Washington in Seattle , who led the study , said : " In contrast to the often assumed benefits or at least lack of harm , supplemental vitamin E was associated with a small increased risk of lung cancer .
" Future studies may focus on other components of fruits and vegetables that may explain the decreased risk of cancer that has been associated with fruit and vegetables .
" Meanwhile , our results should prompt clinicians to counsel patients that these supplements are unlikely to reduce the risk of lung cancer and may be detrimental . "
But Henry Scowcroft , senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK , said : " The jury 's still very much out on whether vitamin and mineral supplements can affect cancer risk .
" Some studies suggest a benefit , but many others show no effect and some , like this one , suggest they may even increase risk . "
He added : " Research repeatedly shows that a healthy , balanced diet can reduce your risk of some cancers while giving you all the vitamins you need .
" Quitting smoking remains the most effective way to avoid many cancers .
There 's no diet , or vitamin supplement , that could ever counter the toxic effects of cigarette smoke . "
In 2002 a Finnish study of 29,000 male smokers found taking beta - carotene - which is converted into vitamin A in the body - was linked to an 18 % increased risk of developing lung cancer
It took 17 rounds , but when the FCC's $ 4.638 billion reserve was met late last week , it meant that the FCC 's mandated open access rules would necessarily come into play .
Under the proposed rules , 22MHz of the spectrum to be auctioned would be subject to open - access regulations , meaning that the company winning the auction would not be able to control what kind of devices are attached to the network or how the bandwidth is used .
While there were plenty of high - fives around here , not everyone is pleased .
Scott Cleland , founder of telecom analyst firm The Precursor Group , is out blasting the developments , saying that open access and " net neutrality " advocates are " antiproperty " according to the IDG News Service .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
" Everybody throws the word ' open ' around and says open is wonderful , " Cleland said .
" But ' open ' means communal .
It means not owned . "
Mr. Cleland is of course wrong on the most fundamental of levels .
Open means open , not communal .
Check a dictionary .
When Verizon " opens " its network this year , it 's certainly not giving up complete and utter ownership of its network .
Second , Net Neutrality advocates are not ipso facto " antiproperty , " because if they were , they would n't care whether or not their own devices ( aka , property ) were locked into proprietary networks and / or designed to only work with specific technologies .
Net neutrality proponents simply want their property to work like it should .
What has brought this situation to light is nothing short than the collective abuses of the American wireless user , who is frankly sick of having choice determined by carrier lock - in and having " features " determined by committee .
The rhetoric of property is apropos here , in the way that carriers can sometimes treat their subscribers like they own them .
Compare your cell phone service to your cable TV service .
Both are , ultimately , powering expensive pieces of technology you own , but taking your television to another cable company is magnitudes easier than taking your cell phone to another carrier .
To be sure , " open " access wo n't mean free access or that whoever owns a chunk of open spectrum can't make money .
It simply means that making such services worth paying for will require a lot more than traditional carrier lock - in .
At the very least , it marks the beginning of an age when our mobile telecommunications property has value and functionality less constrained by arbitrary sets of rules from on high .
And to hear Verizon tell the tale , their dramatic swing from opposing the notion of " open access " networks to wanting to build one themselves was partially the result of coming to grips with market forces in a competitive environment .
It certainly had nothing to do with " not owning " a network .
It was quite the opposite : Verizon realized that the best kind of network to own is the open kind .
Maher praises Obama speech , slams McCain on war David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday March 19 , 2008

Print This Email This Real Time host Bill Maher , appearing on MSNBC's Hardball , had words of praise for White House hopeful Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) and jeers for presumptive GOP nominee Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) .
" I thought it was a great speech , " said Maher of Obama 's milestone address on race .
" He never fails to rise to the occasion .
I think history will look back and see him as ... the Jackie Robinson of politics . "
Maher added , " It was such a pleasure to hear a speech for adults , to adults , that did n't pander , that was eloquent . "
Elaborating on the hubbub over remarks by Obama 's onetime pastor , Maher said , " Americans are so narcissistic , they 're such navel - gazers , they only live in their own little world .
...
People would n't know what goes on in a black church , they could be preaching jihad every week and nobody would know about it .
I mean we learn this every time there 's a racial episode in this country ... [ E ] very time people are absolutely shocked at what 's going on , because obviously there really is n't a lot of dialogue between the two races . "
Matthews began laughing hysterically as he brought up how Bill O'Reilly was stunned by the civility he experienced in a black restaurant .
Quipped Maher , " He thought it was gonna be ' Dinnertime at the Apollo . '
He was just gonna have dinner , stay for a little of the dogfighting , and then leave . "
When it came to McCain , Maher let loose with more of his trademark caustic wit .
" We 're one terrorist attack away from John McCain rising in the polls by ten points because people think he 's tougher .
Of course he's not tougher about the war , he 's dumber about the war ... because he thinks that by keeping troops in the heart of the Muslim world , that 's gonna help the war on terror . "
Transcript via closed captions :: welcome back to " hardball . " every friday night at 11:00 p.m. , bill maher offers up a unique look at politics on hbo " real time with bill maher . " he is with us from los angeles .
mr. maher , sir , here we are , almost at the end of a cycle of picking a president .
the republicans have picked john mccain .
the democrats , what are they up to ? :: you know , when i was a kid i remember my father and mother who were like dyed in the wool democrats , liberal democrats , they would tear their hair out because they say the democrats are the party never organized , fighting amongst each other .
the republicans are organized , they get up in the morning , they have their candidate by february .
obviously , nothing has changed . :: i know .
i sometimes think if you go to a movie theater and go to everybody who comes ten minutes early and they sit there all organized an the people who come in in the dark with their big boxes opopcorn and the gallons of coke .
those are the democrats .
let me ask you a more serious question , barack obama , did you think his speech had the emotional and historic impact that some of us did ? :: yeah .
i thought it was a great speech , but i'm supposed to .
i'm that white progressive who loves what he does .
but he is .
he never fails to rise to the occasion .
i think history will look back and see him as -- i keep using the analogy of jackie robinson .
the jackie robinson of politics .
i say that because jackie robinson had to be , of course , absolutely perfect .
he picked jackie robinson not because he was a great ballplayer , but the exact temper meant and the guy who can take it when they yell out racial ep tats at him in st.
louis .
that is barack obama , too black , too white .
not everybody is going to love that speech .
you guys have been talking about it , blue collar workers , reagan democrats , whatever you want to call them .
people who think , well , we had a racial problem in this country but that ended when bill cosby got a tv show in 1980 .
what is all the talk about race ?
that guy is never going to be swayed by that speech or any speech .
it was a pleasure to hear a speech for adults to adults that did n't pander , that was eloquent .
it is like reading a book now adays , chris , so much writing is not writing .
you read a john grisham book and it is an outline for the script for the movie .
once in a while you read great writes and you think , oh , what a pleasure .
that was what it was like listening to that speech for me . :: you are right about the jackie robinson stuff , that trash talk was coming from the philly dugout . :: it was everywhere .
boston , too . :: that is -- i'll say no more about that one .
i can talk about my city .
boston is trickier when it comes to that topic .
let me ask you about the grandmother comment .
a lot of us were taken that he is defending his relationship with his minister , with jeremiah wright , and he offered a parallel , his white grandmother , white grandparents on his mother 's side , how she talked about fear of black men , the stereotypical language she used that made him cringe as a boy .
almost ripping the scab off of american people , so the secret talk that goes on in our different racial dugouts . :: well , when black folks get in trouble , chris , they always go to the grandmother .
i thought it was very effecting .
americans are so narcissistic .
they are such nazal gazers .
they only live in their own little world .
it was astounding that in 2008 somebody had to go through the abcs of what racial relations are like in this country .
that people still do n't know .
i mean , people would n't know what goes on in a black church .
they could be preaching jihad and we would n't know about it .
we learn this every time there is a racial episode in this country , o.j. or the gena six situation .
people are shocked because there is n't a lot of dialogue between the two races .
yes , they work together now . :: how about bill o'reilly being surprised that people at a restaurant use knives and forks and spoons . :: yes . right .
and they were n't screaming -- :: amazed in harlem they used utensils .
i'm sorry .
some things are beyond imagination , things people say . :: he thought it was going to be dinner time -- chris , would you let me get my joke out .
he thought it was going to be dinner time at the apollo .
he was just going to have dinner , stay for a little of the dogfights and then leave . :: well , let me ask you this , let me get to the tough political question , what is the disconnect between barack obama and working - class regular guys , i do n't like that , joe six pack , joe bag of donuts , the guy who makes less than the national average , working 40 , 50 hours , tired , comes home at night and does n't want to hear about affirmative action or racial change .
he is not connected with that buy the , apparently . :: well , you know , i can sort of understand why that is .
i think we all have sympathy for people who are struggling economically .
i thought it was great barack obama in the speech made the point you are not being kept down by the immigrants or the black guy .
that is not who is your problem .
your problem is the corporation .
the greedy corporation and those pop who put politicians in office who do the bidding of those corporations who rapaciously plunder the workers ' pensions , who take their jobs overseas .
that is the real problem .
that 's that book " what 's the matter with kansas . " the lower middle class people keep voting against their economic interest , people who want to repeal the estate tax and shovel more money into the pockets othe richest 1 % of america .
that is the challenge for a politician like obama or really any democrat is to convince those people who their real problem is .
and their real problem is corporations have taken over america . :: well , great .
it is great to have you on .
i agree with almost everything you say .
john mccain is tricky with the democrats because he is a war hero .
you list that attack on the republican policies if you are a regular person , how it hurts you economically .
suppose they do n't choose between their economic interests and the richer guy 's economic interests .
they choose the war hero , the guy they identify with , personally . :: well , that is very possible .
you know , we are one terrorist attack away from john mccain i'm sure rising in the polls by ten points .
because people think , oh , yeah , he is tougher .
he is not tougher about the war .
he 's dumber about the war .
he 's dumb about the war because he thinks by keeping troops in the heart of the muslim world that 's going to help the war on terror .
that 's exactly what started the war on terror .
that 's why bin laden was so angry at the u.s. because we had tloops in saudi arabia .
we pulled them out after 9/11 , by the way .
of course we go right back in and plant them in the heart of the muslim world and build pizza huts .
that is why young muslim men want to come here and blow themselves up and kill us .
it is not about what happens in iraq .
we need to get out of iraq not build bases there . :: you are a gutsy man , bill maher , and a funny guy .
i'm glad we had a serious show . :: come join us , chris . :: just get hbo .
last time we were on that show it was wild .
friday nights at 11:00 .
What I am going to say is probably not going to be some people ’s favourite thing to hear , but I believe that all the best designed WordPress themes come from one designer : Elena of Design Disease .
I have worked with her for around two years now , and while she might not work with a grid or any of those other “ designer ” conventions , she works around advertising sizes , and has a special style that I am enamoured with .
Even if you just look at the free themes she has released for WordPress , I think you will be amazed at her work .
While it is n’t always the most flexible for adding your own personal style , they are all very beautiful themes .
InSense is a two column design with rounded corners and a distinct blue colour scheme .
It allows the user to switch from a narrow version to a wider version , but I think the narrow version has the better line width , and thus is easier to read .
Illacrimo is a three column theme with another distinct blue colour scheme , this time the design is very different , though many of the elements are positioned the same .
This is by far one of my favourite WordPress themes , though probably the most difficult to shift towards a personal preference design - wise .
Smashing
Theme is a three column theme that has many of the same design elements and influence as Illacrimo , but this time with an orange colour scheme , and some very different graphics .
It was created for Smashing Magazine , hence its name , and is very nice to look at .
I like the way the different content sections in the first sidebar have different colours , and how icons are used very sparingly on this theme .
Gossip City , or really , Gossip City 2 , since Elena did n’t like the first theme , and started again from scratch , is a three column , header heavy theme , that is much easier to modify than most of her other themes , as it keeps the content area very clean , using many less graphics than some of her other themes .
The theme was created for the growing celebrity blog niche , and has become quite popular in that and other arenas .
Christmas Days was Elena ’s first attempt at a seasonal theme with blue , green and red combined , I think she really pulled off the feeling of Christmas .
She had some interesting design challenges when finally releasing the theme to make sure that it was easy for anyone to just drop into their themes folder to use it right away without having to customize any images .
Dilectio is her most recent free theme is another one for Smashing Magazine , this time , the design is again mainly orange for its colour scheme , but has a very natural vine - like feel to it , as swirls of colour are everywhere in the design .
It is three columns , and has a nice wide first sidebar for putting all sorts of content like your Flickr stream , about details , and recent posts and comments .
Not only has Elena of Design Disease released all of these wonderful free themes , but she has also done numerous blog designs , including this one you see today on eXtra For Every Publisher .
Another fine example of the type of WordPress theme design ability that Elena has .
I am always amazed at her work , and I highly recommend everyone check out what she ’s done .
Maybe you ’ve seen all these themes before , but did you know they were all done by one designer ?
If you look through them , you can see her sense of design and style slowly shifting and evolving as she comes up with new designs .
I am at the point now where I can usually tell how old a theme of hers is , just by the placement of certain key elements .
COPENHAGEN , Denmark ( AP ) 
Bands of youths set fire to cars and trash bins overnight in a fourth consecutive night of vandalism mostly in immigrant neighborhoods of the Danish capital , police said .
Seventeen people were arrested , Copenhagen Police spokesman Flemming Steen Munch said , adding police were not sure what sparked the violence .
Some observers said immigrant youths were protesting against perceived police harassment and suggested the reprinting of a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad in Danish newspapers Wednesday , may have aggravated the situation .
" They feel provocations and discrimination by the police that stop then now and then to check them , " Copenhagen social worker Khalid Al - Subeihi said .
" It does n't make it easier when the cartoons come back again . "
The youths set dozens of fires in several districts of Copenhagen , torching cars and trash bins and in some cases hurling rocks at police .
Newspaper Jyllands - Posten said one of its photographers received minor injuries when he was attacked by vandals in the Noerrebro district .
It was not immediately clear whether the attackers knew he was working for Jyllands - Posten , which first printed the 12 cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that sparked massive protests in Muslim countries two years ago .
More than a dozen Danish newspapers reprinted one of the cartoons on Wednesday in a gesture of solidarity after police revealed an alleged plot to kill the creator of the caricature .
Munch said he did not know whether the reprinting of the cartoon had any part in the violence .
" We see different reasons for the rioting , " Munch said .
" We do not know why exactly .
It can be because of boredom , it can be because police in recent weeks have stepped up its search for knives , it can be other things too . "
There were also reports of vandalism in Aarhus , Denmark 's second - largest town , but no arrests were made .

ROME ( AP )  Italian police said Monday they have seized 30 tons of Chinese - made steel that had been contaminated by a radioactive substance .
The environmental protection police squad said the steel was destined for the industrial production of chimneys and pulleys , and long - term exposure could have been dangerous for workers handling it .
Police said in a statement that the shipment had come from China 's TISCO company and had arrived in the northern port town of La Spezia in May last year .
The steel had been accidentally mixed during production with cobalt - 60 , a radioactive isotope of cobalt , police said .
Officers seized it last week after radiation turned up in tests on metal scraps at companies across Italy that had used part of the shipment .
China 's exports have come under intense scrutiny in the past year after potentially deadly chemicals were found in goods including toothpaste , toys and seafood .

Bob Novak has a report out that says unnamed “ Illinois Democrats ” are “ quietly passing the word that John Edwards will be named attorney general in an Obama administration . ”
Novak is a hyperpartisan bullshit artist who will make stuff up in order drive a wedge between Democrats , so it ’s hard to take this all that seriously .
But it does raise an interesting thought experiment .
John Edwards is a passionate fighter for the poor , for labor , and for universal health care — he would be a wonderful addition to any Democratic administration .
He would be a great attorney general , particularly because he could fight for workers on labor law issues and he could fight for the traditionally disenfranchised on election law .
He could really reinvigorate the role of the Secretary of Labor .
He could head a regulatory agency like the FDA , where his distaste for corporate power could combine with his passion for fair and affordable health care .
And he would make an exciting VP choice for Obama , as I ’ve said for quite some time .
That ’s a long - winded way of saying , even if he does n’t get the nomination , more Edwards !
Of course , the Edwards folks probably do n’t want to hear that .
They want to hear “ Edwards for prez ! ”
And that ’s why the Obama people are floating this rumor , assuming it ’s true : it gets the progressive media to laud Edwards ’ potential as an attorney general while further marginalizing his chances for the presidency .

Lorne Michaels has an answer to the political columns , cartoons and comments that have accused his show , “ Saturday Night Live , ” of favoring Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton during her primary showdown with Senator Barack Obama : Nope .
“ I ’m in show business and I never , ever forget that , ” Mr. Michaels said in a telephone interview on Tuesday night .
“ We put on a comedy show . ”
Or as Jim Downey , the “ SNL ” writer who has created all of the recent political sketches on the show  and most of its famous ones going back two decades  put it on Wednesday , “ I ’m just trying to make the sketches funny . ”
Over the past three weeks “ SNL ” has put itself back into the national discussion  not a bad place for any television show to be , as Mr. Michaels acknowledged  first with a series of sketches that have centered on the premise that Mrs. Clinton has been the target of a vengeful press that sees Mr. Obama with stars in its eyes and also with the overt ( albeit comic ) endorsement of Mrs. Clinton by Tina Fey , the former “ SNL ” star who returned on Feb. 23 to be the host of the first show after the recent writers ’ strike .
“ Bitches get stuff done , ” Ms. Fey said , using herself as an example .

ANKARA , Turkey , Oct. 26 — Turkey ’s prime minister on Friday rejected an Iraqi proposal that included a military role for the United States in resolving a standoff over raids by Kurdish guerrillas across the rugged border into Turkey .
The offer , made by a delegation of senior Iraqi officials , was rejected by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who said it failed to meet his country ’s demands in dealing with the guerrillas , the Kurdistan Workers ’ Party , or P.K.K .
In its latest raid , on Sunday , the group killed 12 Turkish soldiers and took eight captive .
“ I can say that there is not really anything positive or anything that met our expectations , ” Mr. Erdogan said , after his foreign minister , Ali Babacan , met with the Iraqi delegation here .
The Iraqis proposed positioning American soldiers in border forts in the Qandil Mountains , a jagged area that has never been fully under the control of any government .
Although American military officials were part of the delegation taking part in the meetings , it was unclear what role , if any , the military might ultimately agree to .

If you own a farily new video game console and love retro gaming then chances are you ’ve indulged in at least one of the many old school gaming compilations that have hit the consoles in recent years .
There really has been an impressive slew of titles .
Some of the best include :
As well as a never ending slew of arcade compilations by Midway , Capcom , Namco and other developers from the 80s .
The compilations just never seem to stop .
Why Retro Compilations ?
Retro game compilations took off a few years back and became hugely popular in a short matter of time .
Its no surprise really as they :
are easier , cheaper and quicker to develop than a full production game
are also easy to market
are tempting to players who have never experienced the franchise as they can buy one game and be up to date ( italics )
generally speaking the price of the compilation is cheaper than the sum of the individual games
bonus content
What Could Stop the Greatness Retro Compilations ?
There is only one thing getting in the way of retro compilations becoming even more popular , that is digital distribution games .
Every next generation current generation home console has a service where individual retro games can be downloaded from an online store .
Because gamers buy each game individually game publishers can ramp up the price and get away with it .
So far developers seem to support both options which is the best outcome for the consumers as it gives us more choice .
DP ’s Retro Compilation Wishlist
There is no denying that there are plenty of great Retro Compilation games that I could ( and after this ) will dream up .
But more importantly , I want to see some already existing compilations be released in PAL regions .
Now I know that this is n’t going to happen as many of these games came out years ago .
But thats why its a wishlist right ?
PAL Wishlist
Street Fighter Anniversary Collection
MegaMan Anniversary Collection
Megaman X Collection
Vampire : Darkstalkers Collection
Ninja Gaiden Trilogy
Its absolutely ridiculous that Capcom wo n’t bring these games out into PAL territories .
We ‘ve got Street Fighter Alpha Anthology so it makes no sense for them not to release Street Fighter Anniversary Collection .
What this means is that the only legal means that anyone can play a PAL version of Street Fighter III in PAL territories ( the UK , Australia and New Zealand ) is to either play it on a Dreamcast or in the Arcades .
So lets see , the Dreamcast is extinct and the price of playing in the arcades is 10 x the price that it was fifteen years ago ( and then you need to find the actual machine ) .
This is just ridiculous .
As for DarkStalkers and Megaman well they also should make the jump , its just common sense .
I ’d also like to know what happened to Ninja Gaiden Trilogy .
I ’m not sure if this had a PAL release or not but I can’t find a PAL version of the game so I assume that it did n’t .
General Wishlist
Sega Saturn / Dreamcast Collection
Sega Megadrive Collection was an absolutely awesome compilation of Sega ’s brightest titles for the Megadrive .
With 27 top titles and only a few duds , this was essential gaming .
So , if Sega can make a compilation for the Megadrive then why not the Saturn and Dreamcast as well ?
Sega have already proven to us that they like to re-release their old games .
For example the re-release of Nights for the PS2 in Japan , Crazy Taxi 1 + 2 on the PSP , Sonic Adventure 1 + 2 on the Gamecube and now House of the Dead for the Wii .
So you get my drift .
With the massive size of a Blu-ray disc and Sega ’s obsession of re-releasing old content it all makes sense .
Any Sort of Nintendo Compilation
Something which does n’t make any sense is Nintendo making any sort of game compilation .
The last decent compilation that they made was Super Mario All Stars on the SNES ( Game and Watch Galleries do n’t count ) .
Remember how awesome this game was ?
Such value for money .
Its a pity that the Virtual Console and the stacks of dough they can make from the GBA / DS re-releases practically ensure that we will never see a Nintendo game compilation ever again .
Just for the sake of it a Mario / Metroid / Zelda compilation would obviously be fantastic .
But what I think would even better is a compilation of all of the Japanese Nintendo Wars and Fire Emblem games that never saw a release out side of Japan .
This would be an absolute dream for the fans of both game series .
TMNT Collection
TMNT are awesome and furthermore their video games were some of the best licensed games ever made .
Some sort of compilation of all the great TMNT games like Turtles in Time , The Arcade and Tournament Fighters would be absolutely sweet .
Most of these games go for ridiculous prices on eBay or are just too hard to find .
Theres only one problem with this dream .
It would take multiple game publishers to team up in order to get this compilation out on the shelves .
There are far too many implications for this to be worth the effort for publishers .
Others
Theres a few more ideas that I have for the wishlist but I can’t write much about them so heres a list :
A SNK Arcade Essentials Compilation
A SNK Fighting Essentials Compilation
Essential Shmps Compilation
Resident Evil Missing Titles ( RE 1.5 , RE GBC and RE2 GBA tech demos , alt RE4 versions )
Capcom CPS - 2
Best of
Conclusion
So after reading this you probably have a few ideas of your own compilations that you ’d like to see be released ( well , you must because I could go on for days ^_^ ) .
So go ahead and let me know by posting in the comment box .

Dear Dell
I am customer of yours .
I own a Dell Latitude X1 laptop , my wife has an Inspiron 6400 and on my recommendation , my father bought a Dell Dimension 5150 desktop system .
Dell , I think its important for you to know that none of these machines run windows .
All of them run Linux exclusively and have from the day they came into our possession .
However for all of these systems we had to pay money to Microsoft for operating systems we have never used .
The reason I am writing this now is that the warranty on my Latitude X1 runs out in November of this year .
That means that some time between now and November I will be purchasing a new laptop .
One candidate for my new machine is the very , very attractive Dell XPS M1330 :
When I buy my new laptop , I would like to buy it either with Linux pre-installed or without any OS at all .
Since I know Linux very , very well indeed , I do not need Dell to support Linux , just the hardware .
For me as long time , devoted Linux user and developer ( professionally as well as FOSS ) , having to pay money for a Microsoft operating system I do n't use is rather offensive .
Microsoft has run a long term campaign to thwart the progress of Linux and my money is being used to fund that campaign .
For me , this situation in unconscionable .
Apart from the not being able to buy machines without a Microsoft operating system , my experience with Dell has been very good .
If I was able to buy a machine from Dell without a Microsoft operating system , buying from Dell would be a no - brainer .
So Dell , here is my challenge for you .
Offer me a good looking , high end laptop with lots of juicy options like the XPS with either Linux pre-installed or with no operating system and make sure that these options are reflected in the pricing ( ie the Linux or no -OS options should be cheaper than the windows option ) .
If you can do that you are almost guaranteed of keeping me as a customer .
If not , I will be looking elsewhere for a company that can meet my requirements .
If Dell loses this sale , it will likely lose other sales from my immediate family , friends and employers .
Dell , the ball is in your court .
Thanks for listening .
Update : 16:47
Someone posted this to programming .
reddit.com and it seems that if you are in the US at least , you can indeed get a Dell XPS with Ubuntu pre-installed .
One good thing about the machine offered is that its got an Intel video chipset which I prefer to the Nvidia one .
On the downside , its missing some of the options that I can get in the windows version like the solid state disk .
I 've just looked again at the Dell Austalia website and I simply cannot find a page where I can get a similar machine .
So Dell Australia or Asia / Pacific , what about making Ubuntu an option for the Dell XPS available here in Australia ?

Classic flash games still test your wits
If you love online mobile gaming , you are like the classic Colossus exploring the assorted paths of your profession , and you 'll definitely not stop till you 've answered every single question regarding what the entire realm entails .
Here , we present to you some stimulating and awakening game types .
The best thing is that you are n't barred by one type from exploring another - without hesitation , delve - in , read through , and find out where you belong .
What are the advantages of reflex - based games ?
Reflex - based games are tactfully designed , apparently by scientists or any other experts who understand the benefits they convey when one plays such games .
Have you ever asked yourself why you seem to transform drastically even with the slightest exposure to some online games ?
If you have n't had an opportunity for such exposure yet , spare some of your moments and search for any reflex - based game that entices your senses and play it .
Thereafter , you will definitely witness some transformations just in time , not only in your physical functioning , but in the manner of your mental functioning as well .
Then you 'll imagine you 've been too late to start enjoying reflex - based games .
How strategy games sharpen your mind
Just like reflex - based games , strategy games are an incentive to your moods and the speed of thinking and reasoning .
Perhaps , this now provides an answer as to why your grade results looks like they did ?
As if a math teacher joined in , just to encourage us to play on , and at such times we could over - play our hand , but all was nevertheless fun .
Whereas it's now vividly apparent to us how immensely we used to enjoy strategy games , little did you know the intent behind the design of such amazing games is often outdated for modern programming .
Even if you are in the adult stage of your life , we have some strategy games ready for you to play .
Then you can be sure it 's one way of cultivating your level of tasking and multi-tasking .
Do not be too busy to attend to your own mental health .
You ’ll need these games for this purpose .
Have you discovered these top five HTML5 free game sites ?
You ’re probably not worried how it ’s possible that your favorite HTML5 games can be played online absolutely free of charge ?
Yet landing onto a sketchy site , if you have n't tried our best free sites is often considered too risky .
Off course , not every site offers such free games that are reputable are definitely free of technical bugs .
Especially using a smartphone where online bugs can damage your phone memory and security features .
And your gaming experience is thus uninterrupted .
Do n’t go searching for these sites since there are too many to count likewise - and many end up being porthole sites anyway .
With HTML as your guiding keyword , you can't miss out through our guide to gaming adventures .
HTML5 technology was a big savior and a safe replacement for the older Flash games .
A lot of online casino websites , for example used to create online games for people to gamble online and the games were built with Adobe Flash technology .
This is no longer the case as the web has evolved and HTML5 games are now everywhere , letting people play online slots for real money .
The games are of a superb quality with amazing graphics and sounds .
A lot of popular fun themes are used and a variety of payment methods can be applied to deposit money and withdraw the winnings .
Payment methods such as Skrill , Paypal and American Express can be used in these fantastic money games .
Do not ignore these great flash games you can still play
The term ‘ flash ' is just a customary term meant to describe the kind of program used to activate a selected game using Adobe Flash .
It has been announced that Adobe will finally pull the plug for the ‘ Flash Plug - in ’ in the beginning of 2020 .
That means if flash sites that are n’t updated before that time do n’t upgrade to HTML5 , these games will simply disappear .
Do n’t worry - we still have some excellent flash games that challenge your reflexes and boggle your mind .

The End
A senior US Department of Homeland Security official has floated the idea of requiring citizens to produce federally compliant identification before purchasing some over - the - counter medicines .
" If you have a good ID ... you make it much harder for the meth labs to function in this country , " DHS Assistant Secretary for Policy Stewart Baker told an audience last month at the Heritage Foundation .
Cold medicines like Sudafed have long been used in the production of methamphetamine .
Over the past year or so , pharmacies have been required to track buyers of drugs that contain pseudoephedrine .
His comment came five days after the agency released final rules implementing the REAL ID Act of 2005 that made no mention of such requirements .
It mandates the establishment uniform standards and procedures that must be met before state - issued licenses can be accepted as identification for official purposes .
Beyond boarding airplanes and entering federal buildings or nuclear facilities , there are no other official purposes spelled out in the regulations .
And that 's just what concerns people at the Center for Democracy and Technology .
They say Baker 's statement underscores " mission creep , " in which the scope and purpose of the REAL ID Act gradually expands over time .
" Baker 's suggested mission creep pushes the REAL ID program farther down the slippery slope toward a true national ID card , " CDT blogger Greg Burnett wrote here .
He says requiring people to produce a federally approved ID to buy cold medicine is a good example of the " significant ramifications " attached to the act .
So far , 17 states have formally opposed REAL ID , which takes effect on May 11 .
Residents of those states will be subject to additional searches and other inconveniences when flying and may be barred from entering federal buildings and nuclear plants .
Baker 's statement belying the official DHS position on REAL ID is n't the first time the agency has made confusing remarks about the legal requirements surrounding identification .
According to travel writer Edward Hasbrouck , DHS officials continue to plant the misunderstanding that residents from states which do n't comply with REAL ID requirements wo n't get on planes .
They will , Hasbrouck asserts here .
In fact , he says , airlines are prevented by law from requiring any kind of ID .
Nonetheless , the DHS website continues to claim a photo ID is needed to pass through security checkpoints .
Hasbrouck has his suspicions about the motives for such statements .
" The most obvious explanation is that they want to use the implied ( but legally and factually empty ) threat of denial of air travel to intimidate states into ' voluntarily ' complying with the Real - ID Act and its rules , " he writes . ®

10 The Bat Bomb
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Working on the premise any weapon is cooler if it flies in the night on leathery wings , Bat Bombs were proposed by a dental surgeon in the '40s .
Naturally the President thought it was awesome so a plan was rolled out to make the night unsafe for anyone that did n't want to have small explosives get stuck in their hair .
The Plan :
Because bats can carry a good amount of weight and tend to sneak into buildings and such , the plan was to make an army of flying rodent suicide bombers and release them over Japan .
The little fellas had small napalm explosive kits made for them , which were probably the cutest incendiary devices ever , and then cases were constructed that would be dropped from B - 29s , releasing the bats .

At dawn , they 'd flee to buildings until the timers on their little bombs went off .
So far , so fucking crazy .
What went wrong :
Things got sketchy when some armed bats were accidentally released and set up shop under a fuel tank on an Air Force base .
So , yeah , that burnt to the ground .
But , hey , it proved the damn things worked , so the people involved looked at that as a silver lining .
Given that the bomb casings they 'd made for the bats could hold over 1,000 bats , they assumed just one bomber could hold up to 200,000 little flaming night terrors and some initial test data concluded these bat bombs were actually superior to regular fire bombs .

But after a couple million bucks in funding , the plan was scrapped .
The plan was moving forward too slowly , the bats were unpredictable and the guys at the Manhattan Project were talking about having some kind of miracle bomb that could do the work of like , a million bats .

New Kind of Antiretroviral , KP - 1461 ; Clinical Trial Recruiting .
Interview with Stephen Becker , M.D .
by John S. James
Summary : KP - 1461 , an experimental HIV drug already in a phase II trial , works so differently from other antiretrovirals that at first glance it looked like science fiction , and we found it hard to take seriously as a current possibility today .
In fact this drug is highly credible , and based on elegant science that goes back at least 25 years .
KP - 1461 is the only antiretroviral in human use or testing that can eradicate HIV from laboratory cell cultures .
No one knows how it will work in people -- but we might know by the second quarter of 2008 , when the current phase II trial could be complete .
AIDS Treatment News interviewed Dr. Stephen Becker , a leading AIDS physician and researcher who is vice president of clinical development at Koronis Pharmaceuticals , in Seattle , Washington .

AIDS Treatment News interviewed Dr. Stephen Becker , a leading AIDS physician and researcher who is vice president of clinical development at Koronis Pharmaceuticals , in Seattle , Washington .
Background :
The scientific story began when Mansfeld Eigen ( who had already won a Nobel Prize in chemistry for other work ) applied his chemistry and mathematics background to problems in biology , and with Peter Schuster and others developed the concept of quasispecies .
Standard Darwinian evolution predicts that the fittest strain of an organism , the one that reproduces fastest in a given environment , will displace the other strains there .
But a virus like HIV is different ; it is always mutating , and can mutate back and forth between different strains .
The result is that HIV , in a patient with advanced infection or AIDS , exists as millions of related strains within the same patient ( usually only one was transmitted , and then it evolved within that individual into countless slightly different variants ) .
This makes HIV hard to treat , because some members of the quasispecies probably already have resistance mutations to a new drug even by chance alone , and these resistant viruses are ready to be selected and become much more prevalent when the drug is started .
The conventional approach to this problem is to use combinations of different drugs , hoping to suppress HIV to such a low level that little mutation and evolution can take place .
This may suppress the virus for years , but has never succeeded in eradicating it , so patients usually have to stay on treatment for life .
Quasispecies follow different rules than Darwinian evolution .
For example , it is possible at least in theory for the strain that reproduces fastest to be replaced entirely by strains that individually reproduce more slowly , but are more fit as a quasispecies .
Eigen and Schuster also wrote a well - known book , The Hypercycle : A Principle of Natural Self - Organization , published in 1979 on quasispecies and related concepts .
A way to attack a quasispecies as a whole is to increase the already - high mutation rate , leading to an " error catastrophe " and collapse of the population .
This approach was used to design the drug now in a phase II trial , KP - 1461 .
KP - 1461 is a nucleoside analog , like AZT , 3TC , and the others ; once inside the cell it is chemically modified ( triphosphorylated ) into its active form ( called KP - 1212 ) , which can replace one of the four bases used to make DNA .
( The four bases are adenosine , cytodine , thymidine , and guanosine -- some say that the initials ' ACTG ' for the government AIDS clinical - trials network were not just coincidence . )
In DNA the bases are paired , forming the famous double helix ; cytidine always pairs with guanosine , and thymidine always pairs with adenosine .
KP -1212 can replace cytidine when the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase is building a new copy of HIV , and pair normally with guanosine .
It does not terminate the DNA chain .
But KP - 1212 was chemically designed to be a flexible molecule , such that it can also look like thymidine and then pair with adenosine .
This introduces an error that then is locked into the viral DNA .
These errors happen at random , anywhere in the virus ; and when they do not kill the virus outright , they accumulate over generations in the DNA of the viral population .
The result is eventually an error catastrophe that can wipe out the entire quasispecies , at least in laboratory tests .
If you then take the drug away , the virus does not come back .
And the cells on which the virus grew are still alive -- cured of the infection .
AZT and the other approved nucleoside analogs terminate the growth of the DNA chain , killing the copy of virus being built .
But that copy is easily replaced by other copies that do not have an abnormal error accumulation , so the population as a whole is not damaged .
In contrast , KP - 1212 continues to add new errors to the population , in addition to the errors that are already there due to the very high normal mutation rate of HIV .

AIDS Treatment News interviewed Dr. Stephen Becker in mid September 2007 .
Dr. Becker , who has been well known for years as a leading AIDS clinician and scientist , was hired last year by Koronis Pharmaceuticals , a small company in Seattle , Washington , to design and conduct the clinical trial that could lead to proof of principle of KP - 1461 .
Interview with Dr. Becker
AIDS Treatment News :
Am I correct in believing that KP - 1461 causes lots of mutations of HIV ?
Dr. Becker : Yes .
KP - 1461 is a nucleoside analog [ a false building block of the viral DNA ] .
It is a cytidine analog .
But unlike all the conventional HIV nukes , it is not a chain terminator , it does not inhibit reverse transcription in the way that all of the conventional nukes do .
It is incorporated by reverse transcriptase , and once it 's incorporated , just as the transcription process would dictate , there is base - pair matching that goes on .
KP -1461 is actually a prodrug [ a medicine designed to be orally usable , which changes into its active form inside the body ] .
The active drug , intracellularly triphosphorylated like all the other nucleosides , is KP - 1212 .
But for ease of discussion we may call it KP - 1461 , even though we know that 's the prodrug .
Once KP - 1212 is incorporated by reverse transcriptase into the copy strand , it can appear in one of two forms .
It can appear as its native cytidine , but also can appear as a thymidine .
This happens because of the flexible structure of the drug .
It is able to tautomerize ( the chemical term ) ; it is incorporated as a cytidine , but then appears ambiguous to the complementary base .
If it appears as a cytidine it would normally pair with a guanosine ( following Watson - Crick base - pairing rules ) .
But when it appears as a thymidine to the complementary base , it winds up pairing with adenosine , causing a base - pair mismatch .
So the drug actually brings about base - pairing errors , usually guanosine -> adenosine errors .
Once the wrong base is incorporated and a base - pairing error exists , it is locked into the proviral DNA .
With every replication cycle , this base - pairing error is perpetuated .
As the drug continues to be administered , there is a progressive accumulation of errors , throughout the viral genome .
There is no preferential hot spot for incorporation ; so base - pairing errors will appear in all the viral genes .
Each mutation that the virus acquires tends to reduce its fitness -- the viability , the infectivity , of the virus .
So a mutational accumulation ( as the theory held , and as we demonstrated in test - tube cell cultures ) brings about the collapse of the viral population .
If you progressively add too many mutations , you exceed an error threshold , or a threshold of viral viability , and the population collapses .
The theory for this came from Manfred Eigen -- who won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1967 for something called fast reactions .
In the 80s and the 90s he applied his chemist 's and mathematician 's brain to problems in biology .
At Harvard he asked biologists to tell him about the problems they wrestled with , and he came up with the theory of viruses including HIV which exist as a quasispecies -- meaning that it exists with many viral variants ( ' strains ' ) in a population .
Some of the strains will be very fit , infectious and pathogenic ; others will be weak or have lesser degrees of fitness or infectivity .
The virus has an advantage in this population form , because having certain strains with resistance mutations allows the viral population to evade selective killing pressures of HIV drugs , or of the host immune system .
So Dr. Eigen developed the concept of viral quasispecies , and suggested that if you hypermutate the virus , you could push it to the state of non-viability ; you could exceed error permissiveness , you could bring about an error catastrophe in the population , and the virus would collapse .
This theory has been out there for a while ; Eigen published during the 1990s .
And scientists from the University of Washington and MIT , ( Jim Mullins , the HIV virologist , Larry Loeb , a DNA polymerase expert , an MD PhD also at University of Washington who studies mutations and cancer , and a chemist at MIT , John Essigmann ) , came up with the idea of fashioning a drug that could induce mutations in HIV , and helped develop KP - 1461 .
Several series of in vitro experiments were done in cell cultures , using a very nasty strain of HIV , a homogeneous , highly fit virus .
And after an average 15 serial passages , that virus was irreversibly extinguished -- repeatedly .
Repeated , published experiments have demonstrated that you can collapse the viral population with KP - 1461 .
You and I both know that none of the HIV drugs currently marketed have been able to extinguish the virus in laboratory cultures , and certainly not in humans .
They may be very potent inhibitors , but when the drug is taken away , the virus re-grows .
That did not happen with KP - 1461 .
It 's distinguishing feature , from a therapeutic perspective , is that it is capable of viral eradication in vitro .
We do n't know if that will happen in humans ; this is exactly what the current phase II clinical trial is designed to determine .
I came to Koronis Pharmaceuticals almost a year ago , to design and execute the trials that would demonstrate proof of concept of the drug .
That 's precisely where we are at this point .
There is an ongoing phase II clinical trial ; it is a very hard trial to recruit .
But we have enrolled 8 patients out of a projected enrollment of 32 .
They will be dosed with KP - 1461 as monotherapy for four months .
The serial passage data showed extinction of the virus after 15 serial passages in the laboratory .
If you use that with the David Ho - Alan Perelson calculations of HIV kinetics ( and all you really can do is a back - if - an - envelope type of calculation ) , we think it will take a couple months to bring about an effect in humans .
So the four months was chosen in part reflective of this couple months of dosing , and the fact that there is animal safety data that will permit a study of four months .
We 've gone through phase I studies ; a phase IA study in healthy volunteers , and a phase IB study in 50 HIV - infected individuals , similar in description to the current phase IIA subjects .
They were triple - class - experienced individuals ; the drug was given in the 1B study for 14 days , because that is all the animal safety data there was at that time .
The bottom line for the phase I studies is that the drug appears safe and quite well tolerated .
The findings from the IA and IB and the strength of the in vitro data , including genotoxicity and mutagenesis studies done in the preclinical stage , took us to performing phase IIA studies .
ATN : What keeps KP - 1461 from harming human DNA ?
Dr. Becker :
There are two very fundamental safety questions that people have , and this is one of them .
The question is how specific a viral mutagen is this drug , to what extent is it capable of mutating host DNA , which of course would not be a good thing .
The answers to that are as follows .
Genotoxicity depends on how much of the drug is incorporated by human DNA polymerase , and how much of it is excised [ cut out ] .
In the case of human DNA in the nucleus of cells , KP - 1461 is very poorly incorporated -- a log [ about 10 fold ] less than any of the other nucleoside analogs .
But it is incorporated to a modest degree , about as much as 3TC or tenofovir , by gamma polymerase in human mitochondrial DNA .
However , it is very quickly proofread and excised .
We have done those experiments , and we and the FDA are satisfied with them for dosing , at least this far in our development program .
ATN : What is the other safety issue ?
Dr. Becker :
The other key question that people rapidly come up with is , could you create a supervirus ?
This needs to be considered .
It is a concept that most of us are not familiar with .
In HIV therapeutics we are trying to avoid mutations and avoid viral diversity .
KP - 1461 is a drug intended to create mutations and increase viral diversity .
The question of whether you could create a supervirus is one that , at this time , has much less data than the viral vs. host DNA selectivity question .
We can only speak in terms of virology , HIV virology , and evolution .
And these studies suggest that of 100 mutations , 49 of them are non-coding ; they do n't result in an altered protein in any way .
These mutations do not change viral enzymes .
So they are basically silent .
Fifty of the 100 mutations will reduce viral fitness .
We see this all the time with HIV .
A mutation in response to a drug impairs the fitness of the virus .
Sometimes that fitness hit is greater ( as with K65R or 184V mutations ) , and sometimes less ; but they all impair viral fitness .
One percent of mutations are believed to increase viral fitness .
So could we create a supervirus ?
On theoretic grounds it is possible but not likely at all .
HIV has evolved to become the supervirus .
Mother nature has been testing billions of mutations for decades .
For example , compared to Ebola , HIV is successful because it does not kill its host in days .
Evolution has selected against the most pathogenic strains that would kill the host too quickly before the virus could be transmitted throughout a human population , which is of course exactly what the virus from its perspective is trying to do .
So one could argue that mother nature has in some ways already created this supervirus .
The most efficient and effective virus already exists .
And 99 of 100 mutations are going to reduce the virus 's fitness , not increase it .
Current Clinical Trial
ATN : Our main question is on the inclusion criteria for the trial .
Patients must have had extensive antiretroviral experience , but have been off all antiretrovirals for at least 16 weeks .
This seems to be difficult to find .
Could you describe not just the criteria , but also the kinds of patients -- maybe they have used antiretrovirals and do n't have good options , so they stopped ?
Dr. Becker : I can see three general patient populations that would be suitable for this study .
One group of patients might qualify because they were treated too early in their infection , treated with less than suppressive regimens , or were not fully compliant when they were given a suppressive regimen .
In the 90s we treated people with 700 T - cells and a viral load of 5,000 -- at the time , that was what we were supposed to be doing .
In retrospect that was probably too early ; we did n't even know whether that patient was a progressor or not .
So one category would be patients who may have been treated too early , with less than fully suppressive therapy , who now have stable T - cells ; they are off therapy , but they have resistant virus .
Another category of patients would be those who for whatever reasons cannot construct a regimen expected to be suppressive .
That could be because they participated in an integrase trial and have integrase resistance already , or their insurance company will not cover the Trofile assay and it's not clear that they can use maraviroc -- or they are not ready to go back onto a combination of conventional antivirals -- they do n't really have as many options as a genotype or phenotype might suggest , because of intolerance or allergy to some of the drugs .
So that is a second general category of patient .
And the third might be patients who just do not tolerate a 3 - drug or 4 - drug antiretroviral regimen .
If you need to use ritonavir , there are some people who cannot even take 100 mg of ritonavir without getting sick .
Those are the three general categories of patients I think would be potentially suitable for consideration .
Of the eight patients we 've enrolled so far , a couple fall into that treated too early , non-suppressive regimen category .
And we actually have one individual who was infected with triple - class resistant virus .
Even though they are not treatment experienced , I provided a waiver for that patient , because they had a terribly ugly genotype of triple - class resistant virus , though by transmission , not prior therapy .
But I wanted people to be off of therapy for sound reasons -- in this post - SMART era where almost nobody should be off therapy .
I wanted to make sure that these were folks who felt , with their clinicians , that there was a solid reason to be off of antiretrovirals .
I wanted them off for 16 weeks , so that they would have gone through whatever sort of reversion to wild type , and may be at a new CD4 and viral load steady state .
I did not want somebody who was about to have immunological or clinical progression because their virus was suddenly very active and very pathogenic .
That is why we are requiring 16 weeks off of therapy .
We require a CD4 count of at least 250 because we wanted patients who were not at proximate risk for an AIDS - defining event .
Somebody with 50 T - cells would be too much at risk , and I think ought to be on some conventional therapy .
One could argue that we could have set it the limit at 200 or 150 , but we picked 250 for the moment .
We know that this will be a very hard study to enroll .
So for 32 patients , we have 23 sites up throughout the U.S. , and we will have in total probably 30 sites .
So we are just looking for one or two patients per site .
We want quality not quantity ; this is a different kind of study , so we approached it from the perspective of many sites with low enrollment .
ATN : How can potential volunteers find a site near them ?
Dr. Becker : On http://www.clinicaltrials.gov search for KP - 1461 .
This shows the current sites , and whether they are recruiting , as of the date of the last changes , which is posted on the site .
Check back in case none are near you , as we are still adding more sites .
Summary
ATN : How would you summarize the importance of this study ?
Dr. Becker :
This drug is clearly different in concept , and clearly different in the laboratory .
It must be tested ; we have seen so many drugs that looked good but did not work .
While the current generation of antiretrovirals is really good , eradication of the virus has been taken off of the agenda .
Maybe the current drugs cannot achieve that .
But we have to have eradication remain as a therapeutic imperative .
It is up to creative scientists , chemist and virologists , to create drugs that can eradicate HIV .
We have many things to contend with -- sanctuary sites , and latent resting reservoirs -- but who is to say that the next generation of drugs should not have eradication as its goal ?
I think we will have clinical data by the second quarter of next year , to indicate whether or not we are on the right track .
I want the community , doctors and patients , to be fully aware of this drug , aware of its laboratory demonstrations , and know that we are trying to test it in early stage clinically .
We do n't know whether four months dosing will be enough .
We came up with four months based on a back - of - the - envelope projection , and animal safety data .
But it could be that 4 months is right , or 2 months is sufficient , or that your really need 10 months .
We wo n't know that until we complete these studies .
But we will make KP - 1461 available to any individual who participates in the phase II studies , should it be apparent that the drug is effective and safe , but maybe needs to be given for a longer duration .
We will work with the FDA to establish a protocol that will provide drug for those who participated in our early development trials should they need further treatment .
Often patients who participate in early stage studies are excluded from further access to the drug .
We have committed , and put into writing , that we will establish a protocol for those who might benefit from further KP - 1461 therapy .
Koronis Pharmaceuticals is a private company ; there are only 17 of us .
It is a very small group of people wearing many different hats .
Our aspiration is not to become the next Gilead .
But if this drug is active we would love to partner with larger pharma , to conduct late - stage HIV trials , which as you know is a fully international several thousand patient venture .
That is nothing that a company like ours could possibly do alone .

Patrons of Truth and Justice , and to whom it may concern , i have awaited this day ... and now it is here .
The entire world , all of humanity , owes Lieutenant Colonel Bob Bowman a great debt of gratitude for having the courage to speak truth to power as he does hereby call on the military of the Republic of the United States of America to fulfill their solemn oath to " uphold and protect the Constitution from all enemies , both foreign and domestic " and arrest Bush and Cheney for treason and crimes against humanity .
Forget about Congress , they 're complicit in this treachery .
Do n't waste your time calling your Congresscritter .
Call your friends and family in the military , pass along this important letter from a true American hero ... Lieutenant Colonel Bob Bowman .
Thank you Bob !
Organize , get active ... remember , our future is in our hands .
It 's now time for the People of this country -- including , and especially , the military -- to seize these pathocrats and abolish this criminal enterprise masquerading as a " duly elected , representative democracy " before it destroys all of humanity .

Dear Comrades in Arms ,
You are facing challenges in 2007 that we of previous generations never dreamed of .
I 'm just an old fighter pilot ( 101 combat missions in Vietnam , F - 4 Phantom , Phu Cat , 1969 - 1970 ) who 's now a disabled veteran with terminal cancer from Agent Orange .
Our mailing list ( over 22,000 ) includes veterans from all branches of the service , all political parties , and all parts of the political spectrum .
We are Republicans and Democrats , Greens and Libertarians , Constitutionists and Reformers , and a good many Independents .
What unites us is our desire for a government that ( 1 ) follows the Constitution , ( 2 ) honors the truth , and ( 3 ) serves the people .
We see our government going down the wrong path , all too often ignoring military advice , and heading us toward great danger .
And we look to you who still serve as the best hope for protecting our nation from disaster .
We see the current Iraq War as having been unnecessary , entered into under false pretenses , and horribly mismanaged by the civilian authorities .
Thousands of our brave troops have been needlessly sacrificed in a futile attempt at occupation of a hostile land .
Many more thousands have suffered wounds which will change their lives forever .
Tens of thousands have severe psychological problems because of what they have seen and what they have done .
Potentially hundreds of thousands could be poisoned by depleted uranium , with symptoms appearing years later , just as happened to us exposed to Agent Orange .
The military services are depleted and demoralized .
The VA system is under - funded and overwhelmed .
The National Guard and Reserves have been subjected to tour after tour , disrupting lives for even the lucky ones who return intact .
Jobs have been lost , marriages have been destroyed , homes have been foreclosed , and children have been estranged .
And for what ?
We have lost allies , made new enemies , and created thousands of new terrorists , further endangering the American people .
But you know all this .
I 'm sure you also see the enormous danger in a possible attack on Iran , possibly with nuclear weapons .
Such an event , seriously contemplated by the Cheney faction of the Bush administration , would make enemies of Russia and China and turn us into the number one rogue nation on earth .
The effect on our long - term national security would be devastating .
Some of us had hoped that the new Democratic Congress would end the occupation of Iraq and take firm steps to prevent an attack on Iran , perhaps by impeaching Bush and Cheney .
These hopes have been dashed .
The lily - livered Democrats have caved in , turning their backs on those few ( like Congressman Jack Murtha ) who understand the situation .
Many of us have personally walked the halls of Congress , to no avail .
This is where you come in .
We know that many of you share our concern and our determination to protect our republic from an arrogant , out - of - control , imperial presidency and a compliant , namby - pamby Congress ( both of which are unduly influenced by the oil companies and other big- money interests ) .
We know that you ( like us ) would n't have pursued a military career unless you were idealistic and devoted to our nation and its people .
( None of us do it for the pay and working conditions ! )
But we also recognize that you may not see how you can influence these events .
We in the military have always had a historic subservience to civilian authority .
Perhaps I can help with whatever wisdom I 've gathered from age ( I retired in 1978 , so I am ancient indeed ) .
Our oath of office is to " protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies , foreign and domestic . "
Might I suggest that this includes a rogue president and vice - president ?
Certainly we are bound to carry out the legal orders of our superiors .
But the Uniform Code of Military Justice ( UCMJ ) which binds all of us enshrines the Nuremberg Principles which this country established after World War II ( which you are too young to remember ) .
One of those Nuremberg Principles says that we in the military have not only the right , but also the DUTY to refuse an illegal order .
It was on this basis that we executed Nazi officers who were " only carrying out their orders . "
The Constitution which we are sworn to uphold says that treaties entered into by the United States are the " highest law of the land , " equivalent to the Constitution itself .
Accordingly , we in the military are sworn to uphold treaty law , including the United Nations charter and the Geneva Convention .
Based on the above , I contend that should some civilian order you to initiate a nuclear attack on Iran ( for example ) , you are duty - bound to refuse that order .
I might also suggest that you should consider whether the circumstances demand that you arrest whoever gave the order as a war criminal .
I know for a fact that in recent history ( once under Nixon and once under Reagan ) , the military nuclear chain of command in the White House discussed these things and were prepared to refuse an order to " nuke Russia . "
In effect they took the ( non-existent ) " button " out of the hands of the President ..
We were thus never quite as close to World War III as many feared , no matter how irrational any president might have become .
They determined that the proper response to any such order was , " Why , sir ? "
Unless there was ( in their words ) a " damn good answer , " nothing was going to happen .
I suggest that if you in this generation have not had such a discussion , perhaps it is time you do .
In hindsight , it 's too bad such a discussion did not take place prior to the preemptive " shock and awe " attack on Baghdad .
Many of us at the time spoke out vehemently that such an attack would be an impeachable offense , a war crime against the people of Iraq , and treason against the United States of America .
But our voices were drowned out and never reached the ears of the generals in 2003 .
I now regret that I never sent a letter such as this at that time , but depended on the corporate media to carry my message .
I must not make that mistake again .
Also in hindsight , President Bush could be court - martialed for abuse of power as Commander - in - Chief .
Vice President Cheney could probably be court - martialed for his performance as Acting Commander - in - Chief in the White House bunker the morning of September 11 , 2001 .
We in the U.S. military would never consider a military coup , removing an elected president and installing one of our own .
But following our oath of office , obeying the Nuremberg Principles , and preventing a rogue president from committing a war crime is not a military coup .
If it requires the detention of executive branch officials , we will not impose a military dictatorship .
We will let the Constitutional succession take place .
This is what we are sworn to .
This is protecting the Constitution , our highest obligation .
In 2007 , this is what is meant by " Duty , Honor , Country . "
Thank you all for your service to this nation .
May God bless America , and sustain us in this difficult time .
And thanks for listening to the musings of an old junior officer .
Respectfully , Robert M. Bowman , PhD , Lt. Col. , USAF , ret .

MySpace is significantly growing their inside ad sales department , according to reports coming from Mediaweek .
We 'd like to say that we trust all the information we 're relaying to you from their piece today is 100 % reliable , but they report MySpace 's total yearly revenue somewhere around $ 17 million , which is around half of what MySpace is reported to make in a month .
None the less , the story boasts high profile sources , like Michael Barrett , the chief revenue officer at Fox Interactive Media .
If the chief revenue officer does n't know how much the company makes , who would ?
According to Barrett , 40 % of the social network 's revenue comes from branded , CPM based advertising , up from less than 20 % 18 months ago .
What 's more , there are now 110 people on staff " dedicated to growing this revenue stream , " a 100 % increase in headcount for the entire company one year before .
Aside from questionable numbers , the impression Barrett gives off when he lists the various advertising projects the company is working on , is that they 're not taking a " one-size - fits - all " approach to advertising on MySpace any longer .
Gone are the days where there are simply banner and AdSense ads slapped on the site .
They 're looking to engage the user on all the fronts within the website 's media arsenal : targeted ads on videos ( in the form of news - crawl like tickers ) , profile meta - data targeted advertisements , and a " relevance engine " to make the determination between when it would and would not be appropriate to advertise on a specific online property ( even though keywords might match up ) .
It will be interesting to see how it develops .
MySpace 's first year under FIM stewardship seemed to be a wait - and - see probationary period .
Now that they 're certain that it can make money without significant upgrades , you 're going to see a leaner and more interesting MySpace emerge .
Is Facebook prepared to meet an actual engaged competitor ?
The next year will tell .

DIGG THIS
It looks like the term  thought police just might take on a whole new and real meaning .
This depends on what happens in the U.S. Senate after receiving House bill H.R. 1955 : Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 .
This act ( now S - 1959  Senate version ) is now being considered by Senate committees and , if passed by the Senate and signed by the president , will become law .
Common sense would indicate that something this vague and dangerous would not make it out of committee , but considering that the House passed it on October 23 with 404 ayes , 6 nays , and 22 present / not voting , I m not holding my breath .
The most disturbing aspects of this bill , and there are many , are the definitions noted in Section 899a .
The three offenses defined in this document that will warrant prosecution are :
 Violent Radicalization :
The term violent radicalization means the process of adopting or promoting an extremist belief system for the purpose of facilitating ideologically based violence to advance political , religious , or social change . 
 Homegrown Terrorism :
The term homegrown terrorism means the use , planned use , or threatened use , of force or violence by a group or individual born , raised , or operating primarily within the United States or any possession of the United States government , the civilian population of the United States , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives . 
 Ideologically based violence :
The term ideologically based violence means the use , planned use , or threatened use of force or violence by a group or individual to promote the group or individuals political , religious , or social beliefs . 
Besides the fact that this Act would greatly expand an already monstrous bureaucracy ( Homeland Security Act of 2002 ) , it is on its very face a threat to all ideological thinking not approved by the state .
Any citizen at any given time could be considered a terrorism suspect and accused or prosecuted for bad thoughts .
Since the very act of thinking could now be considered a crime , how would the populace react to this new paradigm ?
Would political debate among the citizenry become more subdued ?
Would watch groups , whether police or private , arise to monitor individual and group conversations ?
Would speaking out and writing against the government become a dangerous activity ?
The language contained in this proposed legislation is not only vague , it is also broad , sweeping , and unclear .
The tenebrous and obscure nature of the above definitions is obviously not an accident .
The broader the net , the more who are caught ; the more who are caught , the more who live in fear of being caught .
Ambiguity and fear are mighty deterrents , and ambiguity and fear foster obedience .
In this case , unconditional obedience to the mighty state and its many dictates .
In the definition of violent radicalization ,  it is a crime to adopt or promote an extremist belief system to facilitate ideologically based violence .
Neither extremist nor type of political , religious , or social change is defined .
And what about ideologically  based violence ?
Is it violence to simply advocate radical change that might lead someone else to initiate violence ?
Who decides what beliefs are okay and what beliefs are not ?
The state , of course , is the final decider .
The door is left open for interpretation , but for interpretation by government only .
 Homegrown terrorism ,  although similarly defined , is notable in that it concentrates strictly on U.S. - born , U.S. - raised , or U.S. - based individuals and groups operating primarily within the United States or any possession of the United States .
The Bush administration has had its problems in the courts at times concerning American citizens and their rights , sometimes setting it and its agenda back .
This bill could help alleviate those problems .
In addition , to intimidate or coerce the U.S. government , the civilian population , or any segment thereof , in furtherance of political or social objectives , is forbidden and considered criminal .
Let me repeat ; to intimidate the government to further political or social objectives is forbidden .
If this is allowed to stand , what does it do to demonstration , protest , petition , and the right to assemble ?
Remember , this proposed act is attached to the Homeland Security Act of 2002 .
This is what gives it the teeth so that the enforcers can pursue and detain those considered guilty of holding or promoting an extremist belief system or wishing to advance political , religious , or social change .
I use the word enforcers  because this bill allows for the federal authorities , including intelligence and law enforcement , to use any state or local law - enforcement agencies .
In addition , the commission may contract to enable enforcement .
Also ,
 The Commission may request directly from any executive department , bureau , agency , board , commission , office , independent establishment , or instrumentality of the Government , information , suggestions , estimates , and statistics for the purposes of this Section . ( Section 899C . )
What little privacy still exists will not exist for long with the passage of this bill .
One of the tenets of any totalitarian society is that the citizenry must acquiesce to government control .
The state itself is supreme and sovereign , not the people .
This has been true throughout history whether it was during Hitlers , Stalins , Maos or any other of a number of brutal dictatorial rulers reigns .
Dissent was stifled , whether it was ideological or physical , and accused parties faced humiliation , incarceration , or death for their unwillingness to conform .
Is that where were headed ?
The newest weapon we have at our disposal in our fight against tyranny is our advanced communication systems , especially the Internet .
Reaching untold numbers of persons , something not possible only a few years ago , is now possible because of the Internet .
With the mainstream media kowtowing to politicians and government , the Internet has become the major tool for those promoting liberty and truth .
It has allowed many brilliant freedom lovers to reach and change minds .
Even this has not escaped the watchful eye of Big Brother in this bill .
In Section 899B Congress finds the following :
 The internet has aided in facilitating violent radicalization , ideologically based violence , and the homegrown terrorism process in the United States by providing access to broad and constant streams of terrorist - related propaganda to United States citizens . 
This bill , if passed into law , will do nothing less than muffle , if not destroy , our ability to speak out against government .
Considering the combination of the USA PATRIOT Act , The Homeland Security Act , the Military Commissions Act , and the now - enhanced executive power , adding this single piece of legislation fills the only loophole left .
With the passage of this abominable act , all U.S. citizens are at risk , not just those few radical persons and foreigners spoken about by government , but all of us .
This very article could be considered as ideologically based violence , subjecting me to punishment by government .
This could be the final piece of the puzzle .
This new proposed legislation will help an already tyrannical government in its effort to become supreme .
February 2 , 2008
The Best of Gary D. Barnett
WASHINGTON  Senior officials of the Federal Bureau of Investigation repeatedly approved the use of “ blanket ” records demands to justify the improper collection of thousands of phone records , according to officials briefed on the practice .
The bureau appears to have used the blanket records demands at least 11 times in 2006 alone as a quick way to clean up mistakes made over several years after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , according to a letter provided to Congress by a lawyer for an F.B.I. agent who witnessed the missteps .
The F.B.I. has come under fire for its use of so - called national security letters to inappropriately gather records on Americans in terrorism investigations , but details have not previously been disclosed about its use of “ blanket ” warrants , a one - step operation used to justify the collection of hundreds of phone and e-mail records at a time .
Under the USA Patriot Act , the F.B.I. received broadened authority to issue the national security letters on its own authority  without the approval of a judge  to gather records like phone bills or e-mail transactions that might be considered relevant to a particular terrorism investigation .
The Justice Department inspector general found in March 2007 that the F.B.I. had routinely violated the standards for using the letters and that officials often cited “ exigent ” or emergency situations that did not really exist in issuing them to phone providers and other private companies .
Rewards and Praise : The Poisoned Carrot
We give our children ice - cream if they 're " good " , chocolate if they 're quiet , little gold stars if they eat their greens , maybe even money if they get good marks at school .
We praise them with a " good boy ! " or " good girl ! " if they do something that pleases us .
For the modern and discerning parent , the hitting - and - shaming method of " discipline " is passé .
Punishment is out , and rewards are in .
Why use the stick , when we can better teach a child by using a carrot ?
In the long term , reward
systems are ineffective .
The New Age hype about praising and rewarding children for what we call " good " behavior has gained massive popularity .
" Find something good your child has done , and praise them for it ! " say the nouveau " how - to " books and seminars .
Psychologists all over recommend the " star - chart " treatment to modify your child 's behavior .
This trend is the offspring of a particular school of psychology - the " behaviorists " - whose thinking currently dominates much of mainstream psychological and educational theory .
In fact , these days praising or rewarding your kids ' " good " behavior is so customary that almost nobody - until recently - has thought to question its validity .
Praising or rewarding kids is just plain common sense , and good parenting - is n't it ?
Who would doubt that it 's good to give children praise , or prizes when they perform to our liking ?
The praise - and - reward method is definitely hunky - dory , since it is backed by a ton of evidence from the most methodical and ingenious research that money can buy .
Actually , it springs from the work of psychologists who painstakingly discovered that they could train rats to run mazes , pigeons to peck at colored buttons , and dogs to salivate at the sound of the dinner bell - by giving them a controlled schedule of rewards .
Psychologists soon became titillated about the idea of controlling human beings , by applying to us the same principles that worked on animals .
Imagine their excitement when they realized that rewards work exactly the same on humans as on rats , pigeons and dogs .
Modern psychological know - how has enabled us to manipulate children 's behavior , thoughts and emotions in the same way as we can teach a seal , with a few sardines and a little flattery , to balance a ball on its nose .
One problem , though .
We do n't particularly care about the quality of relationship we develop with a lab - rat .
We are not concerned with rodents ' developing self - esteem , their sense of autonomy or independence , nor do we give a hoot whether the rat will get interested in trying bigger and better mazes of it's own accord , long after we stop rewarding it with little food pellets .
And that , as most of our experts have failed to tell us , is where the whole fancy technology of " reward , praise and reinforce " falls to pieces .
Over and over we have been taught that we should praise and reward our children a lot more .
What could be wrong with that ?
On the surface , praise looks marvelous - the key to successful children !
Scratch this surface , however , and the results look very different .
But , rewards improve children 's behavior and performance , do n't they ?
Or so we thought .
However , when the little gold stars or jelly - beans stop coming , the behavior we were trying to reinforce tends to peter out .
Children that have grown used to expecting praise , can feel crushed when it does n't come .
This dampens their perseverance .
There is plenty of evidence that in the long term , reward systems are ineffective .
Contrary to popular myth , there are many studies showing that when children expect or anticipate rewards , they perform more poorly .
One study found that students ' performance was undermined when offered money for better marks .
A number of American and Israeli studies show that reward systems suppress students ' creativity , and generally impoverish the quality of their work .
Rewards can kill creativity , because they discourage risk - taking .
When children are hooked on getting a reward , they tend to avoid challenges , to " play it safe " .
They prefer to do the minimum required to get that prize .
The use of praise or
rewards does not make
children feel supported .
It makes them feel
evaluated and judged .
Here is a good illustration of why we made the mistake of believing in rewards , based on benefits that appear on the surface .
When an American fast - food company offered food prizes to children for every book they read , reading rates soared .
This certainly looked encouraging - at first glance .
On closer inspection , however , it was demonstrated that the children were selecting shorter books , and that their comprehension test - scores plummeted .
They were reading for junk - food , rather than for the intrinsic enjoyment of reading .
Meanwhile , reading outside school ( the unrewarded situation ) dropped off .
There are many more studies showing that , while rewards may well increase activity , they smother enthusiasm and kill passion .
Individuals anticipating rewards lose interest in activities that were otherwise attractive .
It seems that the more we want the reward , the more we come to dislike what we have to do to get it .
The activity required of us stands in the way of our coveted prize .
It would have been smarter to just give the kids more interesting books , as there is plenty of evidence that intrinsically enjoyable activity is the best motivator and performance enhancer .
Can rewards and praise harm our relationship with our children ?
You would n't think that the positive things you say to your child about himself or herself can be as destructive as negative labels .
But there are times when this is true .
Thanks to modern advances in behavioral science , our ability to seduce or manipulate children ( and animals ! and grown - ups ! ) to do what we want them to has become increasingly sophisticated .
But the cost of manipulating through rewards has been great .
Below are ten ways in which praise and rewards can damage our relationship with our children .
Rewards and praise condition children to seek approval ; they end up doing things to impress , instead of doing things for themselves .
This can hold back the development of self - motivation and makes them dependent on outside opinion .
When children get used to getting goodies for " performing " , they become pleasers , over - reliant on positive strokes .
Rewards and praise can create a kind of addictive behavior : children can get addicted to recognition , and thus lose touch with the simple joy of doing what they love .
So many of us are addicted to prestige : we get depressed when admiration fails to come .
Instead of doing what we do for its own sake , we fish for flattery or reassurance , and when the applause dies away , we sink into despair .
Giving rewards or praise can be habit - forming .
This is because the more rewards we use , the more we have to use them to keep children motivated .
Praise cannot create a personal commitment to " good " behavior or performance .
It only creates a commitment to seeking praise .
One of the worst things we can do is to praise a child 's potential .
Acclamations like " I just know you can do it " , " You 're getting better ! " , " I know you 've got it in you ! " , " You 'll get there ! " sound supportive on the surface .
But these compliments are loaded with our expectation that the child must improve in some way .
It tells the child there is a target to keep reaching for in order to get the full " bravo ! " .
Praising children 's potential does not help them to like themselves for who they already are , and can make them feel disappointed with themselves .
Underneath the praise is the silent implication : " you 're not good enough yet " .
This seduces children to work harder to impress us , at the expense of their own self - esteem .
As psychologist Louise Porter says : " If you want children to develop a healthy self - esteem , stop praising them " ( see reading list below ) .
Rewarding children 's compliance is the flip - side of punishing their disobedience .
It is seduction in the place of tyranny .
Many studies show that parents who use more rewards also use more punishment , they are more likely to be autocratic .
Praise is the sweet side of authoritarian parenting .
It reduces the relationship to one of controller and controlled .
That is why the more astute - or less gullible !
- children feel something " icky " in praise ; it makes them feel condescended to .
Praise is a reminder that the praiser has power over them .
It diminishes the child 's sense of autonomy , and , like a little pat on the head , it keeps them small .
Meanwhile , the rewarder is like an assessor , judging what merits praise and what does n't .
This makes them somewhat scary to the child .
The use of praise or rewards does not make children feel supported .
It makes them feel evaluated and judged .
Though " Good boy ! " or " Good girl ! " is a positive judgment , it is still a judgment from on high , and ultimately it alienates the child .
The more insightful children can see right through manipulation .
They are onto us , they think our praise is calculating , and they are not easily outwitted by seductive tactics .
In particular , when praise is a technique we have learned from a book or a seminar , it is likely to come across as false and contrived .
Praise and rewards , like flattery , can stink of our efforts to control , and lose our child 's respect .
Children , just like adults , naturally recoil from being controlled .
We all want to grow toward self - determination .
Praise can therefore create resistance , since it impinges on a child 's developing sense of autonomy .
Rewards punish , because the child is denied the reward , praise or approval unless he or she " comes up with the goods " .
Moreover , the child who is used to being praised begins to feel inadequate if the praise does n't come .
Nothing feels more defeating to a child than to miss out on a reward that he or she had been conditioned to expect .
Inside every carrot , there is a stick .
When children are bribed with rewards for " good " behavior , they soon learn how to manipulate us by acting the part that is expected of them .
They wise up to what it takes to get the goodies from us : the approval , the ice - cream , whatever .
They become superficially compliant , doing whatever it takes to flatter or impress us , and honesty suffers .
After all , who wants to be honest or real with a person who is evaluating them ?
Once relating is reduced to mutual manipulation rather than authenticity , this sets the stage for manipulative and dishonest relationships later in life .
Manipulation erodes the functions of mutual trust , vulnerability and transparency , which are vital to healthy intimate relationships .
As a result of early manipulation , we grow up trying hard to please , or we learn to use our wiles to impress , in order to get the goodies - at the expense of being our natural selves .
We develop a phony or false self that distorts our relationships with others .
Among siblings , or in the classroom , reward systems create competition , jealousy , envy , and mistrust .
Rewards or prizes for " good " performance are a threat to co-operation or collaboration .
Praise can make children feel robbed .
If we are hungry for admiration ourselves , we can sometimes err by deriving it through our children 's triumphs .
We use them to make up for our own wounded self - esteem or pride .
If we are praising them because they have made us feel good about ourselves , they sense this .
This takes away from their good feelings about themselves ; our praise can act as rain on their picnic .
Some children refuse to produce what they are naturally good at , because they are repulsed by their parents ' gloating .
Appreciation is different
from praise because
it is not manipulative .
Why are praising and rewarding so popular ?
Rewards are an easy way out , easier than trying to understand why a child is , as many like to glibly call it , " misbehaving " .
For example , why bother to find out why a child refuses to go to sleep at our convenience , ( is he afraid ? is she feeling lonely ?
is he still hungry ?
etc. ) if we can simply reward him or her with a trinket for going to bed on time ?
It feels easier to fudge over the underlying problem by using a bribe .
This gives the child the clear message that we are not interested in how he or she feels .
Worse still , we risk overlooking a serious emotional problem .
Rewards and praise can be a gimmicky quick - fix that ignores the child as a whole person .
Rewards work well for getting children to do something that they do n't naturally want to do , for the short - term only .
This immediate behavior change rewards us , and keeps us addicted to rewarding .
The negative consequences of rewards and praise do n't materialize until later , so we fail to recognize rewards and praise as the culprit .
But children do need acknowledgment , and positive feedback .
What can we do instead of praise them ?
Often we want to express our delight and appreciation for our children ; who they are as individuals , and the amazing things they do .
Appreciation is different from praise because it is not manipulative .
Manipulative praise , as opposed to spontaneous expressions of appreciation or acknowledgment , is loaded with the covert expectation that the child do the praiseworthy act again .
Most children can sense this ; they can feel the difference between genuine acknowledgment , and a deliberate strategy to reinforce their behavior .
So , how do we give our children positive feedback ?
Avoiding praise or rewards does not mean holding back the love and delight we feel for our children , nor our instinctual desire to encourage them - far from it !
It is perfectly possible to join in with our children and celebrate every step of their unfolding , without being manipulative .
Here 's a few suggestions for how to acknowledge and encourage your children to your heart 's content - and theirs - while avoiding the use of praise .
Focus the child on his / her own pleasure at achieving .
Instead of lavishing children with congratulations , it 's better if they focus internally on the pleasure they derive from accomplishment .
Children are naturally thirsty to achieve , learn and conquer .
They are born with an insatiable zest for mastery , and each new attainment fills them with delight .
It is this self - enjoyment which provides the greatest fuel for perseverance and further learning .
When you see your child do something new , it can be wonderfully encouraging and supportive to say : " you look like you enjoyed that ! " , or : how did it feel to do that ? " .
" I 'm glad you did that , you look happy with yourself ! " .
Help him / her to self - evaluate .
Whenever possible , it is a good idea to ask your child about their own self - evaluation .
For instance : " how do you like your drawing ? " , " are you happy with how that piece fits into the puzzle ? " .
Ask them about their inner experiences .
Say , for instance , your child reads you a story he just composed .
After sharing how the story made you feel , you could ask : " How do you feel about the story you wrote ? " , " How did it feel to write it ? " , " Did you enjoy telling it ? " , " How did you come up with those ideas for your story ? " .
There are few things so nourishing to your child 's self - esteem , and so enriching to your relationship with him , than your interest in his inner world of feeling and imagination .
Use " I " statements , instead of labeling the child .
Your appreciation touches your child more deeply when it is expressed in terms of your feelings .
For instance : " I like the colors you chose ! " , or " I love how you sang that song ! " - instead of : " what a good drawer you are ! " , or " gee you 're a good singer " .
Avoid labeling statements like : " Good boy for sharing your toys ! " .
Say instead : " thanks for sharing with your friend , that felt good to him - and to me " .
Focus on your feelings , not on a moral or quality - oriented label .
An " I " statement keeps you from holding a position of power over your child .
It creates an honest and fulfilling connection between you while not interfering with their experience of themselves .
Comment on the behavior , not on the person .
Feedback and acknowledgment are definitely important .
Imagine your child has just played you a new piece she has learned on the piano .
Instead of saying : " What a good player you are ! " , you could tell her how much you enjoyed the piece .
Better still , be specific .
Tell her what in particular you liked about her playing ( e.g. the passion or emotion , the beautiful melody , how carefully she played , her sense of rhythm , etc . )
How do we know when our positive comments are manipulative ?
Ultimately , the problem is not about the perfect choice of words , or how much or when to make positive comments .
When you do the right thing for the wrong reasons , it ends up being the wrong thing .
Since the problem is one of intent , there is no other way but to become good examiners of our own motives .
This takes practice , and the courage and humility to look within .
When giving a positive comment , are you trying to seduce the child into pleasing you again , into making Mama or Papa proud ?
Or are you genuinely glad to see the child accomplish something that pleases him , or genuinely delighting in her being ?
Therein lies a paradox : that which is not intended to reinforce , but merely to " connect " , is the most reinforcing .
Is praise ever OK ?
There is no need to muzzle ourselves , praise is wonderful when it is not used manipulatively .
For instance , rewards should not be promised in advance , nor guaranteed every time the child does something you like .
Positive feedback is best for your relationship with your child when it is offered spontaneously , when it springs from your heart , and not as a deliberate ploy to get more of what you want from the child .
Conclusion
Praising and rewarding are deeply ingrained habits , particularly as that 's how most of us were raised and educated .
It may take practice to replace them with appreciation and acknowledgment , but the latter feels more fulfilling , and can bring you and your child closer .
Children can certainly be made to do what they do n't want or love , by offering them approval , praise or other rewards .
But this does not make them happy .
Happiness can only be derived from doing what is intrinsically rewarding to us , and this does not require others ' applause .
Do we want kids to become reward - addicts , crowd - pleasers , and recognition - seekers , or do we want them to be self - motivated , faithful to themselves , following their own interests ?
If the latter is true , then the way is not to praise them but to appreciate them .
At school , when the work is made intrinsically interesting , enjoyable , meaningful and relevant , this works better than reward systems to improve both the quality and the commitment to the work .
Children are born with an enormous desire to learn .
They also have an innate capacity for honesty , empathy and considerateness .
These qualities come forward as a result of our guidance , our role - modeling , and our appreciation .
Rewards and praise for " good behavior " or " good performance " simply get in the way .

I understand that by submitting my information , I may be contacted by telephone by one lender .
In most cases , you can apply for a cash advance by using the website of the service , however , in some cases , you may also have the option of using a smartphone app in order to track the amount of money that you ’ve received and the deadline for returning it .
Overall , an online cash advance is easy to access and it comes with fewer restrictions than a small loan given out by a bank .
The companies that offer these services usually work throughout the US , so you can get a bit of extra cash regardless of where you are .
What is an online cash advance ?
An online cash advance is more commonly known as a “ payday advance ” .
Most people know it as a way to get extra money when you need it , by using a credit card or various types of lines of credit .
Most banks allow their clients to use their existing cards in order to get a payday advance using any ATM machine in the area , however , this type of loan tends to come with dangerous financial disadvantages .
One of the main issues that most people are having with payday advances offered by banks is the fact that the costs for these transactions are not always clear and the consequences for missing a payment by a few hours or days can increase the debt by a lot .
This having been said , getting a cash advance online is a safer choice due to the fact that the money is not offered by banks , but by companies that are specially designed for this type of transaction .
Furthermore , the companies are obligated by law to inform you of all the taxes that you will have to pay , prior to agreeing to the terms and conditions of the transaction , so you always know what you are paying for .
Generally speaking , an online cash advance is a short - term loan that is quickly approved and funded after applying for it .
The amount of money that you can borrow is restricted by certain limits that are set by each service , but most will allow you to get up to $ 250 .
It is also important to mention the fact that the entire transaction is handled through the internet .
While you can transfer the money to your bank account , most services will lend you the money online , allowing you to choose what bank to use afterward .
This also means that your credit score will not be affected by this transaction .
In most cases , the money will be shown as a regular transfer on your bank statement , so it will not be marked on your permanent financial records as being a loan .
What can you do with an online cash advance ?
One of the best things about getting an online cash advance is the fact that you have almost no restrictions regarding what you can do with the money .
The money is sent to you through the internet , allowing you to then transfer it to what account you want , or to most online payment services such as PayPal .
Some services will ask you to mention what you need the money for , however , this is usually for marketing or research purposes and will not affect your eligibility or have any consequences on how quickly you get the advance .
You can borrow the money and get your smartphone repaired , pay a utility bill , or even use it in order to go out .
The company providing the advance does not impose any restrictions on what you can do with the cash once you get it .
What do you need in order to apply for an online cash advance ?
Unlike payday advances that you get from a bank , the services that allow you to apply for an online loan for bad credit require a lot less financial and personal information .
Most companies will ask you to fill out a form with the following things , before giving you a cash advance online :
Full name ;
Social security number ;
Proof of stable income ;
Standing debt information ;
Banking information ( only the account number , in most cases ) ;
Email and home address ;
Workplace ;
Phone number ;
Please keep in mind that most services will only give you the cash advance if you have a stable source of income .
Furthermore , you may be required to have a bank account opened at the bank of your choice , solely for the purpose of transferring the money that you borrowed .
The list of required information does not usually require that you input your credit score or any type of credit information because companies that offer online cash advances do not check for it .
This makes these transactions extremely useful if you do not have a great credit score and might not be able to get a payday advance from your local bank .
How to choose the best service for a cash advance ?
There are several services and companies that allow you to apply for an online cash advance , and most of them operate in the same way .
This having been said , you should still look at several services before choosing one to use .
Some companies place larger limits on the amount of money that you can borrow , while others may have smaller fees if you pay the money back in a shorter amount of time .
Generally speaking , you should first look at the most popular online money lending services and figure out which ones suits you best .
Next , open the app store on your smartphone and look for an app that is associated with that particular service .
Most companies also offer smartphone apps that will guide you through the whole process and allow you to submit your request faster .
They will also display all the information that you need to know regarding the advance that you have received , from the amount of money that you have borrowed , to the day when you must pay it back .
The apps will even allow you to set reminders so that you never miss a payment .
Who can get a cash advance online ?
The fact that most companies that allow you to borrow money online do not check your credit score means that almost anyone is eligible to get an advance .
This having been said , you may be required to have a regular source of income , in order to ensure that you will be able to pay the money back .
In other words , anyone who is over the age of 18 and has a job will be able to get a payday advance .
This having been said , some restrictions may apply regarding what services you can use in certain states .
Some companies do not offer their services throughout the US , while others have different terms and conditions for each state .
There are also areas where local laws limit the amount of money that the companies can lend you or the time that you have in order to pay it back .
Regardless of the situation , you will be able to read all the relevant information on the smartphone app or the website of the company .
Why Use Us ?
How much do you offer ?

Conclusion
Getting a cash advance online is one of the most accessible alternatives to the regular payday advances offered by banks .
The transfers are handled entirely online and most companies will not be interested in what kind of credit score you ’ve got .
If you ’re short on cash and need a couple of hundred dollars in order to pay for a utility or medical bill , then borrowing a small amount of money using an online service may be the fastest way to fix the issue .
Most applications are approved in under 24 hours and the transfer is done immediately after that .
While online cash advances do have upper limits in terms of how much money you can borrow , the fact that anyone can do it can save you a world of trouble .

Scores of British passengers on board a Sydney - bound jumbo jet had a lucky escape after the aircraft lost all electrical power as it was approaching Bangkok airport .
In an unprecedented drama , the Qantas Boeing 747 lost vital supplies from all four of its main generators , disabling the navigation and communication system .
And if the aircraft had been any further from an airstrip when the emergency back - up batteries expired , the captain could have been faced with such drastic action as having to ditch into the sea .
Scroll down for more ...
None of the passengers on board QF2 from London to Sydney were aware of the serious predicament which occurred when the jet was just 15 minutes from landing at Bangkok – with only about 30 minutes of reserve batteries remaining to provide the vital power .
" All we were told was that there was a slight power failure after the lights had flickered off and on , " said 25 - year - old Chloe Washbrook , who was travelling with her friend Katherine Radding - both from London - on arrival in Sydney yesterday .
" When we got off at Bangkok , we were told there might be a slight delay but then we were told we would have to be put up for the night .
" Even the new crew in Thailand did n't know what had happened to cause the delay – they were asking us what had happened on the flight into Bangkok . "
Aerospace experts in Australia said today that the pilot was lucky that the failure - caused by water leaking from a galley into the plane 's generator control unit - had happened when the plane was close to landing .
Qantas has never had a crash and prides itself on its safe reputation .
Julian Walsh , deputy director of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau , which is investigating the incident , said it was fortunate the fault had occurred when the jet , with 344 passengers , was only 15 minutes from Bangkok airport .
" If the aircraft was a long way from a suitable landing area , then obviously it could have resulted in the aircraft having to ditch into the ocean or do an emergency landing on to land , " he said .
Colin Adams , president of the Australian International Pilots Association , said it was also lucky the aircraft landed in daylight and in good weather .
" At night or a long way from an airport , it would have been a far more serious incident because you would have lost a lot of aircraft lighting and also a lot of your instrumentation . "
The seriousness of the power failure alarmed Dr Arvind Sinha , director of Aerospace at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology , who said the jet had " gone to the last stage of emergency power for communication and navigation " .
Pointing out that the failure of all four generators on a Boeing 747 was " unheard of " , Dr Sinha said that once the emergency battery power had been used it would have been " down to the skill and experience of the crew " .
He added : " The engines have their own independent power source and the steering is operated by a hydraulic pump system , but the critical issues are the navigation and communication systems that you need to find your way to a runway to land . "
Qantas said last night that after being subjected to stringent inspections and testing in Bangkok , the jet was cleared to fly .
The airline 's entire fleet of B747-400s had also been inspected and no problems found , but the Boeing aircraft company would be informed of the incident .
There are rumblings in the GOP that , if they get much louder , threaten to split the Republican Party over the war issue  and I do n’t think anything could be much louder ( in a good way ) than Victor Gold ‘s colorful dissent from the pro-war neocon orthodoxy .
As deputy press secretary to Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential campaign , Spiro Agnew ’s press secretary in the early ’ 70s , and a senior adviser to Bush père in the ’ 80s , Gold is a self - described " Goldwater conservative " whose new book , Invasion of the Party Snatchers : How the Holy Rollers and the Neocons Destroyed the GOP , is a shot across the bow at the Coulterized , Kristolized " conservative " movement .
As Gold puts it ,
" So it is that six years into the country ’s first neocon administration , what Americans have learned about Irving Kristol ’s ‘ new kind of conservative politics ’ is that it ’s merely a recycled model of the old liberal politics that led to the decline and fall of the Democratic Party in the 1960s : a fiscally irresponsible , ever - expanding federal government presided over by an imperial executive imbued with a messianic view of America ’s right to ‘ democratize ’ the heathen ; or , as Irving ’s neocon son William , editor of the Weekly Standard , prefers , our moral duty to ‘ actively pursue ’ policies leading to Woodrow Wilson ’s dream of a ‘ benevolent global hegemony . ’
" Translated from the neocon : Today we own Washington , tomorrow the world . "
Gold ’s thesis is that the party of George W. Bush has become just as corrupt and delusional as the party of Lyndon Baines Johnson  in good part because the Scoop Jackson Democrats who brain - trusted and defended the Vietnam War have long since migrated to the GOP , where they ’ve taken over and replicated their old policies of big government at home and big trouble abroad .
Gold ’s protest is powerful and delightfully iconoclastic , as he takes on the neocons , punctures the pompous Newt Gingrich , and goes after Dick Cheney hammer - and - tongs .
Written in a punchy , polemical style , part memoir and part jeremiad , his book is a great read .
What ’s significant is that his is n’t a lone voice crying out in the wilderness , but just the latest and most eloquent evidence that there ’s a major rebellion against the War Party brewing on the Right .
The realization that the neocons are doing to the Republican Party what they ’re doing to the U.S. military  driving it into the ground  is now widespread in GOP circles .
In an appearance on Fox News this past Sunday , House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio stated , “ By the time we get to September or October , members are going to want to know how well this is working , and if it is n’t , what ’s Plan B. ” Trent Lott agrees .
Rep. James Walsh , an upstate New York Republican facing pressure from his constituents to disavow the president ’s position on the war , issued an open letter in which he stated that , if the " surge " is n’t successful by autumn , " we should be prepared to begin withdrawing our soldiers . "
Republicans facing problematic reelection prospects , such as Minnesota ’s Norm Coleman , are giving the " surge " and the " Petraeus is our savior " strategy a second look : " There is a sense and a reality that there is a lot we have to see by September , " says Sen.
Coleman , and it does n’t take special powers to hear the anxious undertone .
Rep . Ron Paul , who has always opposed the Iraq war , stands out in the crowd of Republican aspirants to the Oval Office , a giant among the GOP ’s wannabe - presidential pygmies  and his campaign has more support than the " mainstream " media seems willing to acknowledge .
ABC
News had to cave after excluding Paul from their presidential poll , which the libertarian Republican promptly won .
John McLaughlin and Pat Buchanan have both practically endorsed him .
In spite of an effort to minimize his potential impact by likening the calm and credible Paul to the more animated Mike Gravel , the Texas Republican could become the Eugene McCarthy of the anti-interventionist Right , if the online excitement generated among young , libertarian - oriented voters is any indication of his growing appeal .
And , of course , there is Sen.
Chuck Hagel , the Nebraska Republican , playing Hamlet in the wings , threatening not so subtly to launch a third - party run in ’08 .
Hagel ’s dramatic dissent from Republican orthodoxy on the war has enraged the neocons , especially Dick Cheney , their patron and protector .
If he decides to make an independent run , it could signal a lasting split in the GOP , uniting the Perot voters and the burgeoning antiwar constituency under a single banner and auguring the breakdown of the two - party system .
The great problem involved in stopping this war has been the unresponsiveness of the political system : in spite of growing popular disenchantment with our disastrous foreign policy of unrelenting aggression , the politicians of both parties have been slow to react .
Since Democrats as well as Republicans were ( and are ) complicit in the launching and waging of this war , their leaders have been reluctant to backtrack .
They ’ve been forced by circumstances to do so , but not without kicking and resisting every inch of the way .
The pressure on them has just been too great to be ignored , and the Democratic turnaround on this issue is now being followed by the most promising development so far : the cracking of the conservative consensus on the war  which spells doom for the War Party and their hopes of spreading the conflict beyond its present boundaries .
This anti-interventionist movement has been building on the Right for quite some time , ever since Pat Buchanan bucked his fellow conservatives and came out against the first Gulf War .
Buchanan ’s book A Republic , Not an Empire and the magazine he co-founded with Taki Theodoracopulos , The American Conservative , have been enormously influential  and , I might add , so have various writings posted on this Web site , including in this space .
Antiwar.com has always made a conscious effort to present conservative critiques of the Bushian foreign policy precisely because of the strategic importance of splitting the War Party ’s Republican base .
We have always argued that the ostensibly " conservative " principles of the GOP  limited government , fiscal responsibility , and a realistic recognition of the limits of power  are ill served by a foreign policy that aims at exporting our system all over the globe at gunpoint .
The Democrats ca n’t and wo n’t end this war all on their own , and Republican dissent on this issue could n’t have come at a more propitious time .
The main danger is that the Democrats will insist on framing the war as a partisan issue , making it impossible for any Republican to bloc with them on the question of war funding .
The pork - laden supplementary military appropriations bill pushed by the Democratic leadership is a textbook example of how not to end the war .
Now that the much - vaunted timelines for " redeployment " have been stripped from the legislation , all that ’s left is money for the war  and the pork .
The Republican Party faces a choice : it can continue down its present path and follow the Leader and the neocons over a cliff , or it can change course and return to its historic roots as the party of limited government at home and limited ambition on the international front .
To the neocons , the Republican Party was just a means to an end , not a cause unto itself : it was their vehicle to power , and once they had arrived , its fate was irrelevant to their central concerns .
A parasite , after all , cares nothing for its host .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
My piece on the AIPAC espionage trial in the May 7 issue of The American Conservative is now online .
Oh , and this is pretty funny .
I especially like the linkage between Garet Garrett ’s Rise of Empire and George Lucas ’ The Empire Strikes Back .
The Washington Post 's Peter Baker and Anne Kornblut have written the most comprehensive insider account I 've seen of the internal sparring inside the Clinton campaign .
Unlike most articles of its kind , it does not blame one side or the other , and it manages to evince some sympathy for chief strategist Mark Penn .
Big takeaways :
** No one inside the campaign likes Mr. Penn .
He does not seem to care .
** Clinton White House aide Bruce Reed was responsible for the " Change you can Xerox " line .
** There were plenty of Clinton aides ( Guy Cecil , Harold Ickes ) who warned against ceding the caucuses , but the Clintons themselves were too burned by Iowa

Kosovo Serbs rally on their side of the main bridge in Mitrovica
Enlarge Image
Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica also threatened to withdraw envoys from other countries which recognised the territory 's secession from Serbia .
Mr Kostunica said the envoy 's recall was Serbia 's " first urgent measure " .
France , the UK , Germany and Italy have all recognised the new state following its declaration of independence .
In New York , Serbian President Boris Tadic made an impassioned appeal to the UN Security Council to reject Kosovo 's declaration .
But the Council remained deadlocked over how to respond to Kosovo 's declaration of independence , although Russia and China supported President Tadic , and the UN body failed to agree on any action .
Serbia has a powerful ally in Russia , the BBC's Jane Little reports from the UN , but other permanent members of the council - including the US , Britain and France - insist independence is legal and the only viable way forward .
With a council so divided , it is unlikely any resolution could pass in favour of Serbia or Kosovo , our correspondent says .
The leading European states which endorsed independence did so after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels in which it was agreed that Kosovo should not set a precedent for other states .
Spain and several other member states have withheld recognition because of concerns about separatist movements within their own borders .
' Non-existent state '
Serbian media report that Belgrade 's ambassadors to all states which recognise Kosovo 's independence are being ordered home .
KOSOVO PROFILE
Population about two million Majority ethnic Albanian ; 10 % Serb Under UN control since Nato drove out Serb forces in 1999 2,000 - strong EU staff to take over from UN after independence Nato to stay to provide security
Full text : Kosovo declaration
In pictures : Celebrations Anger mounts in Mitrovica
The Associated Press news agency quotes the foreign ministry as saying Serbia 's envoys to France and Turkey have been withdrawn for " consultation until further notice " .
President Tadic told the UN Security Council there were " dozens of various Kosovos in the world and all of them lie in wait for Kosovo 's act of secession to ... be established as an acceptable norm " .
" If you cast a blind eye to this illegal act , who guarantees to you that parts of your countries will not declare independence in the same illegal way ? " he asked .
Serbia 's interior ministry has filed criminal charges against Kosovo Albanian leaders instrumental in proclaiming independence , accusing them of proclaiming a " false state " on Serbian territory .
In Belgrade , about 10,000 students marched in protest at the independence declaration , and Serb enclaves inside Kosovo also saw anti-independence rallies .
Serbian security forces were driven out of Kosovo in 1999 after a Nato bombing campaign aimed at halting the violent repression of ethnic Albanian separatists .
The province has been under UN administration and Nato protection since then .
Pledges of support
On Monday , Washington formally recognised Kosovo as a " sovereign and independent state " .
STANCE ON RECOGNITION For : Germany , Italy , France , UK , Austria , US , Turkey , Albania , Afghanistan Against : Russia , Spain , Romania , Slovakia , Cyprus
In Brussels , EU foreign ministers adopted a compromise proposal from Spain , one of several countries which argue that Kosovo 's independence is a breach of international law and will boost separatists everywhere .
The bloc set aside differences by stressing Kosovo 's declaration was not a precedent for separatists elsewhere and pledging that the whole Balkan region would eventually join the bloc .
Unanimous recognition of Kosovo was never at stake at the meeting because the EU has no legal right to recognise new states , BBC European affairs correspondent Oana Lungescu notes .
The question was whether , despite their differences on recognition , Europeans could unite on how to bring stability in their backyard , after almost two decades of seemingly endless Balkan crises .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This is an ugly victory for demographic warfare SEQ , London
It took hours of tortuous negotiations but the EU managed to pass the unity test , our correspondent says .
Kosovo , the ministers agreed , was a unique case and did not call into question international legal principles , such as territorial integrity .
The bloc 's statement said the EU was ready to play a leading role in the Balkans , with a 2,000 - strong police and justice mission headed to Kosovo and new measures to promote economic and political development in the region , including a donors ' conference by June .
The EU foreign affairs chief Javier Solana said there was a total commitment to bring all the Balkan countries into the EU .
But Kosovo will not be able to get very close until it is recognised by all 27 members , and that may take a long time , our correspondent adds .
Among other countries to recognise Kosovo was Turkey .
Correspondents say this has symbolic significance because for centuries the Ottoman Turks ruled the Balkans , including modern - day Serbia and Kosovo .

Charity is a categorical programming language currently being developed by The Charity Development Group in The Department of Computer Science at The University of Calgary , Canada .
( Click here to see a larger picture ! )
Charity is functional in style .
That is , programmers familiar with declarative paradigms ( functional and logic programmers ) should find Charity easy to grasp .
Charity is based on the theory of strong categorical datatypes .
These are divided into two subclasses : the inductive datatypes ( built up by constructors in the familiar way ) and the coinductive datatypes ( broken down by destructors ) .
Programs over these datatypes are expressed by folds ( catamorphisms ) and by unfolds ( anamorphisms ) , respectively .
We list some , but not all , of Charity 's features below :
Charity is " pure " , and supports lazy evaluation .
. Charity is higher - order .

All Charity computations terminate ( up to user input ) .
It is our belief that Charity provides a very elegant , pure framework for software development , teaching , and language research .
This framework supports straightforward reasoning about programs and is highly amenable to program specification , transformation , and verification .

Why Do People Post Gadget " Unboxing " Photos on the Web ?
An Apple designer sheds some light on one of the Internet 's peculiar little mysteries
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The FBI is looking into fraud allegations against Countrywide Financial Corporation , a U.S. government official told CNN .
The investigation is still in its early stages , another government official familiar to the situation said .
The story was first reported in The Wall Street Journal Saturday .
The probe will examine underwriting and mortgage origination practices , and whether the company misrepresented losses related to subprime loans , the paper said .
Subprime mortgages , or home loans given to borrowers with weak credit , have been at the root of a crisis that has rocked the U.S. economy .
Though the Federal Bureau of Investigation has acknowledged ongoing investigations related to the subprime debacle , neither the FBI nor the Justice Department would comment on the specific targets .
" The FBI has been investigating potential fraud in the mortgage / sub - prime lending industry , however , we can not confirm or deny which companies are under investigation , " said FBI spokesman Richard Kolko .
A law enforcement official told CNN that there are currently 16 companies being investigated .
Both Countrywide and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , which agreed in January to acquire Countrywide for $ 4 billion in stock , did not return calls to CNN .
Calabasas , Calif . - based Countrywide is the nation 's largest home lender , responsible for roughly one - fifth of the mortgages in the United States .
When the housing crash began , Countrywide ( CFC , Fortune 500 ) was faced with an increasing number of subprime customers who were delinquent with their mortgage payments .
The company was forced to essentially shut down its subprime lending operations last year to focus on originating loans that conform to Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) guidelines , considered to be safe investments .
On Friday Countrywide 's founder and CEO , Angelo Mozilo , testified before the House Committee on Government and Oversight Reform , along with two other CEOs who resigned in the wake of the mortgage crisis - Charles Prince of Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Stanley O'Neal of Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) .
All three defended their lofty compensation packages , despite the loss of billions to their companies and shareholders .

The video
Note : the times are GMT+0
So what is it ?
Several months ago , Bungie ( the creators of the Halo game series ) created a map , showing the geographic location of people playing Halo 3 online .
The map is still up and running ( as of January 2nd , 2008 ) , and you can see it at the following url : http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/Nightmap.ashx
Since it was a static image , but updated regularly - I thought it'd be nice to see it animated .
Some observations
There are some somewhat interesting things in the video :
There is a lot of people playing in America and Europe pretty much constantly .
At about 02:00 , there is a dip in play which sweeps over the UK , and then America about 6 - 8 hours later .
People start playing again about 10:00 , picking up till 23:00
There 's a small island to the south of America which seems to be playing Halo 3 constantly .
Hawaii I think ?
It 's also popular in a bunch of other tiny little islands scattered about .
It 's not very popular in China , South Africa , and even less popular in Russia .
How it was made ( The boring bit )
The rest of this post is a reasonably technical explanation of how it was created , feel free to ignore it if you have no interest in bash - scripting .
Thanks to the flexibility and horrible syntax that is shell scripting , I threw together a few script to automatically grab the map every hour using wget .
Getting the images
#!/bin/sh #
Gets the halo activity nightmap every hour , # saves it to a sensibly named file .
while [ 1 ] ; do DATE = ` date + % Y- % m- % d_ % H- % M ` #
Save date to variable FILE =~ / halomap / $ DATE .jpg # Filename format ~/ halomap/2007-12-26_15-23.jpg # wget map , save to above file , terminal output to / dev/null wget " http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/Nightmap.ashx "
- O $ FILE -o / dev / null #
Log activity to file echo * $ DATE >> haloMap.log #
Show download completed ( with a dot ) , sleep one hour echo -n . sleep 3600 done
This script was run on a friends shell - server .
I would have put this video together a lot sooner , but the box it was running on lost power , and kay ( the owner of said box ) was in Germany at the time - thus I could n't retrieve the images .
Anyway , I seemingly had it running for about 25 days before it lost power , which was more than enough images for a short animation .
Once I had tar / gziped the images , and transfered the images to this machine , it was time to convert the images to a video .
Image sequences to video
There are a lot of ways to do this , from shifty looking Shareware applications to completely overkill high - end image - sequence creation / repair tools .
Since this laptop runs OS X , and I have Quicktime Pro installed ( I have Final Cut Pro , which activates the " Pro " features of Quicktime ) I decided used this to convert the image sequence to a Quicktime H.264 .
But , a problem - I had the images numbered yyyy - mm - dd_hh - mm.jpg , and Quicktimes Image Sequence Import requires them to be numbered sequentially ( some_file_001 , some_file_002 etc )
There are various GUI renaming tools , but since it I just needed simple sequentially named files , bash has the required tools built in ..
Opening the folder in a terminal , and running the following command renames all files in the directory to 0.jpg , 1.jpg , 2.jpg etc :
let index = 0 ; for file in * ; do mv $ file $ index .jpg ; let index =index +
1 ; done
If you want to double check it 's not about to break stuff , change " do mv " to " do echo mv " and verify the output .
Importing this into Quicktime Pro , and exporting it worked as expected .
But , watching the video , you have no sense of time .
Was each frame 1 minute passing ?
1 hour ?
1 day ?
Embedding Time - stamps
I decided to put the time - stamp on each frame of video .
But , how to read the filename , format the time - stamp and embed it on the image ?
There are a bunch of watermarking tools , but I doubted they would be able to read the filename , clean up the formatting and write to the image ..
Then I remembered ImageMagick - a set of command - line tools for image processing .
After a bit of searching around , I found some examples of labeling images ..
What I ended up with was the following :
let c = 0 ; for i in * ; do echo convert - font / Library / Fonts / Arial.ttf - fill white - pointsize 18 - draw ' text 10,235 " $i " ' $ i $ c .png >> proc.sh ; let c =c+ 1 ; done
This produces a file filled with incrementing lines such as :
{{lang : bash} convert - font / Library / Fonts /Arial.ttf - fill white - pointsize 18 - draw ' text 10,235 " 2007-10 -10 16:00 " '
2007-10-10_16-09.jpg 0.png
Fun is it not ?
Basically it does the same as the first renaming script , but instead of renaming , it appends an image - magick command to open $ i , write the filename on the frame , and output it as $ c.png ( $c being the frame count )
One slight problem I had was an error " convert : unable to read font " .
This was solved by using an absolute path to the font .
On OS X
These are under / Library / Fonts / , thus / Library / Fonts / Arial.tff was what I used .
I wrote the commands to a file , so I could clean the text output manually .
It saved messing around with sed in the loop , making it even more complicated and messy ..
Since this was a one - of run , manually editing the file was fine .
I opened the " proc.sh " file created by the above loop in TextMate , and used its Regex find / replace to rewrite " 2008-12-27_18-45.jpg " to " 2008-12-27 18:45 "
The regular expresion I used was horrible looking , like all regex's , if you 're going to do this yourself , and there 's problems , just rewrite it - debugging regex 's is more hassle than rewriting them ..
The quotes are included in the regex to stop it altering the filename as well .
" ( d{4}-d{2}-d{2} ) _(d{2} ) -( d{ 2} ) " '
And the replace field :
" $ 1 $ 2:$3 " '
Time - stamped images !
So , now I had a shell - script full of the convert commands , ready to label the images .
chmod +x proc.sh time .
/ proc.sh
After 3.6 minutes ( On a single core of a Intel C2D 2.33GHz processor - imageMagick is n't multi- threaded ) , I had a nice image sequence , ready to convert to a video !
Loading it into Quicktime Pro , I exporting a 12 FPS H.264 video , which you saw at the top of this post !
The file - size was approx ' 1.3MB , and it was 403 frames long .
Crowds flocked to the lava viewing area on the Big Island yesterday .
Lava is flowing into the sea for the first time since June .
ROD THOMPSON / RTHOMPSON@STARBULLETIN.COM
Crowds flocked to the lava viewing area on the Big Island yesterday .
Lava is flowing into the sea for the first time since June .
Spectators love the lava
HILO » Corrine Collins always hoped one day she would be able to see an eruption in person .
Yesterday she got her wish .
" This is so incredible .
Oh my God , I can't believe this , " Collins said .
Collins , who moved to Honolulu just two weeks ago , flew to the Big Island , rented a car and drove to yesterday 's 2 p.m. opening of the new Hawaii County lava viewing site .
The opening ceremony started about 10 minutes early and featured Auntie Minnie Kaawaloa , who grew up in nearby Kapoho village , which was destroyed by lava in 1960 .
Kaawaloa said in a prayer that the present lava flow area was and is a place of beauty for all to enjoy .
She said the prayer in Hawaiian , noting that she knew her ancestors were listening .
Hundreds of cars parked along Highway 130 , waiting for the road and trail to open .
With officials letting just 20 cars at a time drive the final two miles to the trailhead , Collins had to wait an hour before she was allowed to drive forward .
By then the parking places closest to the trail were full , and she had to park a mile back .
Advancing lava cut off a shorter half - mile trail yesterday .
Undaunted , Collins walked the 1 1/ 2 miles from her car to the lava site , past the open - air roadside shelter of Michael Pai , who has had a homestead there since before lava flows began in 1983 .
Pai said some people were literally walking through his backyard , failing to show respect .
One man , his face red from exertion of walking from his car , started treading down Pai 's driveway .
Pai had to send him back to the road and show him where the trail started .
But Pai's friend , Dana Keawe , making the best of the situation , started charging weary hikers $ 10 to drive them back to their cars .
Most people marveled at the rare , if hot and sweaty experience .
Lava has n't entered the sea since last June and access to the viewing area has n't always been simple .
Officials plan to monitor the lava flow daily and will meet each morning to decide whether to close the trail if the lava advances too close .
Outsourcing has become one of the most prominent business trends over the last few years while it has become especially ...
European “ Smart Car ” Hits American Market
February 21st , 2008 by Sarah Lozanova
What lessons can be learned from this tiny car , that Europeans are calling Un - American ?
When my husband and I look for a parking spot on the crowded Chicago streets , we often joke that our tiny Smart car would have many potential parking spots .
Our joke can now become a reality as the Daimler Mercedes - Benz Smart car hits the American market .
This car might help show Americans that bigger is not always better .
With nearly 1 million car sales in 36 countries , this car has made quite a splash over the last 10 years .
The US Smart car will range in price from $ 11,590 to $ 16,590 .
In the US , there is a waiting list with 40,000 people who have forked out a $ 99 deposit .
This exceeded the expectations of most , with many people doubting that the car will be popular on this side of the pond .
The car is a contradiction of everything that I think of as a typical American car .
This two passenger car is a mere 106 inches in length and has a 3 cylinder engine .
It gets about 40 miles per gallon , which I found slightly disappointing .
Roughly half the length of an SUV , there are significant advantages to parking a car of this size .
Many people are calling for a cultural change to respond to the environmental challenges that face society .
This car demonstrates European moderation , while providing a comfortable ride ( for two ) .
Could this car begin to undo the American mentality that bigger and more powerful is always better ?
If nothing else , this car helps reduce the land area needed for parked cars and reduces the gas consumed to power it .
The driving experience in urban areas is a bit more relaxed due to a larger choice of parking spots and increased mobility through congested areas .
It is too early to tell how popular this car will be in the US , or if we are willing to give up size and power for convenience and savings .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. government revealed a weakening budget picture on Friday , with the 2008 fiscal year ’s first - quarter deficit rising 31.3 percent despite a record December surplus .
The cumulative deficit for the October - December period widened to $ 105.54 billion from the $ 80.4 billion gap for the same period a year earlier , as slower growth in receipts failed to keep up with higher spending , the Treasury Department said .
The data comes as the White House and key members of Congress are discussing possible fiscal stimulus plans to bolster a flagging economy , which could cost more than $ 100 billion .
“ The deterioration in the first - quarter numbers did n’t shake our view that the deficit might widen this year to the $ 200 billion range , ” said Lou Crandall , chief economist at Wrightson - ICAP in Jersey City , New Jersey .
“ A severe deterioration of economic conditions and significant stimulus repose could quickly push you above the $ 300 billion ( deficit ) level , ” he said .
The federal government ended its last fiscal year on September 30 , 2007 with a deficit of $ 163 billion , marking the third consecutive year of falling deficits after they peaked at $ 413 billion in 2004 .
The Treasury said receipts for the first quarter of fiscal 2008 rose 5.7 percent from a year earlier to $ 606.21 billion , while spending outlays for the period rose 8.8 percent to $ 711.75 billion .
Both receipts and outlays were a record for a first quarter .
For December , the federal government had posted a $ 48.26 billion budget surplus , a record for that month .
However , one - off items reduced federal outlays by nearly $ 30 billion .
The December budget surplus was 15 percent wider than the year - earlier surplus of $ 41.96 billion .
Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a $ 50 billion surplus for December .
Federal government outlays in December rose to $ 228.72 billion from $ 218.01 billion in December 2006 , the Treasury said .
A Treasury spokeswoman said the December 2007 outlays were reduced by $ 29.7 billion as the government shifted $ 17 billion of December Social Security , Medicare and other benefit payments into November and collected $ 12.7 billion from a Federal Communications Commission auction of advanced wireless services spectrum .
Without these special items , the December surplus would have been only $ 18.56 billion .
Federal receipts still set a new December record of $ 276.98 billion , up 6.5 percent from the $ 259.97 billion collected in December 2006 .
“ Severance agreements are usually a safety net for the employee , ” said Don B. Lindner , head of the executive compensation practice at WorldatWork , a professional organization previously known as the American Compensation Association that provides training and certification for compensation and benefits professionals .
“ It would be unusual to have a severance agreement triggered by a person leaving on a voluntary and positive basis .
It ’s usually used for a job that has been eliminated or cut back , or a person that ’s been asked to leave . ”
Image Michael E. Baroody Credit ... National Association of Manufacturers
Government ethics experts said people occasionally received a severance payment when they left the private sector for a government job , but it could be problematic when the person was going to a post whose mission was to regulate the former employer .
Mr. Baroody ’s nomination will be before the Senate Commerce Committee next week .
He is opposed not only by consumer groups but also by trial lawyers , firefighters and pediatricians .
They have highlighted what they say are repeated actions taken by Mr. Baroody and the association on behalf of companies that have made consumer products less safe .
Mr. Baroody “ not only represented the interests of the nation ’s manufacturing firms — often in direct opposition to the interest of consumers — but led efforts to weaken the C.P.S.C. and opposed numerous initiatives to protect children and the public from unsafe products , ” said Dr. Jay E. Berkelhamer , the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics , in a letter opposing the nomination .
In recent years , Mr. Baroody has been involved in legislative efforts to limit the liability of makers of asbestos as companies have faced growing numbers of lawsuits from workers who say they have been exposed to the fire - retardant material .
In 2000 , he sent a letter on behalf of the association urging Gov. George Pataki of New York to veto legislation that required tobacco companies to make cigarettes that were less likely to cause fires .
( The governor signed the measure . )
Hank Cox , a spokesman at the association who has known Mr. Baroody for many years , said Mr. Baroody ’s letter opposing the New York legislation “ has nothing to do with the efficacy of safe cigarettes ” but was more generally opposed to the principle that the states could set safety standards , rather than one national standard .
Mr. Baroody and the association signed a severance agreement in January 2006 , nearly a year before he was nominated .
It was rewritten in January , after Mr. Baroody was identified in trade publications and Web sites as the leading candidate to head the commission .
Neither the White House nor the association would reveal any details of the original or amended agreements .

Reasons to pull kid from school : Illness , emergency , or presence of gays
by Jeremy Hooper
Abiding Truth Ministries , American Family Association , AFA of MI , AFA of PA , Americans for Truth , Christian Information Service , Christian Civic League of Maine , Concerned Women for America , Culture Campaign , Defend the Family International , Exodus Mandate , Illinois Family Institute , Indiana Voice for the Family , Informing Christians , Liberty Counsel , MassResistance , Mission America , New Generation Christian Center , Parents ' Rights ' Coalition , Right March , Stephen Bennett Ministries , Values USA , Watchmen on the Walls .
If the above coalition of " pro-family " groups were to join forces , it would sort of be like that old " Laff - A - Lympics " cartoon , where characters from all sorts of different shows joined together to compete in an animated extravaganza .
Except , of course , in this situation , the friendly animated characters would be replaced with grown adults who dedicate their careers to keeping LGBT people marginalized , stigmatized , and demonized .
Well , guess what ?
The idea of the aforementioned groups joining forces is not just a hair - raising notion .
In preparation for the upcoming Day of Silence ( a nationwide effort to curb anti-LGBT harassment in America 's public schools ) , these socially conservative groups have joined forces to organize an effort encouraging parents to keep their children home from school on the day of the pro-acceptance event .
Here 's a bit of what they have to say about their endeavor :
Buddy Smith of American Family Association asserts , “ It ’s outrageous that our neighborhood schools would allow homosexual activism to intrude into the classroom .
‘ Day of Silence ’ is about coercing students to repudiate traditional morality .
It ’s time for Christian parents to draw the line — if your children will be exposed to this DOS propaganda in their school , then keep them home for the day . ”
“ It amounts to educational malpractice for school officials to engage in one - sided homosexual activism , ” said Matt Barber of Concerned Women for America .
“ Our schools are supposed to be places of learning , not places of political indoctrination .
It is the height of impropriety and cynicism for “ gay ” activists and school officials to use children as pawns in their attempt to further a highly controversial and polarizing political agenda . ”
...
“ Social activism does not belong in the classroom , ” says Peter LaBarbera of Americans for Truth .
“ Students would be far better served by reading a good book at home — perhaps even the Bible — rather than being subjected to pro-' gay ' indoctrination . ”
This year , GLSEN adds a special twist to “ Day of Silence ” : shameless exploitation of the recent tragic school shooting death of California 8th grade student Lawrence King .
Los Angeles media report that although the boy had been entrusted to the care of Casa Pacifica , a residential center for “ abused , neglected , and severely emotionally disturbed children , ” he had been permitted for the last two weeks to attend school in feminine makeup , nail polish , and high - heeled boots .
The adult guardians , school administrators , and teachers responsible for guiding and protecting this precious troubled child failed him miserably ; GLSEN fails him again now by employing his violent death to manipulate and deceive millions of children .
...
Gary Glenn of AFA Michigan , said :
" The director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force broke homosexual activists ' code of silence on the threat homosexual behavior poses to young people 's health when he admitted this month that HIV 'is a gay disease . '
GLSEN should cancel its celebration of that code of silence about the severe public health hazards of homosexual behavior , and any school administrator who continues to stand silent while enabling the promotion of such harmful behavior should be sued for criminal negligence . "
Yea , kids ?
We gay activists are " exploiting " Lawrence King 's senseless murder ?
That 's weird , because it totally sounds to us like you on the far - right are exploiting our genuine sadness over the tragic matter to make it sound as if such heartfelt expressions are merely a part of our " playbook . "
But what the hell do we know ?
After all , we 're merely people who are sick and tired of seeing soul - damaging bias reproducing itself within subsequent generations , forcing countless queer kids to be robbed of the peace of mind that should define their childhoods .
How could we ever compete with those who are fostering such bias by ensuring that own children learn the rules to " smear the queer " ?!

Why do groups like these think when schools make the effort to protect GLBTQ youth its indoctrination ?
Yet it 's not indoctrination when these same groups want creationism thought in schools ?
So on one hand you have public schools doing what they are supposes to do - protecting all of its student bodies which include GLBTQ youth .
But on the other hand they want to teach students that the earth is only 6000 years old !
These people are kooky !

Yep , ai n't propaganda fun ?
If you say it with authority , you can get people who are predisposed to believe you to buy that the sky is green , and that anybody who tries to tell you otherwise is being a religious bigot !

The " pro-family " movement 's key strategy is to accuse our side of doing EXACTLY what they themselves are doing .
Which is exactly why highlighting every instance is so important .
The more people experience the hypocrisy , the more people will start to understand what their campaigns are all about .

From the Day of Silence website : " The Day of Silence ( www.dayofsilence.org), a project of the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network ( GLSEN ) in collaboration with the United States Student Association ( USSA ) , is a student - led day of action where those who support making anti-LGBT bias unacceptable in schools take a day - long vow of silence to recognize and protest the discrimination and harassment -- in effect , the silencing -- experienced by LGBT students and their allies . "
Funny , I do n't see anything about twisting classmates ' arms until they say , " I hereby reject traditional morality ! "
Maybe it 's buried on some other page ?
Or do you need the Religious Right Bizarro World Secret Decoder Ring to uncover that part of the message ?

Most offensive portion : " The adult guardians , school administrators , and teachers responsible for guiding and protecting this precious troubled child [ Lawrence King ] failed him miserably ; " by allowing him to " attend school in feminine makeup , nail polish , and high - heeled boots . "
Yeah , they must not have known that the penalty for boys being too feminine is death .
What a twisted , sick way too look at this .
Blame the his guardians for not sensoring his looks ?!
How about blaming the kid who shot him for his looking the way he did ?
How about blaming the intolerance that made the shooter think it was necessary or justified to kill another boy if he expresses romantic interest in you .
JUST SICK !

GayMormonBoy : I totally agree with you .
Unfortunately , though , I think most of us realized it was only a matter of time before someone went there .
Sadly , many of these groups seem to make a habit of being sick .

Apparently the anti-gay industry 's " Day of Truth " has gone to pot .

I read some recent news that kids were going to be segregated into gender - differentiated classrooms : girls and boys .
I do n't know how they 'll account for this little problem now ...

How is promoting acceptance , equality , and inclusion ( along with rational analysis ) in our schools considered to be gay activism or indoctrination ?
In Illinois , our legislators recently enacted a law mandating a moment of silent " prayer " in our schools .
Fortunately , many schools have literally interpreted that to mean a few seconds .
Why is prayer taking time in our schools when it could be accomplished in the home before school ?
It is morally imperative for our country 's elementary and secondary schools to enact programs which teach inclusion and acceptance since so many children are taught hatred and ignorance at home and live in a society that condones anti-gay bias in our families , schools , military , adoption , marriages , employment , housing , athletics , etc ...
Posted by : Bob Zuley | Mar 6 , 2008 11:44:52 AM
Bob : Simple answer -- it 's not !
They want people to think acceptance is " indoctrination , " in order to mask the fact that THEY are the ones trying to indoctrinate public schools with faith - based bias .

" Encourage your church leadership to follow the bold example of Pastor Ken Hutcherson who is vocally opposing “ Day of Silence ” in his community in Redmond , Washington . "
Is this the same Pastor Ken Hutcherson who has said " God hates effeminate men " and " If I was in a drugstore and some guy opened the door for me , I 'd rip his arm off and beat him with the wet end " ?
Gee , I wonder if I can name someone - say , a 15 - year old child , perhaps - who was recently brutally murdered for being " effeminate " ?
These anti-gay groups have no sense of decency at all .

EBMUD considers helping renters in foreclosure EAST BAY Utility may keep water on when landlords fail to pay bill
In another sign of fallout from the foreclosure epidemic , the East Bay 's largest water agency today will consider whether to ban itself from turning off water to rental properties where the landlord has stopped paying the bill .
Faced with reports of landlords and banks in foreclosure cases who stop paying water bills as a way to illegally evict tenants , the East Bay Municipal Utility District is considering a proposal to place liens on landlords ' property to collect the unpaid charges .
At the same time , the district would keep the water flowing to the tenants of the building , said EBMUD board member Andy Katz , prime sponsor of the proposal .
Katz said the plan , which would apply to rental buildings where the landlord is responsible for the water bill , is modeled after the policy of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission , which uses liens to collect delinquent charges on rental properties where landlords are responsible for the bills .
The idea was approved by the board 's finance subcommittee March 11 , following appeals from the activist organization Just Cause Oakland , Oakland tenant Kim Isaac - Ray and others .
The water was shut off in December at the foreclosed duplex where Isaac - Ray and her children live in West Oakland , according to Kim Ota of Just Cause .
Katz said that Just Cause asked him for help in the Isaac - Ray case and that he helped get her service restored .
It was shut off for a day , Ota said .
" Landlords seeking unlawful evictions are using water termination to force tenants to move , " the Alameda County director of public health , Anthony Iton , said in a March 10 letter to the board .
Oakland City Council President Ignacio De La Fuente and Councilmembers Nancy Nadel and Larry Reid are among those who wrote the board in support of protecting tenants and holding property owners accountable when they are responsible for the bills .
An EBMUD survey of bill payment since February found 26 multifamily properties with delinquent water bills in the district , which serves 1.3 million customers from Crockett to San Leandro .
Three of the properties later had their bills paid , and the water remains turned on for the remaining 23 while the district pursues existing notification and warning procedures for those responsible for payment , according to a staff report prepared for today 's board meeting .
A district survey of nine utilities found that eight of them have the same collection policy as EBMUD for unpaid bills , which is to stop service and refer the unpaid bills to a collection agency , according to a March 20 staff report .
San Francisco was the only one of the nine to use liens .
" Everybody 's watching this to see what we will do , " said EBMUD spokesman Charles Hardy .
The proposed change in EBMUD policy comes amid what advocates for tenants call an alarming surge in illegal eviction attempts caused by the subprime mortgage and foreclosure crisis .
" It 's really kind of an epidemic in Oakland and Berkeley , " said Anne Omura , executive director of Oakland 's Eviction Defense Center , a nonprofit legal - aid group helping poor renters .
" I 've never seen a time like this in terms of these foreclosure evictions .
The cases are heartbreaking .
We have a lot of elderly and disabled clients whose landlords have been foreclosed on . "
Several cities - including Oakland , Berkeley and San Francisco - have " just cause " eviction laws that allow tenants to remain in rental properties that are sold unless the new owner intends to move in or convert its use .
Omura said it 's difficult to determine whether landlords and banks stop paying utility bills as a deliberate strategy to evict tenants , but her agency is seeing attempted eviction cases where the taps have run dry .
A property owner is legally required to keep rental units habitable .
" It 's definitely a trend we 've seen , " she said , mentioning " one in Hayward and one in Berkeley where they 've cut off the water . "
Oakland City Attorney John Russo said in a report Friday that property owners are using a variety of tactics to illegally evict tenants in foreclosure cases .
" Based on the evidence we are seeing in the city attorney 's office , a large number of evictions resulting from bank foreclosure are deceitful , unjust and flagrantly illegal under local and state law , " he said .
" An increasing number of renters are being kicked out of their homes after banks foreclose on rental properties .
Many are families - good tenants who have never missed a rent payment .
But they are being forced out because banks can realize more profit from a vacant property . "
This is probably as close as I get to a political cartoon .
Before you point out that you do n’t play tridimensional chess with 3 people ( though you should , I mean there are three dimensions ) , and that all the chess pieces are in the wrong places and do n’t look like real chess pieces , let ’s go ahead and assume that Joel , Josh and Eli bought this 3D chess set off of Craigslist and they do n’t actually know how to play ( because no one does ) .
I know this comic really does n’t make any sense ( unless you are both ME and a SUPER STAR TREK NERD ) , but I was reading Wiki articles about Star Trek ( specifically the ending of DS9 , the Dominion War , and Worf ”s family ) and I got to thinking about how there really were some parallels between Worf and Obama ( thin premise , I know ) .
Then I figured it would be fun to draw Obama as a Klingon and thus I birthed the four confusing panels you see above .
What can I say ?
This is EXACTLY how my brain works .
If you were to map out my thought process , it goes something like “ need to write a comic ->
I have n’t done anything about Obama ( I support him ) -> should I ?
This is n’t a political site ->
I wonder if Alexander Rozhenko appeared in DS9 after he served with Worf on the Rotaran -> let ’s check Wiki ->
God I hated Alexander ->
Oh I forgot that Sisko got Cassidy pregnant then be became black alien Jesus -> what if Obama was a Klingon ? ”
See ?
Actually , when I write it out like that it makes perfect sense .
A Call Girl ’s View of the Spitzer Affair
Astute readers of this blog know that we have an abiding interest in the economics of prostitution .
One of the people who will be featured in our next book is a high - end call girl who goes by the name of Allie .
Without giving away much detail here , let me just say that Allie is a very bright and attractive blonde who works for herself ( not through an agency ) in a large U.S. city , and often travels to other large cities .
In light of the news about Eliot Spitzer ‘s encounter with a high - end call girl , we asked Allie a few pertinent questions :
Q . Have you ever had a client as powerful or well - known as Eliot Spitzer ?
( You have n’t had Spitzer himself as a client , have you ? )
A. I have clients that are professional athletes , artists , and entertainers .
They are probably better known , but obviously not as powerful .
I do n’t believe I have ever seen Eliot , or as I like to call him , Number 9 .
Q . In what ways is such a client different from your run -of - the - mill client ?
A. I have n’t found them to be that different .
Some clients are worried that you will give out their information , and others do n’t seem to care .
You see the same thing with the typical guy that no one knows because he is deathly afraid of getting in trouble with the law , or with his wife .
Q . Do you typically know the true identity of your clients , and if so , how ?
A. Yes .
Always .
I insist that they give me their full names and their place of work so that I can contact them there before we meet .
I also check their identification when we meet .
I also use verification companies , which assist escorts in verification of clients .
These companies do the verification of the client and put them in a database so that when the client wants to meet with a girl for the first time , he does n’t have to go through the verification process again .
For a fee , I can call in and they will tell me if the client has a history of giving the girls problems , where he works , and his full name .
Q. How would you describe your typical client ?
A . My clients are generally white , married , and professional males , between 40 and 50 years old , with incomes over $ 100,000 a year .
They tend to be doctors , lawyers , and businessmen looking to get away for a few hours in the middle of the day .
Q . Are there any generalizations you can make about clients from different industries — i.e. , doctors vs. lawyers vs. politicians , etc . ?
A. I have had politicians as clients , but never someone of [ Spitzer ’s ] stature .
I think it should be noted that politics is a little unusual as a profession , since politicians tend to have enemies , who have lots of power .
This makes politicians different from most corporate executives or lawyers or even professional athletes .
I could n’t say I could classify my clients by their chosen profession .
That being said , I think it ’s clear that clients with more disposable cash are willing to spend more money if they think their privacy will be protected .
Q . What ’s the most you ’ve ever been paid for a date ( overnight / weekend / whatever ) ?
A. I have been paid $ 10,000 for two days , and $ 1,000 for an hour , but this is rare for me .
Q. From your perspective , was Spitzer being reckless , and if so , how ?
A. Yes .
I think Spitzer has made lots of enemies over the years , and he is a public official .
In addition , the investigators claim that the initial reason for the investigation was the transferring of money between different accounts .
That seems like a subject he really should know about from his days as attorney general .
Q . How do you think your life would change if prostitution were made legal ?
A. I ’m sure it would cause me to lower my rates .
I ’m sure more people would take up prostitution as a profession , and I am sure more men would partake in the activity .
That said , legalization does not remove all the barriers to entry .
The job still would have a huge negative stigma associated with it , both for the escorts and the clients .
In countries like Canada , enforcement of prostitution laws is extremely lax , and while rates are lower , they are n’t wildly different .
So there would still be men out there afraid of their wives finding out , and I still would n’t want to share my job title with my family .
Q. Is it common for clients to have a girl come in from out of town … even from his hometown ?
A . In Spitzer ’s case , it seems like he was away from his family and had a night to spend with an escort .
So instead of going to the trouble of verification with another agency or girl , he just called the one he had used in the past .
From what I have read , Spitzer had an ongoing business relationship with this agency .
I ’m sure he felt that his identity was safe with the agency .
It probably seemed like a place he could order up different girls and not have to worry every time about his information .
The agency had even given him an alias , with the idea that the girls would n’t know who he was .
As for my experience , it is a little of the same .
I travel to see clients who are just not willing to take the chance that they might have a bad experience .
Q. What percentage of your clients are married ?
A. Almost all of my clients are married .
I would say easily over 90 percent .
I ’m not trying to justify this business , but these are men looking for companionship .
They are generally not men that could n’t have an affair [ if they wanted to ] , but men who want this tryst with no stings attached .
They ’re men who want to keep their lives at home intact .
Q . Have you ever had a client whose wife found out he was seeing you ?
A. Unfortunately , yes .
[ It has ] probably happened more than I know about , but it has been confirmed several times .
Hopefully it has never happened due to my neglect in any way .

“ Freeway Blogging ” : A problematic but inventive method of political protest .
Jonas Phillips is the third resident of Asheville , North Carolina to be arrested in recent weeks for displaying a pro-impeachment sign .
Unlike Mark and Deborah Kuhn , who were targeted for official abuse because of a display erected on their own property , Phillips was arrested for " freeway blogging " — that is , displaying a sign on an overpass spanning the interstate near his workplace .
While different considerations apply to protests on " public " property , it ’s significant that Asheville authorities are finding it difficult to identify a specific offense with which to charge Phillips .
That difficulty is symptomatic of institutional dishonesty :
The Asheville Police Department can’t afford to admit that it arrested Phillips because of the content of his sign , rather than because of some danger his protest posed to the public .
Last Wednesday ( August 15 ) , Phillips was " standing alone with my [ Impeach Bush - Cheney ] sign for about 10 minutes , when I was approached by Police Officer Russell Crisp , " he recounted .
" He asked me how long I was planning to stay there and I told him just a few more minutes because I had to go to work at 8:00 .
He asked for my ID and I obliged .
I asked him if I was doing something wrong , and he said that his Sergeant was on the way and he was going to wait for him .
So , I went back to my sign holding over the interstate . "
If Phillips had been obstructing pedestrians , or imperiling motorists , Officer Crisp could have addressed the problem by warning the cooperative protester to leave .
He did n’t issue such a warning .
A few minutes later the Sergeant , Officer Randy Riddle , " showed up with a paper in his hand , " continues Phillips .
" He spoke briefly to Crisp , then walked over to me and told me to put down my sign , put my hands behind my back , and that I was under arrest !
I was shocked and almost thought he was joking until he told me again to put down the sign and put my hands behind me and I was under arrest .
So I peacefully agreed and he cuffed me .
I asked him why I was being arrested , he told me I was in violation County Ordinance 16 - 2 ( the print out in his hand that he did n’t bother to read to me or show me ) .
He told me I was obstructing the sidewalk .
I told him I was not and that officer Crisp had witnessed a guy walk by me moments before . "
" Riddle yelled at me , ‘ You were obstructing the sidewalk ! ’ and ‘ I ’m sick of this sh*t ! ’ then he said , ‘ Here ’s your 15 minutes of fame buddy ! ’
I looked back to see his name plate and he said in a mean condescending tone , ‘ Yea , that ’s " Sergeant Riddle " get it right !’
He then put me in Officer Crisp ’s police car .
Riddle took my sign with him and I was taken downtown and booked by Crisp .
I was never read my Miranda rights . "
Two days later , the charges against Phillips had mutated from the relatively innocuous offense of " obstructing the sidewalk " — which would hardly merit being handcuffed and stuffed into a police car — to " endangering motorists . "
" The intent [ behind arresting Phillips ] was public safety and the banner being a hazard , " insisted Asheville police Capt .
Wade Wood .
" That ’s basically to the benefit of the motoring public , " which ran an imperceptibly small chance of being endangered should the activist lose control of his 5 ’ x1 ′ sign .
It ’s likelier that motorists would be killed in a bridge collapse , or perhaps in an accident involving falling space debris .
But Wood had to pull some charge out of his emunctory aperture , and this was the best he could do .
Similar dishonest ingenuity has been on display in Kent , Ohio , where City Law Director James Silver announced plans to charge activist Kevin Egler with " littering " — an offense carrying a fine of up to $ 500 — for posting an " Impeach Bush " sign in a public garden .
The original charge , advertising in a public space , proved useless because Egler ’s sign had no commercial content .
The littering charge is obviously an instance of content - based selective prosecution : Egler has presented dozens of photographs documenting the display of other posters — including commercial advertisements and military recruiting pitches — that were displayed without incident .
As I ’ve noted before , many police departments increasingly operate under the " we ’ll find a reason " standard — meaning that when given an opportunity officers will contrive some excuse to cite or arrest individuals who have committed no immediately recognizable offense .
Cases like those of Jonas Phillips , Kevin Egler , and the Kuhns — remember : three or more instances constitute a pattern — suggest that police are particularly prone to display their creativity when dealing with certain forms of political protest .
In his valuable new book You Have No Rights : Stories of America in an Age of Repression , Matthew Rothschild , editor of The Progressive , has compiled dozens of accounts from Americans who endured harassment , arrest , and various forms of official mistreatment after exercising their right to protest peacefully .
In May 2004 , Joe Previtera , a student at Boston College , staged a protest of the Abu Ghraib abuses outside a military recruiting center .
He chose to mimic the iconic photograph of a hooded detainee standing atop a box with his arms outstretched and electrodes attached to his body .
Previtera was surrounded by four policemen who told him the bomb squad was on its way .
He was arrested and jailed overnight on $ 10,000 bond , accused of making a " false bomb threat " ; obviously , he had n’t made a bomb threat , but because one of the heroes in blue ( they ’re all heroes , do n’t you know ? ) claimed to think the milk crate and wires could be a bomb , Previtera was charged with making a false threat .
In the middle of his night in jail , Previtera was awakened by police who tried to catechize him about the virtues of the Iraq war :
They " showed me pictures of U.S. soldiers with smiling Iraqi children , " he recalled .
" The officers told me these were pictures I ’d never see in the media… . "
Eventually the charges were dropped , but the point is that Previtera , like a growing number of others , spent time in jail for conducting a peaceful , legal protest the local police did n’t like .
Rothschild describes how police in Miami , with $ 8.5 million in federal funding tucked into an $ 87 billion war appropriation , waged a literal street war against protesters during the December 2003 Free Trade of the Americas Summit .
Police eagerly used tasers , pepper spray , rubber bullets , billyclubs , and other " non-lethal " weapons against peaceful and largely cooperative protesters .

Tens of millions of internet users across the Middle East and Asia have been left without access to the web after a technical fault cut millions of connections .
The outage , which is being blamed on a fault in a single undersea cable , has severely restricted internet access in countries including India , Egypt and Saudi Arabia and left huge numbers of people struggling to get online .
Observers say that the digital blackout first struck yesterday morning , with the Egypt 's communications ministry suggesting it was caused by a cut in a major internet pipeline linking it to Europe .
The line in question runs under the Mediterranean , from Palermo in Italy to Alexandria in Egypt .
It is not clear what caused the break .
The cable is one of only a handful of connections , and part of the world 's longest undersea cable , 24,500 miles long , running from Germany , through the Middle East and India before terminating in Australia and Japan .
Reports suggested that the lack of alternative routes for internet traffic meant only a small proportion of surfers were managing to get online .
Egyptian officials said that around 70 % of the country 's online traffic was being blocked , while officials in Mumbai said that more than half of India 's internet capacity had been erased , which could have potentially disastrous consequences for the country 's burgeoning hi-tech industry .
" There has been a 50 % to 60 % cut in bandwidth , " Rajesh Charia , president of the Internet Service Providers ' Association of India told Reuters .
The shutdown highlighted the often frail nature of international communications : despite the vast number of individuals who have access to the web , nearly all internet traffic is routed through a small number of cables submerged deep below the oceans .
It is then forwarded through an internet backbone consisting of just 13 servers which handle and direct all online requests .
Amr Gharbeia , a blogger from Cairo , said the inability to communicate with the outside world had caused confusion and concern among Egyptians .
" When I woke up this morning there was no internet at home , and then I visited two or three other places during the day and they had no access either , " he told the Guardian .
He said the lack of information about the outage meant that many people had been left wondering if the Egyptian authorities - who have previously jailed online critics and threatened to close down websites they deem a threat - had blocked web access in an act of censorship .
" We started getting paranoid because we 've seen the internet temporarily shut down before in countries like Pakistan , " he said .
" But I think we only have two internet gateways that go outside of Egypt , so perhaps only the smaller one is currently working . "
The outage will take several days to fix , and could have a drastic impact around the region and across the globe .
As well as hitting communications , businesses and the hi-tech industry in affected countries , it could also have repercussions for banks and even stock market trading .
Segway : the product that changed us forever .
" [ The Segway ] will be to the car what the car was to the horse and buggy . " - inventor Dean Kamen
In The Know : Life Before The Segway
The Segway Story .
Scientists have created metal - organic crystals capable of soaking up carbon dioxide gas like a sponge , which could be used to keep industrial emissions of the gas out of the atmosphere .
Chemists at the University of California Los Angeles said the crystals — which go by the name zeolitic imidazolate frameworks , or ZIFs — can be tailored to absorb and trap specific molecules .
" The technical challenge of selectively removing carbon dioxide has been overcome , " said UCLA chemistry professor Omar Yaghi in a statement .
" Now we have structures that can be tailored precisely to capture carbon dioxide and store it like a reservoir , as we have demonstrated .
No carbon dioxide escapes .
Nothing escapes — unless you want it to do so .
We believe this to be a turning point in capturing carbon dioxide before it reaches the atmosphere . "
Yaghi and his colleagues describe their findings in the Friday issue of the journal Science .
Little energy needed to create crystals
He said the crystals are non-toxic and would require little extra energy from a power plant , making them an ideal alternative to current methods of CO2 filtering .
The porous structures can be heated to high temperatures without decomposing and can be boiled in water or solvents for a week and remain stable , making them suitable for use in hot , energy - producing environments like power plants .
The team of scientists created 25 ZIF crystal structures in a laboratory , three of which showed a particular affinity for capturing carbon dioxide .
The highly porous crystals also had what the researchers called " extraordinary capacity for storing CO2 " : one litre of the crystals could store about 83 litres of CO2 .
The researchers created all 25 crystals by combining their raw materials in thousands of chemical reactions , which they say is similar to the high - throughput methods used in pharmaceutical research .
As concern over climate change grows and its link to human - made carbon dioxide emissions becomes clearer , governments and businesses around the world are investigating carbon - capturing technologies .
Past estimates from United Nation 's energy and climate experts have pegged the cost of capturing CO2 between $ 25 US and $ 60 US a tonne for conventional coal - fired plants .
Earlier this month , a task force established by the Alberta and federal governments issued a report calling for $ 2 - billion to get five new carbon capture and storage facilities operating by 2015 .
Bootlegging Salinger
When I was 14 , I started reading J.D. Salinger .
Empathizing with Holden 's confusion and simultaneous sense of wonder about the world , I remember becoming fascinated by .
When I was 16 , I startedJ.D. Salinger .
After finding the Glass family stories , which I still consider to be his best work , I subscribed to the Bananafish list - serv .
There , amidst conversations about deconstruction and the role it should play in literary theory which confused the hell out of me at the time , I found references to stories that Salinger had written which had never been collected .
I read on the list about the so - called " under - published Salinger stories , " pieces he had published in magazines like Harper 's and Collier 's from 1940 - 1948 .
The real treasure I was looking for was " Hapworth 16 , 1924 " from 1965 , Salinger 's last published story before he began a 43 year silence .
After delving into literary criticism of Salinger , I was fascinated by these stories , published in World War 2 - era magazines and decided to seek them out .
But I was met with a roadblock : Salinger had tried to sue anyone publishing the stories in the past .
Even Ian Hamilton 's biography In Search of J.D. Salinger had to be rewritten due to what Salinger thought was an overly large use of material from these stories , among other issues .
But with advice from the listserv , I traveled to the main branch of the Denver Public Library to photocopy of all of the under - published stories .
I knew from online research that they had an extensive periodical collection , and they did , but a number of the stories had been torn out of the magazines by eager collectors .
I was able to locate about 14 of the stories and read them over the weekend .
But I was still missing some .
About a year later , after searching interlibrary loan ( which is an incredible tool ) , I found 22 Stories , a bootleg volume of Salinger 's work published in 1998 in a run of 1,000 copies by Train Bridge Recluse .
I read the stories and was fascinated .
The search for the books was the most rewarding part about the experience , the feeling of flipping through the same pages that the past generation did to seek out these forgotten pieces .
It made me think that if teachers made learning more of a treasure hunt than a quest to see how much unwanted knowledge they could throw at you , the American educational system would be in a much better state .
The stories are now available online here .
Each story is a fascinating glimpse into another era , and they exhibit Salinger 's stylistic and narrative evolution into one of America 's most highly - acclaimed writers of the 20th century .
Salinger 's first mass - published story was " The Young Folks , " published in Story Magazine when he had just turned 21 , and it was a look inside a 1940s college party .
Naturally , since he began his publishing career during the war , Salinger was drawn towards writing many stories regarding soldiers ' stories and the environment in the nation during the time .
The rest of the stories in the collection focus on this strongly , but " The Young Folks " operates as a prelude , the beginning before the beginning , which makes it one of my favorite of his works .
In " The Young Folks , " a college party hostess named Lucille observes Edna Phillips ' boredom and tries to liven up the party by setting Edna up with another student , Bill Jameson .
During the course of the awkward conversation that follows , Jameson uses the excuse of writing a paper on a John Ruskin essay about " a cathedral in Europe " ( very specifically ) to explain why he should n't stay late at the party .
The conversation shifts to romance and sex , with Edna recalling two past relationships , the first with a painter and the second with a Princeton graduate .
In her recollections of the events , the painter refers deprecatingly to Edna as being " not beautiful according to conventional standards , " and she trails off after mentioning she " only posed for him this once . "
She also directly refers to being pressured sexually by the Princeton graduate .
Throughout this section , there are a few mentions of a blonde girl named Doris seated on the floor around three male Rutgers students laughing uproariously .
At this point , there is a shift in the discussion to the girl .
Edna has a negative opinion about her based on information from a trusted friend who was romantically involved with her , but acknowledges that men do find her attractive .
Meanwhile , Jameson subtly but obviously expresses interest in Doris .
The most telling line of the conversation is at the end :
Edna said , " It is n't that I can't appreciate how a boy feels after he dates you all summer and spends money he has n't any right to spend on theater tickets and night spots and all .
I mean , I can understand .
He feels you owe him something .
Well , I 'm not that way .
I guess I 'm just not built that way .
It 's gotta be the real thing with me .
Before , you know .
I mean , love and all . "
" Yeah .
Look , uh .
I really oughtta get goin ' .
I got this theme for Monday .
Hell , I shoulda been home hours ago .
So I think I 'll go in and get a drink and get goin ' .
After the conversation , Lucille comes to ask how things went between Edna and Jameson .
Edna explains that Jameson had to leave early to finish his paper but is surprised when Lucille replies that Jameson is " in there on the floor with Dottie [ Doris ] Leggett . "
Salinger then paints her reaction : " Edna fish - lipped her mouth and tapped her cigarette ashes . "
After sarcastically referring to Jameson as " quite a guy " and " a trifle warm - blooded , " Edna regains her seat on the big red chair , obviously upset about the situation .
Although everyone in the room -- even the delivery boys -- are dancing to the song on the radio , Edna requests , " See if you can't get something better on the radio !
I mean who can dance to that stuff ? "
The way Salinger presents his story is affecting for many reasons .
It captures a small but significant interpersonal interaction between two characters in a realistic way , and we see two human beings attempting to meet each other on some plane .
They stumblingly try to find some way to come to a greater understanding of themselves and each other and ultimately fail .
Both seem to be drawn to shallow and insignificant pursuits , not unlike many of Fitzgerald 's characters , as the United States comes out of the Depression and is drawing closer to the war that devastated a generation .
These characters also point to what Salinger did later in his writing career with his 1955 story " Franny . "
Jameson , a student who is reminiscent of Lane Coutell in " Franny , " pretends to be too busy with his pretentious college essays about cathedrals he 's never read about or seen while another college girl 's hopes for a more sincere interaction are dashed .
However , Franny is much different from Edna .
Edna 's interactions seem shallow and unfulfilled , while the reader has more sympathy for Franny , a spiritual seeker .
Furthermore , we see an accurate ( even linguistically ) record of what college life was perceived like at the time as a record of Salinger 's own generation .
But what gives these stories the most depth is Salinger 's sense of style and vision , already extremely well - developed at his young age .
Through his language , we are able to dream by the book , and we see his attentiveness to dialogue as expression of inner experience as well as the knowledge that he wanted us to have regarding this moment in these characters ' lives .
The rest of the collection becomes even more interesting , as we see the war 's impact on these characters wax and wane while relationships build and crumble .
Salinger writes shorts that are later turned into episodes in Catcher , and we see models for D.B. , Holden , and Phoebe , among other completely seperate characters who are fascinating to read about to any fan of Salinger .
But in the spirit of forbidden knowledge , I 'm not going to ruin the rest for you .
Everything 's there , from " The Young Folks " to " Hapworth . "

( Recasts , adds Iraqi denial , new injuries )
DIYARBAKIR , Turkey , Nov 13 ( Reuters ) -
The Kurdistan regional government in northern Iraq on Tuesday denied media reports that Turkish military helicopters seeking Kurdish rebels had bombed empty villages in the area .
Jamal Abdullah , a spokesman for the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government , said two Turkish warplanes had dropped flares as they flew over a village near Zakho in northern Iraq near the Turkish border on Monday .
Earlier Turkish television channels CNN Turk and NTV reported , citing Iraqi officials , that Turkish helicopters bombed villages near Zakho but nobody was killed .
The unconfirmed reports came as four Turkish soldiers were killed in a clash with militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) in southeast Turkey near the Iraqi border .
A lieutenant and three privates died in the clash in Sirnak province , where Turkey has massed large numbers of troops in preparation for a possible major incursion into northern Iraq to root out PKK rebels believed hiding there .
They were the first casualties of the conflict on Turkish territory since Nov. 7 when one soldier and three PKK guerrillas were killed in clashes .
An estimated 3,000 rebels use northern Iraq as a base for attacks in Turkey .
The PKK took up arms in 1984 with the aim of creating an ethnic homeland in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey .
Nearly 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
Ankara claims the right of self - defence under international law to attack the PKK inside Iraqi territory and is known to have staged limited cross - border operations against the PKK .
Asked in parliament about the report that PKK premises in northern Iraq had been bombed , Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said : " I am not aware ( of that ) . "
After meeting U.S. President George W. Bush last week to discuss the issue , Erdogan said the army would go ahead with an incursion against the militants in Iraq , but did not say when .
The armed forces chief , General Yasar Buyukanit , said last Friday the military was ready and waiting for the government to order the cross - border operation , according to media reports .
The death of the four soldiers in Sirnak province is likely to increase pressure on the government to authorise a cross - border operation , despite logistical difficulties as winter sets in across the rugged mountainous region .

WASHINGTON  The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday issued a $ 10.2 million fine — the largest in its history — against Southwest Airlines .
The FAA said it will seek the fine from Southwest for flying 46 jets during nine months in 2006 and 2007 without performing required inspections for cracks in the fuselage .
Cracks eventually were found on six of the planes .
The Boeing 737 jets made 59,791 flights before the airline realized in March 2007 that the inspections had not been completed .
The airline deliberately made 1,451 more flights after discovering the lapse , the FAA said .
The agency transferred an FAA supervisor who had been overseeing Southwest to another job and has " taken appropriate action " against an unnamed employee , spokeswoman Laura Brown said .
The inspections were ordered after undetected cracks in an Aloha Airlines 737 allowed a portion of the skin to peel away in flight in 1988 , killing a flight attendant .
Southwest , the low - fare carrier that now has more domestic flights than any other airline , said it had disclosed the missed inspections to the FAA in March 2007 .
" We believed at that point that the matter was closed , " spokeswoman Linda Rutherford said .
Southwest said in a statement that safety was never compromised .
The fine comes as the FAA faces a whistle - blower investigation into whether the agency has become too cozy with the airlines it oversees .
The allegations stem from an FAA program that encourages airlines to disclose safety problems without fear of being punished .
Linda Goodrich , vice president of the Professional Airways Systems Specialists , the union that represents FAA inspectors , said many union members have come forward to complain that the agency abuses the program .
" The agency has allowed ( airlines ) to use this system to get around enforcement actions , " Goodrich said .
Airlines have been allowed to " disclose " safety problems and escape fines even though inspectors initially discovered the problems , Goodrich said .
FAA documents prohibit that practice .
The FAA 's Brown said she did not know enough about Goodrich 's allegations to comment .
Whistle - blowers working with the House Transportation Committee had produced " detailed documentation " about the problem at Southwest , said a letter from the Inspector General for the Department of Transportation .
Committee Chairman Jim Oberstar , D - Minn. , asked the agency to investigate the claims , said the Feb. 11 letter .
The committee had planned to hold a hearing on the issue next week , but the hearing was canceled because Oberstar requires hip replacement surgery .
The previous high FAA fine was levied last year against TAG Aviation .
That fine , $ 10 million , was for operating charter flights in violation of federal law .
Airlines often pay less than the amount the FAA initially seeks .

A few years back , while I was still a student at Presidio School of Management , this vivacious , crazy eyed scientist came and told us about the biolubricants that his company WISE Solutions had been working on .
My mind of course went to , shall we say , personal lubricants , and I began to tune out .
But it turned out to be much different .
You see , they were working on plant based lubricants , to be used ( at the time ) in vehicles .
He shared a story of how they were in some cases too effective at lubrication , causing engines to over perform .
Now , years later , I thought I ’d take a look at what direction this startup has gone .
It seems they gone in many directions , and interesting ones .
But first , what ’s to know about these lubricants , and beyond the “ not petroleum ” factor , what makes them so beneficial , and do they perform in line with their conventional counterparts ?
In a word , yes .
And even better .
How ?
Well thankfully , WISE speaks both tech and laymanese :
• Better viscosity index and lubricity even at extreme temperatures , which means less friction and longer equipment life , saving energy and money .
• Patented oxidative stability ( longer life )
• Health and safety advantages ( e.g. , less flammable due to higher flash points )
• Lower risk of contaminating products being processed or manufactured ( e.g. , Food Grade products are rated USDA “ H1 , ” safe for incidental food contact )
• Better cold temperature performance ( lower pour points ) .
The composition of these products hits the right eco bells .
These green chemistry based products are made from renewable , non-GMO based oils ( as in , not yet another eco product made from monster corn ) and specialized additives .
They also reach “ Ultimate Biodegradability ” in 28 days .
I ’m not a scientist and do n’t have figures to compare that to other products , but somehow I do n’t imagine a quart of oil going inert in any hurry .
Another advantage to the composition of these products is that they ’re not subject to the price volatility of petroleum , and due to WISE ’s , well , wise moves , they are less expensive then synthetic counterparts .
Where do these products get used ?
Well that ’s a whole other article , but they see use in food production , whether it ’s in agricultural , processed food creation , or keeping the oven working smoothly .
They have a range of marine products , which it ’s safe to assume are n’t for a hard working branch of the military , but water traveling vessels and other aquatic oriented machinery .
But with product names like Bio-Blast Penetrant , I ’m not so sure .
And they have an industrial line , which among other things has Bio-Power Diesel Fuel Conditioner .
This fuel additive is able to improve fuel efficiency by as much as 13.6 % , increase horsepower 5.6 % , while reducing black smoke emissions by 42 % and reducing NOx as well .
And that ’s only the start .
Look for it and have a read yourself .
Topping it all off is the fact that WISE gives back 1 % of sales to support sustainable agriculture research , marine preservation , and other worthy causes .
If you ’re a business that uses machines as well as brains to power the operations , I ’d encourage you having a look at WISE Solutions deep catalog of offerings .
ALTADENA , California ( CNN ) --
When she was laid off in February , Patricia Guerrero was making $ 70,000 a year .
Weeks later , with bills piling up and in need of food for her family , this middle - class mother did something she never thought she would do :
She went to a food bank .
Patricia Guerrero was laid off in February .
Desperate to make ends meet , she recently went to a food bank .
It was Good Friday , and a woman helping her offered to pay her utility bill .
" It brought tears to my eyes , and I sat there and I cried .
I was like , ' This is really where I 'm at ? ' " she told CNN .
" I go ' no way ; ' [ but ] this is true .
This is reality .
This is the stuff you see on TV .
It was hard .
It was very hard . "
Guerrero is estranged from her husband and raising her two young children .
She 's already burned through her savings to help make ends meet , and is drawing unemployment checks .
She has had to take extreme measures to pay for her interest - only mortgage of $ 2,500 a month .
In fact , her mother moved in with her to help pay the bills .
Guerrero even applied for food stamps , but was denied .
Watch Guerrero describe going to food bank »
" I never used the system .
I 've been working since I was 15 - and - a - half .
I needed it now and it turned me down , " she said .
Stories like Guerrero's are becoming more common as middle - class Americans feel the pinch of an economic downturn , rising gas prices and a housing crunch , especially in a state like California that has been rocked by foreclosures .
On Wednesday , a key government report on the battered housing market found new home sales fell to their lowest level in 13 years in February , suggesting the nation 's housing market is still struggling .
Americans also have been attending in large numbers foreclosure fairs where mortgage lenders , financial planners and counselors offer tips to hard - hit homeowners .
" Our economy is struggling , and families in the ' Inland Empire ' and across the nation are hurting , " California Rep .
Joe Baca said , referring to an area of Southern California in his district .
" Our housing market is in a state of crisis due to rampant abuses of sub - prime lending , and unemployment is rising .
At the same time , the cost of necessities such as gas , healthcare , and education continue to rise . "

Daryl Brock , the executive director of Second Harvest Food Bank in California 's San Bernardino and Riverside counties , said his organization supplies food to more than 400 charities in metro Los Angeles , from homeless shelters to soup kitchens to an array of food banks .
While the majority of people they help are working poor families , he said they have seen some major changes .
In the last 12 to 18 months , Brock said , the agencies he supplies have begun seeing more middle - class families coming to their doors .
" Our agencies have said there is an increasing number of people coming to them for help , " Brock told CNN by phone .
" Their impression was that these were not people they normally would have seen before .
They seemed to be better dressed .
They seemed to have better cars and yet they seemed to be in crisis mode . "
He added , " The only thing they can do is give us anecdotal evidence that they think it 's because of the sub - prime mortgage meltdown and the housing crisis . "

A former loan processor , Guerrero knows all about that , although so far she has been able keep her house .
She used her tax refund to help pay many of her bills for the first two months , but now that money 's gone .
She says she 's now in a middle - class " no - man 's - land . "
" It just happened so fast .
It happened in a matter of -- what -- two months , " she said .
She 's eager to get back to work and to hold onto her home until the market turns .
But for this single mom , every day it becomes harder to hang on .
" It 's just depressing , " she said .
" For me , I just do n't want to get out of bed , but I have to .
That 's my hardest thing .
I have to . "
E-mail to a friend
CNN 's Gregg Canes contributed to this report .
It really is as simple as that , as Proinsias O'Mahony reports .
In fact , it 's a ' no brainer ' with a possible 654,836 % return
How do you pick a top - performing share ?
Investors looking to beat the market need n't numb their minds with heart - breakingly tedious fundamental research .
No , the secret to market - beating returns is a simple and , now that the US presidential election is getting into full swing , a timely one - buy the stocks that buy the politicians .
That 's the conclusion reached by the authors of Corporate Political Contributions and Stock Returns , a US study that found that the companies that have generously contributed to party coffers have beaten the market by 2.5 % a year over the past 25 years .
Looking at more than 800,000 contributions from almost 2,000 companies , the authors conclude that " evidence of political contribution return effects is quite startling " , with the average firm increasing its shareholder wealth by more than $ 150 m per year .
Interestingly , firms are better off showering modest amounts of money on as many candidates as possible , rather than spending big bucks on a handful of politicians .
Why ?
" Much like a venture capital portfolio of many start - ups , a few of the supported candidates will ' pay off big ' and result in increases in firm shareholder wealth , " the study says , with " an increase in annual returns of approximately 6 % a year " accruing to firms that contribute to the most candidates .
The saying that diversification is the only free lunch in finance never seemed more appropriate .
For most firms , the costs involved in getting politicians on their side are minor .
A limit of $ 10,000 per candidate in each election is enforced , but the authors note that smaller contributions are just as likely to result in share price gains .
As a result , investing in politicians is a no- brainer , with " the annual return - on - investment from a portfolio weighted by the total - number - of - supported - candidates to be an absurdly high 654,836 % " .
One could argue that market perception of political favours might be enough to cause share price appreciation .
The fact that the contributing companies also experienced greater future profitability suggests that political favours were real rather than perceived , however .
Further evidence lies in the fact that the " contribution effect " is greatest for companies that give to the most powerful politicos ( for example , congressional committee heads ) , to home - state candidates and to congressional , rather than senate , contenders ( budget and tax laws originate in Congress ) .
Potential benefits include " favourable tax treatment ... the awarding of government contracts , the imposing of tariffs or other penalties on competitors , and implementing favourable regulatory requirements " .
Once a politician has served his or her purpose , the relationship alters .
" Firms decrease their contributions to politicians who are expected to soon retire or change their affiliation from the committee that has jurisdiction over the firm 's operations , to the committee with no such jurisdictions " .
While this would suggest that politicians are selling themselves short , the study suggests " there may be other substantial hidden costs , above and beyond hard - money contributions " .
A possible translation of the above might be that gift vouchers , free flights and free accommodation in swanky hotels might be on offer .
It 's hard to imagine that happening in the UK , of course .
Few British quoted companies donate money directly to political parties any longer , although individual directors may do so .
The 2000 Political Parties , Elections and Referendums Act required shareholders to approve donations from listed companies , since when corporate donations have shrivelled .
More common is the corporate sponsoring of political events .
Would - be investors in US stocks should concentrate on the many generous companies in the defence , tobacco , automobiles and oil sectors , while avoiding forays into real estate and precious metals - they 're a stingier bunch .
Finally , while Republican candidates receive more corporate money , companies that fund Democrats enjoy the best returns .
A murky road , from Hitler to JFK
A long and murky relationship exists between politicians and their financial benefactors .
" From Indonesia and Malaysia to Italy , politically connected firms are more valuable than their less fortunate competitors , " say the authors of a paper , Betting on Hitler - The Value of Political Connection in Nazi Germany .
They found that " helping to undermine democracy at important junctures produced high returns " and companies with board members " known to favour the party ( or backing it financially ) outperformed the market by 6 % to 9 % " immediately after Hitler 's accession to power .
A 2006 research paper , looking at 157 announcements across 35 countries , found the market capitalisation of a firm increases by an average 2 % when a large shareholder enters politics .
A separate study found firms decline in value by 2 % when a legislator " connected " to a firm dies ( " connected " is defined as living in , or born in , the same city in which a firm operates ) .
Another paper analysed government bail - outs of financially distressed companies from 35 countries between 1997 - 2002 and found " politically connected firms are significantly more likely to be bailed out than similar non-connected firms " .
Most studies found that such market anomalies are even more noticeable in countries rife with corruption .
Brazil lived up to its reputation when Dutch scholars found that firms contributing the most money to federal deputies contesting the 1998 election experienced the highest stock returns after the election .
A 2001 study of Indonesian firms connected to the then ruling Suharto family found that announcements of the president 's declining health caused decreases in the firm 's market value .
While US corruption may not be as obvious as that seen in Suharto 's Indonesia or Hitler 's Germany , a paper entitled Friends in High Places : The Wealth Effects of JFK's Assassination on the Assets of LBJ's Supporters " indicates that political favouritism is not a new phenomenon .
Market reaction to the president 's death indicated that it expected " significant benefits to accrue " to firms connected to vice president Lyndon Johnson .
The authors go on to relate a joke that did the rounds during the duo's 1960 campaign .
Kennedy , a Catholic , tells Johnson that " when we get elected I 'm going to dig a tunnel to the Vatican " .
LBJ 's reply ?
" That 's OK with me as long as Brown & Root gets the contract . "
Antigua had hoped online betting would allow it to rely less on tourism
Antigua and Barbuda was awarded the right to impose sanctions that target US services , copyrights and trademarks .
Laws passed in the US in October 2006 effectively made it illegal for foreign internet gaming firms to trade there .
But in March the trade body delivered a final ruling saying that the US online betting ban was illegal .
Antigua had hoped to impose $ 3.4bn in retaliatory measures against the US and the amount awarded was described as a token gesture , given the massive size of the US economy .
The US said that Antigua 's claim was excessive and more than three times the size of Antigua 's entire economy .
" The United States is pleased that the figure arrived at by the arbitrator is over 100 times lower than Antigua 's claim , " said Sean Spicer , a spokesman for U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab .
Antigua , a former British colony of about 80,000 people , had been promoting electronic commerce as way to end the country 's reliance on tourism , which was hurt by a series of hurricanes in the late 1990s .
Piracy risk
The Caribbean nation is the smallest country to litigate a case successfully in the WTO 's 12 - year - history .
The case had drawn the attention of US industry because Antigua has threatened to target US trademarks and copyright , which could make the nation a safe haven for intellectual property piracy .
The ruling could " establish a harmful precedent for a WTO member to affirmatively authorise what would otherwise be considered acts of piracy , counterfeiting or other forms of ... infringement " , the US said .
The US and Antigua cannot appeal against Friday 's decision .
Mark Mendel , the lawyer who led the case for Antigua , said that the country was unlikely to violate US copyrights .
" Antigua does n't want to negate American intellectual property rights .
They do n't want to sell ... DVDs and copies of Microsoft Office . "
Unequal laws
Last year the US stopped US banks and credit card companies from processing payments to online gambling businesses outside the country , effectively killing off the market for overseas gambling firms .
About half of the world 's online gamblers are based in the US , and the market is estimated to be worth $ 15.5 bn .
The WTO ruling said the US was breaking trade law by targeting online gambling firms , without equal application of the rules to US firms offering online betting on horse and dog racing .
Earlier this week , the EU said the US would offer its member countries trade concessions as compensation for its refusal to lift internet gambling laws .
About a year ago , 54 Baha ’i youth were arrested in Shiraz , Iran , on charges of serving the poor in dispossessed areas surrounding the city by carrying out social - economic assistance .
It was announced that three of them , Raha Sabet , Sasan Taghva and Haleh Rouhi , were sentenced to prison for four years .
The remaining youth were sentenced to one - year imprisonment .
While according to laws in Iran these sentences are unenforceable , on Monday , November 19 , one of the governmental departments summoned the three named Baha ’i youth on the pretext that their personal belonging was to be returned .
However , upon arriving , instead they discovered that they were being arrested for dispatch to Adel - Abad Prison for the execution of their sentence of four years .
In a Jackson Heights shop for colorful saris and glittering bracelets , several women have gathered to meet with their banker .
They laugh and chat in Bengali .
Sultana , a 39 - year - old woman wearing a headscarf , hands him $ 128 in cash .
She is making her first repayment of the $ 3,000 , six - month loan she 'll use to help with her husband 's candy store .
Welcome to Grameen America , Muhammad Yunus 's brand - new microfinance venture .
Mr. Yunus , along with his Bangladesh - originated Grameen Bank , won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for battling poverty by lending out small sums of money to the poor .
The loans are mainly for income - generating activities -- from making baskets to raising chickens .
Since its establishment in 1983 , Grameen has given out billions of dollars in loans , helping to pull families out of poverty and inspiring similar operations all over the world .
Mr. Yunus has now brought Grameen to this borough of New York City .
Since taking off in January , Grameen America has lent out a total of $ 145,000 , with interest rates at around 15 % on the declining loan balance .
The money will be used for everything from taxi registrations to sewing machines .
I meet Josefina from the Dominican Republic , who has borrowed money to buy women 's accessories to sell .
Grameen works a little differently from your average American financial institution .
The Grameen banker comes to the borrowers , either in their homes or businesses .
Women borrowers take priority .
There is no need for collateral , credit - history checks , legalities or complicated paperwork .
Just credit , plain and simple .
ALBUQUERQUE – Oprah is on the way .
On Sunday , Oprah Winfrey is returning to the presidential campaign trail to headline a California event for Senator Barack Obama .
The Obama campaign has yet to announce details , but people familiar with the event say the television talk show magnate will join Michelle Obama at a campaign rally in the Los Angeles area .
The goal ?
Closing the gap with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in California before Tuesday ’s primary .
The target ?
Women voters .
It has been nearly two months since Ms. Winfrey made her debut on the trail , drawing tens of thousands of people to arenas in Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina .
Mr. Obama won Iowa and South Carolina , which aides attribute to the attention stirred by Ms. Winfrey .
( Particularly the landslide South Carolina victory . )
Ms. Winfrey has not played a role in Mr. Obama ’s television advertising campaign and has been out of the political spotlight since that weekend in December . , when she strode onto a stage in Des Moines , declaring : “ Oh my goodness .
At last , I ’m here . ”
“ I ’ve been in contact with her consistently , ” Mr. Obama said aboard his campaign plane the other day , “ and she ’s open to helping out in any ways that she can . ”
Today , Mr. Obama flew from California to begin the sprint to Super Tuesday , campaigning in New Mexico and Idaho , Minnesota and Missouri .
In a news conference in Los Angeles , Mr. Obama was asked why it appeared he was giving up on California , which holds the largest trove of delegates .
He smiled – not revealing the Oprah secret – and said : “ We ’ll see .
I do n’t share that view . ”
“ I think this is going to be very competitive , but we ’ve got 22 states , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ Just from a purely strategic perspective , I think everybody understands that if we are spending all of our time in one state and not spending time in the other 21 , then that might not lead to the most delegates .
And this is , frankly , a delegate race at this point . ”

OTTAWA  A training manual for Canadian diplomats lists the United States among countries that potentially torture or abuse prisoners .
The manual is an internal document of the Department of Foreign Affairs .
A spokesman for the foreign minister confirmed the contents of the manual after news reports about it circulated on Thursday .
The manual appears to contradict the public stance of Canada ’s Conservative government , which accepts assurances from the United States that it does not mistreat prisoners , including those at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba .
One Canadian , Omar Khadr , is being held there ; he was captured in Afghanistan in 2002 .
In an e-mail message , Neil Hrab , a spokesman for the minister of foreign affairs , Maxime Bernier , said the manual was “ not a policy document or any kind of a statement of policy ” and did not “ convey the government ’s views or positions . ”
Pentagon shipped ballistic missile parts to Taiwan
The Pentagon says it mistakenly shipped non-nuclear ballistic missile fuses to Taiwan .
Nose cone fuses for intercontinental ballistic missiles were shipped instead of the helicopter batteries that Taiwan had requested , the Pentagon said .
The fuses were mistakenly shipped from a U.S. Air Force base in Wyoming .
The fuses were shipped to Taiwan in 2006 and kept in a warehouse there .
The Taiwanese military informed the U.S. last week about their presence on the island .
The components were retrieved by the U.S. military and moved to a secure facility in the United States .
" This could not be construed as being nuclear material .
It is a component for the fuse in the nosecone for a nuclear system , " a spokesman said .
" We are very concerned about it . "
The spokesman said the matter is under investigation .
He said the Taiwanese authorities notified U.S. officials of the mistake .

I took liberty of copying it from Foundations of Mathematics Digest .
A post by Daniel Mehkeri :
Monsieur , x^p = x ( mod p ) , donc Dieu existe .
Repondez !
In _Constructivism in Mathematics_ , Troelstra and van Dalen
famously write ,
… we do accept that “ in principle ” we can view 1010 ^10 as a sequence of units ( i.e. we reject the ultrafinitist objection ) , and the authors are not sure that this is really less serious than the platonist extrapolation .
At least it needs arguments .
I would like to make such an argument .
I think it is new : at least , a shallow search fails to turn anything up where it ought to have been mentioned .
Ultrafinitism certainly gets discussed a fair bit
on FOM for instance , but I saw nothing in the archives about this , other than my own vague statement last May to the effect that modular exponentiation will be problematic for the ultrafinitist ,
which is what I would like to expand on .
THEOREM ( Fermat ) .
If p is prime , x^p = x ( mod p ) .
PROOF : Consider the set of all sequences of length p of symbols from an alphabet of size x .
Its size is x^p .
The number of distinct cyclic permutations of a given sequence divides p.
But p is prime , so either there are p of them , or just one .
In the latter case the sequence will consist of p repetitions of the same letter .
There are x distinct cases of this .
So the remaining x^p – x sequences are partitioned into orbits of size p .
So p divides x^p – x , so x^p = x ( mod p ) .
QED
This is a very nice proof .
But can it really be valid , except for small p ?
Consider the case of p=1031 , x=2 : we have to consider the set of _all_ binary sequences of length 1031 .
There would be far more sequences than Planck - time - by - Planck - volumes in the entire history of the observable universe from the big bang to the estimated death of the last star .
Some would call that mysticism .
Now , it might be thought there could be an alternate ultrafinitary proof .
Here is a reason to think otherwise : suppose for example Bounded Arithmetic could prove it .
Then we could extract a
polynomial - time algorithm which , given x and p such that x^p =/= x ( mod p ) , finds a non-trivial divisor of p .
But no such algorithm is known .
This is n’t definitive ( if I could _prove_ there was no
such algorithm , I ’d be rich ) but it is doubtful that any exist .
This does n’t just apply to BA and to the idea that feasibility means PTIME .
It is enough to know that there is no known algorithm for factoring large numbers which is feasible in any sense , while modular exponentiation is well within current technology .
We can easily code up a computer program to check that indeed x1031 = x ( mod 1031 ) for all 0 < =x < 1031 .

so that , by theology , we know p is composite .
But nobody knows a factor [ see Wikipedia , “ RSA Factoring Challenge ” ] . “ p is composite ” is a Delta_0 sentence ( Sigma^b_1 in bounded quantifiers ) , for which we have a constructive proof , but no known ultrafinitary proof .
Notice what happens .
Or rather , what does n’t .
For p < 32 , everything is just fine .
For p on the order of 210 , the proof is problematic because “ the set of all sequences of length p ” is too big .
But we can check all cases by direct computation .
For p on the order of 264 , the idea of even a single “ sequence of length p ” is now doubtful , being at the edge of current storage techonology .
And we ca n’t hope to check all cases .
But it is still feasible to directly check whether any given p is prime , and to check the equation for any given x , p pair in this range .
For p on the order of 22 ^ 10 , “ the set of all sequences of length p ” ought to be empty .
There are no such sequences in reality !
Yet we can still check any given x , p pair .
It is tricky to check whether a given p really is prime without circularly resorting to theological number theory .
But there are still ways to go about it .
In fact , there is already lots of evidence at this level , in that much of modern cryptography depends on Fermat ’s little theorem for numbers of this size , and it works !
Of course none of the above is statistically significant with respect to the Pi_1 theorem , but that ’s not the point .
The problem for ultrafinitism is , as I say , already Delta_0 : why should it be right even in most of these cases , never mind be infallible ?
( There is no probabilistic feasible algorithm to factor large numbers , either . )
Also , why is there no sign of the difference between feasible and
infeasible ?
Because from an ultrafinitist perspective , the numbers in these levels are qualitatively different .
Certainly our ability to check the statement changes drastically .
And yet , there is no hint of any
ontological change .
Nothing at all happens to Fermat ’s little theorem , even up to x^p = 22^210 .
The constructivist simply affirms that Elementary Recursive Arithmetic is TRUE ;
God made the integers , as Kronecker said .
The ultrafinitist has some explaining to do .
If these are just our collective delusions and meditations about entities that can’t exist in reality , then how to explain the very real computations ?

Marion und Folkert Knieper sind mittlerweile im Netz und auch darüber hinaus bekannt :
Mit teuren Abmahnungen fordern sie unaufhörlich von Website - Betreibern und Bloggern Lizenznachzahlungen , wenn diese unberechtigt Fotos aus Marions Internet - Kochbuch übernehmen ( c't berichtete ) .
In vielen Fällen sind diese Forderungen durchaus strittig und sorgen für Unmut in der Netzgemeinde .
Von einer " Masche " ist oft die Rede , bisweilen auch von " Abzocke " .
Das ARD - Magazin plusminus griff jüngst dieses
Thema auf .
Im Rahmen einer Verhandlung am Landgericht Hamburg verabredeten die Reporter ein Interview mit dem Fotografen Knieper , der seine Urheberrechte so vehement verteidigt .
Teile des Interviews wurden am 5 .
Februar im TV - Beitrag ausgestrahlt , das komplette Video ist auf der Homepage von plusminus abrufbar .
Deshalb dachte sich der bereits von einer Knieper - Abmahnung betroffene René Walter nichts dabei , ein Standfoto aus dem Film in sein nerdcore - Blog zu stellen .
Doch auch bei der Veröffentlichung seines eigenen Konterfeis versteht Knieper offensichtlich keinen Spaß : Bereits am 7 .
Februar erhielt Walter eine Abmahnung , formuliert von Kniepers Rechtsanwalt .
Für die Veröffentlichung des Knieper - Bildnisses habe Walter keine Genehmigung , ist da zu lesen .
Ohnehin habe das Bild keinen " Informationswert für die Öffentlichkeit " .
Das Interview habe einem " medialen Angriff auf meinen Mandanten und seine Unternehmung marions - kochbuch.de " geglichen .
Implizite Unterstellungen des Reporters vor laufender Kamera seien " eine psychische , emotionale Belastung " für Knieper gewesen " die sich in den Zügen seines von Ihnen verwendeten Bildnisses deutlich abzeichnet . "
Kurzum : Knieper sei entstellt wiedergegeben worden , erläuterte der Rechtsanwalt seine Sichtweise .
Für die Abmahnung verlangt der Anwalt nun 775,64 Euro Gebühren , resultierend aus einem veranschlagten Gegenstandswert von 10.000 Euro .
Weil Knieper durch Walter " gegen seinen Willen und grundlos in das Licht der Öffentlichkeit gezogen " und zum " Sündenbock " gemacht worden sei , stehe ihm eine Entschädigung von 3000 Euro zu , zahlbar bis zum 28 .
Februar 2008 .
Es handle sich schließlich um eine entschädigungswürdige Verletzung des Persönlichkeitsrechts .
Blogger René Walter hat bereits einen Rechtsanwalt beauftragt , um die Abmahnung abzuwehren .
Er werde vorerst nichts bezahlen , erklärte er. Das Knieper - Bildnis ersetzte er durch ein großes Smiley mit der Bildunterschrift " Folki , Symbolbild " .
Eine erste Nachfrage bei der plusminus - Redaktion habe bereits ergeben , dass das gezeigte Interview im Vorfeld abgesprochen gewesen sei und Knieper daher keinesfalls " unvorbereitet mit den Fragen des Reporters von Plusminus konfrontiert wurde " , wie er nun behauptet .

A 63 - year - old mathematician who worked as a labourer and night - watchman when he first migrated to Israel from Russia has solved a problem which has taxed the world 's leading experts in his field for more than a generation .
Avraham Trakhtman has ended the mystery of the Road Colouring Problem by proving the theory of a " universal map " which allows a journey to end at a certain destination whatever the starting point by following the same instructions .
Professor Trakhtman of Bar - Ilan University managed to jot down the proof in pencil on eight pages of paper .
In layman 's terms , the problem – in the field of symbolic dynamics – can be expressed as whether a man who arrives in a city without street names to visit a friend and telephones for help , could be given directions which would work wherever he was at the time .
The solution – which appears to defy logic but which mathematicians believe could have real - life applications in mapping and computer sciences – has excited widespread interest and admiration among Professor Trakhtman 's international peer group .

It is all the more remarkable since Professor Trakhtman , who came from Sverdlosk ( now Yekaterinburg ) in the Urals as a Jewish immigrant to Israel , has achieved the triumph of his career at an age well beyond that at which mathematicians are normally expected to reach their peak .
The Road Colouring Problem was originally posed in 1970 by Benjamin Weiss , an Israeli - American mathematician , and Roy Adler , who both worked at the computer giant IBM .
They posited that , given a finite number of roads , they could be depicted in a colour - coded map that would lead to the same destination regardless of the point of origin .
Around 100 experts , including the authors of the proposition , have attempted to produce a proof but all failed .
In a diagrammatic version of the conjecture – now a theorem thanks to Professor Trakhtman – a 16 - line graph forming one square and eight triangles , with the lines coloured red or green , includes two vertices , each representing different destinations .
Following the route " blue red red " repeated three times always leads to one , and following " blue , blue red " always leads to the other , whatever the starting point .
Stuart Margolis , who recruited Professor Trakhtman to Bar Ilan , near Tel Aviv , told Associated Press : " In math circles , we talk about beautiful results – this is beautiful and it is unexpected .
Even in layman 's terms it is completely counterintuitive , but somehow it works . "
Professor Margolis said that the discovery was all the more remarkable given Professor Trakhtman 's age and background .
" The first time I met him he was wearing a night watchman 's uniform , " he said .
Professor Trakhtman said that it took him a year to solve the problem .
But he insisted to AP : " The solution is not that complicated .
It 's hard , but it is not that complicated .
Some people think they need to be complicated .
I think they need to be nice and simple . "
Benjmain Weiss said that it gave him great joy to see someone solve his problem , adding that Professor Trakhtman 's solution " is something that is understandable . "
A pair of lion skulls excavated from the moat around the Tower of London and dating to the medieval period belong to an extinct subspecies of Barbary lion which died out in the early 1920s , a study has found .
An analysis of the DNA extracted from the skulls has found that both lions share the same genetic traits as the large subspecies which had distinctive black manes and once lived in the Morocco region of north - west Africa until it disappeared nearly a century ago .
The two skulls were first recovered from the Tower ’s moat during excavations in 1936 and 1937 but the precise geographical origin of the famous lions of the Royal Menagerie – first established by King John who reigned between 1199 and 1216 – was unknown .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
“ Until now we did n’t have any strong evidence that they were from North Africa .
There was no documentary evidence for instance .
They could have come from Asia or even from other parts of the Mediterranean , ” said Richard Sabin , curator of mammals at the Natural History Museum in London .
“ Lions are very charismatic large cats that have been imported into Europe for various purposes since early historic times .
We ’ve not known , however , until now the exact geographical origin of the animals found in London , ” Dr Sabin said .
“ Our results are the first genetic evidence to clearly confirm that lions found during excavations at the Tower of London originated in north Africa , ” he added .
Radiocarbon tests on the skulls show that one is dated to between 1280 and 1385 and the other is dated to between 1420 and 1480 .
Both were young males of about three or four years of age and could have been born in the Royal Menagerie at the Tower of London rather than been shipped directly from north Africa , Dr Sabin said .
“ Barbary lions were probably the largest of all the subspecies of lion .
They had very long , black , shaggy manes and would have been very imposing .
Visitors to the King would have had to pass through Lion Tower where the cats were kept in cages , ” he said .
Nobuyuki Yamaguchi , who carried out the genetic analysis of the lions ’ bones said that a contiguous population of lions once stretched from north Africa through the Middle East to India , until the growth of the Egyptian civilisation about 4,000 years ago divided the lions into separating breeding populations .
“ Western north Africa was the nearest region to Europe to sustain lion populations until the early 20th Century , making it an obvious and practical source for medieval merchants , ” Dr Yamaguchi said .
“ Apart from a tiny population in northwest India , lions had been practically exterminated outside sub-Saharan Africa by the turn of the 20th Century . ”
The Royal Menagerie was first established in Woodstock near Oxford before being relocated to the Tower of London .
The first residents were three leopards sent to Henry III by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in 1235 .
It later on housed a number of exotic animals and was effectively the private zoo of successive kings and queens until it was closed by the Duke of Wellington in 1835 and the contents transferred to Regent ’s Park to become London Zoo .
“ Although we have one of the best mammal collections in the world here at the Natural History Museum , few physical remains survive of the Royal Menagerie , ” Dr Sabin said .
“ Direct animal trade between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa was not developed until the 18th Century , so our results provide new insights into the patterns of historic animal trading , ” he said .
Google 's Plan To Penalize Advertisers Whose Websites Load Slowly Will Benefit Consumers And Google
from the now - less - irritating dept
News.com points out that Google is planning to measure the time it takes to load the target pages for its ads , and penalize ads that point to slow - loading pages in AdWords auctions .
Ads that point to websites that pop right up will be ranked above those that load like molasses .
I think this is not only a great idea , but a good illustration of why Google has been so successful in recent years .
As we 've noted before , one of Google 's great strengths has been its relentless focus on improving the user experience , even when doing so might not help the bottom line in the short run .
One of the ways Google does this with its ads is by prioritizing relevance over cost - per - click : Google shows you the ads it thinks you 're likely to click on before the ones with the highest bids .
The payoff for Google is that over time , people begin to subconsciously associate the Google brand with a fast , clean , efficient user experience .
Most user do n't specifically notice that Google 's ads are more relevant or its pages load a half - second faster .
They just begin to feel that Google sites are generally less annoying than other sites .
An extreme example of the opposite phenomenon is About.com , which I 've learned to avoid it like the plague ( despite the fact that it often has relevant information ) because every time I click on an About page my screen seems to fill up with pop -up ads .
Another example is mainstream sites like Forbes and Salon that make you watch a full - page ad before they 'll show you the content you asked for .
These policies goose revenues in the very short term , but at the expense of making it less likely that users will come back in the future .
In contrast , by giving preference to advertisers with quick - loading websites , Google will be ensuring that users who click on ads find the experience as painless as possible -- and therefore , more likely to click on ads in the future .

Tufts - New England Medical Center has taken measures to keep emergency room patients from chugging hand sanitizer in order to get drunk or injure themselves .
Corresponding with the Annals of Emergency Medicine this month , Scott Weiner said that the changes came after a 27 - year - old man poisoned himself by drinking a 15 - ounce container of Cal Stat antiseptic hand rub – twice during a two month period .
In the first incident , the young man had been admitted to the emergency department for abdominal pain .
When the staff left him unsupervised , the patient removed a bottle of the antibacterial liquid from a dispenser on the wall and downed it .
Since the liquid is mostly isopropanol , not drinking alcohol , he quickly became quite ill .
Doctors tried unsuccessfully to revive him with naloxone , a drug used to treat opiate overdoses .
As the situation worsened , his kidneys stopped working and he had trouble breathing .
Physicians intubated him and moved him to an intensive care unit .
At that time , his girlfriend indicated that her beau has a history of drinking rubbing alcohol .
Blood tests showed that she was n't kidding .
Two months later , after making a recovery and being released from the hospital , the same guy had done it again .
He had come back for more .
Just like the previous incident , he was admitted to the emergency room with complaints of abdominal pain .
When the doctors were ready to send the antiseptic addict home , he claimed to be suicidal .
True to his word , he removed another bottle of hand sanitizer from the wall and finished it off .
To prevent history from repeating itself , staff at the medical center replaced the dispensers with a different design that is hard to remove from the wall .
They were particularly concerned because similar incidents had happened elsewhere .
This February , the New England Journal of Medicine published two case reports of other men becoming intoxicated by hand sanitizer .
When a patient in Cincinnati , Ohio began giving off a sweet but unusual odor , his doctors ordered blood tests to measure the levels of rubbing alcohol and acetone in his blood .
Although defeat was a bitter pill to swallow for the doctors , their patient proved that hand sanitizer is not .
Before the test results were back , they found him drinking the antibacterial goo straight out of the dispenser on a bathroom wall .
In Baltimore , Maryland , a prison inmate was caught drinking from a gallon bottle of Purell .
To his credit , the jailbird had selected a variety of antiseptic gel that is composed mainly of drinking alcohol .
If the prisoner had taken the time to read the What 's Inside section of Wired , he might have realized that some of the other ingredients in his favorite germ - fighting cocktail were not meant for human consumption .
Even the former New York City Police Chief is now acknowledging that the 9/11 attacks may have been an inside job using controlled demolition of the buildings with bombs .
This FOX News pundit who had attacked 9/11 truthers in the past , has begun to doubt the official story .
. . . a wall is beginning to crumble . . . rapidly .
We Are Change , interviews Former New York Police , highly decorated detective , Bo Dietl , as he begins to doubt official story of 9/11
The truth of 9/11 being an inside job being perpetrated by elements within our government is beyond argument .
Richard Gage and Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth , David Ray Griffin , Professor of physics Steven Jones , former UL manager and whistleblower Kevin Ryan , and an endless list of researchers have proven the World Trade Center towers were a controlled demolition orchestrated after the planes hit the twin towers , and later in the WTC 7 building .
Plus , Michael C. Ruppert ’s work exposing the five War Games held on 9/11 , which made it impossible for the US Air Force and FAA to stop the attacks that day .
Ruppert also did the early research on the “ put options ” made against United and American Airlines the day before 9/11 , betting their stock would go down , and that one major stock bet was made at the known CIA connected financial institution , AB Brown Trust .

The BBC has engaged in a brazen cover up about their announcing WTC 7 ’s collapse 23 minutes before it occurred , when no one EXCEPT whoever told the BBC that building was coming down knew it .
The BBC has refused to tell who told them , and lamely pretended they have “ lost ” their required by law three archive tapes of their 9/11 coverage .
BBC REPORTER BIZARRELY REPORTS WTC 7 COLLAPSED 23 MINUTES BEFORE ANYONE IN THE WORLD KNEW IT WOULD ( EXCEPT THE CRIMINALS WHO ENGINEERED IT , WHICH THE BBC REFUSES TO TELL US WHO THEY ARE )
All this has led to recent events that are showing that the 9/11 lies are on their way to being exposed , including a former Prime Minister of Italy writing in Italy ’s largest newspaper that 9/11 was an inside job .

Followed by a Japanese Senator of Japan ’s main opposition party , claiming on national TV in Japan that 9/11 was an inside job , and a European Minister of Parliament agreeing with him .
Before that a former MI6 agent had made that charge , as well as Lt. Colonel ( rtd. )
Robert Bowman , and a long list of other high level military and intelligence experts , which have been compiled at the brilliant website PatriotsQuestion911.org .
DAVID RAY GRIFFIN with JAPANESE SENATOR YUKISH FUJITA AT EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT 9/11 TRUTH CONFERENCE :
These in turn have triggered a growing outcry from prominent citizens including American legend , Willie Nelson , who recently said 9/11 was an inside job .
He ’d been preceded by Charlie Sheen , Rosie O’Donnell , and Daniel Sunjata , the Tony Award winning actor of the TV series Rescue Me .
The powers that be see the writing on the wall , and their media minions have turned up the screeching shrill volume of their insanity of late .

( She was fired soon after ) :
WILLIE NELSON QUESTIONS 9/11 ON NATIONAL TV
However , that was just part of other outrageous government and media insanity regarding 9/11 and those who question it .
A few months ago Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harmon held Homeland Security Hearings , where a spokesman for the Simon Weisenthal Center made the libelous insinuation that Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth was akin to a Jihadist terrorist group , when he showed their website sandwiched in between Jihadist websites , while he spoke of hate groups that were dangerous .
WE ARE CHANGE APPEALS TO SIMON WEISENTHAL CENTER’S SLANDER OF ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS FOR 9/11 TRUTH
Of course the US corporate media ’s frantic hate - fest recently also turned on the Oscar winning French actress , who questioned the official story of 9/11 .
Yet , perhaps the most nauseating media seizure was Joe Scarborough on his hateful , anti-free speech , morning “ Morning Joe ” program on MSNBC , when he expressed a hope that a 9/11 truth activists at a Clinton rally be sent to an eastern European torture prison , and his brain - dead co-hosts giggled their vacuous approval for such a thing to happen , simply because an American exercised his free speech .
WATCH THIS WHOLLEY DISTURBING “ MORNING JOE ” SEGMENT
Why are they going insane ?
Because their six long years of covering up one of the most horrific false flag crimes in modern history , 9/11 , is coming undone .
A new feature film “ Reflecting Pool , ” is now showing at theatres nationwide .
The 9/11 truth documentary “ Loose Change ” has been seen by tens of millions worldwide , and is also showing in US cinemas across the country .
However , one recent development that must be shaking the foundation of the neocon thug ’s questionable sanity , is that the new truth telling historical fiction “ The Shell Game ” hit # 31 on the New York Times list , and its author has gone renegade , no longer listening to his media handlers admonitions about staying away from the 9/11 truth third rail .
” REFLECTING POOL ” FILM TRAILER
Steve Alten , author of the explosive “ The Shell Game , ” is now using his media appearances to challenge viewers and listeners to re-examine the official story of 9/11 , and telling them that when they do , they will realize we need a new investigation .
There is a storm brewing .
In Alten ’s prophetic novel he envisioned a US false flag attack on an American city to fool Americans into an oil conquest war with Iran .
The quickening of 9/11 truth permeating through our culture at an ever accelerated pace , is putting heavy pressure on the neocon outlaws in our government to create another false flag 9/11 event to distract us all from investigating 9/11 , and perhaps to even avoid the 2008 election .
The father of Reaganomics , Paul Craig Roberts , has written extensively offering a warning that this is his greatest fear .
" THE SHELL GAME "s BELOW VIDEO TRAILER CHARGES A WHITE HOUSE FALSE FLAG PLOT TO FOOL US INTO ATTACKING IRAN
The only thing that can save us is a mass awakening to the fact that 9/11 was an inside job , on a scale that would make it impossible for the neocons to create another false flag event to go into Iran .
How can we do it fast enough ?
What can we do ?
New York
Times best selling author , Steve Alten , who ’s put his career on the line because of his urgency to save his democracy , has linked his novel “ The Shell Game ” on amazon with David Ray Griffin ’s latest research book , “ 9/11 Contraditions : An Open Letter to Congress and the Press . ”
Griffin ’s book is a desperate appeal to government and media to ask 25 basic questions , where it is obvious we were lied to about the events of 9/11/2001 .
He uses only indisputable widely reported facts that can not be spun .
Alten linked his novel “ The Shell Game ” to Griffin ’s important work because Alten believes that it is critical that Griffin ’s work get out to a mass audience as rapidly as possible .
Since Alten ’s last works have reached the New York Times best seller list , and landed him on Good Morning America , etc. etc .
he feels compelled to use the popularity and power of narrative to bring millions of more eyes to 9/11 truths , like the ones Griffin has so painstakingly written .
Alten ’s fear of a false flag operation has increased , and this week , he offered to donate $ 5,000 to 9/11 first responders , for each week “ The Shell Game ” is on the top 10 of the NY Times best seller list .
Yes , he wants to help the first responders , but he ’s challenging those seeking 9/11 truth , the 36 % of Americans and the 9/11 truth movement to drive “ The Shell Game ” to the top 10 of the NY Times list , not only to help the responders , but to enable him to get on mainstream corporate media to spread the word of 9/11 truth .
He feels this is the only way to avoid a false flag event to get us into Iran , and perhaps even subvert our electoral process .
Time is of the essence , he has said again and again .
Only a week ago Alten went on CBS National Radio ’s Jim Bohannan Show , a conservative national program that airs on nearly 200 stations nationwide .
In that interview he stepped into the 9/11 truth circles , reading passages from his novel that were actual research notes , suggesting that Air Force fighters were deliberately moved out of the DC and NYC areas on 9/11 to enable the plane strikes .
He went on to point the finger at a high level FBI man who thwarted FBI investigations that would have stopped it .
But perhaps most alarming for the neocons involved in the 9/11 attacks , was Alten ’s insistence that World Trade Center 7 ’s collapse was the work of controlled demolition charges , which means that it had to have been an inside job .
A CLIP FROM ALTEN’S CBS NATIONAL RADIO INTERVIEW WHERE HE READS 9/11 TRUTH FACTS DIRECTLY FROM HIS EXPLOSIVE “ THE SHELL GAME ” novel .
http://theshellgame.net/interview.mp3
There is a race on . . . either we as a people out 9/11 truth very rapidly , or we allow it to drag out , and enable yet another false flag attack to be inflicted on our people , and see the Iranian people pay with their blood for our complacency , just as the Iraqi and Afghani people have continued to pay with their blood for the lies of 9/11 , and our complacency in allowing those lies to go unexposed .

As a scientist , I have always been cautious about alternative therapies — I would rather put my faith in conventional medicine , which has been put through numerous trials and research , and proven to work through
rigorous experiments .
And save for the occasional massage , I would certainly never spend my own money on alternative treatments .
Some
of my fellow scientists have even stronger views and dismiss it all as quackery .
Yet over the past few years , Britain has seen a dramatic uptake in alternative therapies .
I 'd always thought that the real reason these therapies " worked " for people who used them was simply because they were just very good at making the placebo effect work .

Meditation : A study has found people who meditate regularly are happier and less anxious
But having spent the past few months examining the scientific facts about hypnotherapy , reflexology and meditation — three of the fastest growing therapies in the UK — I 'm beginning to understand their appeal .
Take meditation , for instance .
Not so long ago , I would have said sitting around cross-legged for hours , reflecting on goodness knows what , would be a pretty futile exercise .
Yet it 's said meditation can help with many things , including depression and anxiety , as well as helping us feel more content and leaving us better able to think .
In search of the truth , I travelled to the foothills of the Himalayas , where I learned basic meditation from a Buddhist monk called Matthieu Ricard .
He has been called the " happiest man in the world " and has been meditating for 30 years .
Ricard believes meditation changes the way you experience every moment of your life , reducing anxiety and boosting compassion .
And after meditating with him , I definitely felt calmer and more at ease .
In my own life , over the past few years , I 'd made a point of sitting down quietly for 20 minutes a day on my sofa , listening to music , simply to have a break .
It suddenly struck me that what I 'd been doing was n't dissimilar to meditation .
And while Ricard 's views could
sound like mumbo jumbo , his theories are increasingly being given weight by science .
At the Laboratory for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin - Madison , Professor Richard Davidson has carried out a study where he has seen significant changes in brain activity when people meditated .
Those in his study also reported feeling less anxious and happier .
Likewise , Dr Herbert Benson , who works at the Massachusetts General hospital in Boston , has studied a myriad of different types of meditation and their effects on the body , and concludes that they produce a deep form of relaxation which he calls The Relaxation Response .
When I visited him , I was hooked up to several machines which measured my stress levels , including my pulse , the tension in my muscles , my breathing rate , even the sweat on my skin .
I was told to sit quietly for ten minutes , so my pulse rate when resting could be measured .
I then had to undertake a simple meditation exercise , during which my pulse and breathing rate actually went below my
normal level at rest .
It was clear that meditating had caused physical responses in my body .
Dr Benson believes the regular elicitation of the relaxation response can help with a whole range of medical conditions in which stress plays a role , such as asthma , infertility and diabetes .
Although this link between stress and illness is n't fully understood , scientifically this is not an unreasonable link to make .
At the same hospital , neuroscientist Sara Lazar is also getting some intriguing results looking at meditation 's effect on neuroplasticity — which is the ability of the brain to change structure as it learns new tasks .
Neuroplasticity occurs when we learn to juggle or play a musical instrument .
In these instances , parts of the brain actually thicken , which shows the brain is , growing new connections .
Lazar has also found the cortex of the brain — which governs thought processes — are thicker in people who meditate regularly compared to non-meditators .
To see if this is actually down to meditation will require more research , but the potential implications are exciting .
For example , in the elderly , the cortex is known to thin and shrink , so meditation might slow down the effects of growing old .
I made similarly exciting findings when I looked into hypnotherapy .
It 's a therapy I 've long considered pretty wacky , but I did unearth some rather compelling work by Professor Irving Kirsch from Hull University .
He used an MRI scanner to monitor the brain when people were told , under hypnosis , to imagine seeing a black and
white picture in colour .
They were also monitored as they did the same thing while not hypnotised .
He found that , when hypnotised , the subjects activated the parts of their brain that would be active if they were in fact seeing colour .
But when they were in a normal state , this area was not activated .
But my natural cautiousness about alternative therapies seemed to be well - founded when it came to reflexology .
To heal a range of ailments , practitioners apply pressure to different areas of the feet which are considered by reflexologists to be a mirror image of the body itself .
An anatomist told me the " foot map " used by reflexologists has no anatomical basis .
Professor Leslie Walker from Hull University has found that reflexology helps breast cancer patients relax and so improves their quality of life — but he found no significant differences between the results for reflexology and head massage .
This made me wonder whether there could potentially be benefits from massage and touch , rather than from reflexology per se .
So I looked at what we really know about massage , and found , to my surprise , that the answer is not very much .
By the end of all my explorations , I was left with more questions than answers .
But there is no doubt that certain studies in this field are yielding results which made me — and possibly even the most sceptical of individuals — take stock when it comes to the value of alternative therapies .
I 'll certainly be adding meditation into my daily routine from now on .

There have been emotional scenes in Federal Parliament , where Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has delivered his long - awaited apology to Australia 's Stolen Generations .
Mr Rudd turned and applauded members of the Stolen Generations in the public gallery after delivering an emotional address to the House of Representatives in which he spoke of the " profound grief , suffering and loss " experienced by Australia 's Indigenous people .
The House rose as one to applaud Mr Rudd 's speech .
Parliament also applauded the speech given by Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson but the hundreds of people who were gathered in the Great Hall and outside on the lawns of Parliament House gave him a hostile reception .
Many in the Great Hall began by booing and jeering , then turning their backs on the big screens carrying Dr Nelson 's address .
Some walked out in protest during Dr Nelson 's speech .
In Federation Square about three - quarters of the crowd turned their back on Dr Nelson .
Mr Rudd opened proceedings by offering an unconditional apology to the Stolen Generations , talking about tens of thousands of children separated from their families and repeating the word " sorry " on three occasions in the formal apology .
He called on the Opposition to join in a ' war cabinet ' to deal with Aboriginal housing issues and matters of constitutional change and spoke of moving into the future with " arms extended " rather than with " fists still raised " .
Dr Nelson used his speech to warn against judging actions of the past by the standards of the present and said it was correct that no compensation was being offered , because he said no money could compensate for the hurt inflicted on those removed from their families .
' We say sorry '
Addressing a packed House of Representatives this morning , Mr Rudd said the Parliament apologised for laws and policies which had " inflicted profound grief , suffering and loss on these our fellow Australians . "
" For the pain , suffering and hurt of these Stolen Generations , their descendants and for their families left behind , we say sorry , " he said .
" To the mothers and the fathers , the brothers and the sisters , for the breaking up of families and communities , we say sorry .
" And for the indignity and degradation thus inflicted on a proud people and a proud culture , we say sorry . "
As Mr Rudd was speaking hundreds of people had gathered outside Parliament House to watch events unfold on big screens .
" We the Parliament of Australia respectfully request that this apology be received in the spirit in which it is offered as part of the healing of the nation , " Mr Rudd continued .
" For the future we take heart ; resolving that this new page in the history of our great continent can now be written .
" We today take this first step by acknowledging the past and laying claim to a future that embraces all Australians . "
" ... A future where all Australians , whatever their origins , are truly equal partners , with equal opportunities and with an equal stake in shaping the next chapter in the history of this great country , Australia . "
Mr Rudd says the apology is being made to " remove a great stain on the soul of the nation .
" The time has come , well and truly come , for all peoples of our great country ... all Australians , those who are Indigenous and those who are not , to come together , to reconcile , and build a future for our great nation . "
' Sheer brutality '
Mr Rudd told the chamber the moving story of one member of the Stolen Generations , taken from her family in the Northern Territory .
He spoke of the " sheer brutality " of separating a mother from her children , which he described as " a deep assault on our senses and our most elemental humanity " .
In an attack on the government of John Howard , he said it had treated the Stolen Generations with a " stony , stubborn and deafening silence for more than a decade " .
" [ There was ] a view that we should look for any pretext to push this great wrong to one side , " he said .
" To leave it languishing with the ... academics and the ' cultural warriors ' , for who the Stolen Generations are little more than an interesting sociological phenomenon .
" But as of today the time for denial is at last come to an end . "
Fair go
Mr Rudd says reconciliation is a reflection of a core tenet of Australian society : the concept of a fair go for all .
" For our nation , the course of action is clear ... and that is to deal now with what has become one of the darkest chapters in our nation 's history . "
" In doing so , we are also wrestling with our own souls .
" As Prime Minister of Australia , I am sorry .
On behalf of the Government of Australia , I am sorry .
On behalf of the Parliament of Australia , I am sorry .
And I offer you this apology without qualification . "
Mr Rudd said he hoped today 's apology would open a new era in Australian history .
" We have had sufficient audacity and faith to advance part way to that future , with arms extended rather than with fists still clenched , " he said .
" Let us allow this day of national reconciliation to become one of those rare moments in which we might just be able to transform the way in which the nation thinks about itself .
" For the nation to bring the first two centuries of our settled history to a close ... and embrace with awe these ancient cultures which we are blessed , truly blessed to have among us . "
Mr Rudd 's speech was greeted with prolonged applause from both sides of the House and from those gathered outside .
Good intentions
Responding to the motion , Dr Nelson warned against judging actions of the past by the standards of the present day .
" Each one of us has a duty to understand what has been done in our names , " he said .
" Our responsibility , every one of us , is to understand what happened here .
Our generation does not own these actions .
Nor should it feel guilt for what was done , in many cases , with the best intentions . "
Speaking of the early settlers who founded the modern nation of Australia , and the Indigenous people they encountered , he said : " We cannot from the comfort of the 21st century begin to imagine what they overcame - Indigenous and non-Indigenous - to give us what we have and make us what we are . "
And he referred to Opposition unease about the use of the word " Stolen " .
" Many Australians are hurt by accusations of theft , in relation to their good intentions , " he said .
" None of us should bring a sense of moral superiority to this debate . "
Like Mr Rudd , Dr Nelson recounted the story of a member of the Stolen Generations .
Speaking of a child taken from her father , he said she did not want people to say " sorry " to her .
But she wanted people to understand the enormous pain the separation caused her .
And he said there should be no monetary compensation because no compensation fund could erase that pain .
Dr Nelson pledged his " unconditional support " for Mr Rudd's ' war cabinet ' proposal .
" This is far , far more important than anything that would normally divide us , " he said .
And he finished his address by saying : " As one people , we are sorry " before shaking hands with Mr Rudd across the dispatch box .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China has added ghosts , monsters and other things that go bump in the night to its list of banned video and audio content in an intensified crackdown ahead of the Beijing Olympics .
Producers have around three weeks to look through their tapes for “ horror ” and report it to authorities , the General Administration of Press and Publications said in a statement posted on the government Web site .
Offending content included “ wronged spirits and violent ghosts , monsters , demons , and other inhuman portrayals , strange and supernatural storytelling for the sole purpose of seeking terror and horror , ” the administration said .
The new guidelines aim to “ control and cleanse the negative effect these items have on society , and to prevent horror , violent , cruel publications from entering the market through official channels and to protect adolescents ’ psychological health . ”
The regulations suggest China , where graphic , pirated sex and horror movies are available on most street corners , is keen to step up its control of the cultural arena ahead of the Beijing Olympics in August , which are widely seen as a coming - out party for the rising political and economic power .
They come just weeks after Beijing clamped down on “ vulgar ” video and audio content , slapped restrictions on Internet sites and handed down a two - year film - making ban to the team behind the steamy “ Lost in Beijing . ”

In what is being described as the first attack over the internet to cause immediate direct physical harm , hackers have caused an unknown number of epileptic sufferers to suffer seizures by hacking into an epileptic support forum and leaving flashing animation screens .
The flashing screens , made with javascript code , would then adversely affect those suffering from pattern - sensitive epilepsy or photo - sensitive epilepsy ( I also suffer from a strain of it ) .
This means that if the eyes are exposed to rapidly flashing lights for a prolonged period of time , the brain reacts violently and sends the body into a seizure .
The risk becomes even higher if the flashing lights are in a darkened room such as a nightclub or a cinema ( you may have seen cinemas warning epileptics about strobe lighting in movies )
Circumstantial evidence has responsibility pointing to a group that seemingly has a beef with scientologists ( Edit : After further investigation , we believe that the culprits were not who everybody though to be responsible at first … everybody points their finger at everybody else , and it ’s not our position to determine who did it .
Please note that WIRED , which usually is a reliable news source , reported the story first ) .
But it ’s one thing to have an argument with a religious cult .
It ’s quite another thing to target a group of people with a medical disability and provoke traumatic and terrible seizures in their head .
I am trying to be impartial about this but being a fellow epilepsy sufferer myself , I am shaking at the moment with deep anger .
I am currently going round several other epilepsy support groups online that I am involved with to see if anything has been going on there as well .
Is this a co-ordinated attack or a one - off deal ?
It ’s essential to know .
Who in their right mind gets off on making people convulse uncontrollably ?
If they could just realize for a moment what a seizure actually involves and if they were to experience one themselves , they would n’t be so cavalier about inflicting that hurt on others .
A new program in Orange County has the locals squicking out over a supposed “ toilet - to - tap ” program .
The program takes treated sewer water , runs it through the same reverse osmosis process that bottled water companies use to purify their artesian ( or tap ) water , and then injects it into a deep aquifer that provides water for Orange County .
The idea is to recycle as much of the water as possible and , in the process , reduce the water needs of a very arid and highly populated region of the country , southern California .
The problem is that a lot of locals are going “ ewwwwwww ! ” at the process of drinking water that was once in someone ’s toilet .
What these residents do n’t realize is that nearly every drop of water they ’ve ever drank was once someone ’s , or something ’s , toilet .
In every respect , the Earth ’s biosphere is a marvel of recycling .
Plants convert carbon dioxide and sunlight into energy and oxygen .
Animals eat the plants ( and other animals ) and breath the oxygen .
And all living things expells wastes into the environment , including people .
In our case , our respiration expels carbon dioxide , we sweat as a means of internal temperature control , and we excrete urine and feces .
It ’s a pretty basic physics or chemistry calculation using really big numbers to determine that every time we inhale , we probably inhale some small number of atoms ( < 10 ) that were exhaled by someone famous 10 years ago or longer .
Similar calculations can show that some amount of the water we drink would have once been part of someone else 's sweat , or of cow urine , or fish feces .
It 's almost guaranteed by the laws of probability .
But it 's actually simpler and more direct than that .
According to the Municipal Water District of Orange County ( MWDOC ) , the county gets half of its water from Northern California and the Colorado River .
Counting just four major towns or cities above the Colorado River Aqueduct along the Colorado River ( Las Vegas , St. George , Green River , and Grand Junction ) , the number of people whose treated sewage is dumped into the river is about 2 million .
Which means that the people of Orange County are already drinking water that came “ toilet - to - tap ” by way of the Colorado River .
All water is fundamentally contaminated by things that make people sick .
Bacteria , heavy metals , molds , dead plants and animal bits , feces , all of it is in every drop of untreated water .
This is , in fact , the very reason that every drop of water we drink is filtered and chemically treated in water treatment plants – to make the water safe to drink in the first place .
It ’s also the reason that you hear about people being told to boil all their water after a flood backs up sewage treatment plants – boiling kills off the dangerous bacteria and breaks down the viruses that make us sick with diseases like giardiasis and cholera .
It ’s interesting that the MWDOC is re-injecting the treated water into the aquifer – that ’s not necessary , and it adds an expensive step to the process .
It would be cheaper , and probably safer , to connect the treated sewer water directly to the drinking taps .
That way you do n’t run the risk of dissolving too many minerals into the water and the water would n’t have to be treated yet a third time when it ’s pulled out of the aquifer .
I understand why many residents of Orange County would go “ ick ” when thinking of drinking water that once contained feces or urine – they ’re ignorant of the fact that they already do .
And drinking bottled water does n’t fundamentally change the fact that the water that ’s been reverse - osmosis treated still was once drank and excreted by any number of people and other animals before it was bottled for their consumption .
But do n’t worry – the United States has one of the best water treatment systems in the world , so while you ca n’t set yourself apart from the natural world and the “ ickiness ” therein , you can drink your sparkling clear sewer water secure in the knowledge that it ’s safe to drink .

HONG KONG ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Amid wisps of steam and the aroma of freshly baked egg tarts , the tea masters at Hong Kong ’s Golden Phoenix Cafe brew large pots of the city ’s famed milk tea , using “ pantyhose ” stuffed with tea leaves .
“ The tea is superb , smooth and fragrant , ” said one veteran tea brewer known as Fatty Ming , in describing Hong Kong ’s “ Pantyhose ” milk tea -- a drink born in the east - west melting pot which reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997 .
The drink , a Chinese take on English tea - drinking traditions , is brewed in a long cotton “ sock ” or filter resembling a beige pantyhose , rather than a female undergarment itself .
Over the decades , pantyhose milk tea has become a city - wide institution , craved daily by regular Hong Kongers as well as film stars and tycoons who flock to the city ’s best tea -diners .
“ The tea is strong and if it ’s well brewed , you feel a great comfort , ” said Brenda Lo , a self - confessed milk tea addict .
The blend of Indian and Sri Lankan tea leaves , strained repeatedly over 10 to 20 minutes , makes it difficult to prepare oneself .
“ You need experience to do this , not everyone can do it , ” said Fatty Ming , pouring the dark liquid into six large teacups .
EGALITARIAN HAUNTS
While Paris has cafes and New York its diners , Hong Kong has its “ cha chaan teng ” or tea - diners , where pantyhose milk tea is served in often unpretentious and raucous surroundings .

“ Every city has certain foods and drinks which reinforce its identity and Hong Kong is fortunate to have pantyhose milk tea , ” said Craig Au Yeung , a Hong Kong food writer .
At the famed Lan Fong Yuen tea -diner in the Central financial district , where pantyhose milk tea was supposedly invented in the 1950s , it is n’t unusual to see a whole cross-section of Hong Kong society mingling happily over a milk tea and a snack .
Hong Kong ’s leader Donald Tsang recently said : “ I like nothing more than popping into a cha chaan teng ( for a cup of milk tea ) . ”
Hong Kong - born Hollywood star Chow Yun - fat is also known to drop by in his flip - flops for a hit of the steaming brew .
“ You get film stars , the rich , black people , white people , and they all sit together on the same table , talking their talk , ” said Lum Chun-yip , boss of the no-frills Lan Fong Yuen .
“ This is a place where there are no divides .
It ’s a common classless place ...
This is Hong Kong ’s greatest specialty , ” Lum added of the city ’s egalitarian teahouse tradition .
MILK TEA STILL “ BIG BROTHER ”
While China has a great tradition of tea drinking , it was Hong Kong ’s early British colonial administrators who first introduced the territory to drinking Western - style tea , mixed with milk , over a century ago .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
“ Some say Hong Kong ’s pantyhose milk tea origins probably arose from areas near British army barracks , where the tradition of having afternoon tea spread to local villagers , and then to the community at large , ” said Au Yeung , the food writer .
Despite the global rise of coffee culture as propagated by the likes of Starbucks , Hong Kong ’s milk tea tradition and tea diners remain an integral part the throbbing city ’s urban fabric .
“ It ( coffee ) has n’t really toppled pantyhose milk tea ’s reputation and stature as “ big brother ” , said Au Yeung .
“ People wo n’t forget about milk tea just because coffee is more popular , I do n’t think it ’ll die down .
No way , ” he added .
Others say the gruff waiters and working - class ambience of pantyhose milk tea haunts are as important as the drink itself , and carry a quintessential Hong Kong vibe that other places lack .
“ You can talk as loud as you like ( in the tea - diners ) and no one will complain , ” laughed Pallas Ng , a bank clerk .
“ Starbucks is too quiet .
We prefer louder places , ” she added .
Scientific literature has been littered with studies over the past 40 years documenting the superior language skills of girls , but the biological reason why has remained a mystery until now .
Researchers report in the journal Neuropsychologia that the answer lies in the way words are processed : Girls completing a linguistic abilities task showed greater activity in brain areas implicated specifically in language encoding , which decipher information abstractly .
Boys , on the other hand , showed a lot of activity in regions tied to visual and auditory functions , depending on the way the words were presented during the exercise .
The finding suggests that although linguistic information goes directly to the seat of language processing in the female brain , males use sensory machinery to do a great deal of the work in untangling the data .
In a classroom setting , it implies that boys need to be taught language both visually ( with a textbook ) and orally ( through a lecture ) to get a full grasp of the subject , whereas a girl may be able to pick up the concepts by either method .
The team was able to pinpoint the differences between the sexes by monitoring brain activity in a group of children ( 31 boys and 31 girls , ranging in age from nine to 15 ) using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) while the kids tackled language tasks .
In the exercises , two words were either flashed in front of , or spoken to them ; they had to determine whether the pair was spelled similarly ( omitting the first consonant , as in " pine " and " line " ) and whether the words rhymed , such as " gate " and " hate " or " pint " and " mint . "
In some cases , the words fit neither criterion : " jazz " and " list " being an example .
Study co-author Doug Burman , a research associate in Northwestern University 's communication sciences and disorders department , says the team saw greater activity in the so - called language areas of the girls ' brains than in those of the boys .
The areas included the superior temporal gyrus ( implicated in decoding heard words ) , inferior frontal gyrus ( speech processing ) , and the fusiform gyrus , which helps spell and determine the meaning of words .
Activation of the latter two structures , in particular , seemed to correlate with the girls ' greater language accuracy .
" For girls , it did n't matter if they heard the word or read the word , " Burman says .
" It does suggest that girls are learning [ language attributes ] in a more abstract form , and that 's the ideal objective when we 're teaching things . "
Burman says that his team now plans to research whether girls ' edge decreases with age , noting that some previous research suggests that the male sensory " bottleneck " may disappear as boys develop into adults .
Spitzer 's mouthpiece has his own secrets to hide Peter Lance

As the sex scandal hurricane engulfed Eliott Spitzer last week , one of his closest advisors at the eye of the storm was Dietrich  Dieter Snell .
An ex U.S. Attorney from the same office conducting the prostitution probe , Snell is now defending Spitzer in the  Troopergate scandal and reportedly raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for the international law firm he joined last year .
A former Southern District prosecutor who later became Senior Counsel to the 9/11 Commission , Snell is also one of the ex Feds who rewrote history in the Commissions  Final Report by relying entirely on the tortured confession of 9/11s purported mastermind to pinpoint the origin of the planes as missiles plot .
Hes the same investigator who dismissed as not sufficiently credible  the testimony of a decorated Navy Captain who was part of a secret data mining operation that uncovered evidence of 9/11 hijackers in the U.S. more than a year before the attacks .
A former Deputy Attorney General under  the Sheriff of Wall Street ,  Snell is now attempting to quash the subpoenas of investigators probing whether Spitzer misused state troopers to investigate his chief political rival , protecting his ex boss and mentor with a separation of powers  defense worthy of Dick Cheney .
Despite Spitzers sudden flameout , there are currently three separate probes pending of Troopergate , the scandal that erupted when Spitzers aides reportedly used State Police to investigate the travel expenses of Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno .
The New York Daily News estimated that while the initial use of state resources to benefit Bruno was $ 72,000.00 , the cost to the taxpayers of defending Spitzer , who refused to cooperate with the New York A.G.s office , could amount to $ 1.54 million .
And $ 400,000 of that figure will probably go to Snells law firm .
But from this reporters perspective it is Dieter Snell himself who ought to be in the hot seat answering questions , not about a petty state corruption probe but questions that go to the heart of the greatest mass murder in U.S. history : 9/11 .
It was just four years ago Saturday , March 15th , 2004 , when Snell led me into a windowless conference room at 26 Federal Plaza , the building that houses the FBIs New York Office ( NYO ) .
It was then the temporary New York quarters of the 9/11 Commissions staff .
Months earlier , Commission Chairman Gov.
Tom Kean had read my first investigative book for HarperCollins , 1000 Years for Revenge , which presented probative evidence that Ramzi Yousef , mastermind of the first WTC bombing in 1993 , had designed  the planes  operation as early as the fall of 1994 in Manila and that his uncle Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ( KSM ) had merely carried out the plot after Yousef was captured in February of 1995 .
Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - IA ) , one of the top FBI oversight lawmakers on the Hill , had read the book and pronounced it a must read for the FBI , Congress , the 9/11 Commission and anyone whose job it is to protect national security ,  so Gov. Kean directed Commission Executive Director Philip Zelikow to arrange for my testimony .
Cherry Picking the Evidence But I was cautious .
A source I had on the Commission staff told me that Zelikow and staffers on both side of the aisle were cherry picking  the evidence , in an effort to remove Yousef , from the 9/11 scenario .
Why ?
Because as Id reported in 1000 Years , the FBIs NYO could have stopped Yousef in the fall of 1992 while he was building the 1,500 pound urea nitrate - formaldehyde device that he detonated on the B - 2 level below the Twin Towers on February 26th , 1993 , killing six and injuring 1000 .
It was a plot directly funded by al Qaeda and tied to the cell around blind Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman .
If the Bureaus elite Joint Terrorism Task Force had simply done its job and stopped Yousef then , he would never have executed the first attack on the Towers or escaped New York the night of the bombing to commence the 9/11 plot from Manila , half a year later .
1000 Years For Revenge contained probative evidence suggesting that prosecutors in the SDNY  including Dietrich Snell  had received evidence from the Philippines National Police ( PNP ) in early 1995 that , if acted upon , would have tipped the Feds to the 9/11 plot six years earlier .
Snell had prosecuted Yousef in 1996 for Bojinka , a non suicide plot to blow up airliners over the Pacific that was separate from the planes as missiles scenario , and as I saw it , he should have been called before the 9/11 Commission as a witness , testifying under oath about what he and other SDNY officials knew of this second suicide plot involving airliners .
The Fox and the Chicken Coop Instead , Snell was given a senior Commission leadership role and put in charge of determining the single most important conclusion in the Commissions investigation : the origin of the plot .
Without knowing precisely when the plot began , no U.S. officials could be held accountable for failing to stop it .
So four years ago , when I learned that Snell would take my testimony ,  I was properly skeptical .
Also , my source had warned me that despite the televised public Commission hearings , and the appearance of transparency , more than 90 percent of the witness intake to the Commission had been anecdotal and unrecorded .
So I prepared my testimony  ahead of time .
In the presence of an FBI agent assigned to the Commission staff , Snell sat across from me at a conference table .
There was no stenographer or recording equipment present .
The sandy - haired former AUSA took out a small spiral notebook and began to take notes as I read my statement .
Because I was writing a second book on the failures of the Feds on the road to 9/11 , and because Snell had played such a key role in the prosecution of Yousef , I ended up asking him as many questions as he asked me .
I wanted to know why he had flown over eleven PNP officials to testify at the Bojinka trial but not Col. Rodolfo B. Mendoza , the top PNP investigator who had interrogated Yousefs partner Abdul Hakim Murad , a pilot trained in four U.S. flights schools .
It was Murad who was to have been the original lead pilot of the plot  the role later assumed by hijacker Mohammed Atta .
I wanted Snell to answer why he and other SDNY Feds had kept the hunt for KSM secret for more than two and a half years , only quietly passing his name to the press in January of 1998 when the plot was well underway , when they had arrested Yousef , his nephew , via a very public $ 2 million rewards program that had caused one of Ramzis cohorts to rat him out . 
Why not use the same method to capture his uncle KSM who was executing the planes operation ? 
 That s Classified 
But each time I asked a question , Snell would smile and say ,  That s classified  or  I cant discuss that .
At the end of my testimony I told him I would send along the transcript of my March 19 , 2002 interview with Col. Mendoza , which documented Yousefs creation of the planes - as - missiles plot in 1994 .
I had evidence from the PNP that Yousefs Toshiba laptop , passed on to the CIA in January of 1995 , contained the full blown  9/11  plot , including seven targets : the WTC , the Pentagon , the White House , CIA headquarters , the Transamerica and Sears Towers , and an unnamed nuclear facility .
But as it turned out , that was evidence that Snell , as an alumnus of the SDNY , did not want to hear .
Why ?
Because it corroborated the findings of the PNP that Ramzi Yousef was the architect of the 9/11 attacks and that , in turn , put blood on the hands of the FBIs NYO for failing to stop him back in 1992 .
Given Snells apparent bias , I sent the additional evidence directly to Commission co-chairman Tom Kean .
In a cover letter , I asked him to make sure that it was a part of the permanent Commission record .
But when the Commissions final report was published , that evidence was flushed  reduced to a single footnote that didnt even mention Col.
Mendoza by name , even though he was the investigator who had first uncovered Yousefs suicide - hijack plot .
Rewriting History
In the Commissions final Staff Statement # 16 , largely authored by Snell , the Commission removed Yousef from the planes as missiles plot and supported the fiction that the plot didnt even begin to germinate until 1996 , well after Yousefs capture .
The new finding , per Snell , was that KSM merely pitched  the idea to Bin Laden in 96 but it didnt get a green light from the Saudi billionaire until 1998 .
Worse , Snell and the staffers based their evidence for the origin of the plot entirely on the word of KSM , who we now know was subjected to waterboarding and torture in his interrogation .
Taking the sole word of KSM on the origin of the plot was a bit like taking the word of David Berkowitz for when he committed his first  Son of Sam murder .
But as the primary author of Staff Statement # 16 , the Commissions last word on the plot origin , thats what Dietrich Snell decided to do .
To this day , KSMs questionable testimony has served to define the official record on the origin of the 9/11 plot , even though Snell himself admitted under oath , at the March 2005 German trial of an al Qaeda suspect , that he himself had never met Khalid Shaikh , that hed merely submitted questions to KSMs interrogators , and that he ( Snell ) had no control over how or even whether questions were asked .
Back on the Ides of March , 2004 , as I left 26 Federal Plaza , I had no idea that a group of Army investigators in the year 2000 had been on a parallel investigative track to mine .
But Snell would soon reject their evidence as well .
Discrediting the Able Danger Findings
In the early winter of 2000 , a multi-million dollar data mining operation funded by the U.S. Army uncovered evidence that Mohammed Atta and three other 9./11 hijackers were present in the country months before the 9/11 Commission would conclude theyd arrived , thus making a number of U.S. agencies , including the FBI , culpable for their failure to stop them .
In the fall of 2003 , Lt. Col .
Anthony Shaffer , a key player in what had been termed Operation Able Danger , told 9/11 Commission Executive Director Philip Zelikow of the Operations stunning findings during Zelikows visit to Afghanistan , where Shafer had been hunting bin Laden with Task Force 180 .
By July 12th , 2004 as the Commission was wrapping up its investigation on the origin of the 9/11 plot , one of Shafers Able Danger colleagues , Capt .
Scott Phillpott , met with a top Commission leader to corroborate Shafers findings .
The senior counsel he met with was Dietrich Dieter Snell .
Like Tony Shaffers account , Capt .
Phillpotts input about the al Qaeda connections to the New York cell of Sheikh Rahman would have defied the spin that Snell and the Commission staff had decided to sell .
Phillpott was a Navy veteran who had previously commanded three ships , a decorated veteran with immense integrity and reliability as a witness .
But after the meeting , Snell spurned Phillpotts evidence on the hijackers U.S. presence , and not a word of it showed up in the final Commission Report .
Nothing more might have come of it until August of 2005 , when the New York Times broke the story of how tens of thousands of pages of Able Danger evidence had been ordered destroyed in March of 2000 .
The scandal grew , and by mid February 2006 the House Army Services Committee called Snell to testify .
Spitzer KOs Snell Appearance
But on the day of the hearing , February 15th , 2006 , it was learned that Eliott Spitzer himself had intervened with the Committees counsel to keep Snell from having to account under oath for his dismissal of the Able Danger evidence .
Citing Snells heavy workload in New York , Spitzer got him a pass from having to testify .
During his tenure on the 9/11 Commission , pushing the origin of the plot forward to 1996 and ignoring the Able Danger evidence werent Snells only lapses .
As Larisa Alexandrovna pointed out in a RAW STORY piece on February 28th , citing Phil Shenons recent book , The Commission , Snell also seemed to defy his own staffers who wanted to explore the Saudi governments ties to Omar al - Bayoumi .
Al - Bayoumi was the San Diego based Saudi defense contractor whose company had multiple contracts with Prince Sultan , the father of Saudi Arabias then U.S. ambassador Prince Bandar .
The flamboyant Bandar was so tight with the Bush family that over the years hed earned the nickname  Bandar Bush . 
As reported in Triple Cross , Bayoumi played host to two of the 9/11 muscle hijackers , al - Midar and al - Hazmi , who flew AA # 77 into the Pentagon on 9.11 :  using their own names , al - Midhar and al - Hazmi jetted from Bangkok to Los Angeles on January 15th .
There they were met by Omar al - Bayoumi a Saudi , suspected of being an intelligence officer , who had visited the Saudi consulate in L.A. the same day .
After three weeks the two would - be hijackers moved to San Diego , where they lived openly for the next five months .
During that period al - Bayoumi helped them get settled , finding them an apartment across from where he lived .
It was later reported by Newsweek and the Washington Times that al - Bayoumi may have been the recipient of funds sent to his wife indirectly from Princess Haifa bin Faisal , wife of the then - Saudi ambassador to the U.S. , Prince Bandar .
In fact , new information from declassified FBI files as reflected in Ms. Alexandrovnas account for RAW STORY shows that al - Midhar and al - Hazmi were living in a residence rented by al - Bayoumi from the day they arrived in California ; not weeks later as reported in the 9/11 Commission Report .
With respect to Snell 's possible knowledge of the Saudi connection , Ms. Alexandrova writes : Bayoumi moved to London in 2001 and lived there until his arrest immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks .
Following his release , Bayoumi returned to Saudi Arabia , where he was interviewed in October 2003 by the Executive Director of the 9/11 Commission , Philip Zelikow , and Senior Counsel Dieter Snell .
Snell did not respond to requests for comment ; Zeilkow could not be reached .
According to Shenon , several staff members working under Snell , felt strongly that they had demonstrated a close Saudi government connection ,  based on explosive material on al - Bayoumi and Fahad al - Thumairy , a shadowy Saudi diplomat in Los Angeles . 
Shenon recounts how Snell , in preparing his teams account of the plot , purged almost all of the most serious allegations against the Saudi government and moved the explosive supporting evidence to the small print of the reports footnotes .
( The Commission , pp. 398-399 )
Two commission investigators who were working on documenting the 9/11 plot , Michael Jacobsen and Raj De , argued that it was crazy to insist on 100 percent proof when it came to al - Qaeda or the Saudi regime .
In the end , however , and with a publishing deadline looming , Snells caution and Zelikows direction buried apparently promising leads .
Entering Private Practice On April 30th , Snell left his job as Deputy Attorney General to join the law firm of Proskauer Rose , which has offices in seven U.S. cities as well as Paris , London and Sao Paulo .
Within months , the firm had been retained by Spitzers office to defend him in the Troopergate scandal .
Last July , New York Attorney General Cuomos office issued a report finding that Spitzers staff had acted improperly but not illegally .
But the Senate Committees probe is ongoing along with an investigation by the states Public Integrity Commission .
Also , after closing his inquiry into Troopergate last year , Albany District Attorney David Soares has reopened it .
On Thursday Snell charged Soares with continuing on a fishing expedition and acting as grand jury and grand inquisitor .
It was an ironic use of the term .
Elliott Spitzer prosecuted Wall Street white collar crime with the same venom he used on call girl services and high - end pimps .
Using the Attorney Generals office as a state - based strike force against local , state , even national corruption , he redefined the modern day inquisition .
As Governor , he apparently saw himself in the same role .
Last year he reportedly told Assembly Minority leader James Tedisco that he was a fucking steamroller who would roll over 
Tedisco and anybody else .
Steamroller or Sheriff , we now know that Spitzer also redefined the term hypocrisy .
On Tuesday after the New York Times broke the call girl story , Dietrich Snell , with a few key advisors , was reportedly holed up in Spitzers Fifth Avenue co-op working on the damage control .
In defense of Spitzer , and reportedly billing the public for his hours , he continued the spin in court on Thursday .
Disgraced and out of office , its time that Spitzer made a full accounting of his public sins along with his private ones .
In the process , his loyal retainer and counsel Dietrich Snell needs to come clean as well .
The trade paperback of TRIPLE CROSS will be published by HarperCollins in May .

Police were not guarding the embassy at the time
Protesters broke into the US compound in Belgrade and briefly set part of the embassy alight .
Firemen later found an unidentified charred body inside .
Other embassies , including the UK's , were also targeted .
The UN Security Council condemned the attacks .
The violence followed a peaceful rally by at least 150,000 people in the city .
Most Serbs regard Kosovo as their religious and cultural heartland .
Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica delivered an impassioned speech condemning the territory 's secession .
[ Violence ] only keeps Kosovo distant from Serbia ,
President Boris Tadic
In pictures : Belgrade rally
" As long as we live , Kosovo is Serbia .
Kosovo belongs to the Serbian people , " he told the flag - waving crowd .
Later about 1,000 protesters smashed their way into the US embassy , throwing flares through the window while others scaled walls to rip down the US flag .
At the time there appeared to be no police protecting the embassy , but riot police later intervened , firing tear gas .
' Mob attacks '
The fires raged for half an hour , and when firemen finally managed to get inside the building they found a charred body .
The main rally outside parliament was peaceful
White House spokesman Dana Perino said the embassy had been " attacked by thugs " and that Serbian police had not done enough to stop them .
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the US had warned Mr Kostunica and his foreign minister that it would hold them personally responsible for further damage .
Mr McCormack added that the protesters had entered the chancellery but had not breached the embassy 's secure area .
Smaller groups later targeted the Croatian , Turkish and British embassies but were beaten back .
In New York , the UN Security Council condemned what it called " mob attacks " on US and other embassies in Belgrade .
In a unanimous statement , the council recalled the inviolability of diplomatic missions under international law , but welcomed steps by Serbian authorities to restore order .
Kosovo ' stolen '
Serbian President Boris Tadic appealed for calm .
Serbia , supported by Russia and China , says Kosovo 's Sunday declaration violates international law .
During Thursday 's rally , ultra- nationalist leader Tomislav Nikolic accused the US and EU of trying to steal Kosovo .
" Hitler could not take it away from us , and neither will today 's [ Western powers ] . "
After the speeches , the crowd marched to the city 's biggest church , the Temple of Saint Sava .
Thick , black smoke had also earlier billowed from the crossing point at Merdare , 50 km ( 30 miles ) north - east of Kosovo 's capital Pristina , as Serb army reservists tried to enter Kosovo .
KOSOVO PROFILE
Population about two million Majority ethnic Albanian ; 10 % Serb Under UN control since Nato drove out Serb forces in 1999 2,000 - strong EU staff to take over from UN after independence Recognised by US , UK , Germany , Italy and France Not recognised by Russia , Spain , Slovakia , Cyprus Nato to stay to provide security
Country profile : Kosovo
Tense confusion on border
" We are here in support of the Serbs who still live in Kosovo , " Dejan Milosevic , one of the organisers , told the Associated Press news agency .
The Kosovo police , backed by Czech troops from the Nato - led peacekeeping force , put a steel barrier across the road and were able to hold their line .
Protest rallies were also held in the Bosnian Serb republic ( Republika Srpska ) .
There were unconfirmed reports of injuries as several hundred protesters clashed with police outside the US consulate in Banja Luka .
In the coming weeks , an almost 2,000 - strong EU mission will be deployed to help Kosovo develop its police force and judiciary .
' 40 - 50 People in Line ...4 of 8 Machines Not Working ... Poll Workers Didn't Offer Paper Ballots ... Get Rid of These Diebold Machines and Get Something That Works !'
Declares one Buckeye Voter
Switch to Paper Ballots Reportedly Going ' Exceptionally Well ' in Cuyahoga ( Cleveland ) , So Far , According to New Election Director ...
Brad Friedman Byon 3/4/2008 , 3:41 pm PT
The ever - necessary caveat : Most problems and failures with election systems do n't fully begin to reveal themselves until the night of , and , more often , the days and weeks following the elections .
That said , this from RAW STORY 's compilation article of various reports of trouble so far today , coming out of Ohio ...
Dayton Daily News was
In southwest Ohio , thewas collecting voters ' tales from the voting booths on Tuesday .
Most voters reported a pleasant experience , although some trouble persisted .
" About 40 - 50 people in line and 1 of the voting machine were down , " one commenter wrote .
" Waited to 7:00 AM and the line did n’t move 3 more machine went down , now 4 0 f the 8 machine not working .
The poll worker did n’t offer paper ballot and seemed overhelmed by the process .
Let get rid of these Diebold machines and get something that works !
I will be back tonite to vote , hope the machines are working by then . "
" The district I am in had a line the full length of the gymnasium and there were 4 voting machines down that had been report[ed ] 1 1/2 [ sic ] before but no one had been there to look at [ them ] , " said a commenter from Beavercreek , Ohio .
" I talked to several people in line , and everyone seemed to be enthusiastic . "
On the other hand , for some good news --- at least for now --- Cuyahoga County ( Cleveland ) 's new Election Director Jane Platten reports that things were going well there so far today , in the county which has been the center of much controversy for a number of reasons , not the least of which was its recent switch from Diebold touch - screen machines to paper ballots to be scanned at the county by ES&S machines .
As of noon today , Platten said things were going " exceptionally good " and that all precincts had been able to open on time .
For a change .
In Dayton 's Montgomery County , where the report of Diebold touch - screen machine failures above comes from , things are not going quite as well ...
Montgomery uses unverifiable Diebold touch - screen voting machines , unless voters are smart enough to exercise their right to demand paper ballots , and the poll workers are willing to give them to them .
As taken from the posted reports at the Dayton Daily News web page , ( Dayton is the county seat , just north of the Cincinnati metro area ) , more problems with Montgomery 's Diebold machines , along with some registration issues , follow below ...
From " kmdawson " ...
The sign saying optical ballots was placed where it would n’t be seen until the voters were leaving the room .
I would have asked for one , especially since only one machine was working , and when the poll workers called for help with the machines , all they could get was a recording that the voice mail box had not been set up yet !
From " Englewood voter " ...
I had a small problem this morning .
Because I wanted a paper ballot instead of the electronic machine card ( which can be hacked ) , the poll worker in Englewood wanted to mark me down as a “ Provisional ” ballot voter on the register even though I showed my proper ID .
I told her that was NOT correct .
I was polite , but firm in my insistence that I be put in the register as a true registered voter , not a Provisional .
After she called the Board of Elections , she confirmed that I was correct .
From " Lillian Lowe " ...
In Vandalia got there just a little after the polls opened .
Of the approximately 10 voting booths they had only two were operational .
After waiting , someone did show up and get them up and running .
From " Julie " ...
Vandalia - I bought a house 3 years ago and have voted in every election for the last 17 years .
Once again , they did not have my name listed and I was forced to vote provisional rather than registered .
I went through the same thing during the last election and was told it would be taken care of .
It was very frustrating .
I can only hope my vote will count !
From " Sashwen " ...
( Cross Community Church ) .
The poll people told me to choose a party and then said “ no , choose the x because it is more private that way , you do n’t have to tell us anything . ”
The machine only gave me options for the tax issues , and it asked me about printing or submitting I asked where the candidates were ??
told me not to worry about it and submit , it would show up after .
So I closed out .
Complained again .
Told to fill out paper ballot that “ wo n’t count ” to fix .
no one can fix .
no vote .
no fair .
From " Kellie " ...
I voted in Belmont .
Only one machine was working out of 5 .
Took me 20 minutes until I could vote with about 4 people in front of me .
A guest post from Shooting Editor and Shotguns Columnist Phil Bourjaily
This video shows what must be the world ’s largest shotgun shell : the 120 mm canister round designed for the cannon of an M1 Abrams tank .
The 50 pound shell contains 1150 .40 caliber tungsten pellets launched at 4500 fps , with an effective range of 500 yards .
What ’s fascinating to me is that you can see clearly that the shot charge of the canister round behaves exactly like a load of shotgun pellets .
As the round leaves the muzzle , the pellets at the front of the pattern encounter air resistance and begin to peel off and fall behind the main charge , opening the pattern and forming a shot string .
The pellets to the rear of the shot column draft behind the leaders , retaining velocity and moving to the front .
The canister flies with the pattern for quite a ways ( our light plastic shotcups have petals that open open and slow the cup quickly ) .
Eventually , though , the poor aerodymic shape of the canister causes it to slow down , and you can see the trailing pellets catching up and passing it in flight .
The last shot shows how much the pattern opens up at long range as the shell decapitates every one of a row of targets that must be 30 yards across .
Given the price of tungsten , I can only imagine how much the three shells fired in this video must have cost .
Best not to think about it ; just click “ play ” and enjoy the sight of your tax dollars flying downrange .

Yesterday at 3:45 in the morning , some juvenile - minded idiot on a bicycle placed a military surplus ammo box containing a small explosive device in front of the Armed Services Recruitment office at 43rd Street in Times Square .
This exploded causing the glass door to the office to break .
There was no other damage except to the door .
No one was hurt , but the noise was loud enough to get people 's attention ; one British tourist described it as " a loud bang . "
The response by the Government was predictably extreme .
Immediately , officials closed Times Square to all traffic , vehicular and pedestrian .
They also shut down all subway access to the Times Square Subway Station , a major hub station serving some 16 subway lines .
This shutdown lasted some three hours , precisely the height of the morning rush hour , affecting hundreds of thousands of commuters .
The Government wasted no time to exploit this event , and explain their over - reaction .
At 9:20 AM , Mayor Michael Bloomberg staged a demonstration of state power and competence .
He had a press conference and brought out all the high brass : NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly and a phalanx of bureaucrats from the Governors office , the FBI , and Homeland Security — this last item for you Germans out there translates , roughly , into Geheime Staats Politzei .
Now , first let me disclaim strenuously the act of this moron .
Even if he were motivated by an antiwar sentiment , with which I agree , his actions are unacceptable , and counterproductive to the cause of anti-violence .
Using violence — even an innocuous home made device no more powerful than a cherry bomb or M - 80 firecracker — endorses violence in order to make the political statement that the US Government is wrong to use military violence .
This is a moral contradiction .
I denounce this as I denounce other stupid demonstrations such as : silly bumper stickers , retarded rhyming chants , and moronic placards .
These techniques do n't educate , nor do they persuade people towards the protesters cause .
Most likely they alienate potential converts .
These methods are no substitution for rational argument .
However , given the poor state of learning and intellectual discourse in these United States , I understand the tendency to express oneself using mindless gimmicks .
Therefore , in the spirit of the times , the Zeitgeist for you Germans , I offer my own little non-violent gimmick .
I offer to translate Mayor Bloomberg 's press conference for the untutored .
I offer to turn Leviathanspeak into ordinary English .
MAYOR BLOOMBERG :
At approximately 3:45 this morning there was a small explosion outside the military recruiting station … here in Times Square , the Crossroads Of The World .
TRANSLATION : Some crank or college student  who opposes the US Government squandering trillions of dollars on war , causing anti-US hatred abroad and economic ruin within  used some black powder , or other commercially sold chemicals , or some fireworks to break the window of a high - profile military showcase installation in Times Sq .
NOTE : The use of the term " Crossroads Of The World " is gothamspeak for Times Square .
This must be explained etymologically .
Americans are a provincial people ignorant of the outside world .
Its principal city is especially provincial ; peopled by fauna who barely recognize the visible world outside their tiny archipelago save Hollywood , Connecticut , Washington DC or possibly Paris or London .
Therefore they regard their largest city intersection as being the crossroads of the world , much like Easter Islanders regard themselves as being the Navel of the World .
MAYOR BLOOMBERG : The Fact that this appears deliberately directed at the recruiting station insults everyone of our brave men and women in uniform stationed around the world fighting to defend our freedoms that we hold so dear .
TRANSLATION :
The men and women of our military have been euchred by their Government , and if they knew the truth they would be insulted .
In order to prop up our post - 1971 fiat dollar as a global reserve currency , and to further our massive debt - ridden false prosperity , we must enforce the sale of petroleum in US dollars .
Therefore we must maintain , by force , US Global Hegemony , especially in the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea regions .
But this does not sound as good as defending our freedoms from terrorists .
The fact that others in the world are justified in hating our projection of force , and hate our Government , might have a negative propaganda effect on the overworked young men and women of our armed forces in the over 800 military bases worldwide who bought into the Freedom & Liberty dogma and are starting to question it .
MAYOR BLOOMBERG : I want to direct this to those who are watching in this country and around the world .
New York City is back and open for business !!!
Traffic is flowing through Times Square … the subways and trains are running again !!!!!
TRANSLATION :
To those who live in countries where real terrorist bombs explode , killing scores of people , we in New York have survived an M - 80 attack and have fixed the glass door .
We are not afraid .
The subways , buses , and traffic that were never impacted by the minor blast are now running again , after a lengthy delay because the Government has decided that commerce may continue without obstruction .
MAYOR BLOOMBERG : Whoever the coward was that committed this disgraceful act on our city will be found and prosecuted to the full extent of the law .
TRANSLATION :
We will use all our vast power to get this lousy stinking S.O.B for revealing the Mighty American State to be a paper tiger scared of lone guys on bicycles with small explosives .
We do n't want the American people to guess that the State can't protect them against real terrorists with real explosives .
MAYOR BLOOMBERG :
We will not tolerate such attacks .
Nor will we let them destroy our freedom to live safely in the greatest city in the world .
TRANSLATION :
This is the greatest city in the world because we live here , and New Yorkers are better than other Americans .
The fact that you think your country is better or your people freer , or that your city has cleaner streets , better transportation , more polite people is irrelevant .
In order to keep our illusion of moral , intellectual , and economic superiority , we must have cops armed with stun guns and automatic weapons , we must have spot checks , we must search our citizens , with dogs if necessary .
We do this because we believe in Liberty and Freedom .

The Best of A.D Lelong
Did they consider a fig leaf ?
The Victorians made one for Michelangelo 's David , and I 'm sure someone could have come up with a version to protect the modesty of both Cranach 's Venus and the delicate sensibilities of travellers on London 's Tube trains .
Two days ago , Transport for London suddenly reprieved the goddess of love , who had earlier been banned from advertising the Royal Academy 's forthcoming exhibition of the work of the 16th - century German artist .
It followed a similarly abrupt change of mind over a poster for a dance show in which a muscular naked man clutches a cuckoo clock in front of his genitals .
This is n't the first time a female nude has been censored in this country .
A few years ago , a poster for Opium perfume featuring the model Sophie Dahl in an odalisque pose was removed from advertising billboards , no doubt saving the lives of hundreds of drivers who were so unfamiliar with female anatomy that they would otherwise have crashed their cars .
I do n't know how many times I need to point out that not every single image of a naked woman is exploitative ; I loved the Opium poster and I love Cranach the Elder 's pale nudes , especially the one TfL apparently considered offensive .
She 's wearing nothing but jewellery and holding a wisp of gauze , neither embarrassed by her nakedness nor showing it off ; the image is n't even as overtly sexy as Kylie in one of her stage costumes or Victoria Beckham on just about any day of the week .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
That , I suspect , is the problem .
We 're so used to pornified images of women , pouting from the covers of men's magazines or writhing on MTV , that a naked woman who does n't fit into those categories is disturbing .
Venus 's unadorned , surgically unaltered beauty is an unfamiliar sight these days ; Cranach would have been bored by WAGs and movie stars , who appear to have been cloned in some factory in Hollywood or Essex .
The idea that the poster is offensive is risible , but it also says something about a society that is balanced precariously between the chasms of exploitation and puritanism .
We live in a frankly sexual culture whose images of scantily dressed women are irritating not because they involve nudity – most of the time they do n't – but because they 're intended to satisfy basic male appetites , regardless of the fact that a lot of men do n't actually like them .
At the same time , religious groups are making increasingly noisy demands that their taboos should be observed by the rest of us , which may be what TfL had in mind when it explained the thinking behind its short - lived ban on the Cranach Venus : " We have to take into account the full range of travellers and endeavour not to cause offence in the adverts we display . "
Avoiding offence to the millions of people who use the Tube every day is a patently absurd ambition , and any attempt to fulfil it is bound to result in the kind of baffling , inconsistent decision - making we 've just seen .
The last thing we want is a situation in which minorities ( or assumptions about minorities , which is even worse ) are allowed to dictate what is n't acceptable to the wider population .
Many of us do n't like the coarse attitudes to women and sex that have invaded contemporary culture .
We do n't like the way Premiership footballers behave at parties , the huge commercial sex industry or the fact that about 11 per cent of the male population use women who work as prostitutes .
But that 's an argument against sexual exploitation , not against celebrating the human body .
Fig leaves and their modern equivalents are always products of fear , not respect for women .
In December , the Army formally released its counterinsurgency manual , supervised by Gen. David Petraeus .
The next month , Petraeus took control of American forces in Iraq — and promptly threw large chunks of the manual out the window .
( More on that , in next month ’s WIRED magazine . )
Fred Kaplan has perhaps the most vivid example yet of this defenestration :
The uptick in American airstrikes , since Petraeus slid into the commander ’s chair .
Here ’s an recent one , from Karmah , Iraq …
According to the manual , " an air strike can cause collateral damage that turns people against the host - nation government and provides insurgents with a major propaganda victory .
Even when justified under the law of war , bombings that result in civilian casualties can bring media coverage that works to the insurgents ’ benefits …
For these reasons , commanders should consider the use of air strikes carefully . "
But , as Kaplan notes , from January to September of this year , according to unclassified data , U.S. Air Force pilots in Iraq have flown 996 sorties that involved dropping munitions .
By comparison , in all of 2006 , they flew just 229 such sorties — one - quarter as many .
In 2005 , they flew 404 ; in 2004 , they flew 285 . "
In other words , in the first nine months of 2007 , Air Force planes dropped munitions on targets in Iraq more often than in the previous three years combined …
On Sunday , U.S. soldiers were searching for a leader of a kidnapping ring in Baghdad ’s Sadr City .
The soldiers came under fire from a building .
Rather than engage in dangerous door - to - door conflict , they called in air support .
Army helicopters flew overhead and simply destroyed the building , killing several of the fighters but also at least six innocent civilians .
( The bad guy got away . )
In other words , though the shift means greater safety for our ground troops , it also generates more local hostility .
Striking urban targets from the air inevitably means killing more innocent bystanders .
This makes some of the bystanders ’ relatives yearn for vengeance .
And it makes many Iraqis — relatives , neighbors , and others watching the news of the attack on television — less trusting of the American troops who are supposedly protecting them .
Now , as the cliche goes , no plan survives enemy contact .
And there ’s no reason that Petraeus should be held to following every letter of the manual .
But it is interesting to note the disparity .
UPDATE : Colonel Steven Boylan , Petraeus ’ public affairs officer , disagrees with just about every letter and punctuation mark in this post .
" To start , to say that Gen Petraeus has thrown out the book is false and totally mischaracterizes the facts .
No other way about it , " he e-mails DANGER ROOM .
" If you go back to the COIN [ counterinsurgency ] manual , you will [ n ] ote that he states clearly that sometimes the best ammunition is in fact , ammunition .
That does not contradict nor intimate that he has thrown away the manual .
Just the opposite .
It is following the manual as the manual allows for and includes the use of force at the appropriate time . "
In this video you will see Mohammed Ramazan , who came within a few moments of blowing himself up during an attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul earlier this year , allegedly gunning down at least two people before he was captured .
Ramazan ’s views and his lack of remorse for his actions are clearly those of a deeply disturbed young man with only a tenuous grip on reality .
But he is also a creation – or a perversion – of Afghanistan ’s mullahs and Taliban commanders , who took an uneducated Pakistani with almost no knowledge of the Koran and told him to kill in the name of Islam .
One evening in early January , Ramazan and a young Afghan called Farouk , both wielding AK - 47s and wearing explosive vests , approached the front gate of Kabul ’s Serena Hotel .
The Serena is the country ’s only five - star hotel , popular with expat diplomats and NGO workers , and is a symbol of the international community ’s efforts to rebuild the country – precisely why the Taliban had targeted it .
Both Ramazan and Farouk had attended a three - day training course in Pakistan ’s lawless northwestern mountains a few months before .
Their Taliban handlers had showed them maps of the hotel , indicating optimum places to attack .
They were told that the Serena was filled with foreigners who were raping and torturing Afghans .
Neither man had been to school , although both had attended madrassas in Pakistan where their study of the Koran was steadily subverted by anti-American brainwashing , including video presentations of Guantanamo prison and Abu Ghraib .
Neither man speaks Arabic nor has read the Koran in its entirety .
That January night , as the two men approached the hotel , they thought they were defending the Muslim world against the worst kind of abuse .
The reality was altogether sadder and more grim .
They rapidly gunned down the four startled guards outside and forced their way into the inner courtyard of the hotel .
Farouk then detonated his suicide vest , killing himself .
Ramazan approached the hotel ’s gym , where he allegedly killed a Western contractor and journalist , before taking off his explosive vest and attempting to flee .
“ God told me it was n’t my time to die , ” Ramazan told me .
I lived through a suicide bombing when I was reporting in Iraq , so I ’ve experienced what some of the survivors of these attacks go through : the initial confusion and adrenaline , followed by anger and guilt .
On the night of the Serena bombing , I remembered that feeling again .
I had arrived in Afghanistan only a week before , and had been contemplating visiting the hotel that evening .
Instead , I arrived half an hour after the attack to find a chaotic scene , with Afghan police clearing the road for a steady stream of ambulances .
I was able to speak to one ashen - faced businessman who had been in the hotel during the attacks , as he was being escorted from the building .
“ Who would do such a thing ? ” he said simply to a pack of Afghan journalists before being led away to a nearby car .
The man ’s shocked comment reminded me that in reacting to suicide bombings , we tend to view the individuals who commit these crimes in broad strokes : as embodiments of pure evil , as sociopaths following a perverted view of Islam .
But when I met Ramazan earlier this month in a Kabul prison , two months after the attack , he was n’t quite that .
He was emaciated , nervous , and unable to really grasp his situation .
The answers he gave to my questions will never be fully satisfactory .
No matter what explanations one could craft for his behavior – and in this video you will hear his own sad mixture of naivete , ignorance and fanaticism - there is an insurmountable gulf of understanding here .
He is likely to face a death sentence later this year .
It was the Bush Administration which after September 11 , 2001 , overrode morality , and made methods of torture " common " .
It was the Bush Administration which - so as to give itself the " flexibility " to use methods previously defined as torture - covertly redefined torture as " extreme acts " which resulted in " death or organ failure " .
Now , finally , after years of standing idly by , Australia is taking a stand .
Four years after the Howard government refused to ratify the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Torture , the Rudd Government is moving to sign up Australia .
It is also considering introducing legislation outlawing torture under the Commonwealth Criminal Code .
The Attorney - General , Robert McClelland , says he will soon talk to the states and territories about ratification .
It is necessary to bring them into the process as , under the Optional Protocol , member nations must establish a system of international and national visits to places of detention - jails , immigration detention centres and psychiatric institutions - many of which are run by state and territory governments .
In March 2004 , a joint parliamentary committee dominated by members of the former government declared there was " no immediate need " for Australia to ratify the protocol .
The argument made by proponents in favour of ratifying the protocol - that it would set an example on human rights to the region - was " not a compelling reason by itself " to sign .
Australia was " already regarded as a leader in human rights standards " , the majority said .
Some leader .
As scandal after scandal broke in the US - the photographs of naked prisoners leashed like dogs at Abu Ghraib , the secret memorandums from the highest levels of the Bush Administration authorising interrogators to work outside the Geneva Conventions and use a raft of inhumane tactics against detainees - what did Australia do ?
We had an attorney - general , Philip Ruddock , opine : " I do n't regard sleep deprivation as torture . "
We had a prime minister , John Howard , agree with an interviewer in 2002 - five years before political pressure forced a backflip by his government - that it was " fair " that David Hicks be held " indefinitely without bail " at Guantanamo Bay .
And we had a government defend again and again the farcical military commissions set up by the Bush Administration in Cuba , deliberately outside the purview of US domestic law , which allowed among other things evidence gained under torture to be used to convict detainees .
These are the same military commissions where the Pentagon has recently announced it is seeking the death penalty against six Guantanamo Bay detainees .
Evidence against at least one of those prisoners , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , an alleged September 11 plotter , is said to have been procured using the notorious " waterboarding " technique perfected during the Spanish Inquisition .
( Waterboarding is where detainees are made to believe they are drowning to get them to talk . )
Torture has been around a long time .
It tends to resurface during times of renewed security threat .
Think of the Algerian War in the 1950s and ' 60s , when the French army tortured opponents , or techniques used by the British against the IRA during the 1970s .
At times of crisis or fear , the unthinkable becomes possible .
A constitutional expert , Professor George Williams , says as a result of policies pursued by the Bush Administration , " We 're now in a position where the use of torture is more acceptable than it was before 9/11 . "
But torture does n't work .
According to professional interrogators , it is unnecessary , and produces false confessions .
Look at the interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
The New Yorker reports that he has claimed a role in more than 30 criminal plots .
It is known much of this is questionable .
And torture creates more terrorists .
The use of torture places our armed forces , whom the Geneva Conventions try to protect against mistreatment in the event they are ever captured , at risk .
It demeans all of us who purport to believe in democratic values based on human dignity and the sanctity of the individual .
And it usurps the moral authority of the state which uses it .
There are indications that Australia is waking up to these truths .
Mark Thomson , the secretary - general of the Association for the Prevention of Torture , based in Geneva , which has lobbied the Rudd Government to sign the Optional Protocol , told the Herald that all that human rights organisations have been struggling for over the past 50 years has been challenged by what has happened since September 11 , 2001 .
But on the positive side Thomson says it has been an " important wake - up call " for both the public and organisations like his to guard against complacency .
" Protecting human rights is a constant struggle . "
The chart above shows the fall of the US dollar against the Euro over the last eight years , with some key events in American politics and economics noted , which may or may not be seen as causes or effects of the falling dollar .
Consider , for example , the link between wealth and personal attractiveness .
Everyone wants a home in a safe neighborhood with good schools , but those with low incomes can not be sure of getting one .
So economists are not surprised that women mention earning power at or near the top of the list when surveyed about traits they find attractive in men .
Gatsby understood that his humble station in life made him an unlikely suitor for his coveted Daisy .
And so he labored with singular focus and determination to achieve material success on the grandest scale possible .
The theory of compensating wage differentials helps illuminate a particular detail of this quest .
This theory holds that the more unpleasant and risky a job is , the more it pays .
Some of the largest pay premiums , it turns out , are those paid to highly qualified people who are willing to do morally questionable work .
Tobacco industry consultants , for example , were once paid extremely high fees for their willingness to testify under oath that smoking had not been shown to cause serious illnesses .
Gatsby realized that to have any chance of achieving his goal , he could not be cautious or squeamish .
Fitzgerald never reveals the precise details of how Gatsby amassed his fortune .
But he leaves little doubt that Gatsby ’s work was not just morally suspect , but also well outside the law .
Gatsby surely realized that if he were caught and punished , his dream would evaporate .
But no matter .
A less risky path would have meant certain failure .
The burgeoning literature on the determinants of human well - being also sheds light on events in “ Gatsby . ’’
Once the almost exclusive domain of psychologists , happiness studies began to attract the attention of economists after Richard A. Easterlin posed a timeless question in an influential 1974 paper .
Does money buy happiness ?
Current research supports seemingly contradictory answers to this question .
One is that in any given country , the average level of measured happiness remains essentially unchanged over time , even in the face of substantial growth in average incomes .
But if getting more money does not make us happier , why do people often struggle so hard to earn more ?
An answer is suggested by other studies showing that at a single point in time , people are happier , on average , the more money they have .
To the extent money influences measured happiness levels , then , it is relative , not absolute , income that seems to matter .
Hemp – that word usually stirs up associations with stoned hippies and “ reefer madness ” .
But hemp is so much more , particularly what ’s known as industrial hemp – a cousin of marijuana .
Two North Dakota farmers are suing the DEA for the right to grow industrial hemp .
The US DEA sees the plant as being a controlled substance because it ’s a subspecies of Cannabis Sativa L. Some see the legalizing of industrial hemp as a stepping stone to the legalization of marijuana and there ’s also concerns that in relaxing the laws , industrial hemp fields would need heavy policing to ensure marijuana is n’t being grown also .
While marijuana ’s THC ( tetrahydrocannabinol - the hallucinogenic stuff ) levels can range between 3 and 20 percent , industrial hemp has far lower levels – between .3 and 1 percent .
In other words , you could n’t get high on it and industrial hemp also contains another chemical that blocks the effects of THC .
Some industrial hemp plants have been bred that contain no THC at all .
Hemp has been in use by man for purposes other than recreational and medicinal uses for thousands of years .
Today , it ’s used in ropes , textiles , paper , construction , the automotive industry , food and cosmetics .
While it is technically legal to grow it in the USA , cannabis can only be cultivated with special permits and for the purposes of medical or research purposes only – and it seems the University of Mississippi is the only permit holder .
Most hemp products coming into the USA are imported from dozens of other industrialized countries that permit the cultivation of industrial hemp .
It ’s a really odd situation – industrial hemp is an incredibly useful plant and is more environmentally friendly than other crops in large scale agricultural operations in that it can grow quickly in poor soils and is n’t water , pesticide or herbicide intensive .
In fact , it can help restore fields that have been degraded through poor farming practices .
I hope sanity prevails and the North Dakota farmers are successful in their action .. and no , I do n’t smoke the other stuff in case you were wondering ; not even Bill Clinton style :) – I ’m actually pretty much opposed to smoking marijuana as a recreational pursuit .

I have been reading Rolling Stone since the start as I am 68 years old .
It 's not the same magazine as it used to be but everyonce in a while it 's shines .
The Aretha Franklin article was superb and was what the old magazine would have proudly published .
The once a month format is odd as things in the world can be better serviced by a bi-weekly publication .
Some of what it covers now seems like glorified Teen Beat crap and I have lost faith in their music reviews .
If I want Music and artists I can relate to I go to MOJO .
The political articles and the current events are what keeps me as a subscriber otherwise I would just read Mojo and say Goldmine for a good overview of music .
I also dislike the way the magazine has changed its layout like why have a letters to the editor page when its mostly snippets of letters that lessen the writers point of view .
But as I said every once in a while it is good and for that I stay even though it is the least likely magazine to trust for a good music review .
The recent release of FogBugz 6.0 has , approximately , doubled our sales , and , while I fully agree that often small teams can accomplish a lot more than large teams , we have a lot of interesting work to be done here and there never seem to be enough people to do it , so we ’ve looked for some areas where adding more people would not necessarily slow things down .
We came up with three fairly interesting new positions that might be a perfect fit for you or someone you know .
It ’s relatively rare for Fog Creek to hire full time engineers ; many of the people we ’ve hired in the past have been former summer interns , the company is quite small ( 20 people ) , and we do n’t hire lightly , so this is a rare opportunity to get in the door and take advantage of the fact that Fog Creek was designed from the ground up to be the kind of company where the best software developers want to work ( about Fog Creek ) .
The first position is in system administration .
Normally , I ’m pretty happy to hire inexperienced but bright people and let them learn on the job .
Even for fairly important jobs , like , say , President of the United States .
But system administration is one of those things where experience is really important .
You do n’t want your new system administrator to learn about how to create secure and robust online services by building something insecure and unrobust and learning from experience .
So for our first system administrator , we hired Michael Gorsuch , because he knew how to operate our systems well on day one .
This is a dilemma for smart people who want to learn how to be world class system administrators .
If everybody is asking for x years of experience , how are you supposed to get that experience ?
You can take an entry - level job in a big company as , say , junior DNS administrator , typing changes into DNS configuration files , but you wo n’t learn very much .
Here ’s where Fog Creek comes in .
Michael and I talked about this and decided that our second hire in that department could be totally inexperienced at system administration , as long as they were smart , got things done , and had the personal characteristics to become a great system administrator ( attention to detail , insane curiosity , constant need to be learning new things , strong ability to stay levelheaded and organized even in the most chaotic of situations , does n’t soil pants in fear when presented with a command prompt , thinks “ rtfm ” is a great answer , etc . )
This is a once - in - a - lifetime chance to learn the field and gain substantial experience on an interesting , mixed environment including Unix and Windows , desktops and servers , internet hosting and internetworking , open source and Microsoft , with all kinds of interesting moving parts .
And you ’ll be learning from a real master , one on one , in a great environment with zero corporate BS , management that trusts you to order equipment you need without going through some kind of 6 month budget committee process during which a shrill corporate attorney who has been somehow promoted to “ head of the capital infrastructure committee ” is nervous about using open source hippie software because it seems kind of “ communistic , ” and she had a terrible experience on a commune in the 60s when this really gross guy who never bathed and wore flip flops even in the winter … well , anyway , I ’m getting off the subject .
At Fog Creek when you need equipment you order it .
That ’s really all there is to it .
Our next interesting position is for a Chief Linux Guru .
This is a hybrid position for somebody who really loves Linux , wants to do a lot of coding , but also wants a more diverse problem - solving kind of job .
Here ’s the theory behind this position .
Our main product , FogBugz , is a server product , available for Windows , Linux , and Mac .
On Windows servers , everybody has pretty much the same minimal stuff .
So our setup program usually works off the shelf .
On Linux , though , there ’s a lot more diversity .
People have different distros , they have different versions of different important components like MySQL , PHP , and Mono , and they ’re not all instantly compatible .
A lot of Linux administrators went through their server when they first set it up removing things that they did n’t think they ’d need for “ security ” reasons ( “ if you ’re not going to use / bin / ls , delete it–it ’s just a security hole waiting to be found ” , they said ) , and now , here it is , three years later , and they ’re installing FogBugz , and they do n’t get why ls is n’t working .
Bottom line : it takes a little bit of hammering to get FogBugz to work on many Linux systems .
So this position is for a Linux coder who will also be responsible to get FogBugz working on our customers ’ systems .
My pet theory is that if the person who takes the call when a customer is missing , say , the Pear Mail module , if this person is the same person who maintains the setup code , then they will eventually get sick of sshing into customers ’ servers and typing “ pear install Mail ” for them and they ’ll just fix it in the setup code once and for all .
And I think a lot of people would find a job that combines problem solving with new software development is going to be pretty interesting , especially if , as I said , you love Linux .
On the development side , you ’ve also got to handle all the Linux - specific code .
Right now , that ’s a mix of PHP , Mono , and various scripting languages .
Most of FogBugz is written in our own portable language , Wasabi .
You ’ll be responsible to maintain the Linux - specific parts of the code , and you ’ll be working on keeping Wasabi for Linux at the same level as Wasabi for Windows .
Finally , we could use an extreme Windows Internals guru .
I do n’t mean an “ Access / VB ” kind of guru .
I mean a Win 32 , COM , . Net , GDI programming , low level Windows systems stuff in C++ and C# kind of guru .
And when I say “ .
Net ” I do n’t mean “ Ooh look I made an ASP .
NET website with a GridView that shows a list of customers . ”
Uh-uh .
Leave that bush league stuff to the boss ( me ) .
For this job , you ’ll be working directly on a native .NET programming language , generating CLR bytecode and integrating with the Visual Studio debugger .
You ’ll be resolving obscure threading model problems in Other People ’s Code .
You ’ll be hacking GDI to improve the performance of our remote desktop service , Copilot .
You ’ll be figuring out why trivial things that used to work do n’t work any more in 64 bit Vista .
This is the perfect job for the kind of developer who has been doing API level Windows programming for years , who has been reading MSDN Magazine since it was called MSJ , who actually understands what Don Box is talking about , who can explain how to instantiate a COM object from a DLL without touching the registry , and who can figure out , from crappy Microsoft documentation , how to play the first four bars of Gaudeamus Igitur on a computer without a sound card .
Do n’t small teams get more things done than big teams ?
Did n’t The Mythical Man Month prove conclusively that you should have the smallest team possible ?
Do n’t startups with two kids run circles around the big companies ?
Is n’t Fog Creek getting big and bureaucratic ?
Why hire more people ?
No , no , no , and no .
It ’s a little bit more complicated than that .
At 20 people we still fit around one lunch table and we ’re far from not being able to get things done .
And what MMM claimed was only that adding people to a late project makes the project later .
The more people you have , the more communication you need , which counterbalances the added productivity of the extra people – that ’s the MMM conclusion–and so when we add people we always try to find a way to do it in a way that ’s efficient .
But the bottom line is that we have a long list of things that we want to do , and our too - small team is forced to do things in serial that we could do in parallel with a couple more people .
So in the long run I think we ’ll continue hiring carefully and discretely , keeping each of the core teams small ( our biggest dev team right now is , um , three people ) , and I think we ’re still a ways of from worrying about Fog Creek being bogged down in bureaucracy .

DAVOS , Switzerland ( CNN ) -- Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates announced a new direction Friday as he pledged $ 306 million in grants to develop farming in poor countries , leading the charge for corporate responsibility at a major meeting of business chiefs .
Bill Gates , Bono and Michael Dell from Dell computers .
The announcement by Gates , who is to step down from the computer giant later this year , drew attention from the financial woes that have dominated the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
Gates received a standing ovation for his announcement at the suggestion of U2 frontman Bono .
The move , the first foray into agriculture by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , will help boost efforts by the annual meeting in Davos , Switzerland to shake off its image as a billionaire 's talking shop that does little to solve the problems it discusses .
Watch Bono , Bill Gates and Michael Dell talk about charity project
" If we are serious about ending extreme hunger and poverty around the world , we must be serious about transforming agriculture for small farmers , most of whom are women , " Gates said .
" The challenge here is to design a system including profit and recognition to do more for the poor , " he said , calling for a new form of " creative capitalism . "
Bono , returning to add showbiz sparkle to the Forum for a second year , and UN chief Ban Ki-moon pushed the debate towards issues such as malaria eradication , poverty alleviation and climate change .

In his first appearance at Davos 2008 , which gathers more than 2,500 world business figures and government leaders , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for the World Bank to take on an environmental role to fight climate change .
Despite the fresh financial shockwaves generated by the $ 7.2 billion fraud at French bank Societe Generale , there were easing concerns that the global economy was heading towards recession .
A CNN straw poll of business leaders attending the Davos meeting voted in favor of an economic slowdown .

Update , Nov 14 2011 : I did a terrible job of making my point with this code .
I deliberately chose some of the most freakish code I 've ever written , because I wanted it to look ugly and scary .
I 'm trying to show here what " typical " veteran code looks like to a junior programmer .
This code serves as a * caricature * for illustration purposes .
You 're supposed to be put off by it .
If I had been trying to show you what modern art looks like to the uninitiated , I would have showed you a graffitied subway station wall that someone had just vomited on .
This is the coding equivalent .
If you * insist * on missing my point entirely and arguing about whether this function is " good code " or not , then I assure you : this code is horrific .
It 's a Lisp port of a Java port of some old C code .
* Both * ports intentionally stay as faithful to the original as possible , line - by - line in the most un-idiomatic code imaginable .
Why ?
To make it easy to propagate bug fixes in the original to both ports .
So it 's ugly for a legitimate reason .
But it 's still frigging ugly .

This is how I used to comment my code , twenty years ago ( Note : dramatization ) : Does this style look at all familiar ?
It should !
This is , to put it as impolitely as possible , n00b - style .
( Incidentally , if u dont no wat a n00 b iz , u r 1 . ) This is how junior programmers write code .
If you 've read Malcom Gladwell 's remarkable and eye - opening book The Tipping Point , you 'll notice a striking similarity to the real - life 2 - year - old Emily he describes in Chapter Three , who tells herself stories after her parents leave her room .
Here 's a short excerpt from one of her stories :
Gladwell 's account of Emily is fascinating , as she 's allegedly a completely normal 2 - year - old ; they all do this when Mommy and Daddy are n't around .
Gladwell explains :
If you look back at the comments in my hypothetical code from 20 years ago , you 'll see that I was doing exactly what Emily does : making up a temporal narrative in an attempt to carve out a mental picture of the computation for myself .
These stories I told myself were a critical part of my mental development as a programmer .
I was a child trying to make sense of a big , scary new world .
Most programmers go through this phase .
It 's perfectly normal .
In contrast , here 's what my code tends to look like today :
If I 'd seen this code 20 years ago I 'd have been appalled .
The lines of code are all crammed together !
Some of them are n't even commented !
If I 'd been given the task of maintaining this code , I 'd have been screaming " rewrite !
" I probably write more Java and JavaScript these days , but I picked an Emacs - Lisp function I wrote recently to highlight how alien my code today would have looked to me twenty years ago .
To be fair , this function is actually a port of some Java code from Mozilla Rhino 's JavaScript parser , which in turn is a port of some C code from SpiderMonkey 's parser , which in turn was probably borrowed and modified from some other compiler .
Compiler code tends to have some of the purest lineage around , tracing back to the assembly - language code they wrote for the first compilers 40 or 50 years ago .
Which means it 's going to be a bit on the ugly side compared to " ordinary " code .
But when I write code in other languages these days , even in Java , it looks a lot more like this Emacs Lisp fragment than like the n00b code I was writing 20 years ago .
It 's denser : there 's less whitespace and far less commenting .
Most of the commenting is in the form of doc-comments for automated API - doc extraction .
On the whole , my code today is much more compressed .
In the old days , seeing too much code at once quite frankly exceeded my complexity threshold , and when I had to work with it I 'd typically try to rewrite it or at least comment it heavily .
Today , however , I just slog through it without complaining ( much ) .
When I have a specific goal in mind and a complicated piece of code to write , I spend my time making it happen rather than telling myself stories about it .
After going through their 2 - year - old phase , programmers eventually have to go through a stupid - teenager phase .
All this month I 've been hearing sad but unsurprising news stories about teenagers getting stuck on big rocks , being killed falling off cliffs , or dying of exposure .
I 'm actually lucky the same did n't happen to me when I was a teenager .
It 's just a bad time for us .
Even though teenagers are old enough to understand the warnings , they have this feeling of invincibility that gets them into trouble and often mortal peril .
The programming equivalent happens around us all the time too .
Junior programmers with five to ten years of experience under their belts ( still n00bs in their own way ) attempt to build giant systems and eventually find themselves stuck on the cliff waiting for a helicopter bailout , telling themselves " my next system rewrite will be better ! "
Or they fall off the cliff – i.e. , the project gets canceled , people get laid off , maybe the company goes under .
Yes , I 've gone through that phase too .
And let 's face it : even seasoned programmers need a little optimism and a little bravery in order tackle real challenges .
Even as an experienced programmer , you should expect to fail at projects occasionally or you 're probably not trying hard enough .
Once again , this is all perfectly normal .
That being said , as a hiring manager or company owner you should keep in mind that " 5 to 10 years of experience " on a resume does not translate to " experienced " ; it means " crazy invincible - feeling teenager with a 50/50 shot at writing a pile of crap that he or she and his or her team can't handle , and they 'll eventually , possibly repeatedly , try to rewrite it all . "
It 's just how things are : programmers can't escape being teenagers at some point .
Hopefully the scene I 've painted so far helps you understand why sometimes you look at code and you just hate it immediately .
If you 're a n00 b , you 'll look at experienced code and say it 's impenetrable , undisciplined crap written by someone who never learned the essentials of modern software engineering .
If you 're a veteran , you 'll look at n00 b code and say it 's over - commented , ornamental fluff that an intern could have written in a single night of heavy drinking .
The sticking point is compression - tolerance .
As you write code through your career , especially if it 's code spanning very different languages and problem domains , your tolerance for code compression increases .
It 's no different from the progression from reading children 's books with giant text to increasingly complex novels with smaller text and bigger words .
( This progression eventually leads to Finnegan 's Wake , if you 're curious . )
The question is , what do you do when the two groups ( vets and n00bs ) need to share code ?
I 've heard ( and even made ) the argument that you should write for the lowest common denominator of programmers .
If you write code that newer programmers can't understand , then you 're hurting everyone 's productivity and chances for success , or so the argument goes .
However , I can now finally also see things from the veteran point of view .
A programmer with a high tolerance for compression is actually hindered by a screenful of storytelling .
Why ?
Because in order to understand a code base you need to be able to pack as much of it as possible into your head .
If it 's a complicated algorithm , a veteran programmer wants to see the whole thing on the screen , which means reducing the number of blank lines and inline comments – especially comments that simply reiterate what the code is doing .
This is exactly the opposite of what a n00b programmer wants .
n00bs want to focus on one statement or expression at a time , moving all the code around it out of view so they can concentrate , fer cryin ' out loud .
So it 's a problem .
Should a team write for the least common denominator ?
And if so , exactly how compressed should they make the code ?
I think the question may be unanswerable .
It 's like asking for a single format for all books , from children 's books to epic novels .
Each team is going to have its own average preference .
I suspect it 's a good idea to encourage people to move their stories into design documents and leave them out of the code , since a junior programmer forced to work in a compressed code base may well grow up faster .
As for me , at this point in my career I would rather puzzle through a small , dense , complex piece of code than a massive system with thousands of files containing mostly comments and whitespace .
To some people this trait undoubtedly flags me as a cranky old dinosaur .
Since this is likely the majority of programmers out there , maybe I am a cranky old dinosaur .
Rawr .
Everyone knows that comments are metadata : information about the data ( in this case , the data being your source code . )
But people often forget that comments are n't just a kind of metadata .
Comments and metadata are the same thing !
Metadata is any kind of description or model of something else .
The comments in your code are just a a natural - language description of the computation .
What makes metadata meta - data is that it 's not strictly necessary .
If I have a dog with some pedigree paperwork , and I lose the paperwork , I still have a perfectly valid dog .
You already know the comments you write have no bearing on the runtime operation of your code .
The compiler just throws them away .
And we 've established that one hallmark of a n00 b programmer is commenting to excess : in a sense , modeling every single step of the computation in painstaking detail , just like Emily modeled her ideal Friday by walking through every step and reassuring her 2 - year - old self that she really did understand how it was going to work .
Well , we also know that static types are just metadata .
They 're a specialized kind of comment targeted at two kinds of readers : programmers and compilers .
Static types tell a story about the computation , presumably to help both reader groups understand the intent of the program .
But the static types can be thrown away at runtime , because in the end they 're just stylized comments .
They 're like pedigree paperwork : it might make a certain insecure personality type happier about their dog , but the dog certainly does n't care .
If static types are comments , then I think we can conclude that people who rely too much on static types , people who really love the static modeling process , are n00bs .
Hee hee .
Seriously , though : I 'm not actually bashing on static - typing here ; I 'm bashing on the over - application of it .
Junior programmers overuse static typing in the exact same way , and for the same reasons , as they overuse comments .
I 'll elaborate by first drawing a parallel to data modeling , which is another kind of " static typing " .
If you 've been working in a field that uses relational databases heavily , you 'll probably have noticed that there 's a certain personality type that 's drawn to relational data modeling as a career unto itself .
They 're usually the logical modelers , not the physical modelers .
They may have begun their careers as programmers , but they find they really love data modeling ; it 's like a calling for them .
If you know the kind of person I 'm talking about , you 'll doubtless also have noticed they 're always getting in your way .
They band together and form Database Cabals and Schema Councils and other obstructive bureacracies in the name of safety .
And they spend a lot of time fighting with the engineers trying to get stuff done , especially at the fringes : teams that are not working directly with the schema associated with the main revenue stream for the company , but are out trying to solve tangential problems and just happen , by misfortune , to be homed in the same databases .
I 've been in surprisingly many situations at different companies where I had a fringe team that was being held up by data modelers who were overly - concerned about data integrity when the real business need was flexibility , which is sort of the opposite of strong data modeling .
When you need flexible storage , name / value pairs can get you a long , long , LONG way .
( I have a whole blog planned on this topic , in fact .
It 's one of my favorite vapor - blogs at the moment . )
It 's obviously important to do some amount of data modeling .
What 's not so obvious is when to stop .
It 's like commenting your code : newer programmers just do n't know when to quit .
When you 're a little insecure , adding comments and metadata are a great security - blanket that make you feel busy when you 've in fact stopped making forward progress and are just reiterating ( or perhaps teaching yourself ) what 's already been accomplished .
Hardcore logical data modelers often suffer from an affliction called metadata addiction .
Metadata modeling is seductive .
It lets you take things at a leisurely pace .
You do n't have to be faced with too much complexity at once , because everything has to go in a new box before you 'll look at it .
To be sure , having some metadata ( be it a data model , or static types , or comments ) is important for human communication and to some extent for performance tuning .
But a surprising percentage of people in our industry take it too far , and make describing an activity more important than the activity itself .
The metadata - addiction phenomenon applies equally to coders .
Code is data , and data is code .
The two are inextricably linked .
The data in your genes is code .
The floor plans for your house are code .
The two concepts are actually indistinguishable , linked at a fundamental level by the idea of an Interpreter , which sits at the very heart of Computer Science .
Metadata , on the other hand , is more like the kidney of Computer Science .
In practice you can lose half of it and hardly notice .
I think that by far the biggest reason that C++ and Java are the predominant industry languages today , as opposed to dynamic languages like Perl / Python / Ruby or academic languages like Modula - 3/ SML / Haskell , is that C++ and Java cater to both secure and insecure programmers .
You can write C++ like straight C code if you like , using buffers and pointers and nary a user - defined type to be found .
Or you can spend weeks agonizing over template metaprogramming with your peers , trying to force the type system to do something it 's just not powerful enough to express .
Guess which group gets more actual work done ?
My bet would be the C coders .
C++ helps them iron things out in sticky situations ( e.g. data structures ) where you need a little more structure around the public API , but for the most part they 're just moving data around and running algorithms , rather than trying to coerce their error - handling system to catch programmatic errors .
It 's fun to try to make a bulletproof model , but their peers are making them look bad by actually deploying systems .
In practice , trying to make an error - proof system is way more work than it 's worth .
Similarly , you can write Java code more or less like straight C , and a lot of seasoned programmers do .
It 's a little nicer than C because it has object - orientation built in , but that 's fairly orthogonal to the static type system .
You do n't need static types for OOP : in fact OOP was born and proven in dynamic languages like Smalltalk and Lisp long before it was picked up by the static - type camps .
The important elements of OOP are syntax ( and even that 's optional ) and an object model implemented in the runtime .
So you can write Java code that 's object - oriented but C - like using arrays , vectors , linked lists , hashtables , and a minimal sprinkling of classes .
Or you can spend years creating mountains of class hierarchies and volumes of UML in a heroic effort to tell people stories about all the great code you 're going to write someday .
Perl , Python and Ruby fail to attract many Java and C++ programmers because , well , they force you to get stuff done .
It 's not very easy to drag your heels and dicker with class modeling in dynamic languages , although I suppose some people still manage .
By and large these languages ( like C ) force you to face the computation head - on .
That makes them really unpopular with metadata - addicted n00bs .
It 's funny , but I used to get really pissed off at Larry Wall for calling Java programmers " babies " .
It turns out the situation is a little more complicated than that ... but only a little .
And Haskell , OCaml and their ilk are part of a 45 - year - old static - typing movement within academia to try to force people to model everything .
Programmers hate that .
These languages will never , ever enjoy any substantial commercial success , for the exact same reason the Semantic Web is a failure .
You can't force people to provide metadata for everything they do .
They 'll hate you .
One very real technical problem with the forced - modeling approaches that static type systems are often " wrong " .
It may be hard to imagine , because by a certain definition they can't be " wrong " : the code ( or data ) is programmatically checked to conform to whatever constraints are imposed by the type system .
So the code or data always matches the type model .
But the type system is " wrong " whenever it cannot match the intended computational model .
Every time want to use multiple inheritance or mixins in Java 's type system , Java is " wrong " , because it can't do what you want .
You have to take the most natural design and corrupt it to fit Java 's view of the world .
An important theoretical idea behind type systems is " soundness " .
Researchers love to go on about whether a type system is " sound " or not , and " unsound " type systems are considered bad .
C++ and Java have " unsound " type systems .
What researchers fail to realize is that until they can come up with a type system that is never " wrong " in the sense I described earlier , they will continue to frustrate their users , and their languages will be abandoned for more flexible ones .
( And , Scala folks , it ca n't just be possible to express things like property lists – it has to be trivial . )
To date , the more " sound " a type system is , the more often it 's wrong when you try to use it .
This is half the reason that C++ and Java are so successful : they let you stop using the type system whenever it gets in your way .
The other half of their success stems from the ability to create user - defined static types .
Not , mind you , because they 're helpful in creating solidly - engineered systems .
They are , sure .
But the reason C++ and Java ( particularly Java ) have been so successful is that their type systems form a " let 's not get any work done " playground for n00bs to spend time modeling things and telling themselves stories .
Java has been overrun by metadata - addicted n00bs .
You ca n't go to a bookstore or visit a forum or ( at some companies ) even go to the bathroom without hearing from them .
You can't actually model everything ; it 's formally impossible and pragmatically a dead - end .
But they try .
And they tell their peers ( just like our metadata - addicted logical data modelers ) that you have to model everything or you 're a Bad Citizen .
This gets them stuck on cliffs again and again , and because they 're teenagers they do n't understand what they did wrong .
Static type models have weight and inertia .
They take time to create , time to maintain , time to change , and time to work around when they 're wrong .
They 're just comments , nothing more .
All metadata is equivalent in the sense of being tangential documentation .
And static type models get directly in the way of flexibility , rapid development , and system - extensibility .
I 've deleted several thousand words about the evolution of Apache Struts and WebWork , an example framework I chose to illustrate my point .
Rather than waste a bunch of time with it , I 'll just give you a quote from one of the Struts developers in " The Evolution of Struts 2 " : Struts 2 was thrown away for WebWork , which was in the process of throwing away version 1 ( for similar reasons ) in favor of version 2 ( which has all the same problems ) .
Some of those several thousand words were devoted to JUnit 4 , which has comically ( almost tragically ) locked on , n00b - style , to the idea that Java 5 annotations , being another form of metadata , are the answer to mankind 's centuries of struggle .
They 've moved all their code out of the method bodies and into the annotations sections .
It 's truly the most absurd overuse of metadata I 've ever seen .
But there is n't space to cover it here ; I encourage you to go goggle at it .
There are die - hard Java folks out there who are practically gasping to inject the opinion , right here , that " rapid development " is a byproduct of static typing , via IDEs that can traverse the model .
Why , then , was Struts considered by its own developers to be a failure of rapid development ?
The answer , my dear die - hard Java fans , is that a sufficiently large model can outweigh its own benefits .
Even an IDE can't make things go faster when you have ten thousand classes in your system .
Development slows because you 're being buried in metadata !
Sure , the IDE can help you navigate around it , but once you 've created an ocean , even the best boats in the world take a long time to move around it .
There are hundreds of open - source and proprietary Java frameworks out there that were designed by code - teenagers and are in perpetual trouble .
I 've often complained that the problem is Java , and while I think the Java language ( which I 've come to realize is disturbingly Pascal - like ) is partly to blame , I think the bigger problem is cultural : it 's hard to restrain metadata addiction once it begins creeping into a project , a team , or an organization .
Java programmers , and logical data modelers , and other metadata - addicted developers , are burying us with their " comments " in the form of models within their static type system .
Just like I did when I was a n00b .
But they 're doing it with the best of intentions , and they 're young and eager and energetic , and they stand on street corners and hand you leaflets about how great it is to model everything .
Seasoned programmers ignore them and just get it done .
Software engineering is hard to get right .
One person 's pretty data model looks like metadata - addiction to another person .
I think we can learn some lessons from code - commenting : do n't try to model everything !
You need to step back and let the code speak for itself .
For instance , as just one random illustrative example , you might need to return 2 values from a function in Java ( a language with no direct support for multiple return values ) .
Should you model it as aclass with namedandfields ( presumably with actual names appropriate to the problem at hand ) ?
Or should you just return a 2 - element array ( possibly of mixed types ) and have the caller unpack it ?
I think the general answer to this is : .
Just get the code written , make forward progress .
Do n't let yourself get bogged down with the details of modeling a helper class that you 're creating for documentation purposes .
If it 's a public - facing API , take a lesson from doc-comments ( which should be present even in seasoned code ) , and do model it .
Just do n't go overboard with it .
Your users do n't want to see page after page of diagrams just to make a call to your service .
Lastly , if you 're revisiting your code down the road and you find a spot that 's always confusing you , or is n't performing well , consider adding some extra static types to clarify it ( for you and for your compiler ) .
Just keep in mind that it's a trade - off : you 're introducing clarifying metadata at the cost of maintenance , upkeep , flexibility , testability and extensibility .
Do n't go too wild with it .
That way the cliff you build will stay small enough for you to climb down without a helicopter rescue .
I'm leaving comments on , at least until " click - my - link " spam starts to surface .
I 'm curious to know how this entry goes over .
This was an especially difficult entry to write .
I did a lot of editing on it , and left out a lot as a result .
I feel like I may not have made my points as clearly as I 'd like .
And I 'm sure I have n't convinced the metadata - addicted that they have a problem , although at least now they know someone out there thinks they have a problem , which is a start .
Let me know what you think !
1999 was a big year for Harvard Business School Publishing .
In the past few years , they had seen their business model – selling books , journals , articles , case studies , and so forth – transform from being entirely catalogue - based to largely web - based , and it had finally come time for a major re-launch of their website .
HBSP ’s new website was slick .
On top of a fairly advanced search system , the re-designed site also featured community forums and a section called “ Ideas @ Work ” , which let users download audio broadcasts from influential business thinkers from around the world .
And best of all , despite the rapid development schedule , scope creep , and all of the new bells and whistles , the new site actually worked .
In the height of the dot - com era , not too many other sites could claim the same .
One key contributor to the success of Harvard Business School Publishing ’s new website was its extensive testing and QA .
Analysts developed all sorts of test cases to cover virtually every aspect of the site .
They worked closely with HBSP ’s logistics department to make sure the tests – searching , fulfillment , account management , etc. – were run .
And not just run , but run often .
This aggressive testing strategy ensured that the site would function as intended for years to come .
That is , until that one day in 2002 .
On that day , one of the test cases failed : the “ Single Result Search . ”
The “ Single Result Search ” test case was part of a trio of cases designed to test the system ’s search logic .
Like the “ Zero Result Search ” case , which had the tester enter a term like “ asdfasdf ” to produce no results , and the “ Many Results Search ” case , which had the tester enter a term like “ management ” to produce pages of results , the “ Single Result Search ” case had the tester enter a term – specifically , “ monkey ” – to verify that the system would return exactly one result .
And for three years , “ monkey ” returned exactly one result : Who 's Got the Monkey ?
( full article text ) by William Oncken Jr. Written in 1974 Oncken ’s article is for managers who “ find themselves running out of time while their subordinates are running out of work . ”
As for the monkeys , they ’re just an analogy for work , not who managers should outsource work to .
Apparently , Oncken was n’t that ahead of his time .
In any case , on that day in 2002 , the “ monkey ” search returned two results .
The first , as expected , was Who 's Got the Monkey ?.
The second result was something to the effect of Who ’s Got The Monkey Now ? , which was an update to HBSP ’s run-away best seller , Oncken ’s 1974 Who 's Got the Monkey ?.
It seemed obvious : the “ Single Result Search ” test case just needed to be updated .
But then they looked into the matter a bit further .
As part of the aggressive testing strategy mentioned earlier , the HBSP logistics team would fill their down time by executing test cases .
First they ’d run through the “ Zero Result Search ” test , then the “ Many Result Search ” test , then the “ Single Result Search ” .
Then they ’d add that single result – Who ’s Got the Monkey ?
– to their shopping cart , create an new account , submit the order , and then fulfill it .
Of course , they did n’t actually fulfill it – everyone knew that orders for “ Mr. Test Test ” and “ 123 Test St. ” were not to be filled .
That is , everyone except the marketing department .
When HBSP ’s marketing department analyzed the sales trends , they noticed a rather interesting trend .
Oncken ’s 1974 Who 's Got the Monkey ? was a run-away best seller !
And like any marketing department would , they took the story and ran .
HBSP created pamphlets and other distillations of the paper .
They even repackaged those little plastic cocktail monkeys as official “ Who ’s Got the Monkey monkeys ” .
And finally , sometime in 2002 , the updated version of Who ’s Got the Monkey ? was posted to HBSP , which was then picked up by the searching system , which , in turn , caused the “ Single Result Search ” test case to fail .
Of course , by this point , there was little anyone could do .
The fictional success of Who ’s Got the Monkey had already been widely publicized as reality .
And with all the subsequent write - ups ( many of which are still around to this day ) , it may have very well become a best - seller .
Needless to say , HBSP has since changed their aggressive testing policy .
Some details of the story have been redacted to protect the guilty .
Thanks to the two anonymous sources working at HBSP for the inside scoop , and news archives for the rest .
UPDATE : Bill Damon from Harvard Business added , “ our web development environment has changed dramatically in the last 9 years – in fact , since 2002 , we ’ve had a up a test order system specifically to handle these requests , and no testing orders made it into the sales data .
Also , I do know from historical sales data that Management Time : Who ’s Got the Monkey ? was a bestseller long before 1999 , and it continues to perform really well in reprint sale .
We also do n’t merchandise ancillary products such as plastic cocktail monkeys . ”
「 日経 」 が「 朝日」を抜き日本一に。 「 毎日 」 「産経 」 「時事」は凍え死に。ブロック紙と地方紙も勝ち負けがくっきり。
2008 年1月号 DEEP ［「 マスコミ志願者」必読］
「3大紙」と言えば朝日、毎日、読売というのが長らくニッポンの常識だった。しかし、本誌7月号が指摘したように、毎日はすでに日経にその地位を奪われている。10月の「ANY」提携会見しかり。朝日（A）、読売（Y）は毎日（M）ではなく、日経（N）をパートナーに選び、3社長揃い踏みで電子メディアや販売などでの提携を発表した。
新聞記者を目指すご子息を持つご両親。「冬の時代」と言われても「腐ってもマスコミは高給」などと幻想を抱くなかれ。新聞業界も勝ち組、負け組がくっきり。しかも勝ち組にも木枯らしが吹き始めている。
ここに示した新聞各社の冬のボーナス（年末一時金）一覧表は、マスコミが報じないため、まずお目にかかれないものだ。朝日、毎日、読売、日経の大手紙（産経は非加盟）と、各地のブロック・地方紙の労働組合が加盟する産別組合、「新聞労連」の内部資料に、本誌の独自取材を加えた。とくとご覧いただきたい。
日経は30歳で126万円！
ボーナスの額を比べると歴然である。表で「回答額」とあるのが各社の冬のボーナスだが、毎日の回答額は35歳モデルで100万円を切る87万円。一方、日経は30歳モデルで126万6千円と、年齢差を無視した単純比較でざっと40万円、年齢差を考慮した実質格差は50万円近くに達する。
ちなみに新聞労連非加盟の産経も、夏期は37歳で84万3千円と毎日並みだった。一般の大企業の今冬ボーナスが平均82万円（日本経団連調べ）。それに比べて毎日、産経が低水準とはいえないが、新聞業界というムラ社会では、朝日、読売、日経の「勝ち組」と、毎日、産経の「負け組」にくっきり分かれている。
勝ち組の中では、日経の40歳171万7千円が頭ひとつ抜け出した。朝日の41歳167万5千円を上回り、30歳での数字も126万6千円と、読売の同年齢117万5千円を上回っている。
「今冬の最大の話題は、名実ともに日経の首位奪取。日経の30歳支給額が共同の39歳と肩を並べた。30歳モデルで126万円というのは、驚異的なレベルだ。かつては朝日が断トツだったが、部数減、広告減の二重苦で日経の後塵を拝することになった」――大手紙労組の幹部はこう解説する。
ただし、朝日の場合は、別に社外秘の「リフレッシュ手当」なる一時金があるともいわれる。さらに、残業代を含まない月次の本給および家族手当などからなる「基準内賃金」（いわゆる基本給）をベースにして見ると、日経は「3.57」カ月分、朝日は「3.22」カ月分。つまり、月給では依然、朝日が首位だ。
中京圏のガリバー紙である中日新聞の子会社である東京新聞も、40歳で134万5千円と、それなりにいい数字だ。同紙はかつて「都新聞」といい、文芸などに独特の強みを持つ東京ローカル紙だったが、経営難から中日に買収された。旧東京社員は悲哀をなめたが、待遇はすこぶるよくなった。
通信社では、共同通信が39歳で126万9千円と、大手紙のやや下につけているが、時事通信は30歳モデルで68万7千円と毎日、産経よりさらに苦しい。記者クラブに夜遅くまで居残って「アルバイト原稿にいそしんでいるのが時事。次いで毎日、産経」と揶揄される所以だ。

（注1）基本給や扶養手当、通勤手当、住宅手当など、原則的に毎月金額が変動しないものを指す。多くの組合は、ボーナスについては例えば「3.5カ月分」といった形で、経営側に要求を出す。一方、裁量労働手当、残業手当や休日出勤手当は基準外賃金にあたる。朝刊の締め切りまで働くため労働時間が長い新聞記者の場合、この基準外賃金が通常の業種に比べ、大変多いのが一般的だ。
（注2）新聞労連は、冬のボーナス闘争について、傘下の労組に対し、10月29日から11月1日を第1次統一行動日と指定し、要求書を提出するように指示している。その際の労組からの要求金額が「要求額」。統一回答日を11月8、15、22、26日と指定しており、交渉次第で第3次、第4次と回答数を重ねることも多い。本誌が読者の手元に届くころには、相当数の新聞社では冬のボーナスが確定しているとみられる。
逆に低額回答を探してみよう。
茨城新聞（38歳、33万円）、千葉日報（42歳、53万円）、奈良新聞（30歳、18万5千円）の低さが目につく。また年末は回答が間に合わなかったが、埼玉新聞は夏期が38歳モデル12万3千円と、にわかに信じ難い金額だった。
この新聞は1944年創刊、熊谷や秩父など埼玉県北部を地盤とする地方紙だが、2002年に親会社の不動産会社「地産」が倒産し、経営が大きく傾いた。今年に入り、経営再建のため、県庁や市役所に近い浦和地区にあった土地、社屋を売却し、遠く離れた大宮地区への移転を決めた。40代以上の社員に希望退職を募り、計画通りの応募があったのはいいが、それを上回る退職者が出る始末。労組幹部は「社員は展望を失っている」と嘆く。
こうした東京、大阪の隣接県は都心に通勤する住民が多く、「千葉都民」「埼玉都民 」 「 奈良府民」と呼ばれて朝日、読売、日経などの大手紙が強い地域。地方紙が青息吐息なのも無理もない。
その一方で、全国紙と互角に戦う体力があるブロック紙は、経営が安定している。
北海道新聞は39歳モデルで139万5千円。中日新聞は新聞労連非加盟のため不明だが、子会社の東京新聞の水準から察するに、かなりの高レベルであることは間違いない。九州一円をカバーする西日本新聞は35歳モデルで103万3千円とやや見劣りするが、東京、名古屋に続く人口増加都市・福岡市を押さえ、経営体力は十分だ。準ブロック紙である中國新聞も35歳モデルで112万4千円と、広島の会社としては飛び抜けて高い。
忘れてはならないのは、県紙の知られざる大健闘ぶり。最も高いのは徳島新聞。35歳モデルで132万2千円というのは、日経、読売と勝負できる高水準だ。答えは簡単。本誌7月号でお伝えしたように、徳島新聞は県内シェアの8割を押さえるガリバーゆえだ。徳島新聞の労組は通常「全徳島」と呼ばれるが、新聞労連内では、 “ 全 ” にチョンチョンと2本ヒゲを生やして 「 “ 金” 徳島」と、待遇の良さを冷やかす呼び名もあるほどだ。
新潟日報（35歳、133万6千円）、宮崎日日新聞（同、124万7千円）などもブロック紙を上回る。島根の県紙である山陰中央新報も、35歳で113万円と気を吐いている。東北、中国、四国、九州などの地方紙でも、100万円の大台乗せが少なくない。
こうして見ると、人口が少ない地方の県紙であっても、高いシェアを持つ社は経営が安定しており、ボーナスをはずむ余裕があることが分かる。その一方で東京・大阪隣接型の県紙の経営はしんどい。地方紙も二極分化が急速に進んでいる。
そんな中で沖縄タイムス、琉球新報の沖縄2紙はいずれも70万円台と低額だ。「本土」の新聞が半日以上遅れて着くため、圧倒的な2紙寡占市場であるだけに意外だ。本土より物価・賃金水準が安い影響もあろうが、経営者が実質的な無競争状態にあぐらをかいて人件費を押さえ込んでいるのではないか。
Clive Thompson has been getting some well - deserved attention for his recent Fast Company piece , in which Columbia University sociologist Duncan Watts explodes the hierarchical theory of social influence and trend propagation popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in the bestselling book The Tipping Point .
Gladwell 's model , which has itself become something of a cultural epidemic , posits that a few hyperconnected " influentials " are the key to the runaway viral spread of fads , fashions , ideas , and behaviors .
These pivotal individuals , according to Gladwell , determine which trends will wither on the vine and which will " tip , " becoming mass phenomena .
But Watts , a pioneer in the mathematical modeling of social networks , has tested the " tipping point " hypothesis , both empirically and in computer simulations .
As it turns out , according to Watts , it 's just not true .
There are exceptionally well - connected folks out there , but they 're so swamped by ordinary individuals that they can't account for genuine cultural cascades , which result not primarily from the activity of social " hubs " kick - starting trends and broadcasting them to the masses , but average Joes and Janes passing them on to other average Joes and Janes .
In a way , the best vindication of Watts ' critique is that , despite being " precisely the type of person you 'd peg as an Influential , " his objections have taken so long to gain traction .
He has , after all , been raising them for quite some time .
When I interviewed Watts back in 2004 , he dismissed Gladwell 's theory : " We knew 50 years ago that this model was wrong .
After the fact , and this is why Gladwell 's book is so beguiling , you see that crime rates dropped or Hush Puppies took off and then you can always find the people with whom it started , " he told me .
" But if it 's something about them , why are n't they driving all the other trends ?
What turns out to be the deciding factor is not the ' influentials ' but the people who are easily influenced .
You might have someone who influences five times as many people as the average , but the total numbers relative to a population are still very small .
Almost all of the action is away from the center . "
And indeed , our hardwired dispositions to be easily influenced in certain ways may provide a better explanation of the popularity of the " tipping point " thesis than Gladwell 's own status as an Influential .
For example , researchers like anthropologist Pascal Boyer , who studies the psychology of religion , argue that our brains have evolved with an overactive agency - recognition system :
We look for — and find — individual intention and design behind any pattern , even when none exists .
After a bad harvest , we wonder how we have angered the gods ; after a trend goes viral , we wonder what special person could have made it happen .
This model also has the virtue of simplicity and , perhaps most importantly , that of flattering its target audience .
How tempting , if you 're a marketer , an activist , or just the sort of person who tends to pick up books by New Yorker columnists , to imagine that you have it in your power to launch a runaway cultural phenomenon just by targeting a few key people .
Why , you may even be one yourself !
Alas , with catchy memes no less than biological viruses , infectiousness is a poor metric of value .
In a Toronto suburb , a father , Muhammad Parvez , 57 , is accused of strangling to death his 16 - year - old daughter because of her refusal to wear a hijab .
Parvez called police himself .
Aqsa Parvez was rushed to the hospital but died that night .
The father is a devout Muslim and killed his daughter after she rejected the religious scarf and loose - fitting clothes .
Her 26 - year - old brother is also charged in the crime for obstructing justice .
Canadian Muslim groups immediately condemned the murder .

Patent Attorney Offers $ 5 k For Identity Of Anonymous Patent Troll Tracker

A few months back , we discovered the blog of an anonymous IP lawyer called The Patent Troll Tracker .
It had great info , and you 've probably noticed that we 're now linking to stories from that site on a fairly regular basis .
Sometime before we became aware of the site however , the Troll Tracker got into a little scuffle with a bigshot patent attorney , Raymond Niro of the law firm Niro , Scavone .
The Mises Institute has a recap of the situation , but basically the Troll Tracker had mentioned Niro in a way that Niro felt was unflattering , and Niro asked the Troll Tracker to identify himself -- not , apparently , for a defamation charge , but for patent infringement .
How could a blog post ( unflattering or not ) be considered patent infringement ?
Apparently , the patent in question , owned by Acacia ( who , you may recall is considered the worst patent system offender by the EFF ) , can be interpreted to mean that posting a JPG image to your site is infringement .
It also happens that Niro is the patent attorney who has filed some of Acacia 's patent infringement lawsuits , including against the Green Bay Packers for violating this same patent .
Apparently , Niro also used the same claim of patent infringement against well - known patent critic Gregory Aharonian .
It 's an interesting twist on patent infringement cases to use an incredibly broad patent that covers " posting a JPEG to a website " to basically go after anyone you do n't like .
Somehow , I doubt that 's what the founders of the patent system had in mind .
Hell , I 'd guess that it's not what anyone who had any part in writing patent laws had in mind .
Of course , Niro has run into something of a problem in trying to sue the anonymous Troll Tracker .
It 's that anonymity bit .
So , apparently , he 's now put out a $ 5,000 bounty to anyone who can identify the Troll Tracker .
Law.com has more details on this as well as some other odd moves by Niro .
Who knows if he will actually sue ( though , the earlier stories suggest it 's not out of the realm of possibility ) , but it 's stunning that a bigshot patent attorney would be so afraid of an anonymous critic of patent system misuse that he not only would threaten him with patent infringement claims on such an incredibly broad patent , but also is willing to put up $ 5,000 just to find out the guy 's identity .
Yes , this is what our patent system has been reduced to .
Thomas Jefferson is rolling in his grave .

In a Nutshell
The Church of Scientology is a vicious and dangerous cult that masquerades as a religion .
Its purpose is to make money .
It practices a variety of mind - control techniques on people lured into its midst to gain control over their money and their lives .
Its aim is to take from them every penny that they have and can ever borrow and to also enslave them to further its wicked ends .
It was started in the 1950s by a science fiction writer named L. Ron Hubbard in fulfilment to his declared aim to start a religion to make money .
It is an offshoot to a method of psychotherapy he concocted from various sources which he named " Dianetics " .
Dianetics is a form of regression therapy .
It was then further expanded to appear more like a religion in order to enjoy tax benefits .
He called it " Scientology " .
Scientology is a confused concoction of crackpot , dangerously applied psychotherapy , oversimplified , idiotic and inapplicable rules and ideas and science - fiction drivel that is presented to its members ( at the " advanced " levels ) as profound spiritual truth .
The Harm it Does to a Person
The results of applying their crackpot psychotherapy ( called " auditing " ) is to weaken the mind .
The mind goes from a rational state to an irrational one as the delusional contents of the subconscious mind are brought to the surface and are assumed to be valid .
It also makes a person more susceptible to suggestion since it submerges the critical thinking faculties of the mind into a partial subconscious state .
It results in a permanent light hypnotic trance and so from thenceforth that person can be more easily controlled .
The person will , to a much greater extent , believe and do whatever they are told .
And of course this is used to the full in persuading them to hand over further money and dedicating themselves further to the cult .
The results of applying their oversimplified and inapplicable rules in life is to lose the ability to think rationally and logically .
A person loses the ability to think for themselves and so they lose the ability to challenge incorrect ideas .
This makes them easier to control .
It also isolates and alienates the person from society so that they withdraw from normal society and into their " Scientology " society .
This further increases their susceptibility to the influence of their group .
They end up being afraid of society , believing all society to be controlled by a group of drug companies , psychiatrists and financiers all of whom report to more remote masters .
In other words they are in a state of mass paranoia .
They therefore avoid reading newspapers and the like since they fear it will disturb their safe Scientology world .
It is a downward spiral into madness .
The science fiction content of Scientology is revealed to them after they have reached the state they call " Clear " , meaning freed from the aberrations of the mind .
However , perhaps " brainwashed " would be a more applicable word to describe the mental state of someone who has survived the near entire delusional contents of their subconscious mind brought to the surface and presented to them as " truth " .
On the " advanced " levels ( called OT levels ) above the state of " Clear " they encounter the story of Xenu .
Xenu was supposed to have gathered up all the overpopulation in this sector of the galaxy , brought them to Earth and then exterminated them using hydrogen bombs .
The souls of these murdered people are then supposed to infest the body of everyone .
They are called " body thetans " .
On the advanced levels of Scientology a person " audits out " these body thetans telepathically by getting them to re-experience their being exterminated by hydrogen bombs .
So people on these levels assume all their bad thoughts and faulty memories are due to these body thetans infesting every part of their body and influencing them mentally .
Many Scientologists go raving mad at this point if they have not done so already .
The " Ethics " Trap
On the surface the Church of Scientology seems reasonable .
The insane content of it is only revealed to a person when the early stuff has done its work and made them more susceptible .
After a short while a person " believes " that Scientology is doing them good .
They are then persuaded to help their new - found group further by donating money and / or working for the organisation for almost no money .
Many people do exactly that .
" Ethics " is used to good effect to trap a person .
A person ’s natural tendency to do good is worked upon .
Yes - they want to be more ethical , but what is ethical ?
This is where a clever trick is pulled !
" Ethics " is redefined by Scientology in such a way that to be ethical is to be a better Scientologist and obey the " church " .
Young people , not yet made cynical through the machinations of life and politics , are very keen to contribute to the world and to be ethical .
So the " ethics " trick works easily into persuading them to join the " church " .
Many of them join an elite group called the " Sea Org " where they become brainwashed slaves .
There they work a hundred hour week for almost no pay .
There they are subject to every cruel whim of their masters .
It is a living hell that they endure because of the conditioning they have received and this now perverted sense of ethics that they have accepted .
The " Sea Org " is the ultimate in brainwashed slavery .
They are expected to work harder and harder to achieve ever higher targets of production .
If they fail to meet their targets there are various penalties .
One of them is to be put onto a diet of beans and rice and to miss sleep .
Another is to be sentenced to a period on the RPF ( Rehabilitation Project Force ) .
This is the equivalent to " hard labour " .
Such is the extent of their brainwashing that they actually write " success stories " when they complete their sentences .
Brainwashing Bites Back
There is no doubt at all that L. Ron Hubbard incorporated brainwashing techniques into Scientology to put people under his control .
He even wrote a " brainwashing manual " which is still in existence today .
However there was a cruel twist in his scheme .
He fell victim of it himself .
In creating his devoted slaves , the Sea Org , he created an audience that believed every word he said .
Now L. Ron Hubbard had an over - active imagination plus delusions of grandeur .
The negative feedback he would obtain by being part of normal society was replaced by the positive feedback from his devoted followers .
Through this his imagination got the better of him and combined with his delusions of grandeur , his thinking became increasingly bizarre which , on acceptance , led on to more bizarre thinking and the idea that he and Scientology had the job of saving the entire universe
He wanted to take over the world in order to further Scientology ’s aims to save the universe and so branches of Scientology were set up to try to influence governments and gain positions where they could influence to world to a high degree .
So what started out as a mass confidence trick backed up with brainwashing became a monstrous and insane organisation with fantastic , fanatical ideals .
Because of this change , the Church of Scientology survived the death of their founder .
It is like a runaway monster machine that tramples on society and peoples lives that is very difficult to stop .
Stop the Monster
The whole machinery called the " Church of Scientology " needs to be jammed somehow so that more people do not get sucked in and the people already in it have a chance to get out .
We must not forget the people already in this " church " .
Although they are the ones perpetrating this crime they are also the victims .
They need our help as well .
And here we come to the " War on the Internet " .
The War on the Internet
The check is n't in the mail yet .
But it 's coming .
Within the next few days , President Bush is expected to sign an economic - stimulus bill that will include tax rebates to more than 130 million Americans .
Here are some answers to questions about the rebates : Q : How much will I get ?
YOUR MONEY : Sandra Block on other aspects of the rebates A : Most single taxpayers will be eligible for a $ 600 rebate , and married couples who file jointly will be eligible for $ 1,200 .
Taxpayers with dependent children under age 17 will be eligible for an additional $ 300 per child .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , says a typical family of four with two children would receive $ 1,800 .
There 's no limit on the number of dependents eligible for the rebate , so a large family could end up with a much larger check .
A family with six children , for example , would be eligible for a rebate of up to $ 3,000 .
Q : When will I get the money ?
A : Probably not until late spring or early summer .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson says the IRS will start working on the rebates right away , but taxpayers wo n't start receiving checks for two to four months .
The IRS needs to finish processing 2007 tax returns before it can start delivering rebate checks .
Taxpayers who want their money as soon as possible should be sure to file their tax returns by the April 15 deadline , says Mel Schwarz , partner at Grant Thornton 's national tax office .
Because the rebate will be based on 2007 tax returns , taxpayers who file for an extension will have to wait longer for their money .
Q : Is there an income cut - off for the rebates ?
A : Yes .
The rebates will phase out for single taxpayers with adjusted gross income of more than $ 75,000 and married taxpayers with AGI of more than $ 150,000 .
The phase - out will be 5 % of the amount of income that exceeds the threshold .
If , for example , you 're married and your 2007 AGI is $ 160,000 , your rebate would be $ 700 .
Q : What about people who do n't owe income tax ?
A : Even if you did n't owe any tax , you 're still eligible for a rebate of $ 300 , or $ 600 for married couples , as long as you had at least $ 3,000 in earned income , Social Security benefits , veteran 's disability payments or a combination .
You may be eligible for a larger rebate if you have dependent children .
Suppose , for example , that you worked part of the year in 2007 and earned $ 9,000 .
And say you also have custody of two children .
Though you owe no income tax for 2007 , you would be eligible for $ 300 for yourself and $ 300 for each child , for a total rebate of $ 900 .
Q : Do I have to do anything to get a rebate ?
A : You do n't need to file an additional tax form to get your rebate .
But if you received more than $ 3,000 in earned income last year , you should file a tax return , even if you do n't owe any tax , says Mark Luscombe , tax analyst for tax publisher CCH .
That will make it easier for the IRS to find you , he says .
If you 're eligible for a rebate but do n't receive one , you can try contacting the IRS .
Alternatively , you 'll have a chance to claim your rebate when you file your 2008 tax returns in 2009 , says Clint Stretch , managing director for Deloitte & Touche .

Those hours practicing piano scales or singing with a choral group were n’t for nothing because people with a background in music tend to have a higher education and earn more , according to a new survey .
The poll by Harris Interactive , an independent research company , showed that 88 percent of people with a post - graduate education were involved in music while in school , and 83 percent of people earning $ 150,000 or more had a music education .
“ Part of it is the discipline itself in learning music , it ’s a rigorous discipline , and in an ensemble situation , there ’s a great deal of working with others .
Those types of skills stand you well in careers later in life , ” said John Mahlmann , of the National Association for Music Education in Reston , Virginia , which assisted in the survey .
In addition to the practical skills gained from studying music , people questioned in the online poll said it also gave them a sense of personal fulfillment .
Students who found music to be extremely or very influential to their fulfillment were those who had vocal lessons and who played in a garage band .
Nearly 80 percent of the 2,565 people who took part in the survey last month who were still involved in music felt the same way .
“ That ’s the beauty of music , that they can bring both hard work and enjoyment together , which does n’t always happen elsewhere , ” Mahlmann added in and interview .

Those of us biding our layover time at DIA will miss the most controversial murals to ever grace the walls of a baggage claim .
Some of the murals have now been painted over , but they did include a city on fire , dead children and women in coffins , a military - type guy stabbing a dove and other disturbing stuff .
Some conspiracy theorists say the murals were commissioned by the Masonic society to show what will happen to the population and the environment when the world allegedly ends in 2012 .

One man has written more than 20 books explaining how the world is controlled by reptile - like aliens , including George W. Bush , Queen Elizabeth II and …
Kris Kristofferson ?
Yep .
According to him , the murals how the reptilians when they finally take over the world .
Furthermore , the tunnels underneath the airport house human slaves , even children , who are controlled by the reptilians .
According to the artist , Leo Tanguma , it 's really just a mural that " depict man-made environmental destruction and genocide along with humanity coming together to heal nature and live in peace . "
Disney 's Grand Floridian Resort
Rumors about the dark side of Disney are certainly not lacking , so it 's not surprising to find one that says the company purposely had an artist paint a Nazi into a mural at one of their swankiest hotels .

In the book Sabotage in the American Workplace , an anonymous man claims that his company was hired to paint a scene at the Grand Floridian that depicted something similar to the setting of F. Scott Fitzgerald 's The Great Gatsby .
The artist wanted to make a statement that while the rich folks were enjoying their parties and cocktails , sinister things were happening in the rest of the world .
The thing is , the figure the man claims is a Nazi does n't have any really distinguishing Nazi characteristics , so all we can really do is take him at his word .
You can decide for yourself .
San Francisco's Mission District

This mural in San Fran has caused a huge rift among many citizens in the Mission district .
The mural shows Palestinians breaking through the Israeli wall , with a large crack in the wall shaped like the country of Israel .
The organization that received a grant to paint the mural , HOMEY ( Homies Organizing the Mission to Empower Youth ) said the mural was intended to show the two sides uniting .
In order to make the mural more neutral , the agreed to reshape the crack in the wall so it does n't represent Israel , add an olive tree to symbolize peace and remove a headscarf from a woman 's face .
Twelve Labors of Hercules
When muralist Michael Spafford created " Twelve Labors of Hercules " for Washington 's House of Representatives chambers in 1981 , he did n't know he would cause such a divide .
The murals were up for barely a year before they were covered with plywood after complains that the paintings were offensive .

The murals show some of the feats Hercules accomplished , including one where he kills the Amazon queen Hippolyta .
One Representative felt the depiction was a glorification of rape .
The murals are now on display at Centralia College in Centralia , Washington , much to the chagrin of Michael Spafford , who says the mural would only look right in the space he created it for .
Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future / Man Controller of the Universe

It seems like a crime to destroy a mural painted by one of Mexico 's most famous artists , Diego Rivera , but Nelson A. Rockefeller did n't really have a problem with it .
He commissioned Rivera to paint a mural on the RCA center in 1933 and requested that it be about " new frontiers " and that it would be an image that would make people stop and think .
Rivera created Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future , a scene that juxtaposed workers and capitalism and industry .
Some of the people portrayed included Charlie Chaplin , Edsel Ford , Vladimir Lenin and Jean Harlow .
The Rockefellers hated the representation of Lenin .
Rivera refused to change it ( although he did offer to balance it by adding Abraham Lincoln to represent an American leader ) so the mural was covered up entirely until it Rockefeller had it chiseled away .
In response , Rivera painted a pretty exact replica of Man at the Crossroads Looking with Hope and High Vision to the Choosing of a New and Better Future in Mexico City , but titled this one Man Controller of the Universe .
I would say that Rivera got the last laugh .
Bush proposes cuts in health , domestic progams ;
Debt remains his legacy RAW STORY

With less than a year until he leaves the White House , President Bush is proposing deep cuts in health programs while allowing virtually no increase for other domestic priorities in his final budget .
Kevin Freking of the Associated Press , citing a senior administration official , reports that the budget " will virtually freeze most domestic programs . "
Nonetheless , economists predict the president has saddled his successor with near - crippling debt that could threaten the US credit rating for the first time in more than 90 years .
" Despite his efforts , Mr. Bush failed to work out a deal with Congress to tackle the spiraling costs of government health and retirement programs , " report the Wall Street Journal 's Michael M. Phillips and John D. McKinnon .
" The next president , if he or she serves two terms , could find the U.S. government so deeply in hock that it would face losing its Triple - A credit rating , something that has never happened since Moody 's Investors Service began grading U.S. securities in 1917 . "
Bush has proposed nearly $ 200 billion in cuts to Medicaid and Medicare as part of his $ 3 trillion budget to be unveiled Monday , and he will provide miniscule increases in spending on other domestic programs .
" It 's a very small increase , " an Office of Management and Budget official tells the Associated Press .
" Very small . "
The deficit is expected to reach $ 400 billion in the next budget , adding to what Philips and McKinnon call the " trail of deficits and debt " Bush is leaving in his wake .
Excerpts from the Journal :
The president 's critics say his failings are twofold :
He has squandered surpluses that could have helped pay down the $ 5 trillion federal debt .
And he has let two terms pass without persuading Congress to take action that would preserve the government 's social programs .
According to the Concord Coalition , a fiscal watchdog group , the shortfall in Social Security and Medicare through 2080 will total $ 72.3 trillion , a number that dwarfs the impact of Mr. Bush 's spending and tax cuts .
Mr. Bush 's defenders say he did the best he could in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks , and that he has recently tightened up on spending .
The budget deficit in fiscal 2004 measured 3.6 % of gross domestic product ; last year it narrowed to 1.2 % of GDP , low by historical standards .
The deficit is expected to rise to 2.5 % of GDP , or about $ 350 billion , this fiscal year , assuming Congress passes an expected economic - stimulus package .
" You could say , ' Gee , he inherited surpluses and now we have a deficit , ' " said Rob Portman , the former head of the White House budget office under Mr. Bush .
" On the other hand , you could say he inherited a recession " in 2001 .
Mr. Portman called the country 's fiscal health " relatively strong " and said the president has left a solid base for " the next president and the next Congress to deal with the real problem , which is the unsustainable growth in mandatory spending . "
In his State of the Union address this week , Mr. Bush signaled he was n't going to use his last year trying to revamp entitlement programs .
Instead , he called on lawmakers to " offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution . "

Top 100 list , there has been some huge movement thanks to Google updating their PageRank system , and starting today , I will have a very different list with which to create the Xfep Podcast .
I have taken a look at the sites in the list before Mark updated it , and after , and here are the new Top 50 Make Money Online blogs .
I suggest checking out the biggest movers and shakers , as they are the ones that were being held back by their lack of a PageRank or due to a low PageRank .
I Made It
In other great news , eXtra for Every Publisher went from a rank of 106 to 66 on the list thanks to going from a PageRank of 0 to a PageRank of 4 .
I had hoped to get into the Top 100 by the end of the month , and while I am super excited to be included in the Top 100 , I ca n’t help feeling like I do n’t deserve it as getting a PageRank is the only thing that brought me to my current position .
My new goal though is to get to the Top 50 by my wife ’s birthday in February .
Will it be possible ?
I am not yet sure , as I will have to outpace 16 other amazing blogs to get there .
Jake Tapper / ABC News Blogs | March 27 , 2008
At a $ 1,000 - a- head fundraiser at the Credit Suisse building in New York City today , Sen. Barack Obama , D - Illinois , took a brand new whack at Sen.
Hillary Clinton , D - NY , adding to his usual construct that he “ decided to run not because of some long - held ambitions or because I thought it was somehow owed to me ” the notion that “ certainly I was n’t presumptuous enough to think it was my turn . ”
Obama also pooh - poohed the notion that Democratic divisiveness would hurt the part come November , saying the primary and caucus process “ has gotten people engaged in politics who were never engaged before or who had forgotten what it ’s like to be passionate about politics …
“ I am absolutely confident that by the time this thing is over , the Democratic party will be completely unified . ”
He added , “ for those of you who are just weary of the primary , and feeling kind of ground down or that it ’s like a Bataan death mark , I just want everybody to know that the future is bright . ”

The mix of criminal prosecutions now being brought by the Justice Department that Judge Michael B. Mukasey will lead if confirmed as attorney general is very different from what it was when President Bush came to the White House almost seven years ago .
Evidence of the profound and often unannounced changes in the basic thrust of federal enforcement under the Bush Administration has emerged from the records of hundreds of thousands of individual criminal cases that are routinely collected by the government and then analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse ( TRAC ) .
Other evidence , drawn from Justice Department budget submissions to Congress , indicate that some of these dramatic shifts will continue at least until after the next administration comes to power in early 2009 .
Here are a few selected enforcement trends based on the timely information collected by the Justice Department 's Executive Office for United States Attorneys :
The prosecution of all kinds of white - collar criminals is down by 27 % since FY 2000 , before President Bush came to office .
See Figure 1 .
Also substantially down were federal prosecutions against individuals the government accused of various kinds of official corruption .
They dropped in the same period by 14 % .
See Figure 2 .
Charges against organized crime figures were slightly up in the last year , but their number currently is about half ( 48 % ) of what it was in FY 2000 .
See Figure 3 .
While the decline in federal filings against drug violators was less precipitous , such prosecutions were still 20 % below where they were a decade ago .
See Figure 4 .
( While weapon prosecutions grew in the first three years of the Bush administration , since FY 2004 they also have fallen 21 % .
See table . )
The drop was even more pronounced for drug and weapons cases where the FBI was the lead investigative agency .
For drugs , the number of such prosecutions credited to the bureau dropped from 5,014 in FY 2000 to 2,414 in FY 2006 .
Based on the first nine months of FY 2007 , these prosecutions appear to be continuing to drop — down to an estimated 2,332 — less than half of the 2000 total .
FBI weapons prosecutions are down around 30 percent over this same period .
The only major enforcement area where federal prosecutions were sharply higher is immigration , where the number of individuals charged with criminal offenses has undergone a 127 % jump .
See Figure 5 .
The data thus document that there have been revolutionary changes in the long - established enforcement priorities of the federal government .
While new administrations have always had the authority to alter the emphasis they give to different areas , the possible impacts of such shifts — on the lives of individual Americans and the economy — can be significant .
This is true partly because local and state agencies are generally not equipped to deal with the activities of organized crime gangs , white collar criminals , international drug dealers and corrupt government officials .
Looking Ahead
While the case - by - case enforcement data highlight the dramatic changes of the recent past , submissions to Congress by the FBI provide evidence that at least some of these changes probably will continue in the near future .
The signal that further declines are highly likely in the prosecution of matters not connected to terrorism — such as white collar crime and official corruption — comes from the most recent staffing request submitted by the FBI in the Justice Department 's FY 2008 budget .
The FBI historically has played a major role in the investigations of these kinds of crimes .
In FY 2006 , the agency unit ( now called " Criminal Enterprises and Federal Crimes " ( CEFC ) decision unit ) that " comprises all headquarters and field programs that support the FBI 's criminal investigative mission " had 12,595 permanent positions .
In FY 2008 , assuming Congress accepts the administration 's proposal , the number of positions in this unit will decline by 14.3 % to 10,800 positions .
Declining staff almost certainly means declining enforcement .
See budget submission , p. 4 -110 .
An even more dramatic insight into current FBI priorities — strongly focused on intelligence and terrorism work — can be found in the distribution of funds outlined in the FY 2008 budget submission .
Here are the numbers : 60 % ( $ 3,838 million ) for all intelligence / counterterrorism work , 33 % ( $ 2,131 million ) for criminal law enforcement and 7 % ( $ 463 million ) for state and local assistance .
See Figure 6 and budget submission , Exhibit B .
The distribution of special agents , support staff and others among bureau sub-agencies offers a parallel indicator .
But because the FBI has undergone several major reorganizations since 9/11/01 and the key functions sometimes have been re-named , such comparisons are not exact .
With this caution in mind , however , a TRAC report posted in 2002 found that as of 9/11/01 only a small proportion ( 15 % ) of all FBI agents — 1,664 out of 11,028 — were assigned to what was then called " counterterrorism . "
See Figure 7 .
By comparison , the FBI " positions " assigned to intelligence , counterterrorism and counterintelligence now made up more than half ( 56 % ) of the total — 16,486 of 29,373 positions .
See budget submission , Exhibit B .
While the distribution of agents within the bureau thus has been substantially altered , the DOJ's FY 2008 budget proposal calls for 11,868 agents , only a slight increase from the total of 11,028 in 9/11 .
Thus , this redirection of FBI efforts has occurred during a period when total FBI staffing as well as staffing within other DOJ agencies have grown only modestly .
See table .
Implications of these Trends ?
The overall impact of this shift in resources and concomitant decline in many areas of criminal prosecutions is not clear .
But according to explanatory text in the FBI budget document , the potential consequences of this dramatic drop could undermine efforts to root out corrupt government officials all over the United States , to maintain a healthy national economy , to assure honest elections and to deal with other such problems .
This is because the detection and prosecution and convictions of corrupt officials , crooked business executives and shady political operatives are thought to be key to deterring such criminal activities in the future .
The FBI statement about importance of investigating all kinds of financial crime , for example , was sweeping .
" In the United States , citizens and businesses lose billions of dollars each year to criminals engaged in non-violent fraudulent enterprises .
The globalization of economic and financial systems , advancement of technology , decline in corporate and individual ethics and the sophistication of criminal organizations have resulted in annual increases in the number of illegal acts characterized by deceit , concealment and violations of trust . "
But the investigation of financial crimes was not the only area where the FBI described its role as critical .
For public corruption and government fraud , the agency 's budget document said , it was " the only law enforcement agency primarily charged with investigating legislative , executive , judicial and significant law enforcement corruption . "
With a possible nod to the upcoming national elections , the statement also noted that the FBI was alone in targeting federal campaign finance violations , ballot fraud , obstruction of justice matters and Foreign Corruption Practices Act ( FCPA ) violations .
Sylvester Stallone poses during a photocall to promote the movie " Rambo " in Madrid January 28 , 2008 .
Stallone stars in this film which he also wrote and directed .
Police in Myanmar have given DVD hawkers strict orders not to stock the new Rambo movie , which features the Vietnam War veteran taking on the former Burma 's ruling military junta , a Yangon resident told Reuters on Friday .
REUTERS / Susana Vera
BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - Police in Myanmar have given DVD hawkers strict orders not to stock the new Rambo movie , which features the Vietnam War veteran taking on the former Burma ’s ruling military junta , a Yangon resident told Reuters on Friday .
Despite the prohibition , pirated copies of the movie are widely available on the streets of the former capital , where it is fast becoming a talking point among a population eager to shake off 45 years of military rule .
“ People are going crazy with the quote ‘ Live for nothing , die for something ’ , ” one resident said , referring to the tagline of the fourth Rambo installment , which opened in the United States this week .
Even though it received lukewarm reviews , it is likely to be a sure - fire hit with opponents of the junta , with some even hoping it could spur a change of regime in the impoverished southeast Asian nation .
“ This movie could fuel the sentiment of Myanmar people to invite American troops to help save them from the junta , ” one Yangon resident told Reuters by e-mail .
In the movie , John Rambo , played by Hollywood superstar Sylvester Stallone , comes out of retirement in Bangkok to save a group of Christian missionaries taken captive by troops in the jungles of eastern Myanmar .
As with previous Rambo films , it is short on plot and long on blood and guts -- although viewers appear to think it is all relative .
“ Rambo acted very cruelly , but his cruelty is nothing compared to that of the military junta , ” a Myanmar student in Thailand , who did not wish to be named , told Reuters .
In addition , the bureaucratic entanglements that these two farmers faced at the Farm Service office were substantial .
The federal farm program is making it next to impossible for farmers to rent land to me to grow fresh organic vegetables .
Why ?
Because national fruit and vegetable growers based in California , Florida and Texas fear competition from regional producers like myself .
Through their control of Congressional delegations from those states , they have been able to virtually monopolize the country ’s fresh produce markets .
That ’s unfortunate , because small producers will have to expand on a significant scale across the nation if local foods are to continue to enter the mainstream as the public demands .
My problems are just the tip of the iceberg .
Last year , Midwestern lawmakers proposed an amendment to the farm bill that would provide some farmers , though only those who supply processors , with some relief from the penalties that I ’ve faced  for example , a soybean farmer who wanted to grow tomatoes would give up his usual subsidy on those acres but suffer none of the other penalties .
However , the Congressional delegations from the big produce states made the death of what is known as Farm Flex their highest farm bill priority , and so it appears to be going nowhere , except perhaps as a tiny pilot program .
Who pays the price for this senselessness ?
Certainly I do , as a Midwestern vegetable farmer .
But anyone trying to do what I do on , say , wheat acreage in the Dakotas , or rice acreage in Arkansas would face the same penalties .
Local and regional fruit and vegetable production will languish anywhere that the commodity program has influence .
Ultimately of course , it is the consumer who will pay the greatest price for this  whether it is in the form of higher prices I will have to charge to absorb the government ’s fines , or in the form of less access to the kind of fresh , local produce that the country is crying out for .
Farmers need the choice of what to plant on their farms , and consumers need more farms like mine producing high - quality fresh fruits and vegetables to meet increasing demand from local markets  without the federal government actively discouraging them .

Kosovo has been controlled by Nato's K - For
The recognition of independence for Kosovo raises serious questions of international law as well as sensitive diplomatic difficulties .
The United States and many European Union countries accept that Kosovo should no longer be formally part of Serbia .
They will recognise a limited form of independence for Kosovo , as recommended in a report drawn up for the UN by the former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari .
The EU is sending a major law and order mission to Kosovo , made up of 1,800 police and justice officials , including judges , in effect taking over from the current UN presence .
Serbia itself , supported strongly by Russia , rejects independence for Kosovo .
Serbia and Russia argue that there is no UN Security Council approval for the move and that the parties should continue negotiating until an agreement is reached .
Serbia offered Kosovo autonomy but not independence .
So what are the legal arguments for and against recognition ?
The arguments for After the war over Kosovo in 1999 , the UN Security Council took control .
In resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999 , it ordered the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( as it then was ) to withdraw all its forces from Kosovo and hand Kosovo over to the UN .
The problem is that although the resolution called for a " political solution to the Kosovo crisis " , it did not specify what that solution should be .
Acting to implement the Final Status outcome in such a situation is more compatible with the intentions of 1244 than continuing to work to block any outcome
EU document
And there has not been any further Security Council resolution mandating independence for Kosovo .
Many Western governments argue that because 1244 does refer to general principles that G8 foreign ministers had agreed in advance of the resolution , these should be used as the basis for the acceptance of independence now .
These principles include the deployment in Kosovo of " international civil and security presences " and " facilitating a political process designed to determine Kosovo 's future status " .
EU legal opinion The European Union has drawn up , as it is required to do by EU procedures , a document to justify its own mission to Kosovo and the arguments deployed are the same as the ones used to justify recognition .
The city of Mitrovica is a symbol of the Serb - Albanian divide
The document basically argues that independence for Kosovo is within the spirit of 1244 , if not strictly within the letter .
The 1244 resolution also envisaged a final status process and did not constrain or pre-determine its outcome .
" Acting to implement the final status outcome in such a situation is more compatible with the intentions of 1244 than continuing to work to block any outcome in a situation where everyone agrees that the status quo is unsustainable , " it says .
The document adds that this approach " will enable , rather than frustrate , the conclusion of the final status process envisaged in resolution 1244 " .
And it gives approval to international recognition : " Generally , once a entity has emerged as a state in the sense of international law , a political decision can be taken to recognise it . "
We are speaking here about the subversion of all the foundations of international law
Sergei Lavrov ,
Russian Foreign Minister
UN plans to tackle limbo Nato troops under the Kosovo Force ( K - For ) continue to be mandated by 1244 , the opinion holds .
As for the legality of the EU mission , the argument is that there is nothing to stop the EU from taking over from the UN , as 1244 simply refers to " international civil and security presences " .
In addition , it suggests that Kosovo could invite the EU to undertake this role .
The document interprets references in the 1244 preamble to Kosovo being part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and to the " territorial integrity " of Yugoslavia as being non-binding .
The arguments against The counter - argument by Serbia and Russia is simpler .
It is that Serbia , the sovereign state , has not agreed to independence for Kosovo , that there is no Security Council resolution authorising the detachment of Kosovo from Serbia and that therefore its independence is illegal .
Some European Union members - Greece , Spain , Cyprus , Slovakia , Bulgaria and Romania - agree , though they have not blocked the EU mission .
Serbia remains strongly opposed to independence Serbia and Russia also say that 1244 itself gives no authority for independence .
They point to article 10 of 1244 which authorises " substantial autonomy with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia " for Kosovo , meaning , in their view , that 1244 blocks independence .
And they argue that 1244 talks about international organisations being deployed in Kosovo " under United Nations auspices " , which an EU mission would lack .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had this to say on 12 February , in a translation by the RIA Novosti news agency in Moscow : " We are speaking here about the subversion of all the foundations of international law , about the subversion of those principles which , at huge effort , and at the cost of Europe 's pain , sacrifice and bloodletting have been earned and laid down as a basis of its existence .
" We are speaking about a subversion of those principles on which the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe rests , those [ principles ] laid down in the fundamental documents of the UN . "
The main principle he refers to is that borders should be changed only by agreement .
In Russia and Serbia 's view , since there is no agreement , there should be no recognition .

The Worst Mortgage In The World and A Look At Creative Mortage Loans
This is part of our series on “ scary money tips and stories ” .
Have you heard of the world ’s worst mortgage ?
It ’s this fictional doozy from MSN Money :
An interest - only , payment skipping / minimum - payment - option - enabled , negatively amortizing , no - money - down , no documentation , prepayment - penalizing , 3 - month LIBOR 40 - year adjustable - rate mortgage with a balloon .
But even though that loan is fictional , there are some real - life mortgages that may keep you awake at night .
Mortgage Loans That Can Give You Nightmares
There are so many types of loans to cover you as you buy a house , but there are some I ’d think twice before applying for .
There ’s this cluster of risky mortgage loans that was very popular during the housing boom but now is just getting its comeuppance .
I ’d rather rent until I can afford less expensive loans that do n’t have some hidden booby trap that springs out and forces me to foreclose .
Unless you ’re comfortable with the risk , I ’d avoid these if I were you :
Subprime Loans :
These are non-traditional loans that are offered at a rate higher than prime for those borrowers who do not qualify for prime rate loans .
Those with bad credit and who are at high risk of default , will be offered these loans if they decide to be homebuyers .
Critics of subprime lending point out that due to its nature , this type of loan is taken out by people who usually are not able to fulfill their payments and obligations .
And therein lies the risk because a subprime loan could be fine if you are able to make good on it .
However , people fall into the trap of getting into a loan based on a low teaser rate and do n’t plan on the consequences when it resets .
As we have read in the media , predatory lending practices exist in this industry thereby often causing default , eventual foreclosure and even bankruptcy .
Stated Income Loans :
The fact that these were also called “ liar loans ” somehow did n’t sit too well with me .
Though it may sound like a good deal : you ’re able to avoid the documentation needed to prove your income ( supposedly a benefit for those with irregular income reports ) , these loans are highly problematic once mismanaged .
In other types of loans , the bank assumes liability for the loan as they screen the borrower for eligibility ; but if the borrower takes out a stated income loan , he takes on that liability .
If he defaults on the loan , he may be cited as committing fraud .
Interestingly though , it is rare that such borrowers actually get prosecuted for fraud .
The reality is that stated income is another way for people to stretch into houses they ca n’t afford ( they are just hoping things will turn around or they can refi or sell at a profit ) .
A recent colorful example of such loans gone bad and its nasty consequences can be found in the saga of Casey Serin , a real estate investor who suffered foreclosures and notoriety for indiscriminately taking on liar loans .
Option ARMs :
When I first heard about this loan which belongs to a mortgage loan classification called a “ neg am loan ” , I thought it was great because it sounds so flexible : you can decide to pay your regular principal and interest , interest only or a minimum required amount that could be lower than your actual interest .
That last option is a catch because the difference between your minimum payment and interest is then added to your mortgage .
The danger is that if you are not fiscally responsible , you can end up owing much more than your house is worth .
Stats show that around 80 % of option arm customers make only the minimum payment .
Ouch !
More details of how scary it is here and here .
Interest Only Loans :
This may not be as bad as the Option ARM but can also blow up in your face .
You pay interest only for three to ten years then after that period , you are required to start paying down principal along with interest .
If you are n’t prepared to cover those payments , you ’re hosed .
It may be a reasonable choice of loan if you ’re moving from your home before the interest only period expires so that you are not subject to the payment reset , or if you have the money to pay this down later .
-ooOoo -
There ’s someone we know who is highly concerned by her highly leveraged position in rentals right now .
She owns homes in Arizona , Nevada , and other “ hot ” property markets of the last few years but she ’s now struggling with the negative cash flow she ’s experiencing after loan rate readjustments .
The only recourse is to sell off some of these money pit properties but she ’ll have to take some losses if she does so .
This is the common story plaguing new real estate investors who entered the market late .
I feel badly for her .
This is the unfortunate situation when you become over leveraged with properties especially when they are purchased at the peak of the housing market .
The temptation is great to follow suit like so many others who found the siren song of real estate investing as their answer to their financial future .
They forgot all too easily that timing and risk should not be ignored when entering such serious financial transactions .
When things get too complacent and rosy , there ’s usually a catch , with the market pendulum just about waiting to swing to the other side .
If you bought your house at the peak , it wo n’t be half as bad if you put down a large down payment or got a fixed rate loan or bought it with cash ( which is a less common occurrence given the price of properties nowadays ) .
That is not the scenario most people take because of one very common reason : AFFORDABILITY .
Many new mortgage loan products were therefore fashioned to assist prospective homeowners to afford homes regardless of their financial situation .
And these loans are a pretty scary bunch , particularly to those folks who probably need them the most : if you ’re least likely to afford such a loan but you can only qualify for such loans , then does n’t taking on such debt make for a toxic situation ?
Caveat :
My position here is always to take things conservatively and to proclaim : buyer beware .
Do your research before taking on the financial burden of a new loan .

PITTSBURGH -- Carnegie Mellon University 's Michael Bockstaller and Krzysztof Matyjaszewski have created a version of Harry Potter 's famed " invisibility cloak " for nanoparticles .
Through a collaborative effort , researchers from the departments of Materials Science and Engineering and Chemistry have developed a new design paradigm that makes particles invisible .
In a recent edition of Advanced Materials Magazine , the researchers demonstrate that controlling the structure of nanoparticles can " shrink " their visible size by a factor of thousands without affecting a particle 's actual physical dimension .
" What we are doing is creating a novel technique to control the architecture of nanoparticles that will remedy many of the problems associated with the application of nanomaterials that are so essential to business sectors such as the aerospace and cosmetics industry , " said Bockstaller , an assistant professor of materials science and engineering .
Colloidal particles are omnipresent as additives in current material technologies in order to enhance strength and wear resistance and other attributes .
Light scattering that is associated with the presence of particles often results in an undesirable whitish , or milky , appearance of nanoparticles , which presents a tremendous challenge to current material technologies .
Carnegie Mellon researchers have successfully created a way to prevent this problem by grafting polymers onto the particles ' surface .
" Essentially , what we learned how to do was to control the density , composition and size of polymers attached to inorganic materials which in turn improves the optical transparency of polymer composites .
In a sense , light can flow freely through the particle by putting ' grease ' onto its surface , " said Matyjaszewski , the J.C. Warner University Professor of Natural Sciences in the Department of Chemistry .
The new " particle invisibility cloak " will help create a vast array of new material technologies that combine unknown property combinations such as strength and durability with optical transparency .

I personally have never had a problem while traveling .
For the most part , people are excited to meet an American .
I would say that at least half the time , I am the first American they have ever met in their lives .
Of course , there are some places in the world where being an American has paid off better than others .
We have all heard the stories that start , " I walked into a bar , ordered a beer and I had all of these foreign women flocking to me ... just because I was an American ! "
I travel -- a lot -- and I have to tell you that these are some of my favorite stories to tell .
I devised this list based on my experiences and the stories I have heard from other travelers .
Not surprisingly , of the cities I have here , a majority are from the old Eastern Bloc .
Even though I am going to talk about ratios for some of these cities , I have found that this is not as important as the following criteria :
1 . Do n’t go in the summer .
Americans travel in the summer so if you head to these places in the fall or early spring you have a better chance of being the only American representative around .
2 . Ask the people that work in your hotel / hostel where they drink .
The tourist bars are great , but the local bars will have fewer travelers in them , so you will seem like a oddity .
People love to try new things , and you can be that new thing .
3 . Travel by yourself or with one friend .
A group of loud Americans is going to turn off even the most interested of foreign women .
4. Stay in Hostels .
Sign up with Hostelling International .
You can book online , see pictures of the places .
All their member hostels are clean and affordable .
The best thing about a hostel is that you meet other travelers that you can go out with .
There is a sense of community that you do not find in a hotel .
Also , you might never have to leave the place to find a nice young lady who wants to check an American off her list of things to do .
5 . Do n’t go to the American style bar more than once during your trip .
Sometimes you can find women here , but mostly it is other Americans .
Did you really just fly half way around the world to hang out with people that you could see down the block ?
Me neither .
On to the list ; these are in the order that I thought of them , not necessarily a ranking .
Moscow , Russia --
Why would I start with the most expensive city in the world ?
A couple of reasons spring to mind .
There are 10 million more women in Russia than there are men .
Add to that a crumbling economy , vodka ( lots of it ) , the Russian tradition of single women being looked down upon in society and you look like the proverbial knight in shining armor .
You are looking to have some fun and all she is thinking is that you might take her to America with you .
The other thing you have going for yourself here is that not many Americans travel to Moscow , so these lovely ladies do not get to practice their English -- I am sure that you 'll be more than happy to help them out .
Head over to Gorky Park or the GUM department store during the day to try and find some Russian beauties .
At night , go to whatever bar or disco looks like there are people in it .
Stockholm , Sweden -- Swedish Bikini team ?
That was really all I knew about Sweden before I went there .
Stockholm is another crazy expensive city , but well worth it .
The great thing about the Swedes is they have always been a very progressive society .
So the women are not only beautiful , but they are liberated .
They will buy you a drink in order to talk to you ; they make no pretenses about giving into their carnal desires .
Head over to Old Town and the surrounding neighborhoods .
If you are a music fan , there is live music every night of the week in Stockholm so you might be able to find a Swedish rocker chick .
English is not a problem here ; they have to take around six years of English in school .
You really have not lived until you have been hit on by a six foot tall blonde woman that could have walked right off the Swedish Bikini team .
Ask her to ride bikes around town and do n’t be surprised if she shows up on her bike in a little skirt .
Good luck taking in the sights .
London , England --
I am not purposely picking the most expensive cities on the planet ; it just happens that these are places it pays to be an American .
Unfortunately , with the state of the dollar in London you are going to pay double what you would anywhere else .
But you know how you feel when you see a marginally hot woman from England start talking ?
She goes up two notches on the scale , no ?
Well , our accent has the same affect on British people .
The good thing about the Brits is that they love to drink and love to talk .
So head into any pub in London and just start talking to people .
Be ready to talk a lot about Pop Culture and politics .
I know it is weird , but people outside of America can have civil conversations on the subject and they want to get a Yank 's point of view .
Dublin , Ireland --
This one surprised me a little as well , but hear me out .
If the English love to drink , the Irish live to drink .
I was drinking with a couple of people from Dublin .
We were drinking until ... well , the sun was coming up when I got back to my hostel .
Then I got a call the next day and the message said , “ Its 1 pm , we are in the pub , where are you ?
We started drinking again an hour ago .
Get your ass down here . ”
I fancy myself a drinker ; that was the first time in my life I have ever been drank under the table .
Dublin has passed Stockholm as the “ Casual Sex Capital of Europe . ”
Now you love me .
I read a survey that 1 in 3 Irish would have casual sex with a foreigner .
The advice for England holds true for Dublin .
Head to a pub and just start talking , you will be surprised how much people want to know about America .
Just check you ego and realize that the women are going to drink you under the table .
Tokyo , Japan - You have all heard the saying , “ I am big in Japan ” .
Well , that is true .
I am 6 ’ 2 ” and whenever I am in Asia I feel like a giant or a NBA player .
The Japanese are a little tougher to get through to than say the Irish or the English , as the language barrier can prove difficult to overcome .
They also have a lot of customs that I am not going to get into .
But head to a Karaoke bar and all pretense goes out the window .
( Just do n’t sing “ My Way ” by Frank Sinatra -- trust me . )
I put Tokyo on the list for two reasons .
Japanese men are enamored with blonde American women ; conversely , Japanese women need some variety , also .
What better way than with a big strapping American ?
Also , you know how weird the Japanese are , think of all the freaky shit that these little women have experienced .
There is nothing that you would not be able to do with them .
Think of the possibilities .
I will give you a minute .
Kiev/ Odessa , Ukraine --
Ukraine ( I have been told recently that it is politically incorrect to say “ the Ukraine ” now ) has the most beautiful women in the world .
More supermodels have come from Ukraine than any other country outside of the US .
This is another place the ratio comes into play : 54 % of the population is female .
It is cheap ; they are not on the Euro .
The people are extremely friendly .
This is another place where not a lot of Americans frequent , so when you walk into a bar and order , people are going to be instantly drawn to you .
I know I cheated a little by naming two cities here , but one , Kiev , is the capital and the other , Odessa , is a port and seaside town .
It would be worth it to check out both while you are there .
This is a discothèque culture so be ready to go and dance to weird thumping beats .
Who knows , you may end up hooking up with the next big thing in modeling , or her mother .
Head to the Andriyivsky Uzviz neighborhood in Kiev to try and find your hottie .
Prague , Czech Republic --
I know , I know .
Prague has become the place to go simply to say you have been there .
But I love this city .
I fell in love every five minutes .
My buddy who was with me actually walked into a street sign because his head was on a swivel .
The women here are gorgeous .
The Czech ’s can party .
You can have some Absinthe and let the green fairy lead you to the arms of a Czech princess .
Supposedly , the Czechs have a custom of infidelity , so if you see a hot woman with a wedding ring on , that does not mean she is off limits .
Like the rest of Eastern Europe , they are enamored with America .
So head to a dance club in Old Town and have at it .
They are not as forward as in Sweden , so you are going to have to put a little effort in .
Trust me , though , it is worth it .
Be ready to be out all hours of the night .
Prague has become such a destination that you never know who you are going to meet .
I met girls from Croatia , England , Texas , Germany , Russia and , of course , Czechs .
That is why Prague is still on this list .
Budapest , Hungary - Just a hop , skip and a jump from Prague are the two cities of Buda and Pest which form the capital of Hungary .
Budapest is what Prague was 20 years ago and is an unspoiled , sparsely - traveled - by - Americans wonderland of strikingly beautiful woman .
While it is starting to get more popular , you can probably still be one of the first people you know that has been there .
They are just dying to show off their city .
Head over to the pedestrian only Vaci Street and see if you can get one of the beauties to give you a guided tour of her fair city .
It is a city in which 53 % of the people are women , so you have got a good chance .
Hungarians can party as well , so be ready to tie one on and go with the flow .
You are going to be bouncing from one dance hall to the next and then to a small bar to end the night .
Sydney , Australia -- I love the Australians .
They are who they are and they love it .
Australia is a place where our accent pushes us up the hotness scale .
Also , it is so far away from us that most of them have never been here , so you have a lot to talk about .
The Australians drink and party like it is their job .
There is a mix of pubs and dance clubs and casinos have started springing up .
Just imagine meeting a cute , golden brown tanned cutie that can teach you how to surf , take you diving on the Great Barrier Reef ( which I realize is not near Sydney ) and then drink you under the table .
The girls of Australia make the 20 hour flight each way worth it .
Copenhagen , Denmark - Most Americans head to Amsterdam instead of Copenhagen , but most Americans are stupid .
While I do like Amsterdam -- I have been there six times -- I feel like it is not a place where being an American sets you apart .
But head over to Copenhagen , an equally sexually and socially liberal capital city , but with women that look like Helen Christensen walking around , and you have set yourself apart .
This is where not going in the summer is key ; the cruises that run through the Baltics are only there in the summer , so go in the fall and you might be the only American there .
Copenhagen is a café culture , so be prepared to do a lot of sitting around , smoking , drinking and talking .
Head over to the Norrebro and Vesterbro neighborhoods for the best bars in the city .
Very different vibe than Eastern Europe .
Riga , Latvia --
How about heading to an 800 year old thriving city that most of your friends can’t find on a map ?
Riga is a city that mixes Latvian and Russian cultures .
Under the Soviet regime , all the artists were ‘ encouraged ’ to live in Riga .
You also know that artists are usually more liberal in their thinking and now you know where I am going with this .
This place is a killer for being an American , because they are not used to seeing Americans .
You have a built in conversation , because you know nothing about Latvia .
That is , except for the fact that Riga has the largest concentration of Art Nouveau buildings in Europe .
Imagine a Latvian beauty ready to find out if everything is better in Americh .
It does not stink , my friends .
It does not stink .
A legally enforceable cinema - style classification system is to be introduced for video games in an effort to keep children from playing damaging games unsuitable for their age , the Guardian has learned .
Under the proposals , it would be illegal for shops to sell classified games to a child below the recommended age .
At present only games showing sex or " gross " violence to humans or animals require age limits .
That leaves up to 90 % of games on the market , many of which portray weapons , martial arts and extreme combat , free from statutory labelling .
Ministers are also expected to advise parents to keep computers and games consoles away from children 's bedrooms as much as possible , and ask them to play games in living rooms or kitchens facing outward so carers can see what is being played .
Ministers are also expected to recommend blocking mechanisms to protect children from seeing unsuitable games , emails or internet sites .
Discussions have already been held with internet service providers to see if an agreement on a standardised filter can be reached .
A review of violence and video games has been commissioned by Gordon Brown from the former television psychologist Tanya Byron .
She is officially due to report next month , but education and culture ministers have a sense of the report 's direction .
She has previously said she would examine the current classification system to see if it is confusing for parents .
The report 's contents , which include a lengthy review of the literature on the impact of video games on children , has been discussed between the Department for Children , Schools and Families and the Department for Culture , Media and Sport .
Ministers are anxious to strike a balance between the entertainment , knowledge and pleasure children gain from highly profitable internet and computer games , as well as the dangers inherent in the unregulated world of the net and its overuse by children .
Under the Video Recordings
Act , most games are exempt from the British Board of Film Classification and only lose this exemption if they depict , to any significant extent , gross violence against humans or animals .
Other games can be classified by a separate , entirely voluntary pan-European scheme administered by the Video Standards Council .
Policing such regimes is difficult as it is possible to buy games over the net and simply tick the box stating the purchaser is over 18 .
A new British Standards Institution specification proposed by Ofcom , the communications regulator , and the industry is expected to allow the developers of filtering products to test them against the standard designed to protect children and other users from illegal or unsuitable content .
Companies that pass the test will be able to display a child safety online kitemark .
Ministers hope the Byron review will act as a way of calming the debate about video games which has become increasingly polarised and based on prejudice .
They say they are also willing to examine proposals made by a Tory MP earlier this week for an internet standards authority to be set up to ensure that service providers offer a two - tier system with users able to pick content suitable for adults or children .
In a further sign of Tory concern , Julian Brazier will bring forward a private member 's bill this month giving powers for a new body to appeal against decisions of the BBFC in its classification of video games and DVDs .
Hugo Swire , a former shadow culture secretary , has suggested that the default setting for internet content would be for children , with a password or pin needed for unfiltered material .

I wonder why he was so sheepish so as not to tell how many lines of code he did on those wonderful revolting evoting machines .
And why did they not stay with Shawn Southworth , the certifier of all evoting machines ?
This is akin to the Butch Custody and the Hoppy Kid episode .
Hilarious .

I found a few more details about Raymond Michael Gibbons of Sugar Land that might interest you : http://onourradar.blogsp...-make-this-stuff-up.html
By the way , the single - family home at that address where his company is listed and I 'm guessing also where he may live is assessed at $ 207,000 .
I would n't be so sure he is n't embellishing his financial credentials a tad .
Googling is n't interviewing , mind you , but that cursory glance gives me the impression Suntron Corp. may have been his biggest claim to fame , and I 'm guessing he and Suntron parted ways some time ago .
That company 's latest big contract seems to be selling components for plasma TVs in Mexico .
Did n't strike me as voting machine experience .
His interest in Schroedinger 's cats , referring to the quantum physics genius who won the Nobel , seemed kind of creepy because , 1 ) the analogy between him inspecting these black boxes and the Schroedinger 's cat paradox , and 2 ) the woman who filed a lawsuit claiming George W. Bush raped her was Margie Schoedinger ( all but one ' r ' ) of ( cue " Twighlight Zone " music ) of Sugar Land , Texas .

Another great scoop Brad .
If I did n't know better I 'd be tempted to think you made this one up .
Sequoia has a long history of deception with their voting machine claims .
If they think this guy will clean up the corporate image they are sadly mistaken .
Maybe Tom Wilkey , head honcho at the EAC , will throw some work to Kwaidan .
Wilkey has previously shown his interest in helping Sequoia fix their voting machine PR problems .
However , having outfits like Kwaidan hunt for hackers does n't exactly build one 's confidence in Sequoia 's voting machines !

{ There are some url links from this excerpt , including to BradBlog , that I did n't include in this copy / paste .}
Meanwhile , Sequoia has responded to public pressure , kinda sorta , announcing it has submitted the broken voting machines used in New Jersey to third - party testing ( though only its own , hand - picked testers , of course ) .
Strangely , Sequoia parceled out its machines ' source code to an unknown company called Kwaidan Consulting Services of Houston , leading some bloggers to ask , Who the hell is Kwaidan Consulting Services ?
Looking up KwaidanConsulting.com does n't inspire much confidence .
My browser was immediately redirected to bnmq.com , which Spy Sweeper warned me was not a nice place to be .
( According to McAfee SiteAdvisor , bnmq is guilty of extreme spammishness . )
The Kwaidan domain is registered by a company called Prime Directive Inc. Calls to Prime Directive 's number went unanswered , as did email .
But a Texas corporate records search traces PDI to one Raymond Michael Gibbons , aka Mike .
Mike Gibbons has a solid geek pedigree --- an engineer and executive at K* Tec Electronics , later subsumed into Suntron , a contract manufacturer based in Phoenix .
Suntron makes the eSlate voting machines for Hart InterCivic , one of the few e-voting companies that rarely makes the news .
( If there 's a smoking gun connection between Suntron and Sequoia , I have n't found it .
But all you out there in Cringeville are welcome to try ) .

Hello
It 's my first post to this Board .
It appears to me that what we call CONSCIOUNESS is really an illusion .
We are incapable ( by our very design ) of perceiving reality .
In reality the past , present and future co-exist simultaneously painted on a FOUR dimensional landscape .
At a time like this , I am reminded of the famous quote from Werner Karl Heisenberg .
" We must remember that what we observe is not nature itself but rather nature exposed to our method of questioning . "
He used to have a drinking problem .

Post subject : " Advice : Touch Screen Display ? "
Anyone know which supplier manufacturers the touch screen in Coin Stars Prepaid System ?
See link below .

I 'm looking for something similar to this touch screen .
Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .
Cost is a key driver as is basic functionality .
Thanks in advance !

Socrates , it 's interesting that his and Margaret 's children are relatively young , given Mike and Marge 's ages .
I found a Raymond Michael Gibbons Jr. well established in New York ( at least I think it was New York I saw , but he 's not the story ) .
Might be coincidental name , but I 'm wondering if this is his second family .
If so , I wonder if there 's an ex somewhere .
I 'm always a little squeamish about delving into people 's personal lives , but because elections are n't about who votes but rather who counts the votes ( was that a Stalin quote ? ) , I think this contract makes him a figure of public interest .
I vote on these Sequoias , so it matters to me whether he 's legitimate to be the source to test the security and reliability of those voting machines .
I think Sequoia owes the public a better explanation as to why Gibbons , who seems to be a recovering alcoholic with personality issues , is solely suitable for Sequoia 's purpose but Princeton University professors are not .
It raises the question of just what is Sequoia 's true purpose .
I do n't see reason to assume it 's the same as mine , as a voter using that machine .
How is someone Sequoia hires " independent , " but experts from Ivy League academia that acquire a random machine to test are not " independent " ?
The terms " proprietary " and " independent " at this point seem to be conflicting terms .
If Sequoia continues to avoid these questions , I think NJ AG Anne Milgram and Gov. Jon S. Corzine should be held accountable to explain or sue Sequoia .
New Jersey 's Legislature just passed a law to extend , yet again , Sequoia and others ' deadline for retrofitting our machines with reliable printers that are supposed to allow every voter to verify their vote on paper .
Extension would be an abomination .
I expect Corzine will sign this legislation any day , if he did n't today , but there is a phone drive to persuade him to veto it .
I would like to see Milgram , New Jersey 's AG , order county clerks to convert every election exclusively to paper ballots and hand count votes until the technology flaws are 100 % resolved .
The machine companies need appropriate economic incentives , which they do n't now have at the all - you - can - eat public trough buffet .

So , if the above about Mr. Gibbons is true , that he used to work for Suntron , that is interesting .
Suntron manufactures Hart InterCivic 's eSlates .
At least , they did as of a few years ago , right there in Mike 's town , Sugar Land , Texas .
Suntron , although headquartered in Phoenix , does have a facility in Sugar Land , Texas .
It is located at Suntron Corp. , Electronics , 1111 Gillingham Lane , Sugar Land , TX 77478 , 281/243-5000 , and has been a major employer in this suburb of Houston .
Suntron is listed as an electronic manufacturer .
On its website ( www.suntroncorp.com), back then , it listed its areas as : Military / Aerospace
Semi-Cap Equipment
Industrial
Medical
In a Hart press release back in January 2004 , Hart mentions that Suntron did its manufacturing .
Hart Earns Prestigious ISO 9001:2000 Certification for eSlate Electronic Voting Systems Design , Development and Manufacturing Processes
January 12 , 2004
New link : http://web.archive.org/w...ress_releases.asp?id=118
Austin , TX – 1/12/2004 – Austin - based Hart InterCivic , developer of the eSlate� Electronic Voting System , recently upgraded its International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) 9001 certification to the newer , more comprehensive ISO 9001:2000 certification .
The new certification , which applies to Hart ’s design and development process for the eSlate System , builds on the requirements of the prior versions of the ISO 9000 standards family plus other International Standards , and takes into account their best practices .
Hart was awarded this updated certification at the higher standard following a stringent audit from Underwriters Laboratories ( UL ) .
Suntron Corporation of Sugar Land , Texas , Hart InterCivic ’s contract manufacturer of eSlate System components , also holds the ISO 9001:2000 certification for its manufacturing process , as well as
ISO 14001 certification in recognition of their environmental management system practices . …

Hi Molly McCoy , your blog is showing up near the top for this story .
Good job with that .
I agree with you that it feels awkward to delve into the private lives .
I was probably wrong to post about his alcohol problem .
You are correct that there can be people with the same name .
Then we can end up dragging innocent people into it .
Yeah , that was Stalin with the who counts the vote quote .
I am curious why he made that post asking about the touch screen machines back in 2004 .
I am sensing a conflict of interest with this Gibbons character .
He 's linked to Suntron and Hart InterCivic .
It 's as if this is Steven Hertzberg / ESI all over again .
It seems like we have another insider from the dark side acting as an impartial good guy to the rescue .
It 's like having Alberto Gonzales investigating the Bush Administration .
It feels like gatekeeping 101 .
Hertzberg actually had the gall to promote Damschroeder {sp .?} on the Democratic Underground .
Now we have Gibbons with his obnoxious myspace page .
I agree with you that we the people have the right to know who these people are and what qualifies them to be hired .
Hey Pokey , thanks for doing the follow up .
That connection stood out like a sore thumb for me too .
I am late to this election integrity topic .
But one thing I have been noticing a lot about some of these internet people are that they have ties to the military and other govt .
groups .
Mike Rivero .
Hertzberg .
Hal Turner was in direct contact with the FBI in a cointelpro like relationship .
Markos Kos Zuniga - the CIA .

Socrates , Gibbons reminded me immediately of Bev Harris ' memorable ( to me ) " This is Shawn Southworth in his office in Huntsville , Alabama . "
I do n't see evidence of Gibbons with Suntron since 2004 , and perhaps not since 2003 .
That last '04 SEC report he 's listed on relates to stock compensation for execs in '03 .
His was about $ 70,000 , and he 's among execs whose salary was less than $ 1 million .
He may well have an expertise in the area of voting machines , if he worked with the Hart contract you say Suntron had at least at one time .
That 's fine for Sequoia 's needs , but not for the public's .
Typically , " consultant " is another word for " hired gun , " someone who 's paid to rationalize a preordained conclusion , not to objectively investigate .
My rub is that voting machines are the most public business of a democratic government .
If counting my vote is going to be handled by private vendors , under our Constitution I should be not only entitled to know everything about this guy 's resume , but public officials are responsible to know it as a condition of the contract and OFFER it to the public .
There have to be checks and balances for anyone counting my vote .
" Proprietary information " is not OK .
It 's not as if we do n't have a choice .
Direct ballots and hand counts have been successful since the first cavemen put rocks on a stump to decide who would investigate the volcano .
Are most of us really too stupid not to demand better from our elected officials ?

That is the connection between Gibbons and Mireaux then , they did the testing when he was employed at Suntron .
I 'll venture to guess that UL subbed out that e slate testing to Mireaux

Basically all this amounts to is that Hart , by sending the machines to be tested by Kwaidan , is the same thing as sending them back to the people who built them to be tested in a roundabout way .
That is not independent testing Good find Socrates !!!

Or is this just an easy way for Sequoia to get certified through the back door like Hart did

SEQUOIA PIMPS ABOUND
… The only consultant Sequoia will ever hire is a pimp for the voting machine industry .
This has been demonstrated in the past by the company 's past hire of Steven V. Freeman ( not our election justice Freeman ; but rather a different Freeman ) who tested the Sequoia AVC Edge for the State of Nevada AFTER WYLE LABORATORY IDENTIFIED PRODUCT DEFECT AND FAILED TO CERTIFY THE MACHINE IN MAY 2004 .
Freeman rode to the rescue , arriving in Las Vegas , NEVADA tools ready to do his sleight of testing and certify Nevada 's machines with the help of another Sequoia shill , Clark County Registrar of Voters Larry Lomax .
Freeman testing a small sampling of machines ; hand selected by Lomax .
Surprise !
Surprise !
The machines passed testing and Freeman certified the machines .
But in a fit of conscience or perhaps just to cover his hiney FREEMAN REFUSED TO CERTIFY THE ENTIRE AVC CLASS ; AND CERTFIED ONLY THE SMALL SAMPLING OF GOLDEN GOOSE MACHINES HE ACTUALLY ‘ TESTED ’.
But that was enough for then Nevada Secretary of State Dean Heller and Sequoia executives who – with the tacit consent of the then Federal Elections Committee now morphed into the Elections Assistance Committee - thereafter deployed 1000's of AVC Edges replete with printer and unresolved product defect to every precinct in Nevada .
Consequently I have demanded that Sequoia and the State of Nevada test Nevada ’s voting machine systems to include not only the AVC Edge and Printer but also the WINEDS tabulator , the 400 C Optiscanner , and any other machines provided to the State of Nevada by Sequoia at a cost of $ 9,000,000 plus .
Just as they did in Nevada , Sequoia – empowered by the blessing of the State of Nevada and my county of Washoe ( NV ) Registrar of Voters ’ , Dan Burk , - threatened retaliation against me with promises of sanctions if I in anyway impugned the company ’s reputation and or hindered the sale of Sequoia Voting Machines to some other hapless State or City .
Guess what ?
Up popped my Irish and I pro se sued Sequoia , the State of Nevada and its ’ new Secretary of State , Ross Miller , Washoe County and Dan Burk , and Diebold / Premier Election Systems – the company that collaborated with Sequoia to manipulate Nevada ’s list of Registered Voters with provision of the defective DIMS Voter Registration and Voters ’ History System .
My State and County and Sequoia and Diebold have all responded with Motions to Dismiss .
Equipped with a tiny purse but a big mouth , a burning desire for accurate and honest elections and steel ovaries , I am legally outgunned with no fewer than 15 high - powered attorneys poised against me but I have not been dissuaded from pursuing litigation against these villains and my lawsuit goes on .
I can only hope that New Jersey – strengthened by all of the power and money of the State – battles Sequoia with anything that it takes to ensure election justice for its ’ people .
They have nothing to loose but Democracy .

The Gibbons ' cached myspace page leaves nothing to the imagination .
He clearly made it known that he is a selfish , Karl Rove Republican .
Steven Hertzberg also made things easier to understand when he made the endorsement of Damschroder at the Democratic Underground .
http://www.democraticund...67628&mesg_id=467760
11 . Good for Ohio Damschroder is clearly the best candidate for the job .
He 's one of the smartest and most capable election official in the nation .
He 'll do more for election transparency and accountability than anyone else in Ohio .
Election reformers who are able to remain objective and non-partisan should be supportive of this positive development .
Who is Matt Damschroder ?
http://www.politicalfrie...mp;name=Matt-Damschroder
After reading Patricia 's post , I sought out an appropriate BradBlog entry .
https://bradblog.com/?p=5353
John Gideon made a good post .
Then Floridiot made this one : John # 1 , what I would like to know is who originally hired all these assclowns in the first place , like who hired Freeman to the SOS Florida office ?
Who hired Southworth ? , Lewis ? , Coggins ? , and the list goes on .
Whose payroll were they on before they slipped into the electioneering racket ?
Me thinks it was something to do with politics of the " R " persuasion .
Were they all in the military before their previous jobs ?
Maybe it was innocently a random thing ( but I doubt that )
Just some shit I would like to know to find a common connection somehow .
Hertzberg worked for the military .
Mike Rivero worked for NASA , same as Hertzberg 's Jaiku contact , Andrew Hoppin .
The common denominator with these folks does appear to be the military and ties to the Republican party .
My opinion is that election fraud has primarily to do with propping up the military industrial complex .
How did Hertzberg , an aeronautical engineer , end up as the Director of the Election Science Institute ?
Why was he a prolific poster on a nutjob website called BreakForNews ?
Why did BreakForNews label Bev Harris as a " 9/11 CIA rat ? "
Why was Hertzberg astroturfing for Ron Paul and something he coined Full Spectrum Liberty ?
Why was Hertzberg as Navari so set on debunking man-made global warming ?
The United States is in a legitemation crisis .
All the astroturfers have left is to say to us , yeah , you figured it out , but so what , no one is listening and no one cares .
Unfortunately for them , people are becoming more internet savvy .
Good people are starting to figure out how to work together to get beyond all the smoke and mirrors .

Apparently , I think you have to be a fan of The Hulk comic books / movies to figure this one out .
There was a good joke in the name of The Kwaidan Corporation but you had to be a real hardcore movie buff to pick up on it .
" Kwaidan " was the name of Chinese movie composed of five separate ghost stories .
The Kwaidan Corporation was composed of five separate divisions that were no more than elaborate fronts or ‘ ghosts ’ to hide the true purpose of The Kwaidan Corporation .

Good job Brad great to know that we have people on thier toes so the truth can get put out to the people thanks .

One is that you said that you do not like looking into peoples private lives now come on you know you do and not just the one person but also thier family members .
Please be honest when posting here about that sort of thing because there is so much proff of you not having one problem with posting about people and thier families at many sites so please if you want people to be hinestthen youshould hold yourself to that standard also .
Need I show proff of this ?
My second problem with your posts is that you lumped Mike Rivero into your group of people working with the fbi cointro pol .
Now unless you can show proff of Mike Rivero having been involved in any of this you need to retract what you say or put up the proff .

The town of Sevagram in central India has long been known for three things : its heat , which is oppressive even by Indian standards ; its snakes , which are abundant ; and its ashram , a derelict and increasingly malarial retreat preserved as a tribute to Mohandas Gandhi , who lived here and was known for tenderly relocating the poisonous vipers that slithered into his shack .
Despite this intemperate setting , Sevagram 's hospital has a good reputation .
Though the power fails often , forcing medics to use the backlit screens of their cell phones for illumination , the standard of care is higher than at many of the country 's public hospitals , and the facilities are comparatively plush .
At the nearby government medical center in Nagpur , for instance , patients sometimes have to sleep on mattresses on the floor .
Last year , Sevagram began garnering even more cachet .
A German pharmaceutical company called Boehringer Ingelheim , whose latest stroke - prevention drug was making its way through the clinical pipeline , approved the town 's hospital as a trial site - one of 28 in India recruiting stroke victims to round out the company 's 18,500 - person study .
The drug regimen , known as Aggrenox , was being tested for its ability to forestall a second stroke .
S. P. Kalantri , the doctor tapped to lead the trial in Sevagram , quickly grasped the offer 's appeal .
Patients in Sevagram are poor enough that the benefits of taking part in the study would amount to a health care windfall ; among other things , Boehringer Ingelheim guaranteed participants two physicals during each of the three years that the trial would run .
For each person enrolled , moreover , the hospital would receive 30,000 rupees ( about $ 665 ) - no small amount , given the puny budget of the center 's stroke ward , a single room of eight pallet beds .
Kalantri talked the matter over with the chair of the hospital 's ethics committee , and the two concluded that the trial drug itself , with its possible side effects and limited efficacy , would provide little benefit to their patients .
Then they went ahead and signed up .
When I arrive in Sevagram on a typically sweltering October afternoon , Kalantri is midway through a busy day .
That morning , he attended to a farmer who had been bitten on the heel by a viper while sleeping , and then to a woman who had drunk a quart of insecticide in a suicide attempt .
He also checked on his regular patients : a man with cerebral malaria , two women with unexplained fevers , and a stroke patient who had hemorrhaged .
When I ask what treatment he gave to the stroke victim , he seems surprised .
" Nothing , " he says .
" There 's nothing we can do . "
Though hemorrhagic strokes are untreatable - drugs can't undo the damage - Kalantri's response echoed a more persistent frustration : that patients are too poor to pay for medicine .
Because of this , one of the alluring features of a clinical trial is that subjects are supplied with the test drug for free .
And while the medication on offer is n't always a very useful one , there 's still the chance that it will do some good .
This casual optimism contrasts sharply with the attitude in the West , where the number of patients willing to sign up for clinical trials is abysmally low .
Just 3 percent of cancer patients opt to join trials , and the number of US patients who sign up for cardiac trials has plunged by half over the past five years .
Such reticence has created a problem for the pharmaceutical industry .
Modern drug design may be a sophisticated enterprise , harnessing technology that did n't even exist a decade ago , but one part of the process remains the same :
The only way to tell how well a medication really works is to feed it to a sick person .
This process , the human clinical trial , is the largest and creakiest part of the drugÂ­making machine - a mammoth lab experiment that succeeds by brute statistical force .
To make it run , companies have to round up a large number of ailing people and then convince them to swallow an unproven remedy with uncertain side effects .
The experiment unfolds in three stages :
Phase I , when a compound is safety - tested on a few dozen healthy people ;
Phase II , conducted on a slightly larger group of mildly ill subjects ; and Phase III , which is the most extensive .
Involving thousands of subjects and taking up to seven years to complete , Phase III trials are the make - or - break point for new medicines and , because of their size , the hardest to fill with patients .
Exacerbating the problem is the fact that discoveries of rare side effects ( including lethal ones , like strokes and heart attacks caused by the arthritis drug Vioxx ) have pushed companies to conduct ever larger studies .
In the 1980s , a new drug typically was tested on 1,300 volunteers in a total of 30 trials .
By the mid-1990s , those numbers had swelled to 4,200 patients and 68 trials .
" Twenty years ago , drugs were dropping the cardiac mortality rate from 20 percent to 15 percent , " says Dhiraj Narula , medical director of Quintiles ECG , a contract - research firm that organizes trials for major multinationals .
" Today we 're looking at drugs that will take you from 6 percent mortality to 5 percent .
To prove an effect that subtle , in a way that 's statistically robust , you need a lot of patients in your sample . "
One cardiac drug study was conducted on a whopping 41,000 subjects .
The result is a bottleneck that Narula argues is impeding the arrival of important cures .
Herceptin - an exceptionally effective breast cancer drug - languished in trials for years because its maker , Genentech , reportedly could n't recruit enough patients to test it .
Like many in the pharmaceutical industry , Narula believes that the solution to the slow pace of drug trials lies in outsourcing .
As many as half of all clinical trials are already conducted in locations far from the pharmaceutical companies ' home base , in countries like India , China , and Brazil .
And many industry analysts expect the market to skyrocket , particularly as expanding libraries of genetic information increase the number of drugs coming out of the lab .
The consulting firm McKinsey calculates that the market in India for outsourced trials will hit $ 1.5 billion by 2010 .
Enticed by numbers like these , developing countries have been scrambling to catch Big Pharma 's eye - India most aggressively of all .
Like high tech call centers and software farms , which were meant to transform India 's computer industry by creating skilled workers and a stockpile of modern equipment , drug trial outsourcing is seen as the fast route to economic and scientific growth - a money train that the country can't afford to miss .
With this in mind , the government is working to advertise India 's most pharmacologically appealing qualities , notably its doctors ( English - speaking and educated abroad ) and its vast number of ailing patients - 32 million diabetics alone .
Many of these patients are also , in the delicate parlance of the drug world , " treatment naive , " meaning they 've never taken any medication for their illnesses .
This is a perk for trial managers , because it lowers the risk of unforeseen drug interÂ­actions and avoids the troublesome process of weaning patients off one medication and onto another .
Last year , the government took a more controversial step , amending a long - standing law that limited the kind of trials that foreign pharmaceutical companies could conduct .
That law allowed companies to test drugs on Indian patients only after the drugs had been proven safe in trials conducted in the country of origin .
In January , the government threw out that constraint .
India , the brilliant hub of outsourced labor , was positioning itself in a newly lucrative role : guinea pig to the world .
The headquarters of Sevagram 's Aggrenox trial , located around the corner from the hospital 's intensive care unit , is low on frills .
A drooling corner sink and two elderly computers list against the water - stained walls , under the benevolent gaze of a small plastic bust of Gandhi .
A handful of scientific papers have been tacked to the wall , where they hang unstirred by a sluggish fan .
Since recruitment for the trial began in January 2005 , Kalantri has signed up 44 stroke victims , a quarter of the number that have come through the hospital .
Nonetheless , Kalantri is uneasy about his clinical success .
" Patients here are very passive , " he reflects .
" They will almost never question their doctor . "
Indeed , one woman who joined the trial six months ago sits patiently for more than an hour while Kalantri translates my questions , before revealing that she is suffering from aches and fever that are likely malaria .
Such deference is hard to imagine in US patients - a querulous lot - and it makes Kalantri 's position tricky .
" Nine out of 10 times , " he says , " the patient will just ask me to make the decision about the trial for him .
So what role do I play ?
Am I a physician , concentrating on what 's best for the patient ?
Or am I a researcher interested in recruiting patients ?
I try to balance the two sides , but ... "
He shrugs .
" It 's a dichotomy . "
Kalantri began worrying about such matters not long after he started recruiting patients for Boehringer Ingelheim .
The previous year , he had overseen a trial for Reviparin , an anticlotting drug that improves the health of one out of 65 cardiac patients within 30 days of a heart attack .
The trial was enormous : Nearly 16,000 patients participated , half of them from India .
When the trial ended , however , Kalantri wondered whether he had served his patients well by enrolling them .
At 800 rupees a day , the drug they had taken was too expensive for any of them to afford .
Plus , even when it worked , it showed results for just a month .
Such a minute and costly improvement might make sense in the US , Kalantri felt , but was it really the kind of medication that poor Indians should be testing ?
" The biggest problems around here are snakebite and insecticide poisoning , " he points out .
" We could really use a trial for one of those . "
Kalantri is in a good position to observe such discrepancies .
He grew up in the neighboring town of Wardha , 15 minutes away by auto - rickshaw , and got his training at the local medical college in Nagpur - a city whose main claim to fame is a survey plaque declaring it to be India 's geographical center .
He is a slight man , with a philosophical and conscientious manner .
His wife is a database administrator for the hospital in Sevagram , and last year the older of their two children started attending medical school there .
Although Kalantri could probably work elsewhere - in 2004 , he did a stint at UC Berkeley , working on his master 's in public health and collaborating on a tuberculosis study that was published in The Journal of the American Medical Association - he remains attached to the rural hospital he joined 20 years ago .
" I found my peace of mind here , " he says .
Initially , Kalantri says , he was excited by the idea of bringing clinical trials to Sevagram and liked the prospect of turning his hospital into a research center .
" Drug trials can teach residents proper record - keeping and help them understand how to associate clinical care with research , " he notes .
When I first called him , shortly after a record rainy season , he mentioned that the emergency ward contained a number of patients with a mysterious fever - one that epidemiological tests had been unable to identify .
" It would be good to study it , " Kalantri murmured , sounding a bit regretful .
" Maybe we will , one day . "
Bringing trials to India , moreover , struck him as medically important .
A Nature Genetics article had recently surveyed 29 drugs whose efficacy and side effects varied in different racial or ethnic populations .
Perversely , testing drugs exclusively on Americans and western Europeans could almost seem colonial .
Little by little , however , Kalantri began to see the problematic side of outsourced trials .
" When I try to explain that a drug is experimental , that it might not work , the understanding is not there , " he observes .
" One woman said to me , ' What do you mean , the drug might not work ?
All drugs work ! ' "
Poorly paid doctors can also find the financial rewards of a trial hard to resist - particularly since pharma companies reward high enrollments with prizes like vacations to Hawaii and Europe .
" A lot of private hospital doctors have suddenly become ' researchers , ' " Kalantri notes .
" They will enroll almost anybody and recruit for almost any trial , whether or not it helps the patient . "
And while the money earned from a trial in Sevagram goes to the hospital , elsewhere it may be paid to the doctor .
" A lot goes into personal bank accounts , " he says .
NaÃ¯vetÃ© and corruption are hardly unique to India , of course .
They 're the early story of almost any developing industry , when regulation is still too flimsy to check the horses of rapid progress .
Compared to a country like China , for instance , India is alert to the potential for exploitation and has made at least some effort to safeguard its citizens .
Programs to train clinicians in World Health Organization - standard Good Clinical Practice - a set of international rules covering patient rights and data management - have sprung up around the country .
In addition , all trials must ostensibly be cleared by a local review board that includes one doctor , one lawyer , and one pharmacist , as well as a housewife and a social worker .
In practice , however , policing trials is not easy .
The enforcement staff of the Drugs Controller General of India - the equivalent of the US Federal Drug Administration - consists of just three pharmacists .
And the country has little history of keeping medical care independent of the pharmaceutical business .
The largest cardiac hospital in India , Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre , is a division of the massive Indian pharmco Ranbaxy .
" Are patients here more vulnerable ? " asks Brijesh Regal , CEO of the New Delhi - based firm Apothecaries , which runs clinical trials for pharmaceutical companies .
" Obviously .
They 're poor .
They 're illiterate . "
Nonetheless , he argues , most of the problems can be attributed to the growing pains of a new industry .
He points to the thalidomide fiasco in the 1950s - women who were given the drug for morning sickness delivered children with severe birth defects - as evidence that every developing industry has problems .
" Why are we so concerned about India ? " he asks .
" If problems happened everywhere else , they will happen here .
We are a massive country without a lot of regulatory infrastructure . "
Regal 's willingness to accept collateral damage may seem chilling , but it has some historical precedent .
The path of medical progress is strewn with cases of questionable ethics , desperate practices , and misguided experimentalism , if not outright exploitation .
And since patients with the fewest options are invariably the ones most likely to try ( or be forcibly volunteered for ) risky new treatments , be it an artificial heart , an unproven pill , or a radical lobotomy , they 're also the ones who bear the brunt of medicine 's experimental nature .
In this light , outsourcing trials to a country where decent medical care is scarce , and medication scarcer , is just the globalization of an old equation .
Kalantri , meanwhile , finds himself stuck in the uncomfortable role of gatekeeper .
" Every week , I get a call : ' Do you want to participate in this trial ? ' " he says .
So far , he has turned down one anti-osteoporosis trial and another for a drug that might improve patient survival after a heart attack .
He declined , he explains , because the studies " do n't make sense for India . "
Finding better treatments for osteoporosis and high cholesterol is important , he adds .
" But these are diseases that will cause problems at 40 or 50 .
Infectious diseases like malaria and filariasis kill at 20 , and they 're much more common here . "
Kalantri is also troubled by what he sees as skewed trial demographics .
" Ninety percent of patients being recruited in India are poor , " he says .
" That 's the reality .
Trials enroll very few patients who are rich , literate , and capable of asking awkward questions . "
But even as Kalantri has grown more selective , other Indian doctors are moving in the opposite direction .
And at his own hospital , Kalantri 's pickiness has been a subject of debate .
" Some of my colleagues are not exactly happy with these decisions , " he sighs .
" The extra money could be used to build the department . "
Finding a dollar amount that compensates medical centers properly - covering costs like blood tests and the extra time a doctor must spend with study patients , without amounting to a bribe - is tricky , Kalantri says .
He confesses that he has turned down trials because they paid too little .
Nonetheless , when a representative from Boehringer Ingelheim visited to check up on the paperwork , Kalantri felt compelled to mention that the amount the company was offering per patient seemed high .
The rep looked at him in surprise .
" You 're the first person to say that , " she said , giving Kalantri a puzzled smile .
" Everyone else has asked for more . "

A salamander ’s limbs are smaller and a bit slimier than those of most people , but otherwise they are not that different from their human counterparts .
The salamander limb is encased in skin , and inside it is composed of a bony skeleton , muscles , ligaments , tendons , nerves and blood vessels .
A loose arrangement of cells called fibroblasts holds all these internal tissues together and gives the limb its shape .
The Chamber of Commerce is seeking such changes .

Indeed , most of the Democratic candidates for president have offered proposals to expand the 1993 law , to provide paid leave and to cover millions of additional workers .
Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut was a principal author of the law .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York says it has been “ enormously successful . ”
And Senator Barack Obama of Illinois says that more generous family leave is an essential part of his plan to “ reclaim the American dream . ”
Susan E. Dudley , administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs , said , “ Research suggests that regulatory activity increases in the final year of an administration , regardless of party . ”
Whoever becomes the next president , Democrat or Republican , will find that it is not so easy to make immediate and sweeping changes .
The Supreme Court has held that a new president cannot arbitrarily revoke final regulations that already have the force of law .
To undo such rules , a new administration must provide a compelling justification and go through a formal rule - making process , which can take months or years .
Within hours of taking office in 2001 , Mr. Bush slammed the brakes on scores of regulations issued just before he took office , so his administration could review them .
A study in the Wake Forest Law Review found that one - fifth of those “ midnight regulations ” were amended or repealed by the Bush administration , while four - fifths survived .
Some of the biggest battles now involve rules affecting the quality of air , water and soil .
The National Chicken Council and the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association have petitioned for an exemption from laws and rules that require them to report emissions of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds a day .
They argue that “ emissions from poultry houses pose little or no risk to public health ” because the ammonia disperses quickly in the air .
Perdue Farms , one of the nation ’s largest poultry producers , said that it was “ essentially impossible to provide an accurate estimate of any ammonia releases , ” and that a reporting requirement would place “ an undue and useless burden ” on farmers .

Forget the Christmas pudding , stuffing and mince pies - it 's the turkey that really does the festive damage to your waistline , says a new report .
Far from being lean and healthy , white meat is full of the sort of fats that cause obesity and increase your chances of a heart attack , says a scientific study .
Poultry products sold in supermarkets contain far higher levels of adipose fat than previously thought , a team of nutrition experts from London Metropolitan University has found .
Professor Michael Crawford , who headed the team , said : ' The public thinks of chickens as lean products and a much healthier alternative to red meat .
But we found that typical supermarket chickens are very fatty . '
The biochemist blamed the over - feeding and lack of exercise involved in the battery farming of chickens for altering the birds ' natural physiological balance .
Turkeys produced using similar methods would be as high in ' bad fat ' as chickens , he added .
' People think that poultry is lean , but it is grossly fat , ' said Crawford .
' When I bought a turkey several Christmases ago it was perfect ; only a teaspoon of fat came out when it was cooked .
But a year later the turkey for that Christmas was absolutely swimming in fat in the oven tray , even though it was supposedly a free - range bird . '
Crawford and three colleagues at the university 's Institute of Brain Chemistry and Human Nutrition conducted tests on 52 batches of 14 different sorts of chicken products bought in high street supermarkets , such as legs , breast pieces and whole chickens .
The results showed that the amount of fat contained within these birds has risen dramatically in the last 30 years .
They found that in 13 of the 14 categories , the amount of ' bad fats ' , known as triglycerides , now outweighed the amount of ' good fats ' , called phospholipids , which are useful for brain development , often by massive margins .
Nine of the 14 sorts of chicken tested were organic .
But eight displayed the same unhealthy ratio of bad to good fat .
' That surprised us and will surprise consumers , who think that organic equals goodness , ' said Crawford .
While red meat has been identified by a growing number of studies as a potential cause of cancer , white meat has appeared increasingly appealing as a supposedly healthy alternative .
But the latest findings appear to pose a direct challenge to the FSA 's existing nutrition advice , which states that those ' making healthier choices when buying meat ' should ask their butcher for a lean cut and ' go for turkey and chicken , without the skin , because these are lower in fat ' .
An FSA spokeswoman said : ' The agency keeps a watching brief on emerging evidence and we will certainly look at this report once it 's published . '

WHAT makes Google so valuable ?
This week the search engine 's share price rose above $ 500 , valuing the company at more than $ 150 billion .
Investors ' optimism stems in large part from Google 's dominance in the booming field of internet advertising , which is currently worth around $ 27 billion a year and is expected to grow to $ 61 billion by 2010 .
In the longer term the internet is expected to account for at least 20 % of global advertising spending — around four times its share now .
So there are years of growth still to come .
But that rosy future could be in jeopardy unless the big internet companies , including Google , do more to clamp down on some dodgy practices on the web .
Concern has been growing in recent months that “ click fraud ” might undermine the industry .
The problem is that many of the clicks on internet advertisements are bogus .
The ability to aim such advertisements so that they pop up , for example , when a user searches for a particular word , is what makes them so valuable — and makes fraud so lucrative .
American law firms , for instance , are prepared to pay as much as $ 30 each time someone clicks on an advertisement after searching for “ mesothelioma ” — the name of an obscure asbestos - related disease .
It is , after all , quite an efficient way to find sufferers who might be interested in launching a money - spinning compensation lawsuit .
Sadly , cheating the system is easy .
It is done in two main ways .
The first exploits the fact that Google , Yahoo !
and other firms place ads on the websites of their affiliates , who receive a small cut of the advertising revenue generated by each resulting click .
Unscrupulous affiliates can generate a stream of bogus commissions by repeatedly clicking advertisements on their own websites ( or getting other people or machines to do so on their behalf ) .
The second form of click fraud is aimed at the competition : click on a rival company 's advertisements , displayed on websites or alongside the results of an internet search , and its advertising budget will swiftly be exhausted .
Estimates of the extent of click fraud vary , but it is generally thought to account for around 10 % of clicks on advertisements , though some estimates range as high as 50 % .
Disgruntled advertisers have launched class - action lawsuits against Google and Yahoo ! , and big companies are threatening to hold back spending on internet advertising unless the industry generally becomes more transparent and accountable .
Been there , done that
To some extent , these are the ordinary growing pains of a new industry .
A similar problem arose with television .
After the first television advertisement was screened in 1941 , advertisers wanted to know how many eyeballs they were getting for their money .
Television companies were at first reluctant to tell them .
However , during the 1950s and 1960s , proper rules , ratings and standards were gradually introduced .
Things are supposed to move more quickly on the internet .
But the big internet firms seem to have been worryingly complacent .
Small - business owners , to whom click - fraud is most apparent , grumble that Google and Yahoo !
have tried to play down the scale of the problem .
Eric Schmidt , the boss of Google , caused a storm earlier this year when he seemed to suggest at a conference that one solution to click fraud would be to “ let it happen ” , since advertisers would not be prepared to pay as much for bad clicks , so reducing commissions and hence the incentive for fraud .
He also joked that Google 's engineers were having “ great fun ” trying to keep ahead of the fraudsters .
And Yahoo !
concedes that click fraud has been a problem for years .
Stung by class - action suits , both Google and Yahoo !
now insist they are taking the problem more seriously and have agreed to go along with an industry plan to draw up new standards and set up an independent auditing system to reassure advertisers by the middle of 2007 ( see article ) .
Both now provide refunds to advertisers who spot dodgy - looking referrals .
Like recalcitrant teenagers , they are grudgingly giving in and doing the homework they should have done ages ago .
But as well as shoring up the current system , internet firms must also devote more attention to developing new models that are less vulnerable to fraud , such as pay - per-action , in which advertisers pay up only if visitors referred to their websites actually buy something .
Such new models will also require rules and standards to ensure that advertisers get what they pay for .
That will be difficult .
But if the internet giants do n't deliver what the advertisers want , advertisers will find other ways to market themselves .
And if the advertisements evaporate , so will that remarkable $ 150 billion valuation .
This is the beginning of a series of posts on sustainable development in Ruby .
No , I ’m not talking about writing code on wind - powered laptops while sipping fair - trade coffee .
But the sustainable development movement has a fairly direct analog in software development .
As programmers , we work within a code ecosystem .
The ease with which we write new programs is impacted by the choices of other coders before us , and likewise the decisions we make while coding affect other programmers down the line .
As with industrial development , in the early years of a particular software ecosystem it ’s not always obvious that the choices we are making might be detrimental to our successors .
The first generation of programmers is usually enthusiastic ; any failure is a personal failure , so you can gloss over those things .
It ’s the second generation that ’s going to be less enthused , that ’s going to stare in bafflement at these classes that mysteriously spawn methods , and trying to figure out what ’s going when there ’s an exception in dynamically generated code .
— Ian Bicking
When a programming language is relatively young , unsustainable practices often go unnoticed , or are dismissed as easily avoidable .
A mere flesh wound , says our programming primate : I usually do n’t get conflicts , so I ’ll pretend they wo n’t happen .
The thing is , as thing scale up , rare occurrences get more frequent , and the costs can be very high .
— Gilad Bracha
When a language is only a few years old , the amount of code written in it is necessarily small .
Legacy code is measured in the thousands of lines , rather than hundreds of thousands .
If a section of code , or a third - party library , is causing problems–well , you can always rewrite it .
As codebases grow , however , the rewrite option becomes less and less viable .
Coping with legacy code is an everyday fact of life for most professional programmers .
Parameters
If we take it to mean any and all techniques for making software more robust and easy to maintain , sustainable software development is a very broad subject .
Indeed , one could argue that most of the major advances in the software field in the last 30 + years have been made with sustainability in mind – OO , refactoring , TDD , to name a few .
In this and the following essays I ’m only going to be addressing one specific aspect of sustainability in the Ruby language .
I ’m going to be talking about the practice of dynamic class modification , colloquially “ monkeypatching ” .
I ’m addressing this subject because I believe injudicious use of dynamic class modification to be one of the greatest threats to long - term sustainability currently facing Ruby .
Definitions
What are we talking about when we say monkeypatching ?
Some divide dynamic class modification into two categories :
Runtime addition of methods
Runtime redefinition ( overwriting ) of methods
Some maintain that only the latter definition is true monkeypatching .
The line is blurrier than it might first appear , however .
If two separate libraries both add a # to_xml method to the Object class , then individually they are only adding a method , but when both libraries are required by the same program one will be overwriting the other–whichever one is loaded last .
For this reason I will use “ monkeypatching ” to mean both the dynamic addition and redefinition of methods , albeit with an emphasis on redefinition .
Specifically , I will be referring to dynamic non-local addition and redefinition of methods .
By non-local , I mean that the dynamic modification occurs outside of the original class definition .
The following is not a monkeypatch :
class
Foo attr_accessor : bar # defines bar , bar= # redefines bar def bar # ... end end
Whereas this version demonstrates monkeypatch :
class
Foo attr_accessor : bar # defines bar , bar= end # re-open the class class
Foo # redefines bar def bar # ... end end
No easy answers
this “ monkey patching ” thing is seriously powerful — Chad Fowler
languages — like Ruby — that include dangerous features give the fringe a broader latitude to invent new things .
Of course , they also break things and they invent stupid things and they get excited and write entire applications by patching core classes instead of writing new classes and commit all sorts of sin .
— Reginald Braithwaite
One of the things that ’s really great about agile languages is they give you the power to do anything .
One of the most horrible things about agile languages is they give every other idiot the same power to stab you in the back with a rusty pitchfork .
— Zed Shaw
This series will not tell you when to monkeypatch and when not to .
It is not my intent to set myself up as the arbiter of when monkeypatching is justified .
These posts make the assumption that you already understand that Ruby dynamism is both tremendously powerful and potentially dangerous .
I want to present some alternatives to monkeypatching , so that you can make an informed decision when deciding whether to use monkeypatching to solve a particular problem .
Conventions
In order to help you make that judgement , I ’ll be characterizing the techniques presented by their applicability .
Some of the aspects affecting applicability are introduced below .
In this context , the term “ vendor ” is used to refer to any code you do n’t have the ability to change upstream – whether from a third - party library , or written by another team down the hall .
The term “ target ” is used to mean a vendor - defined object whose methods you wish to modify .
Who controls creation of the target ?
Does your code call the class constructor , or is the object given to you already created by vendor code ?
Does your code call the class constructor , or is the object given to you already created by vendor code ?
Are you the only client ?
Is the target used by third - party code , or is your code the only code that touches it after it is created ?
Is the target used by third - party code , or is your code the only code that touches it after it is created ?
Can you intercept the target ?
If the target is produced and consumed by vendor code , is there still a point at which your code has access to it ?
Or is it ’s use completely internal to vendor code ?
These factors and others will affect which techniques are right for any given case .
Our phones take a beating practically everyday .
They may look shiny , cool , and innovative , but they can not take a punch .
We need a combination of the cool looks and durability .
Qian Jiang has designed the Soft Phone concept and at least gave us the durability part .
It may not look like all the new , technologically advanced cellphones out there , but the features may be enough to intrigue customers .
The Soft phone is as it sounds : a cellphone that is made of fabric and silicon , allowing it to live through a fall or intentional drop .
In fact , this phone asks you to squeeze and hug it , since it is created with that in mind .
Moreover , you can make a call or hang up by the level of squeeze you give this cellphone .
In case you want more features , this cell is built within a pouch like home .
It reminds me of the vehicle dashboard sun protectors .
If you are familiar with the ones that are made of fabric and silicon that arrive as a small circular shape , only to unfold to a larger dashboard protector … a very space efficient product .
With that , the soft phone provides such practicality : as you unfold the pouch , a qwerty keyboard is provided , along with build in earphones .
This idea may be great as a concept , but could you see yourself actually using one of these ?
If you would or would n’t , is it because of its looks , its material , or something else ?

Last week , I visited a Muslim place of worship .
A schedule for Islam 's five daily prayers was posted at the entrance , near a sign requesting that shoes be removed .
Inside , a barrier divided men's and women 's prayer space , an arrow informed worshippers of the direction of Mecca , and literature urged women to cover their faces .
Sound like a mosque ?
The place I 'm describing is the " meditation room " at Normandale Community College , a 9,200 - student public institution in Bloomington .
Until recently , the room was the school 's only usable racquetball court .
College administrators converted the court into a meditation room when construction forced closure of the previous meditation room .
A row of chest - high barriers splits the room into sex- segregated sections .
In the smaller , enclosed area for women sits a pile of shawls and head - coverings .
Literature titled " Hijaab [ covering ] and Modesty " was prominently placed there , instructing women on proper Islamic behavior .
They should cover their faces and stay at home , it said , and their speech should not " be such that it is heard . "
" Enter into Islaam completely and accept all the rulings of Islaam , " the tract read in part .
" It should not be that you accept what entertains your desires and leave what opposes your desires ; this is from the manners of the Jews . "
" [ T ]he Jews and the Christians " are described as " the enemies of Allaah 's religion . "
The document adds : " Remember that you will never succeed while you follow these people . "
A poster on the room 's door advertised a local lecture on " marriage from an Islamic perspective , " with " useful tips for marital harmony from the Prophet 's ... life . "
Other fliers invited students to join the Normandale Islamic Forum , or participate in Ramadan celebrations .
One thing was missing from the meditation room : evidence of any faith but Islam .
No Bible , no crucifix , no Torah .
Normandale 's administration is facilitating the room 's Islamization .
The college 's building crew erected the barrier separating men's and women 's sections , according to Ralph Anderson , dean of student affairs .
College officials also posted signs at the room 's entrance asking students to remove shoes -- a Muslim custom before prayers .
This was " basically a courtesy to Muslim students , " Anderson said .
Despite the room 's Islamic atmosphere , Anderson says it " is open to everyone . "
Why is the meditation room segregated by sex ?
" Muslim students prefer that areas be divided into male and female , " he said .
" Other students do n't care . "
Does n't sex-segregation present a constitutional problem in a public educational institution ?
" I do n't want to comment on that , " he said .
And the literature regarding Jews and Christians ?
" I would probably take it out if I knew it was in there , " said Anderson .
Normandale 's zealous effort to accommodate Muslim students is not new .
Chad Lunaas , a former student who works at the college part time , cites examples .
Last year on Fridays , he says , he often entered the bathroom to find that " every sink and toilet stall had someone washing his feet . "
Other students could n't use the bathroom at these times , and those who tried felt awkward .
Lunaas finally expressed his concerns to a Muslim student who " seemed to be in charge . "
" His attitude was , ' We do n't have to listen to you , we can do whatever we want , ' " he said .
Confrontations also erupted in the sex - segregated meditation room , according to Lunaas .
" Muslim students just took it over .
They made people who were not of the Muslim religion feel very uncomfortable , especially if they were female . "
One female student tried to use the room when Muslim students were in it , said Lunaas .
" She believed she should be treated equally .
They were telling her to leave , to take off her shoes , to go to the other side of the divider . "
Anderson says he met several times with concerned students .
But " the whole thing was just basically swept aside , " according to Lunaas .
The steps outlined here should help you setup Jenkins agents on AWS EKS clusters .
The agents are one - time only .
In other words , every build gets a fresh agent and then it is thrown away .
The big advantage with Kubernetes is the concept of the pod , which supports multiple containers as a unit , and we make use of that here by bundling a Docker - in - docker container along with the main JNLP container .
PreReq
– The VPC in which Jenkins Master is placed should have network connectivity via either being placed in the same VPC / VPC - peering / Transit - gateway connection .
Jenkins Master
– Plugin kubernetes - plugin https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin must be installed .
The minimum required version of this plugin is 1.23.2 , which can only be installed on Jenkins version 2.190.1 and up .
– awscli version requirement minimum 1.16.300 and up .
Previous versions do not support the command $ aws eks get - token which is a requirement for the plugin functionality .
– ( This is no longer required for Kubernetes plugin versions 1.24.1 and up )
Java option “ - Dorg.csanchez.jenkins.plugins.kubernetes.clients.cacheExpiration=60 ”
must be set in /etc / sysconfig / jenkins .
This is to force the plugin to refresh the EKS token every 1 minute .
The default cacheExpiration value is 24 hours which is much higher than the validity of EKS tokens ( 15 min ) .

Jenkins ELB
– The security group for Jenkins ELB needs to allow TCP : $JNLP_PORT and TCP:443 from the EKS worker - node security group .
This allows the launched pod to communicate back to Jenkins as “ Ready ” , among other communication .
The JNLP port for Jenkins is defined when you setup Jenkins and is found in Manage Jenkins .
EKS
– The EKS cluster security group needs to allow TCP:443 from Jenkins Master security group .
This allows Jenkins Master to communicate with EKS to launch pods .
– Modify the aws - auth ConfigMap for the EKS cluster to allow the Jenkins Masterʼs IAM role access to the EKS cluster to start / stop pods .
The IAM role of the Jenkins - Master should show up this way :
apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata : name : aws - auth namespace : kube - system data : mapRoles : | <- snip -> - rolearn : arn : aws:iam ::< snip - acc -num >: role / rol - ops - tool - jenkins - master username : jenkins groups : - fake - group - because - module - wants - it mapUsers : | mapAccounts : |
– Add a Role and a RoleBinding to the EKS cluster with policies that grant Jenkins permissions to spin up / down pods in the ‘ operations ’ namespace , among a few other actions .
If you use helm , this is how you could do it :
--- {{- if .Values.jenkins_agent.enabled - }} apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind : RoleBinding metadata : name : jenkins - agent - role - binding namespace : operations roleRef : apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io kind : Role name : jenkins - agent - access subjects : - kind : User name : jenkins apiGroup : rbac.authorization.k8s.io {{- end }} --- {{- if .Values.jenkins_agent.enabled - }} kind : Role apiVersion : rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 metadata : namespace : operations name : jenkins - agent - access rules : - apiGroups : [ " " ] resources : [ " pods " ] verbs : [ " create " , " delete " , " get " , " list " , " patch " , " update " , " watch " ] - apiGroups : [ " " ] resources : [ " pods /exec " ] verbs : [ " create " , " delete " , " get " , " list " , " patch " , " update " , " watch " ] - apiGroups : [ " " ] resources : [ " pods/log " ] verbs : [ " get " , " list " , " watch " ] - apiGroups : [ " " ] resources : [ " secrets " ] verbs : [ " get " ] {{- end }}
KubeConfig
– Generate a kubeconfig file for the cluster of your choice .
Run this on your computer after logging into the account holding the EKS cluster :
$ aws eks list - clusters -- region us - east - 1 -- output text CLUSTERS my - awesome - cluster - 7MWC
– Then fetch the kubeconfig for this cluster :
$ aws eks update - kubeconfig -- name my - awesome - cluster - 7MWC --kubeconfig config_file Added new context arn : aws:eks:us- east-1:<snip-acc-num>:cluster/my-awesome-cluster -7MWC to < snip >
Remember the location of this file on your machine .
Jenkins UI
These changes must be made manually from the UI .
Our Jenkins is built on EFS so our master remains stateless and stores everything on the EFS volume .
This EFS volume is backed - up regularly , plus we installed the Jenkins Config - History plugin that ensures that we ’re never far away from the correct config .
Credentials
Create a credential in Jenkins of Global scope and kind ‘ Secret file ’ .
Upload the kubeconfig from the previous step .
Configuration
Browse to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System
Scroll to the bottom and setup a new Cloud of type Kubernetes .
Setup the EKS cluster , choosing the kubeconfig credential created in the previous step .
The Kube URL and certificate are automatically fetched from the kubeconfig credential , and are not required to be set here .
Click “ Test Connection ” button and ensure you see a message Connection test successful before proceeding .
Enter the URL for your Jenkins website for “ Jenkins URL ” , such as “ https://jenkins.example.com”
Jenkins tunnel : is your Jenkins domain followed by the Jenkins JNLP port , such as “ jenkins.example.com:49817 ” .
This port is defined in Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure Security .
Next , click “ Pod Templates .. “ and click “ Add Pod Template ” .
The label defined in the “ Labels ” text - box is how you ’d use this agent from within your builds / pipelines .
Labels are separated by a space .
In the Container section , add a container that contains the jnlp - slave agent .
This is the container that runs the JNLP jar and connects the slave to the master .
Our image is hosted on ECR and is based off of this Dockerfile : https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-agent/blob/master/8/alpine/Dockerfile
You can add environment variables for this container .
In our case , we set one for defining the AWS region .
Optionally , add a second container .
In our case , we add a “ Docker - in - Docker ” image so we may build docker images in our pipeline .
Note , docker - in - docker requires that the container be run in the “ Privileged ” mode .
This checkbox is accessible by clicking on the “ Advanced ” button for the container section .
( Optional )
In the “ Advanced ” section for both the containers , add CPU and Memory limits to prevent the pod from consuming too much of available node resources .
Example :
( Optional ) Add raw - YAML for the pod to define additional Pod-spec .
In our case , we define a nodeSelector to select a set of nodes :
Next , scroll down and modify the “ Workspace Volume ” option to “ Empty Dir Workspace Volume ” .
The default option creates an EBS volume in the background which is not only unnecessary , but also slows down pod-launch times .
An empty - dir volume https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir provides a scratch space for the build , and uses the underlying EKS worker - node ’s disk .
Click “ Save ” at the bottom of the page .
You ’re done !

In this example , the ‘ infra - pod ’ agent is called at the pipeline level .
The first stage uses the jnlp container ( which , in our case , points to the infra-node image ) .
The second stage specifically calls for the ‘ dind ’ container within the ‘ infra - pod ’ and builds a docker container within it .
pipeline { agent { label ' infra - pod ' } // Pipeline options options { ansiColor ( 'xterm ' ) } stages { stage ( ' This stage uses the jnlp container ' ) { steps { echo " Test " withCredentials ( [ [ $class : ' AmazonWebServicesCredentialsBinding ' , credentialsId : " aws-nonprod " ] ] ) { sh ''' aws sts get - caller - identity ''' } } } stage ( ' This stage uses the dind container ' ) { steps { container ( ' dind ' ) { dir ( " containers " ) { checkout scm : [ $class : ' GitSCM ' , userRemoteConfigs : [ [url : " git@github.com : Example / containers " , credentialsId : ' github - jenkins - ssh - key ' ] ] , branches : [ [ name : ' master ' ] ] ] sh ''' docker build example - container -t . ''' } } } } } }
Sharing files between stages
The $ WORKSPACE is a variable available in your builds .
This variable points to the workspace directory for the current build , and it is shared across stages .
This is the mount that we configured when we setup the pod in previous steps .
This shared mount allows another subsequent stage to access files , artifacts , and directories created in a previous stage .
For example , you could create a Dockerfile in one stage and build a docker image in a subsequent stage using the ‘ dind ’ container .
One hundred years ago a Scientific American article about the history and large - scale structure of the universe would have been almost completely wrong .
In 1908 scientists thought our galaxy constituted the entire universe .
They considered it an “ island universe , ” an isolated cluster of stars surrounded by an infinite void .
We now know that our galaxy is one of more than 400 billion galaxies in the observable universe .
In 1908 the scientific consensus was that the universe was static and eternal .
The beginning of the universe in a fiery big bang was not even remotely suspected .
The synthesis of elements in the first few moments of the big bang and inside the cores of stars was not understood .
The expansion of space and its possible curvature in response to matter was not dreamed of .
Recognition of the fact that all of space is bathed in radiation , providing a ghostly image of the cool afterglow of creation , would have to await the development of modern technologies designed not to explore eternity but to allow humans to phone home .

Most parents like to pull out all the stops to make a child 's 16th birthday as memorable as possible .
But having a female stripper surprise your son in front of his teacher in class would not feature on many wish - lists .
Yet that 's what happened when one woman booked a special performer for her son's big day .
She stipulated that the surprise take place in drama class - and even asked the teacher to film it so the family could see the boy 's reaction .
But - thanks to what has been put down as a booking error - a female stripper turned up in place of the gorilla - suited man the unnamed mother had apparently asked for .
The stripper , who arrived on cue halfway through the lesson , first walked the birthday boy around the classroom on all fours .
Then , gyrating to the sounds of Britney Spears , she spanked him before stripping down to her bra and knickers and insisting the " naughty " schoolboy rub cream all over her body .
At that point , the teacher - who had not been told what the surprise would entail - called an immediate end to the show .
Last night , education officials launched an investigation into the bizarre incident at Arnold Hill School in Nottingham .
The pupil 's mother has told them she was the victim of a booking error .
Classmates refused to name the boy , claiming they had been told to stay quiet by teachers who insisted he was " already in enough trouble " .
But one teenager , who witnessed the show , said : " It happened just before lunch when we were in drama class , discussing our GCSE coursework .
" The teacher suddenly announced : ' Something is about to happen ' .
Then a woman in a very short skirt walked in dressed as a copper .
" She asked the lad to stand up , which he did , and told him he had been a very naughty boy because he had n't been doing his homework .
" Then she put on some Britney Spears music and got out a collar and lead from her bag and told him to put them on .
" No one could believe it .
Next she ordered him to get on all fours , led him around the classroom and hit him 16 times - one for each year - on the bottom with her whip .
" Then she took off some clothes until she was down to her bra and pants , pulled out some cream , put it on her buttocks and told him to rub it in .
" To be fair to the teacher , you could tell she was just stunned - and when
the cream came out she told the stripper : ' That 's it .
That 's enough ' . "
The teenager said the boy ran out of the classroom while the stripper calmly packed her bag and left .
" Everyone was in a state of shock , " added the source .
" Apparently the boy 's mum arranged the whole thing .
But all she wanted to do was embarrass him with a little bit of fun .
" She thought she had booked something like a gorilla to chase him around the classroom .
She certainly did n't expect anything like this .
" Apparently minutes before the stripper turned up the mum told the teacher something was going to happen and gave her a camera to film it all . "
A spokesman for the school would only say yesterday : " There was an incident , we are aware of it , and it is being dealt with . "
Nottinghamshire County Council , the local education authority , is investigating .
No pupils have been suspended and police officers are not involved .
Dave Lewis , of Nottingham - based agency Sam's Entertainment , said the firm who took the booking had acted unethically .
He said : " If this happened in front of the kids then it 's outrageous .
We get kids ringing up now and again , but we always say no .
" Sometimes someone will say they want something for their teacher , but when we ask for written permission they do n't call back . "
The publishing world was shocked to learn that the gang - life memoir “ Love and Consequences ” was a fake .
But even more startling was how that came to light .
The author , Margaret Seltzer , was exposed by her own sister .
While it is n’t clear why Ms. Seltzer ’s older sister , Cyndi Hoffman , took on the role of whistleblower ( neither sister returned phone calls ) , the incident throws a spotlight on society ’s conflicted expectations of sisterhood .
Even while criticizing Ms. Seltzer for her fabrication , some blog writers turned their ire on Ms. Hoffman , calling her a “ tattletale ” and speculating that she must have been jealous of her sister ’s success .
“ People were almost as fascinated by the fact that it was her sister as they were with the whole story , ” said Marcia Millman , a sociology professor at the University of California , Santa Cruz , and the author of “ The Perfect Sister : What Draws Us Together , What Drives Us Apart . ”
“ We have powerful expectations of loyalty from a sister , ” she added .
“ But along with the idealized image of sisters , that they are always close , there is a stereotype that sisters are very competitive .
It ’s the two extremes . ”

While unpacking groceries , you pull out the bag of apples and decide to eat one then and there .
You take it over to the sink , wash it off and -- with some effort -- peel off the little sticker .
Pausing to look more closely at the sticker you wonder , " What do those numbers mean ? "
As much as we may dislike them , the stickers or labels attached to fruit do more than speed up the scanning process at the checkout stand .
The PLU code , or price lookup number printed on the sticker , tells you how the fruit was grown .
As reported by Maria Gallagher , in the June 26 , 2002 issue of the Philadelphia Inquirer , by reading the PLU code , you can tell if the fruit was genetically modified , organically grown or produced with chemical fertilizers , fungicides , or herbicides .
Here 's how it works :
For conventionally grown fruit , ( grown with chemicals inputs ) , the PLU code on the sticker consists of four numbers .
Organically grown fruit has a five - numeral PLU prefaced by the number 9 .
Genetically engineered ( GM ) fruit has a five - numeral PLU prefaced by the number 8 .
For example , A conventionally grown banana would be :
4011
An organic banana would be :
94011
A genetically engineered ( GE or GMO ) banana would be :
84011
The numeric system was developed by the Produce Electronic Identification Board , an affiliate of the Produce Marketing Association , a Newark , Delaware - based trade group for the produce industry .
As of October 2001 , the board had assigned more than 1,200 PLUs for individual produce items .
Incidentally , the adhesive used to attach the stickers is considered food - grade , but the stickers themselves are n't edible .
Do you REALLY know what 's in your dinner ?
Today , 7 out of every 10 items on grocery stores shelves contain ingredients that have been genetically modified .
In other words , scientists are using new technology to transfer the genes of one species to another , and these altered foods are in the market stream .
And yet many scientists have concerns about the safety -- to people , wildlife and the environment -- of this process .
That 's why consumers in Asia and Europe are demanding that their food be free of genetically modified ingredients .

As early as next week , the Pentagon plans to lob a missile at a satellite falling toward Earth , in an unprecedented effort to keep the satellite 's toxic fuel from inflicting public injury or death , federal officials said Thursday .
The United States has never shot down a spacecraft with a missile , said Gen. James Cartwright , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
The military is not destroying the satellite to keep classified information from falling into the wrong hands , Cartwright and other officials said .
Downing the spacecraft is also not a way to test an anti-satellite missile , they said .
" This is all about trying to reduce danger to human beings , " said James Jeffrey , deputy national security adviser .
However , satellites carrying the same type of toxic fuel fall to Earth all the time , said Jim Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank .
Also , he added , no one has ever been hurt by falling satellite parts , mostly because so much of the Earth 's surface is water or thinly populated .
" The risk of this is very low , and that leads to the question , why bother ? "
Lewis said .
" This is n't going to popular " with other nations .
When China shot down a satellite in a 2007 test , it was widely condemned by other nations and left a wide swath of space debris that will endanger satellites and human spacecraft for years .
The U.S. National Reconnaissance Office launched the targeted satellite in December 2006 , Cartwright said .
It reached the proper orbit , but ground controllers lost contact with it .
It is now slowly falling out of orbit .
The satellite 's cost and exact purpose are classified .
Eventually , pieces of it will strike the Earth , though where they'd hit and how big they'd be are impossible to predict , said Graham Candler , an aerospace engineering professor at the University of Minnesota .
Among the pieces that could survive the trip through the Earth 's atmosphere is a 3 - foot - wide spherical tank containing 1,000 pounds of hydrazine , a toxic fuel used to maneuver spacecraft , including the space shuttle .
Hydrazine , Cartwright said , could spread over an area the size of two football fields and anyone caught in it could suffer lung damage and possibly die .
Three Navy ships will be stationed in the northern Pacific Ocean to shoot down the satellite sometime during a seven - to - eight - day window that will open early next week .
A missile equipped with target - seeking sensors and explosives will aim for the tank , in the hopes of venting it before the satellite 's pieces reach Earth .
The Standard Missile - 3 the Pentagon will use is reliable and successfully hit an incoming ballistic missile during a 2007 test , said Steven Schneider of Purdue University .
" It 's almost certainly possible to do , " said Ivan Oelrich of the Federation of American Scientists .
" Whether it is a good idea or not is another thing entirely . "

Hamsters are one of many items imported illegally
The Ministry of Agriculture says anyone caught with a hamster will be fined up to 30 m dong ( $ 1,900 ) - almost double the average annual wage in Vietnam .
The authorities say the creatures are a potential source of disease .
Officials have also expressed concern that the animals are imported from China and Thailand without proper licensing or controls .
In a tropical Asian country like Vietnam , hamsters are not a traditional pet of choice .
That role has normally been held by various types of fish .
But a combination of factors including growing incomes and the Chinese Year of the Rat have made the beady - eyed rodents highly desirable .
They have been trading for $ 10 to $ 20 each and are reported to be a hit with the young population of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City , spawning a whole sub-culture of hamster forums and hamster clubs .
But the authorities are concerned .
Traded illegally from China or Thailand , the hamsters are unlicensed and unchecked .
The Ministry of Agriculture has highlighted the risk of disease .
The animals are just one of many imports that escape adequate scrutiny or epidemiological control in Vietnam .
A recent survey alarmingly showed that most anti-malaria drugs - in Vietnam and other countries of the region - were fakes traced back to China .
And reports abound of other counterfeit or dangerous items sold for human consumption - including rather startling internet rumours of a trade in fake chicken 's eggs .
Teaching 4.5 million doller robots karate is exactly what we do not want to do .
Have we learned nothing from Skynet , Screamers , and Teddy Ruxspin ?

We would need to stop it before the creation of " Only the Strong 2 " with Robots .

The National Debt in the United States is now over $ 9,000,000,000,000 ( that ’s trillion , baby ! ) .
Never before have we owed so much to so many .
Did you know that we owed China $ 408 billion ?
Even more staggering is the $ 611 billion we owe Japan .
The debt ceiling has been raised five times in the last five years to allow government spending to spiral completely out of control .
And who has to pay this money back ?
Certainly not the people writing the checks .
It ’ll be the people who are too young to vote now who will have to deal with this mess later .

Which face looks more attractive ?
The images are identical except for the direction of the gaze , which is off - centre in the right - hand image .
More people prefer the direct gaze on the left ( Image : Claire Conway )
It ’s official : you are more likely to think other people are attractive if they are looking straight at you and smiling .
The finding helps to explain long - standing questions over the subtle ways in which evolution can determine human preferences .
An important question in biology is whether a particular function or ability is the result of evolution or an accidental byproduct of it .
Some biologists believe that human perception falls into this second category because there has been little evidence that how we perceive things like faces affects our biological success in ways that are selected for or against .
But the evidence is mounting that evolution has conditioned our perception in subtle ways .

Claire Conway and colleagues at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland , UK , paired nearly identical photos of computer - generated faces , with smiling or disgusted expressions .
The pair differed only in where the irises were pointed : straight at the viewer , or off to the side ( see image top right ) .
Several hundred Aberdeen undergraduates , in the lab and online , rated the faces for sexual attractiveness , and for likeability , a sexually neutral quality .
Both men and women found faces looking straight at them to be more attractive and more likeable , even if the faces looked disgusted though unsurprisingly , there was a greater preference for smiles .
Sexual bias
But when the viewers were rating the faces for attractiveness , the preference for being gazed at directly by smiling eyes was much greater for faces of the opposite sex , especially when they were rated by men .
There was no such sexual bias in the preference for a direct gaze when the students rated disgusted - looking faces , or when they were rating any faces for likeability .
The Aberdeen team says the sexual bias in subjects ’ perception of sexual attractiveness in a direct , smiling gaze is hard to explain as a functionless byproduct of perception .
But it could have evolved to ease the effort of mating , by directing efforts towards people who are already expressing an interest .
The idea that evolution played a role in determining our facial preferences is backed up by other work , such as research showing that perceptions of attractiveness change depending on peer pressure , or even the time of the month .
What about cultures , common in Asia , where gazing directly at someone is rude ?
“ The Asian participants [ in the study ] demonstrated preferences for direct over averted gaze , ” Conway told New Scientist .
But these are private preferences , she cautions .
“ Whether or not such preferences are also expressed in public situations we do n’t know . ”

Teacher Melissa Moss Sent Topless Photos to Student
is a 27 year old English teacher who emailed two nude photos of herself to a 15 year old student in her class .
The pictures were found by the boys parents in November , while they were checking their son's internet activity on his home computer .
The Chesterfield , Missouri couple took the evidence to police and officials at the prestigious Barat Academy , where Moss is employed and their son attends classes .
Other parents were stunned by the charges .
Barat Academy is a private catholic high school that has only been operating since September 2007 .
Debby Watson , Barat Academy president , gave the following quote :
" It 's frustrating , it 's upsetting , it 's disappointing .
It 's all of those emotions .
But what I 'm most proud of is that parents did the job they needed to do .
And they work in partnership with the school . "
A letter was sent home to parents after the allegations surfaced , letting them know of the situation and alerting them to steps that were being taken .
Officials say that Moss did not send the photos from school computers .
She has been fired from the school and faces up to a year in jail and $ 1,000 fine if she is found guilty of the charges .
According to our source at The Post Chronicle , Melissa Moss was charged with misdemeanor ' furnishing pornographic material to a minor ' in St. Charles County Circuit Court on Tuesday .
There is no indication that any physical contact occurred between the student and teacher .
A profile has come up on Facebook.com supporting Moss ; with people posting messages supporting her and saying they want her back at Barat Academy .
Bizarre .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Google has seen an acceleration of Internet activity among mobile phone users in recent months since the company has introduced faster Web services on selected phone models , fueling confidence the mobile Internet era is at hand , the company said on Tuesday .

Early evidence showing sharp increases in Internet usage on phones , not just computers , has emerged from services Google has begun offering in recent months on Blackberry e-mail phones , Nokia devices for multimedia picture and video creators and business professionals and the Apple iPhone , the world ’s top Web search company said .
“ We have very much hit a watershed moment in terms of mobile Internet usage , ” Matt Waddell , a product manager for Google Mobile , said in an interview .
“ We are seeing that mobile Internet use is in fact accelerating .
The growing availability of flat - rate data plans from phone carriers instead of per-minute charges that previously discouraged Internet use , along with improved Web browsers on mobile phones as well as better - designed services from companies like Google are fueling the growth , Waddell argued .
Google made the pronouncement as it introduced a new software download for mobile phones running Microsoft Corp ’s Windows Mobile software that conveniently positions a Google Web search window on the home screen of such phones .
Similar versions of the search software which Google introduced for Blackberry users in December and certain Nokia phones in February have sped up the time users take to perform
Web searches by 40 percent and , in turn , driven usage .
The software shortcuts the time it takes for people to perform
Web searches on Google by eliminating initial search steps of finding a Web browser on the phone , opening the browser , waiting for network access , and getting to Google.com .
By making a Google search box more convenient , mobile phone users have begun using the Internet more , the company said .
“ We are actually seeing a 20 percent increase in the number of searches by people , ” Waddell said .
Google ’s mobile plug - in software lets users customize their phones to feature Google mobile services instead of relying solely on software features network carriers have pre-installed on the devices .
“ Faster is better than slow , especially on a mobile device , where fast is much better than slow , ” Waddell said .
“ Not only are we are seeing increased user satisfaction but also greater usage . ”
Microsoft expects to have sold 20 million Windows Mobile devices by the end of its fiscal year in June , which together with Blackberry and Symbian - based phones represent upward of 85 percent of the Internet - ready smartphones sold in the world .
Users of phones based on software from Research in Motion , Nokia 's Symbian - based phones and now Microsoft Windows Mobile can download the software at mobile.google.com /.
Google officials said in August that they had seen a similar surge in usage of Google.com via mobile devices following the launch of the Apple iPhone last year .
The iPhone offers a full - featured Internet browser unlike many phones .
Waddell said Google had seen iPhone users perform as many as 50 times more Web searches on these computer - phone devices as users of standard mobile feature phones typically do .
Wal - Mart Yanks Linux PC From Shelves , Keeps Them Online
The sale of Everex gPCs was a test run more than a gung ho endorsement of Linux 's readiness , according to the retailer .
( click image for larger view )
Based on the gOS Rocket Linux operating system , Everex 's gPC2 now sells for $ 199 at Walmart.com .
After only a few months on the shelves , the plug has been pulled on the Linux experiment at Wal - Mart stores .
Wal - Mart had been selling Everex 's gPC for $ 199 since November , but decided to scrap the offering in its stores .
The retailer will continue to sell the PC at its online store .
" It looks like this particular product serves our online customer space best and that 's where we 'll continue sales of Everex , " Wal - Mart spokeswoman Melissa O'Brien said in an interview .
Wal - Mart.com sells nine different Everex models , including two Linux laptops and the gPC 's successor gPC2 , which is a Linux desktop like the gPC .
The Linux models range from $ 199 to $ 399 .
They all run gOS , a Linux distribution created by Good OS that comes bundled with icons to launch a number of Google - run and other online services .
A company spokesman told InformationWeek last year that the gPC had been a " top performer " online .
Other major retailers , including Best Buy and Sears , also sell Linux - based PCs through their Web sites , though not in stores .
The sale of Everex gPCs in Wal - Mart stores was a test run more than a gung ho endorsement of Linux 's readiness , according to Wal - Mart .
The company only offered Everex gPCs in 600 of its more than 6,800 stores worldwide , with some stores only getting one Everex gPC to sell .
" It has to do with what customers are shopping for in our stores , " O'Brien said .
" There 's a limited amount we can sell and display in stores . "
Wal - Mart is known for doing extensive data mining to figure out what items should be sold and how at Wal - Mart stores .
O'Brien earlier told the Associated Press that Wal - Mart had sold out of the first run of Everex gPC's , but she was n't able to express that same certainty to InformationWeek .
Thus , it 's unclear if the company decided to cancel the offer due entirely to a lack of demand .
Linux is not necessarily Everex 's strong suit .
On its own Web site , Everex recommends Windows Vista Home Premium to buyers , not gOS .
The gPC is also a relatively stripped down desktop .
Its 512 Mbytes of RAM is barely enough to run the cheapest versions of Microsoft Windows Vista , and it does n't come with a monitor .
Everex did n't respond to inquiries in time for this article .

Emma Heming & Bruce Willis Dating ( Photos )
, 52 , and , 27 , are dating .
She is a lingerie model and actress and he is a Golden Globe and Emmy winning actor and singer .
He came to fame in the late 1980's and is best known for his role in the Die Hard series .
The photos of the couple were taken in Park City , Utah during the Sundance Film Festival .
Willis was married to actress Demi Moore .
The couple had three daughter from that union , which ended in divorce after thirteen years in 2000 .
He has starred in over sixty films , including Pulp Fiction , Armageddon and The Sixth Sense .
Heming recently had a role in the 2007 film Perfect Stranger , the same movie ( no coincidence ) Willis starred in , with Halle Berry .
Willis certainly seems to gravitate to dark haired , dark skinned , brown eyed women .
Heming and ex-wife Demi have a similar look .
We are aware that Bruce , Demi and husband Ashton Kutcher have a very unusual relationship .
They appear to be one big happy family .
Hopefully there is room for one more .
It looks like both Demi and Bruce have determined that they are looking for youthful partners .
The age difference between Bruce and Emma is 26 years .
Demi and Ashton have a 15 year difference in their ages .
UPDATE : Emma Hemming and Bruce Willis Married

If John McCain is our next President it 's not just possible , it 's a good bet -- and an invasion of Iran would be inevitable .
How long would it take ?
Six months ?
A year ?
The very thought of Lieberman as head of State , Defense or DHS scares the hell out of me .
From Raw Story :
If Sen. John McCain ( D - AZ ) prevails in his bid to keep the White House in Republican hands for the next four years , one of his most hawkish colleagues could find himself overseeing the Department of Defense , State or Homeland Security within a McCain White House .
Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman , the Democrats ' onetime vice presidential nominee who left the party last year , is seen as a likely McCain pick for a cabinet level appointment , according to Roll Call :
Atop McCain ’s short list , according to closely aligned Republican Senators and aides , likely would be two of the Arizonan ’s most vocal supporters : Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) for attorney general or Sen. Joe Lieberman ( ID - Conn . ) as secretary of State , Defense or Homeland Security .
Graham and Lieberman have been stumping for McCain for months and are considered two of the most loyal and ardent backers of his Iraq War policy .

Tweet Blu - Ray tells their first adopters to bend over as the players they bought are now obsolete so to speak and cannot take full advantage of Blu - Ray 's features None of the first Blu - Ray players , the Profile 1.0 players , can be upgraded to Profile 1.1 , which was finalized recently , with the exception of the PlayStation 3 .
Likewise , Profile 2.0 is expected to arrive in October bringing Internet connectivity that Profile 1.1 players lack .
Representatives at the Blu-ray booth at CES said that the PlayStation 3 is currently the only player they would recommend , due to upcoming changes to the platform .
But Pioneer , Samsung , Panasonic and Sony have all been selling standalone Blu-ray players to customers .
So what do you do if you were a early adopter of Blu - Ray hardware ?
Your basically out of luck , and will have to buy a new player to enjoy all of the benefits of Blu - Ray .
Okay , I ’m getting a little belligerent , but here ’s my opinion of yoga : yoga is a great physical and spiritual practice , but not a complete exercise it itself !
Do n’t turn into a yoga “ wimp ” .
My tip for today is :
“ Whether you ’re a man or a woman , whether you ’re young or old , lift weights for building strength . ”
If you do n’t already lift weights , you should start .
The benefits are numerous :
– Weight lifting will energize you , add functional strength that you can use
– It will improve your posture and reduce your risks of osteoporosis
– It will improve your balance and coordination
– It will improve your immune system and make you less prone to low - back injuries
– It will improve your digestion , your resting heart rate , your muscular endurance
– It will help you look younger , and help you burn more calories when you ’re at rest ( more muscles burs more calories ! )
– It will improve your confidence and may your daily activities easier
And that ’s not to speak of the cosmetic aspects !
Do n’t start thinking that you will look like the pictures of “ Hulk ” in the magazines … that ’s very unlikely unless you train specifically for that !
Now … when I say weight lifting , I actually mean lifting actual weights , not just your body .
Although bodyweight exercises are great , and I really recommend them , I think everybody needs to actually pump some iron if they want to increase their strength .
Bodyweight exercises mostly build your muscular endurance .
Weight lifting builds your strength .
In theory , you could design some body weight exercises that can also build your strength … but those are too challenging for the average person .
Can you reasonably expect to do a “ handstand pushup ” ( which means you ’ll have to stand on hands , against a wall , and push up ) ?
That ’s the way to build strength on your shoulders using body weight exercises only .
But with weight training , you only have to lift a weight above your shoulders to achieve the same benefits .
So this is much more accessible to most people .
Do n’t think you need any special equipment to start weight lifting , or any expensive gym membership !
All you need are a set of dumbells .
Overtime , you can purchase heavier ones or buy a set of adjustable dumbells ( If you can save for it …
I recommend the best in the world … the Powerblock , a http://www.powerblock.com)
Then you also need an adjustable bench .
And that ’s it !
That ’s all you need to get started .
Of course , you also need to know what exercises to do .
For that , you can learn the routines from a friend .
You can buy a book on the subject ( a good eBook I recommend can be found at : http://fredraw.westy04.hop.clickbank.net/)
All you have to do is to train for about 30 minutes three times a week , and you will build more strength !
Remember , this is important especially as you get older , and especially if you ’re a woman ( although men need it too ! ) , because typically women and old people tend to avoid strength - building activities .
So start getting stronger now !

Hau can stop a pulse of light in midflight , start it up again at 0.13 miles per hour , and then make it appear in a completely different location .
" It 's like a little magic trick , " says Hau , a Harvard physicist .
" Of course , in all magic tricks there 's a secret . "
And her secret is a 0.1 - mm lump of atoms called a Bose - Einstein condensate , cooled nearly to absolute zero ( - 459.67 degrees Fahrenheit ) in a steel container with tiny windows .
Normally — well , in a vacuum — light goes 186,282 miles per second .
But things are different inside a BEC , a strange place where millions of atoms move — barely — in quantum lockstep .
About a decade ago , Hau started playing with BECs — for a physicist , that means shooting lasers at them .
She blew up a few .
Eventually , she found that lasers of the right wavelengths could tune the optical properties of a BEC , giving Hau an almost supernatural command over any other light shined into it .
Her first trick was slowing a pulse of light to a crawl — 15 mph as it traveled through the BEC .
Since then ,
Hau has completely frozen a pulse and then released it .
And recently she shot a pulse into one BEC and stopped it — turning the BEC into a hologram , a sort of matter version of the pulse .
Then she transferred that matter waveform into an entirely different BEC nearby — which emitted the original light pulse .
That 's just freaky .
Hey , Einstein may have set that initial speed limit of light , but he only theorized about BECs .
" It 's not breaking relativity , " Hau says .
" But I 'm sure he would have been rather surprised . "

Aug. 9 , 2006  -- Brandi Koch of Clearwater Beach , Fla. , says she feels as if she 's living in a horror movie .
She claims she has colored fibers coming out of her skin .
Brandi is married to Billy Koch , a former Major League baseball player who was one of a handful of pitchers who could throw a ball at more than 100 mph .
Koch says her life was good , until one day in the shower she noticed something strange -- tiny fibers running through her skin .
" The fibers look like hair , and they 're different colors , " Koch says .
Koch says she knows that what she 's experiencing " sounds crazy , " but it 's true .
" If I had a family member call me up and say , ' I have this stuff , ' I 'd say , ' I 'm sending a straitjacket over .
You need some help . ' "
Anne Dill describes a similar condition .
Looking at Dill 's life , it appears as if she 's living an idyllic existence in a home on Florida 's Lake Mary .
Her three daughters excel in sports and are straight - A students .
But life in the Dill household is far from idyllic .
Anne 's 40 - year - old husband , Tom , died in January and she believes his death was due to a contagious illness that has infected her entire family .
Dill describes her family 's skin : " There 's this fibrous material .
It 's in layers . "
Dill says the skin on their hands is particularly bad , very swollen and itchy .
She says it feels as if bugs are crawling underneath the skin .
Consulting Doctors
Dr. Greg Smith of Gainesville , Ga. , has been a pediatrician for the past 28 years .
He claims a fiber is coming out of his big toe , and he has video footage to prove it .
" It felt like somebody stuck a pin in my toe and wiggled it and it just continued to hurt , " Smith says .
He says he never thought he had bugs .
" I 've certainly had those crawling sensations , and the fibers which come out of the skin are really bizarre , and really odd . "
When Koch , Dill and Smith consulted doctors , they received diagnoses that they call wrong or dismissive .
Dill 's doctor told her to stop scratching , even though many of her sores were in places she could not reach .
Koch went to the Mayo Clinic , where doctors did n't believe that the fibers she 'd brought them had grown from her body .
" I saw the infectious disease doctor , and I showed him some samples that I had and he snickered .
I can't go through another doctor blowing me off or looking at me like I 'm crazy .
I know I 'm not , " says Koch .
Smith -- a doctor himself -- was handed over to a hospital psychiatrist when he went to the emergency room complaining of a fiber in his eye .
He admits that he , too , would be skeptical if a patient came to him with the same story .
" I would wonder if they 'd taken their medicine that day .
It makes no sense .
It 's totally bizarre .
It 's something that -- just telling the story is so outlandish on the face of it -- that no one would believe it , " Smith says .
Dr. Vincent DeLeo , chief of dermatology at New York 's St. Lukes - Roosevelt Medical Center , weighed in on what he'd say to someone who came to him with this condition .
" I do n't think this is any different than many patients I 've seen who have excoriations and believe that there is something in their skin causing this . "
DeLeo says the open lesions are a result of scratching the skin .
But for biologist Mary Leitao of Surfside Beach , S.C. , medical skepticism was something she refused to accept .
Relying on Your Own Research
Her son , Drew , was just 2 years old when Leitao noticed an odd sore on his lip that would not heal .
" He very simply said ' bugs , ' and he pointed to his lips , " says Leitao .
Leitao never expected to find herself at the center of a medical storm .
But when her son complained about that strange sore , the biologist , who once ran the electron microscope at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , did what any scientist would do .
She took a closer look .
" What I saw were bundles of fibers , balls of fibers , " Leitao says .
" There was red and blue . "
Even stranger , they glowed under ultraviolet light .
Armed with research , Leitao took her son to a doctor at one of the country 's leading hospitals .
He dismissed her tale of fibers and wrote to her pediatrician , saying that her son needed Vaseline for his lips and that his mother needed a thorough psychiatric evaluation .
Undaunted , Leitao began poring through the medical literature looking for clues .
What she discovered was a 17th - century reference to a strange disease with " harsh hairs " called " Morgellons . "
She named the strange fibers Morgellons disease and put the information on a Web site , Morgellons.org .
Since then , more than 4,500 people have contacted Leitao , claiming they have Morgellons - type symptoms .
The name has stuck , and the disease was featured on the television show " ER . "
But do these fibers grow from inside the body -- as Morgellons patients believe -- or do they come from the external environment -- a kind of lint -- as the medical skeptics say ?
Searching for an Answer
Forensic scientist Ron Pogue at the Tulsa Police Crime Lab in Oklahoma checked a Morgellons sample against known fibers in the FBI 's national database .
" No , no match at all .
So this is some strange stuff , " Pogue says .
He thinks the skeptics are wrong .
" This is n't lint .
This is not a commercial fiber .
It 's not . "
The lab 's director , Mark Boese , says the fibers are " consistent with something that the body may be producing . "
He adds , " These fibers can not be manmade and do not come from a plant .
This could be a byproduct of a biological organism . "
While they wait for evidence that they hope will convince the medical community to take them seriously , some Morgellons sufferers wear pink bracelets that say , simply , " Fortitude . "
Dill says she looks at pictures of her family from just four years ago and finds them unrecognizable .
" My kids have to see not only their dad but their mom disintegrating , and that 's gotta be really scary . "
Morgan Motor Co. , the tiny British automaker so old - fashioned it still uses wood frames , is stepping well into the future with LifeCar , a hydrogen fuel cell hybrid it says will prove " a zero-emission vehicle can be fun to drive . "
Morgan will unveil the hand - built aluminum - bodied coupe next month at the Geneva Auto Show , and although there 's no word on whether LifeCar will ever be more than a one - off concept , the company hopes to show hydrogen is a viable - if distant - alternative to fossil fuels .
Morgan has spent more than two years working with a British defense firm , two universities and a hydrogen supplier to develop a car it promises will " minimize the fuel cell cost and provide the fuel economy for a 200 mile range . "
As impressive as the LifeCar is , what makes it truly remarkable is a company so small as Morgan built it .
The company , founded in 1912 , employs 156 people who built 650 cars last year - all of them by hand in a small factory in rural England .
Yet it is standing alongside Honda , General Motors and BMW with a hydrogen - fueled vehicle that works .
Morgan 's cars look like they were designed in the 1930s , and LifeCar draws on that decade 's streamlined art deco aesthetic .
LifeCar is based on Morgan 's Aero Eight and uses a fuel cell built by British defense contractor QuentiQ.
Charles Morgan , the founder 's grandson , said the challenge was to build " a proper sports car , " and meeting it required a novel approach .
" The use of ultracapacitors to store the surplus energy and then use this for acceleration and braking does promise a dynamic ride , especially when combined with our ultra light chassis , " Morgan told Business Week .
" The paring of weight to a minimum is our strength and allows a much smaller fuel cell than conventionally though necessary .
This gives energy and yet more weight savings . "
Britain's Department for Trade and Industry helped finance the project , which reportedly cost 1.9 million British pounds ( about $ 3.7 million at today 's exchange rate ) .
The collaborative effort included Cranfield University , which developed the on - board computer and control systems , and Oxford University 's work on the regenerative electric motors .
We called Morgan and were told quite politely the company had nothing to say about LifeCar right now but will provide more information next week .
Meanwhile , here are some conceptual renderings of the car and pictures of it under construction .
Some managers go beyond being dictators to becoming real psychos .
They treat their employees as their slaves .
Whatever you do is not good enough , they keep criticizing and under - estimating your work .
They always think that whatever they do and say is brilliant and whatever you do is disappointing .
They interfere in your daily work to the extent that they paralyze you .
I came across one of those once .
The ironic thing is I was an Organization Development manager with 11 years of working experience .
So I was on a strategic managerial post and I was supposed to have responsibilities and authority to manage my projects .
The healthy way to deal with me was to evaluate my work based on results .
But instead see what she used to do :
1- Insist that I CC : her on every email I send .
2- Read every email and find something one way or another to criticize in the email .
( Something like the tone of the email might annoy the audience , not clear enough ….. )
3- Insist on attending most if not all the meetings I conduct .
4- Criticize me in front of the audience sometimes .
5- Criticize my work all the time especially if my customers praise it .
6- Continuously add new projects to my schedule ( overloading me to the max . ) and still request very tight and unreasonable deadlines .
This of course is to give herself the pleasure of criticizing me for being late .
7- When the time for the quarterly evaluation comes , she gives me a completely unfair evaluation .
And when I ask for logical explanation , she is unable to give me one .
She starts saying stupid things like : “ Everyone thinks your work is not good enough ” .
Of course without saying WHO “ everyone ” is and WHY it is not good enough and WHAT exactly is not good enough about it .
8- She wants to be treated as GOD .
Whatever she says I should agree with .
Whatever she wants she gets anytime .
9- Start all her meetings after 6:00 p.m. and if I start complaining and asking not to be forced to stay late every day then it becomes a big issue .
And suddenly I get comments like “ It is not professional to refuse staying late ” .
10 - Go to the CEO ( her boss ) and show - off her work and exaggerate its impact and results .
And when it comes to my work that she is supposed to report to him , she either undermines or does not mention at all as if I am not doing anything .
The funny thing is the projects she was responsible of did not deliver outstanding results as mine did .
As a matter of fact I am convinced that she used to treat me in such a way because she was jealous that everyone is praising my work and not hers .
Also because her way of dealing with people was extremely repulsive , ( arrogant , bossy and aggressive ) , people preferred dealing with me .
I think that made her jealous too .
WELL , how to deal with such psychos ?
1 - Resign to get rid of the headache .
2 - Be his / her slave as he pleases .
And of course praise him all the time , befriend him and feed his ego .
3 - Go behind his back and befriend his boss , praise him and feed his ego .
Then use your relation with his boss as your boss ’s whip .
As for me , my choice is 1 - all the time as I can not do , neither 2 - nor 3 - .
It is not just me to be a slave or hypocrite .
As a matter of fact I feel sorry for such people that they have to live with themselves .
They are really sick and they definitely need help .

Stock Market Crash Danger as Imminent Downgrades of Credit Insurers Threatens US Economy
Credit Insurers Must Keep AAA Rating or Else -
This week , on Thursday , February 14th , Bernanke spoke , markets fell .
Confidence in the Fed Chairman wanes .
From a fundamental perspective , until something is done to bail out the credit insurers , so they maintain their AAA rating from Moodys and S&P , market rallies will be corrective .
This is an economic nuclear bomb at 32,000 feet .
This is about bank solvency , bank risk - based capital , the bank credit function , not about the insurers themselves .
Should a downgrade come to the insurers , billions of municipal bonds will effectively become illiquid , joining the trillion of CDOs ( mostly subprime loan securities ) that have already become illiquid .
Without a bailout here , we are headed for a depression .
Period .
None of this is lost on the markets .
Technical analysis does n't predict the news , it just recognizes those periods ( Bear markets ) when a cacophony of bad news , macroeconomic screw ups , frauds , etc … are likely to occur , which in turn send market prices lower .
We are in one of those periods now .
How far down we go depends upon how the Master Planners and the mass of human psychology responds to the current financial crisis .
Some folks consider technical analysis rubbish , however the Dow Theory Bear Market signal came way back in November , and look at the bad news since .
So far , the Master Planners fiddle , and apparently the mass of human psychology is looking to Barrack Obama for a solution , the guy who defines $ 75,000 of income per year as rich .
If you make $ 75,000 , Dartmouth College gives your kid ( assuming he gets in ) a 100 % free ride .
So , who 's definition of rich versus poor is correct ?
And the Bear Market beat goes on .
The imminent downgrade of AMBAC , MBIA , and FGIC is the greatest systemic threat to our economy since the bank failures of the 1930s .
Sure they were mismanaged , sure they deserve to go belly - up , sure they failed to properly assess the risk of a systemic slowdown in mortgage backed securities they insured , sure they failed to charge the appropriate credit insurance premiums to securities underwriters for that risk .
But fact is , regulators blew it , which means our government blew it , and now the entire banking system is at risk , as is the ability for consumers to get a basic loan , because of loan restrictions banks face as underwater securities , due to declining market values on lower rated credit insured securities ( due to a ratings downgrade ) shrink risk - based capital levels .
Time for Congress to get to work .
Time for the most incompetent Fed Chairman since Eugene Isaac Meyer ( whom FDR canned out of necessity in 1933 ) , Fiddling Ben , to take the lead and put together a just and effective credit insurer bailout .
If Hillary wins , will Wall Street cheer ?
Would she axe Ben ?
Would McCain ?
Gotta believe Ron Paul would .
The St. Valentine 's massacre .
That 's how markets felt after listening to Hank and Ben on the hill Thursday , as they snuffed out a nice confidence - building three day rally earlier this week .
Here are some of their uninspiring comments that day : Bernanke proffered , “ the economy is likely to endure a period of sluggish growth … followed by a somewhat stronger pace of growth later this year , ” as the effects of the Fed 's rate cuts and a newly enacted stimulus package begin to be felt .
But his faith in the fiscal stimulus package and past rate reductions by the Fed are worrisome .
More is clearly needed .
In fact , Republican Senator , Richard Shelby , from Alabama , disagreed strongly .
In rebutting Fiddling Ben , he described the impact of the rebates as “ negligible , ” and he likened its action to pouring a glass of water into the ocean .
Based upon my own experience testifying on the hill , Senator Shelby knows a thing or two about the economy and the banking system .
Too bad he is n't the Fed Chair .
Probably the least inspiring quote of the day came from Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson .
Yes , Paulson does n't get a free pass here .
Senator Charles Schumer , a Democrat from New York , asked whether policymakers underestimated the severity of the situation .
Paulson 's response , and I quote , “ It 's one thing to identify a problem .
It 's another thing to know exactly what to do about it . ”
In other words , he does n't have a clue .
Just great .
The Treasury Secretary does n't know what to do about the most serious economic crisis in 80 years .
Probably the most accurate remark came from Senator Robert Menendez , a Democrat form New Jersey .
He criticized the Master Planners for what he believed was a too slow response to the housing crisis .
“ We count on those at the top . . . to sound an alarm during a crisis .
Instead what we got was a snooze button . . .
We 've been behind the curve . ”
Yes , just like in the 1930s .
Kind of strange :
It looked like Friday was more of a day where folks did not want to take positions before the long weekend ( U.S. markets are closed Monday ) , than a day where folks chose to dump positions .
In other words , staring a long weekend in the face , we did not see panic selling or anything resembling that .
This could mean the decline the past few days is merely a small degree corrective wave down , with another rally leg coming next week .
There is a lot of back and forth going on , which is typically a sideways consolidation , often occurring after sharp moves .
The trend going into the sideways move is usually the same trend that leaves it .
Keep your eye on the Credit insurance crisis .
That is key .
If it gets fixed , we should see a Bear Market bottom follow .
If it is ignored , we get the Great Depression of the 21st century .
Think cash , precious metals , and get out of debt .
The Head and Shoulders Pattern in the Chart below warns that should the Industrials sink below 11,600 , we are at great risk of a plunge all the way to 9,750 .

World industries gain market and position from creative works made by people .
In the last 60 years , as rewards to the creative fell , so to , participation of the creative fell towards nothing .
Any tactical analysts may find fundamental disorders in systems .
Thereafter , in correcting these disorders , analysts find only criticism at the door .
Industrial or corporate stability is immediately expensive , but instability is eternally nothing .
Will World finance recover ?

17 Feb 08 , 19:31 Against Bailouts
Sorry but I disagree strongly with the idea of bailing out the banks and the financial institutions .
Every time there is a finanical crisis the answer is always the same .
Let 's do a bailout .
The criminals are never punished .
And the American taxpayer foots the bill .
NO !
Not this time !

The hyoid bone helps to support the tongue and elevate the larynx when you talk or swallow .
It 's the only bone of the body that does not articulate with any other bone .
The hyoid is suspended above the larynx and is anchored by ligaments to bones in the skull .
Each Monday , this column turns a page in history to explore the discoveries , events and people that continue to affect the history being made today .
Our gift of the gab is all due to a small horseshoe - shaped bone suspended in the muscles of our neck , like a piece of fruit trapped in Jell - O .
The hyoid bone , which is the only bone in the body not connected to any other , is the foundation of speech and is found only in humans and Neanderthals .
Other animals have versions of the hyoid , but only the human variety is in the right position to work in unison with the larynx and tongue and make us the chatterboxes of the animal world .
Without it , we 'd still garble and hoot much like our chimpanzee cousins , scientists say .
The larynx drop
Humans likely had the capability to speak similarly to the way we do now about 300,000 years ago , based on discoveries of ancient hyoids .
Alongside the hyoid , another important anatomical change happened around the same time that really kicked speaking into high gear – the larynx drop .
In human infants , the larynx sits up high in the nasal cavity like a snorkel , so babies can drink and breathe at the same time .
But , around three months of age , the larynx " drops " much lower in the throat , making choking easier but speech possible ( the register of male voices lowers when the larynx drops again slightly during puberty ) .
No other animal has a larynx low enough to produce sounds as complex as our ancient ancestors did and as we do today , including our close relatives the chimpanzees , whose hyoid bone sits just a smidge too high to do anything but hoot and grunt .
Speech , language , talk shows
Those first words came from Homo heidelbergensis – the species of early human roaming the earth when our anatomy changed to allow complex speech .
Heidelbergensis , believed to be the related to both modern humans and Neanderthals , probably was n't Shakespeare - eloquent on his first try , but it was n't long before people were chatting up a storm .
As soon as speech became anatomically possible , putting the sounds together into a clear structure that everyone could understand – language , that is – became advantageous , anthropologists agree .
Complex speech meant individuals could share ideas and concepts like never before .
It 's no coincidence , say anthropologists , that we see the first hints of " culture " around this time as well .
Neanderthals , whose hyoid and larynx is almost identical to early modern humans , started to show signs of symbolism and religion about 100,000 years ago , by burying their dead with grave offerings .
Art and music followed soon after .
Neanderthal speech likely had fewer vowels and consonants , however , due to the restrictive shape of their nasal cavity , which was adapted for living in cold climates .
Just that little disadvantage may have led to the demise of the Neanderthals as opposed to our chat - happy ancestors , some experts say .

An engine driver climbs out of a locomotive at the ' Bahnhof Alte Suederelbe ' cargo centre of the harbour in Hamburg , Germany , November 8 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Christian Charisius
BUCHAREST ( Reuters ) - A Romanian train driver leapt aboard a runaway engine to stop it after having left the brake off in a station but was killed when the stunt backfired , railway police said Wednesday .
Ioan Colceriu , 55 , was at a train station in the central town of Odorheiu Secuiesc , when he realized he had forgotten some papers in the station office .
He went to fetch them but forgot to put the hand brake on the engine .
When the engine moved off without him , the driver flagged down a taxi and chased it for six km ( 3.7 miles ) before catching up with it .
He jumped aboard the moving engine but slipped and fell under its wheels , railway police said .
The engine traveled another 26 km until it was stopped by rail workers .
“ If you panic , you pay with your life , ” railway police officer Constantin Nut told Reuters .
Cheney ’s former chief of staff disbarred from practicing law in U.S. capital
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) — Former White House adviser Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , convicted last year for lying to a grand jury and federal agents probing the leak of a CIA agent ’s identity , was disbarred from practicing law in the nation ’s capital on Thursday .
“ When a member of the Bar is convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude , disbarment is mandatory , ” the District of Columbia Court of Appeals wrote in its opinion , which is posted on its Web site .
Last July , a court sentenced Libby , once Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff , to a 30 - month prison term .
President Bush later commuted Libby ’s sentence , calling it “ excessive . ” 
The president stopped short of an outright pardon , noting that “ our entire system of justice relies on people telling the truth . ” 

The effects of the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004 are only too well known :
It knocked the hell out of Aceh Province on the Indonesian island of Sumatra , leveling buildings , scattering palm trees , and wiping out entire villages .
It killed more than 160,000 people in Aceh alone and displaced millions more .
Similar scenes of destruction were repeated along the coasts of Southeast Asia , India , and as far west as Africa .
The magnitude of the disaster shocked the world .
What the world did not know was that the 2004 tsunami — seemingly so unprecedented in scale — would yield specific clues to one of the great mysteries of archaeology :
What or who brought down the Minoans , the remarkable Bronze Age civilization that played a central role in the development of Western culture ?
Europe ’s first great culture sprang up on the island of Crete , in the Aegean Sea , and rose to prominence some 4,000 years ago , flourishing for at least five centuries .
It was a civilization of sophisticated art and architecture , with vast trading routes that spread Minoan goods — and culture — to the neighboring Greek islands .
But then , around 1500 B.C. , the Minoan world went into a tailspin , and no one knows why .
In 1939 , leading Greek archaeologist Spyridon Marinatos pinned the blame on a colossal volcanic eruption on the island of Thera , about 70 miles north of Crete , that occurred about 1600 B.C.
The event hurled a plume of ash and rock 20 miles into the stratosphere , turning daylight into pitch darkness over much of the Mediterranean .
The explosion was recently estimated to be 10 times as powerful as the 1883 eruption of Krakatau in Indonesia , which obliterated 300 towns and villages and killed at least 36,000 people .
So extreme was the Thera eruption that many writers linked it to Plato ’s legend of Atlantis , the magnificent island city swallowed up by the sea .
Marinatos ’s theory was bolstered in 1967 when he dug up the ruins of Akrotiri , a prosperous Minoan town on Thera that had been buried in volcanic ash .
Akrotiri became famous as a Bronze Age Pompeii because the ash preserved two - story dwellings , exquisite frescoes , and winding streets almost intact .
On further examination , though , the ruins did not confirm the theory .
It turned out that the pottery on Akrotiri was not from the final phase of Minoan culture ; in fact , many Minoan settlements on Crete continued to exist for at least a generation or two after the Thera cataclysm .
Archaeologists concluded that the Minoans had not only survived but thrived after the eruption , expanding their culture until they were hit by some other , unknown disaster — perhaps some combination of fire , earthquake , or foreign invader .
Thera ’s impact , it seemed , had been overestimated .
But startling new evidence is forcing archaeologists to rethink the full fury of the Thera explosion , the natural disaster it may have triggered , and the nature of the final blow to the once - great Minoan civilization .
Each summer , thousands of tourists encounter the Minoans at the spectacularly restored ruins of Knossos , an 11 - acre complex four miles south of Crete ’s capital , Heraklion .
Late - 19th - century excavations by Sir Arthur Evans revealed Knossos to be a vast , intricately engineered , multistory building , complete with flushing toilets , statuettes of bare - breasted priestesses , and frescoes of athletes vaulting over bulls .
In 1900 , Evans discovered an impressive stone throne , from which he believed the legendary King Minos and his descendants had presided over Bronze Age Crete .
In the 1980s , however , a new generation of archaeologists , including Joseph Alexander “ Sandy ” MacGillivray , a Montreal - born scholar at the British School at Athens , began questioning many of Evans ’s assumptions .
Smaller - scale versions of Knossos have turned up at nearly every Minoan settlement across Crete , and scholars now suspect there was no single king but rather many independent polities .
MacGillivray also became interested in how the civilization ended .
At Palaikastro , in the island ’s far northeastern corner , MacGillivray and his colleague Hugh Sackett have excavated seven blocks of a Minoan town of perhaps 5,000 inhabitants , their plastered and painted houses arranged in a network of tidy paved and drained streets .
One striking find was the foundations of a fine mansion , paved with fancy purple schist and white limestone and designed around an airy central courtyard “ of Knossian pretensions , ” as MacGillivray puts it .
“ But after the house was destroyed by an earthquake , it was abandoned and never rebuilt , and that preserved some things we had a hard time explaining . ”
The house was dusted with a powdery gray ash , so irritating that the diggers had to wear face masks .
Chemical analysis showed that the ash was volcanic fallout from the Thera eruption , but instead of resting in neat layers , the ash had washed into peculiar places : a broken , upside - down pot ; the courtyard ’s drain ; and one long , continuous film in the main street outside .
It was as if a flash flood had hosed most of the ash away , leaving these remnants behind .
Some powerful force had also flipped over several of the house ’s paving slabs and dumped fine gravel over the walls — but this part of the site lies a quarter of a mile from the sea and far from any stream or river .
That was n’t the only oddity .
Another building “ looked like it had been flattened , the whole frontage facing the sea had been torn off , and it made no sense .
And we asked ourselves , could a wave have done this ? ” MacGillivray says .
+++
The strangest and most significant find , however , was a soil layer down by the beach that looked like nothing MacGillivray had ever seen in four decades as a field archaeologist .
A horizontal band of gravel about a foot thick was stuffed with a mad jumble of broken pottery , rocks , lumps of powdery gray ash , and mashed - up animal teeth and bones .
Perhaps an exceptionally violent storm had inflicted this chaos , MacGillivray considered , but he began to suspect that a tsunami was the more likely culprit .
The statue at Mallia may have been smashed and burned during an uprising against the Minoan elite .

MacGillivray invited Hendrik Bruins to Palaikastro .
The Dutch - born geoarchaeologist and human ecologist had a reputation as a skillful analyst of the thorny dating controversies that beset archaeology in the Middle East , but figuring out the chaotic layer overlooking the beach presented a novel scientific challenge .
“ Identifying a tsunami deposit is a completely new field , ” Bruins explains .
“ Until the early 1990s , earth scientists did n’t even recognize that tsunamis do more than just destroy the coast — they leave distinctive deposits behind as well .
I needed to do a lot of different tests to convince myself , as well as my colleagues , that we were dealing with a tsunami and not something else , like debris from a storm surge . ”
Another building looked like it had been flattened .
Could a wave have done this ?
Bruins sent thin sections of the chaotic deposit to micropaleontologist Chaim Benjamini , a colleague at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel .
Benjamini identified the tiny round shells of foraminifera and fragments of red coralline ­algae ; these marine organisms suggested that the ocean , rather than a river or a flash flood , had been involved .
If the marine organisms had been scooped up from below sea level and dumped on the elevated promontory , something much bigger than a storm surge must have pounded the coast of ancient Crete .
The strange pattern of gravel deposits in the town offered further evidence of a deep oceanic disturbance .
Then there were lumps of gray ash in the beach layer , “ resembling unstirred instant - soup lumps at the bottom of a cup , ” according to Bruins .
He sent samples of these lumps to two state - of - the - art geochemistry labs in Germany , which analyzed the sample ’s geochemical signature .
The results of both tests were identical : a perfect match between Theran ash and the “ soup lumps ” on the beach .
Finally , there was the question of when all this disruption occurred .
Bruins sent fragments of cattle bones and seashells from the chaotic layer to the radiocarbon dating lab at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands .
Because of well - known problems in calibrating dates from 3,500 years ago , he knew the lab would be unable to pin down the exact calendar age of the samples , but the uncalibrated measured age of the cattle bones closely matched the latest equivalent dates for the cataclysm on Thera .
All the clues pointed to one answer : A giant wave had struck Palaikastro Bay while freshly fallen ash from Thera was still lying about , inundating the town for miles inland and streaking it with strange patterns of ash .
But could even a giant wave be big enough to wipe out an entire civilization ?
MacGillivray consulted Costas Synolakis , an energetic Greek - born earth scientist at the * University of Southern California , where he pioneered the predictive computer model used by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii .
Synolakis ’s first attempts to model tsunamis in the early 1990s began as a solitary exercise .
Everything changed after the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 .
Synolakis visited Banda Aceh , the city in northwestern Sumatra closest to the epicenter of the undersea quake , where hundred - foot waves had destroyed a city of more than 150,000 people in minutes .
“ It was a surreal , absurdist landscape , ” he says .
“ It took an effort of imagination to conceive that people had ever lived there . ”
Almost overnight , Synolakis ’s expertise in computer modeling of tsunamis became a focus of worldwide scientific and media attention .

In 2000 , Synolakis had con- sulted on a study to model a hypothetical Minoan tsunami .
He found that no matter how steep the waves were when they started out at Thera , they dissipated quickly , reaching only three to nine feet at most when they hit Crete , some 70 miles away .
The study concluded that such waves could have been “ disruptive , ” but not devastating , to Minoan Crete .
Synolakis was still thinking that way when he visited Palaikastro in May 2006 .
Then MacGillivray took him down to the beach .
“ The moment I looked at that debris layer , I was absolutely stunned , ” Synolakis says .
“ The image that came to me , right then and there , is what I saw everywhere after the December 2004 tsunami : a blanket of cultural debris , broken dishes , broken glass , bits of bone , people ’s belongings scattered everywhere .
It looked exactly like that kind of debris carpet , and you do n’t get it in a smaller tsunami .
The presence of this chaotic deposit suggested that the tsunami was at least three or four meters [ 10 to 13 feet ] at the shoreline . ”
What had begun as a casual visit now turned into a full - blown research project .
Synolakis hired a boat and took depth measurements of the seabed in Palaikastro Bay .
When he tested the hillside behind the Minoan town to establish how far the wave had penetrated inland , he found what appeared to be more layers of chaotic debris at an astounding 90 feet above sea level .
About 60 miles to the west of Palaikastro , near the palace of Mallia , the research team found yet another strikingly similar chaotic deposit .
Plugging in all the new data , Synolakis drastically revised his tsunami model .
“ When we put it all together , ” he says , “ we ’re looking at a wave that ’s on the order of 15 meters [ 50 feet ] when it hits the shore at Palaikastro .
This is a gigantic wave , much larger , wider , and longer than we thought ; its volume is 10 times more than what we estimated only six years ago .
We ’re talking about an extreme event , certainly on the order of the 2004 Indian Ocean disaster . ”
With eyewitness video of that disaster lingering in everyone ’s minds , it took little imagination to visualize the physical destruction that must have hit Palaikastro , Mallia , and elsewhere along the Cretan coast .
But evidence suggests that the Minoans survived the disaster for at least a generation or two ; the real end came later , in an outbreak of fiery vandalism .
Throughout Crete , temple - palaces were burned and ransacked , and there are no obvious signs of battle , invasion , or natural disaster at these ruins .
Of all the great Minoan palaces , only Knossos survived ; eventually it was taken over by the Mycenaeans , the mainland Greeks who prospered as the fortunes of Crete declined .
A leader of the Palaikastro team , Belgian archaeologist Jan Driessen , contends that the wave of destruction was the tail end of a spiral of instability that the Thera catastrophe set in motion .
A steep drop - off in the number of Minoan sites suggests that there had been a famine or an epidemic , one perhaps touched off by the environmental effects of the eruption combined with the later tsunami .
There may have been a spiritual crisis as well .
At Palaikastro , archaeologists found that a shrine had been violently destroyed and a cult statuette deliberately smashed and burned .
Driessen suggests there may have been a reaction against the religious cult represented by the statuette , perhaps as part of a populist uprising against the elite in their villas and temple - palaces .
The loss of life and livelihood after the eruption may have aggravated problems of class difference and widened the gap between the elite and the commoners , which Driessen says “ existed already in Minoan society . ”
The terrifying scale of the Thera eruption , followed by the devastating force of the giant tsunami it created , may have led to a gradual unraveling of the values and beliefs that had sustained this brilliant civilization for so long .
In his poem “ The Hollow Men , ” T. S. Eliot writes these famous lines : “ This is the way the world ends / This is the way the world ends /
This is the way the world ends /
Not with a bang but a whimper . ”
For the Minoans , it appears their world ended with both .

Okay , so the title of this article is a bit provocative .
But , I wanted to get your attention .
You see , I got the idea for this article after attending the 33rd annual atheist convention in Seattle , Washington , in April of 2007 .
It was a very interesting experience , and I learned things I did not expect to learn .
While sitting in the crowd and listening to speakers and watching the atheists ' reactions , it dawned on me how utterly religious they seemed to be .
No , I 'm not saying they believe in a God ; and I 'm not saying atheism is a religion .
But , they sure acted as though it were .
Let me explain .
As I sat there watching , taking notes , and listening , I formulated a list that I think is accurate and representative of what I saw at the convention .
Please take a look .
Creed No God , anti-God , pro-homosexuality , anti-Christianity .
Atheism is a belief .
I know that many atheists will disagree with this , but the atheists gathered around a common belief of no God , or lack of God , and the need to increase what they perceive as separation of church and state in America .
Crisis Created a problem and offered a solution .
The problem was religious oppression in society with atheistic ideals as the solution .
Assemblies Gathered in groups with meeting times .
Atheists do n't meet nearly as frequently as Christians do in their churches , but they do have state meetings , national meetings , and regular gatherings .
Pulpit
The lectern from which speeches were made , their ideas were promoted , and their reasons for their belief system were validated .
Evangelistic
The atheists sought converts to their cause .
They frequently spoke about getting the idea of atheism out into society and to move people away from theism .
Celebration over converts
Rejoiced when converts to their belief system were announced .
There was applause and excitement when there were announcements about people who had " come out of the closet " and announced their atheism .
Zealous for their cause
They wanted their cause and belief system expanded to the extent of changing America to reflect their thinking .
Exclusive
Only they have the truth .
The atheists repeatedly spoke of how atheism was the truth , and that theists and deists were ignorant of facts and reason .
Us against them mentality
There was a profound description of the division between atheism and theism with the atheists being the ones who were defending themselves against the intrusive theists .
Concerned about public image
This is normal .
They were very concerned with how they were perceived and wanted to change their negative reputation .
Lack of critical thinking
This is common everywhere .
Though they thought they were rational , by far most of the arguments and comments were n't .
Misrepresentation of opposing views Again , another common trait among people who gather in groups , have a common ideology , and see others as being less enlightened .
Voting block
The atheists mentioned voting as a group in order to progress their cause in society .
Infighting
This is normal for groups .
We do n't all see eye to eye .
But , they all held to atheism even though they had disagreements about some particulars .
Money
They did n't have tithing , but there were plenty of things for sale .
And , let 's not forget to mention how they sought donations to help cover the costs of promoting atheism , paying speakers , renting facilities , etc .
Now , I 'm sure there are atheists who will debate a few of the issues listed .
But , I am just rendering my opinion of what I saw .
I think it is rather ironic that those who are against religion so much are , in actuality , so religious themselves .
I could n't help smiling and seeing the natural tendency of people to gather around an idea , develop a cause , and then promote it .
Unfortunately , the atheists have gathered around non-belief and want that non-belief promoted in society .
All I have to say is eternity is a long time to be wrong .

Enumerable #inject , that is .
I know that there are a lot of Budding Rubyists out there .
Are you a former ( or current ) Java developer ?
That was me , but I saw the light and have moved on to greener pastures .
A big step in the transition from Java to Ruby was the adoption of inject as a first - class weapon in my iteration arsenal .
So , what ’s the big deal , and how does it work ?
Let ’s break it down .
You ’re going to use inject to iterate through some values and use each of them to manipulate some other object .
Let ’s say that we have an array of two - element arrays ( a la [ [ ‘ a’ , 1 ] , [ ‘b ’ , 2 ] , [ ‘ c ’ , 3 ] ] ) and want to construct a hash with the first element as the key and the second element as the value ( { ‘ a’ => 1 , ‘b’ => 2 , ‘ c’ => 3} ) .
Someone just transitioning to Ruby might do this :
hash = {} array .
each do | current | hash [ current [ 0 ] ] = current [ 1 ] end
You can do this with inject like so :
hash = array .
inject ( {} ) do | results , current | results [ current [ 0 ] ] = current [ 1 ] results end
Ok , to be fair … this code is not simpler .
Not as pretty , imho .
More Ruby - esque ?
Sure .
Patience , Grasshopper .
You can think of inject as a replacement for each that takes an argument representing the starting state of the object you want to manipulate .
We want to construct a hash , so this starting state is {} .
The block , then , receives another argument ( I call it ‘ results ’ above ) : the value of your object passed in from the previous iteration .
One key thing to remember when using inject : you must return the ‘ results ’ from the iteration at the end of the block .
Not doing so is a very common mistake that will totally break you .
Let ’s pick a different example : we want to sum the values in an array .
Old way :
total = 0 array .
each do | current | total += current end total
With inject :
total = array .
inject ( 0 ) do | total , current | total + current end
Again , you mentally translate the above to :
– start with 0
– iterate through each value , adding the current value to the total , and
– pass the total on to the next iteration
Easy peasy .
( What , you just want to use ActiveSupport ’s Enumerable #sum ?
Bleh .
Fair enough . )
Ok , one more .
This one actually shows it used in a realistic scenario .
Array .
class_eval do def hash_by ( attribute ) inject ( {} ) do | results , obj | results [ obj .
send ( attribute ) ] = obj results end end end
Here , I have reopened the Array class to add a new method , hash_by ( ) .
I use it to construct a cache of objects so that I can quickly look up a specific object using a unique object attribute .
Here it is in action :
class
User attr_accessor : name , : age , : email def initialize ( name , age , email ) @ name = name @ age = age @ email = email end end users = [ User . new ( ' Brian ' , 32 , ' brian@foo.bar.com ' ) , User . new ( ' Jim ' , 46 , ' jim@foo.bar.com ' ) , User . new ( ' Scott ' , 33 , ' scott@foo.bar.com ' ) , User . new ( ' Kenton ' , 32 , ' kenton@foo.bar.com ' ) , User . new ( ' Chris ' , 34 , ' chris@foo.bar.com ' ) ] user_cache = users .
hash_by ( : name ) puts user_cache [ ' Brian ' ] . inspect puts user_cache [ ' Scott ' ] .
inspect
With the constructed User cache , we can now get to the object of our choice in constant time .
Yay , inject !

Federal Court Rejects Wal - Mart ’s Trademark Claim Against Web Critic
Public Citizen Argued First Amendment Protects Parody of Company ’s Logos
WASHINGTON , D.C. – A federal judge today upheld a Georgia man ’s First Amendment right to criticize Wal - Mart ’s business practices by using satire to compare its destructive effects on communities to both the Holocaust and al - Qaeda terrorists .
In rejecting the company ’s claim of trademark infringement , the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta found that Charles Smith ’s parody Web sites ( www.walocaust.com and www.walqaeda.com ) and related novelty merchandise were protected speech and that a reasonable person would not confuse their use with Wal - Mart ’s legitimate trademarks .
The court also rejected Wal - Mart ’s claim that it has trademark rights in the “ smiley - face ” that Smith used in one of his parodies .
Public Citizen and the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia Foundation defended Smith after Wal - Mart sued the Conyers , Ga. man in 2006 , claiming he infringed on its trademark by creating parody logos and Web sites built around the “ Walocaust ” and “ Wal - Qaeda ” concepts , including the image of an eagle clutching a yellow smiley face , similar to the one Wal - Mart uses in advertising .
Smith also put the design on T - shirts , bumper stickers and other items that he sold on CafePress.com .
Judge Timothy C. Batten Sr. ’s decision reaffirms an important point of trademark law – that even though a parody is placed on a T - shirt and sold , it nevertheless represents non-commercial speech that is fully protected by the First Amendment and , thus , is not a proper basis for a trademark action , said Paul Alan Levy , a Public Citizen attorney , who represented Smith along with Gerald Weber of Atlanta .
“ This ruling shows that even the biggest company in America is subject to parody , and that trademark rights must yield to the right of free speech , ” Levy said .
“ This is a resounding victory for First Amendment rights and sends a clear message to big corporations that would try to use their deep pockets to intimidate and silence their critics . ”
Although Wal - Mart spent more than $ 200,000 on an “ expert ” witness to prove that consumers seeing these parody T - shirts were likely to be confused , the judge properly recognized that the expert ’s testimony was junk science and flew in the face of common sense .

IPv6 took another significant step forward yesterday , as the root DNS zone was updated with IP v6 addresses for six of the 13 root servers .
Most root servers are " anycasted : " physical machines are placed in different locations , but share an address .
Requests are automatically routed to the closest server .
As we noted a month ago , this change means that it's now possible for an IPv6 - only system to connect to another IP v6 - only system without the need to do DNS lookups over IP v4 .
In order to see how well that works , I turned off IP v4 on my Mac , started up a local nameserver , and started typing URLs .
Of the 16 web sites that I tried , nine were reachable , seven were not .
For instance , the Internet Systems Consortium that publishes BIND , the most popular DNS server software , was reachable , as were the RIPE NCC , LACNIC , AfriNIC , and APNIC , four of the five Regional Internet Registries that give out IP addresses around the globe .
The missing RIR is ARIN , the American Registry for Internet Numbers , which fulfills this function in North America .
Update : it 's unclear why I could n't reach the ARIN website ( or the IETF website ) when running IPv6 - only .
After testing with a DNS tool I concluded that they did n't have IP v6 nameservers , but this is incorrect , they both do .
Before the addition of the IPv6 addresses to the root zone , there was worry about the increase in the size of the DNS reply that lists all the root nameservers and their addresses .
However , the names of all the root servers easily fit in a 512 - byte packet .
The addresses are extra information , and as such , may be omitted if the packet is in danger of becoming too large .
So when a DNS server that does n't indicate that it supports larger packets does its initial request for the list of root nameservers after it starts , it will always see the full list of 13 root server names in the reply .
Some of the root servers then include all the IP v4 addresses and as many IP v6 addresses as will fit in the response ( usually , two of them ) , others return a more balanced mix of IPv4 and IP v6 addresses , usually ten of the former and four of the latter .
However , the reply is not marked as " truncated " so there is no need to repeat the query over TCP with all the firewalling dangers that that entails .
Interestingly , the K root server is already getting more than 100 queries per second over IP v6 , while the maximum IP v4 query rate is around 9,000 per second .
A bit more than 1 percent of the queries over IP v6 does n't seem like much , but it does suggest that IP v6 uptake , at least in some circles , can no longer be accounted for by margin of error .
It does , however , seem as though these figures are n't consistent from one root server to the next .
What does this step mean in the grand scheme of things ?
In practical terms , nothing , really : you pretty much have to go out of your way to run an IPv6 - only nameserver , which will then be slower and more failure - prone than its easier - to - configure dual stack IPv4 + IP v6 counterpart .
Even then , you 'll have to find a domain seller who can handle the necessary DNS records in the first place .
But the move does mark a fundamental change : before yesterday , IPv6 was incapable of doing some things that IP v4 could do since the invention of the DNS in the late 1980s .
Now , the two protocols are on an equal footing — in theory , at least .
In practice , it is of course possible to completely ignore IP v6 in favor of IPv4 .
The next big step for IP v6 is to become so ubiquitous that users will expect to be able to reach services over IP v6 as well as IPv4 .
For a long time , IPv6 proponents assumed — or at least hoped — this would happen before we ran out of IP v4 addresses , but appears increasingly unlikely .
So it looks like in a few years we 'll have a situation where most of the Internet is still IPv4 - only , but newcomers wo n't be able to get IP v4 addresses to join the party .
" This is an important step in the direction of adopting IPv6 and with that , the preservation of an open Internet , " said Erik Huizer , chair of the Dutch IPv6 Task Force .
" But it 's a first step , there is still a lot to be done . "
So read everything you need to know about IPv6 and go forth and enable it on your systems .
And do n't forget to download the latest named .

WASHINGTON – Hillary Rodham Clinton can no longer win the Democratic nomination , Barack Obama ‘s campaign said yesterday .
Obama campaign manager David Plouffe told reporters the “ only way ” Clinton can overcome Obama ’s lead in pledged delegates after her latest lopsided defeats “ is to win most of the remaining contests in blowout form . ”
That ’s a highly unlikely scenario that no political expert expects .
Clinton advisers were talking openly about which upcoming primary could be the final blow to her campaign .
“ If she loses either Texas or Ohio , this thing is done , ” Clinton adviser James Carville said on CNN last night .
But a defiant Clinton unleashed her first blistering TV attack ad against Obama yesterday and slammed him for peddling “ promises . ”
“ I am in the solutions business .
My opponent is in the promises business , ” she said on a campaign swing in Texas .
“ I think we need answers , not questions . ”
The New York senator shrugged off Obama ’s Tuesday primary sweep and aides insisted the race had n’t been decided .
“ You go on , ” Clinton told reporters .
“ Some weeks one of us is up and the other is down , and then we reverse it . . .
It ’s a long and winding road . ”
“ No one is going to be able to get the nomination without superdelegates , ” said Clinton adviser Mark Penn .
“ We are looking at right now essentially a tied contest . ”
Clinton tried to push Obama onto the defensive on health care and the economy , while her campaign focuses on a retooled strategy designed to battle Obama for delegates .
The jockeying comes as Clinton licked her wounds from three brutal losses Tuesday , in Virginia , Maryland and Washington , DC , where Obama tore into her coalition of women and working - class voters , and bested her by several hundred - thousand votes .
Clinton operatives – who once confidently predicted victory on Feb. 5 – now say the gap in delegates will be razor - thin , and that Clinton will prevail , possibly through the support of unelected “ superdelegates ” at the convention .
Clinton ’s new TV ad , airing in Wisconsin , slams Obama for failing to agree to met her face to face in a debate there .
In the ad , which flashes images of both candidates , an announcer states that both Clinton and Obama have been invited to a debate , but only Clinton has agreed to participate .
“ Hillary Clinton has said yes .
Barack Obama has n’t .
Maybe he ’d prefer to give speeches than have to answer questions .
Like why Hillary Clinton has the only health - care plan that covers every American , and the only economic plan that freezes foreclosures . ”
Obama also has a housing plan , but it does n’t include a freeze on interest - rate increases .
An Obama spokeswoman noted the candidates have had 18 debates , and said Obama ’s campaign wants to “ spend our time with the voters . ”
Clinton agreed to an upcoming debate in Ohio on MSNBC , despite her complaints that an MSNBC correspondent accused her campaign of “ pimping out ” daughter Chelsea by having her appeal to delegates .
Clinton aides say she can still win the nomination by cleaning up in Ohio , Texas and Pennsylvania and prevailing at the convention this summer .
But Obama is already working to sap her momentum by campaigning hard to seize a win in Wisconsin next Tuesday .
Privately , some Clinton superdelegates yesterday admitted they ’re concerned about the possibility of some in their ranks flipping to Obama .
“ Of course , we ’re worried about it , ” said one Clinton superdelegate , adding that some fellow “ supers ” have said they ’re “ depressed ” by the current state of the race .
The Clinton camp announced it was hurrying to open field offices in places from Wyoming to Puerto Rico where upcoming contests will award critical delegates .
But they suffered a setback yesterday when Puerto Rican Gov. Anibal Acevedo Vila endorsed Obama .
Presumptive GOP nominee John McCain slammed Obama as the Senate ’s “ most liberal member ” and tag - teamed with Clinton ’s attacks , saying Obama ’s speeches were “ singularly lacking in specifics . ”

Despite the Fed ’s predicament , investors seemed to interpret the report as an indication that more interest rate cuts might be in the offing .
Stocks had been flat before the report was issued at 2 p.m. but turned upward in late trading , with the Dow Jones industrial average closing with a 90 - point gain .
The Fed ’s forecast , a compilation of predictions by its governors and presidents of its regional banks , was released as part of the minutes of two policy meetings in January .
Those meetings produced a surprise decision on Jan. 21 to slash the benchmark Federal funds rate by three - quarters of a point , to 3.5 percent , and a move on Jan. 30 to lower the rate an additional half - point .
Both of the policy meetings came at moments of turbulence and uncertainty in the economy , and together they amounted to a major course correction in policy .
The emergency meeting on the evening of Jan. 21 , at which some of the regional Fed presidents spoke over a secure videoconference , took place on a day when stock markets plunged around the world on what appeared to be fear about economic problems in the United States .
Fed officials , meeting on a government holiday when the American markets were closed , stunned investors and analysts alike by slashing the overnight federal funds rate by three - quarters of a point , to 3.5 percent .
Though Fed officials insisted they were not trying to rescue the stock markets , they were keenly aware from activity in the futures markets that American stocks were poised to plunge as soon as markets opened on Jan. 22 .
Fed officials justified the surprise rate cut by pointing to a declining economic outlook , but they acknowledged that they had become increasingly worried about a “ adverse feedback loop ” or self - fulfilling prophecy in which fears in financial markets led to paralysis in the real economy .
A sysadmin last week pleaded guilty to attempting to disrupt the power grid in California by shutting down a data center that managed the state 's electricity supply .
Lonnie Charles Denison , 33 , of South Natomas in California confessed to breaking a glass cover and pushing an emergency power off button at the Independent System Operator 's ( ISO ) data center near Folsom on 15 April .
The contract Unix sysadmin was upset with his employer and co-workers at the time .
Denison reportedly snapped shortly after discovering his computer privileges had been revoked .
His actions prevented the ISO from communicating with the electricity market for about two hours , leaving California vulnerable to blackout conditions .
In the event no blackout occurred because the incident happened late on a Sunday night , when demand was low , so California had no need to buy in excess generating capacity from other states .
Nonetheless , the incident cost the centre $ 14,000 , UPI reports .
It took 20 computer specialists about seven hours to restore the system .
Folsom data centre blues
Prosecutors allege Denision compounded his offences by sending a threatening email to an unnamed California ISO employee the next day implying he planted a bomb at the facility .
The email said : " Hey , at one point I respected you ... you have a new kid .
So this is only because of him .
Get out before the timer expires .
Not long now .
Take care . "
ISO responded by evacuating 500 workers from the facility and transfered control of the grid to a second control centre .
Denison pleaded guilty to attempted damage of an energy facility , a felony offence punishable with up to five years ' imprisonment and a $ 250,000 fine , at a hearing in Sacremento on Friday .
The rogue employee faces a sentencing hearing scheduled for 29 February . ®

I recently clicked upon Keith Braithwaite and Ivan Moore ’s presentation , “ Why Java Programmers Should Learn Python ” .
It starts off well with an expert discussion of three different axes of type systems , placing various programming languages in the resulting 3 - space .
It then poses a programming problem , the kind of problem which Python excels at :
Given the supplied library classes write some code in “ quickSilver ” to convert between word and decimal digits representations of positive integers less than 1001 .
e.g. “ five seven three ” → 573 e.g. 672 → “ six seven two ”
The Java programmers attending the presentation do n’t know it yet , but “ quickSilver ” turns out to be Python , or at least a subset of it sufficient to solve the problem , and the final slides of the presentation contain a model solution to this problem .
A “ model ” solution ?
Here is that solution .
class WordsFromNumber : def __init__ ( self , number ) : self.representationOf = number def wordsOf ( self ) : lsd = self.representationOf % 10 msds = self.representationOf / 10 if msds == 0 : return self.wordFor(self.representationOf ) else : return WordsFromNumber(msds).wordsOf ( ) + " " + \ self.wordFor(lsd ) def wordFor( self , numeral ) : return [ " zero " , " one " , " two " , " three " , " four " , " five " , " six " , " seven " , " eight " , " nine " ] [ numeral ] class NumberFromWords : def __init__ ( self , words ) : self.representation = words def number ( self ) : words = split ( " \\s " , self.representation ) return self.unpack ( words ) def unpack ( self , words ) : if len( words ) == 1 : return self.numberFor( words [0 ] ) else : lswi = len ( words ) - 1 lswi = words [ lswi ] msws = words [ 0:lswi ] return self.numberFor(lsw ) + 10 * self.unpack ( msw ) def numberFor ( self , word ) : return { " zero " : 0 , " one " : 1 , " two " : 2 , " three " : 3 , " four " : 4 , " five " : 5 , " six " : 6 , " seven " : 7 , " eight " : 8 , " nine " : 9} [ word ]
I do n’t know what point the presenters were trying to make .
I was n’t in their audience but if I were , this code would n’t go any way towards persuading me I should bother with Python .
It ’s got two classes where none is needed , it uses recursion when container operations would do , it ’s longer than it needs to be , and ( putting myself in a Java programmer ’s shoes ) are all those self s really needed ?
In other words this , to me , looks like Java written in Python .
I ’ll assume this is the point the presenters are trying to make , but if they revise the presentation , I ’d like to suggest extending it to add an alternative ending , which I think shows off Python ’s advantages .
An alternative ending number_to_word = { ' 0 ' : ' zero ' , ' 1 ' : ' one ' , ' 2 ' : ' two ' , ' 3 ' : ' three ' , ' 4 ' : ' four ' , ' 5 ' : ' five ' , ' 6 ' : ' six ' , ' 7 ' : ' seven ' , ' 8 ' : ' eight ' , ' 9 ' : ' nine ' } word_to_number = { ' zero ' : 0 , ' one ' : 1 , ' two ' : 2 , ' three ' : 3 , ' four ' : 4 , ' five ' : 5 , ' six ' : 6 , ' seven ' : 7 , ' eight ' : 8 , ' nine ' : 9 } def number_to_words ( number ) : return ' '.join( number_to_word[c ] for c in str( number ) ) def words_to_number ( words ) : def dec_shift_add( x , y ) : return x * 10 + y return reduce ( dec_shift_add , ( word_to_number[w ] for w in words.split ( ) ) )
I ’ve omitted documentation in order to squeeze the encode - decode functions on to a single slide .
If I had time and space , though , I ’d show how to document and test this function in one go using doctest , taking care to cover what happens with invalid inputs .
By the way , you ’ll see I ’m using reduce while I can !
I think this example is one of those rare cases where it works well .
Dictionary initialisation
The explicit dictionaries are fine and good and almost certainly what should be presented to an audience of Python virgins , but in my own code I ’d be tempted to remove a little replication .
( My thanks to Ashwin for tactfully pointing out a howling bug in the code originally posted here ) .
Zippy dicts import string words = " zero one two three four five six seven eight nine " . split ( ) number_to_word = dict ( zip ( string.digits , words ) ) word_to_number = dict ( zip ( words , range ( 10 ) ) )
Living by the Sword
A recent ( 2008 -03 -07 ) wave of hits from Reddit has prompted me to revisit this note and , cough , refactor my code .
There ’s no need for any mathematics , nested functions or reduce : this problem is better handled by string conversions .
And the goal of squeezing functions on a single slide is misguided .
This code needs doctesting .
Java programmers are used to good test frameworks with great tool support , but Python excels at this too .
Today EFF submitted a letter to Senators Leahy and Specter calling their attention to a portion of the Draft Judiciary Committee Report of the Patent Reform Act of 2007 which has the potential to kill EFF 's Patent Busting Project .
The Report states that “ Section 5 of the Act creates a new post - grant review ( PGR ) system for United States patents , replacing and eliminating inter partes reexamination , in a new chapter 32 in title 35 . ”
This statement is followed by footnote 87 :
Ex -parte reexamination , based on a request by the patentee , is retained .
See new Section 303 ( a ) of the Act .
However , third parties may no longer request an ex-parte reexamination .
Thus , third parties wishing to challenge the patent will use the new post grant review system ; patentees wishing to have additional art considered by [ sic ] will use the old ex-parte reexamination system .
This sounds reasonable , but the implications turn out to be deeply problematic .
The form of PGR currently proposed in the Senate ’s bill is an inadequate substitute for reexamination because it would only permit non-profit organizations like EFF to question the validity of issued patents within twelve months of issuance .
Since the true effect of a patent on the public is frequently not realized until well after the first year of its term , there would be no way for us to then have any concerns we may have regarding its validity addressed .
Finally , since there is only a proposal for a second opportunity to challenge the patent if an individual or entity is economically harmed by a patent , 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) entities like EFF would have difficulty meeting that standard and would in many cases be prevented from standing up against invalid patents .
To be clear , EFF supports the Patent Reform
Act generally and the creation of a post - grant review procedure , but this should not mean the elimination of the ex parte or inter partes systems because the PGR system cannot meet the public ’s needs on its own .
EFF 's Patent Busting Project is one of a number of public - interest projects that use the reexamination process to defend the public against the most dubious patents .
Four of our five petitions for reexamination have been granted , and EFF expects the last will be after the PTO has had an opportunity to review it ( it was filed last week ) .
One of the first reexamination requests submitted by EFF has already resulted in the PTO revoking the patent .
The public has a right to defend itself against patents that should never have been granted , and organizations like EFF exist to assist in this process .
Reexamination proceedings are essential for us to continue this work .

The tradition continues as the longest - running series on the ' Chair is back for another round ...
Shockingly , it 's been two years since I first came to ArmchairGM , and while plenty has changed , the spirit of this great site has stayed the same -- to give talented aspiring sportswriters an outlet for their opinions , so that everyone 's voice can be heard .
In keeping with that philosophy , and just like each of the last 2 years , I have projected numbers for each of the 2008 MLB season 's regulars , running them through the statistical blender to project standings .
What follows will likely be wrong as much as it's right , but you never know , sometimes these things can surprise you -- like the Rays winning 82 games ? -- and besides , it 's all in good fun .
Remember that when your team ends up with a sh*tty projection ( or when I stupidly compare Carlos Beltran to Cristian Guzman ) .
Anyway , without further ado , I present my 2K8 AL picks .
Enjoy the preview , and here 's to many more years of success here at ArmchairGM !
American League
Projected Standings
AL East
Projected Record : 98-64
962 Runs Scored ( 5.94 per game , 1st )
779 Runs Allowed ( 4.81 per game , 8th )
Team MVP : Alex Rodriguez
Analysis : After a tumultuous 2007 , the good news for the New York Yankees is that the team should be better ( if not more stable ) on the field in 2008 .
The offense is going to remain the best in baseball , and getting A - Rod back was just huge for them -- without him , they 're struggling to hold off Toronto for 2nd in the East , but with him they 're right back among the AL powerhouses .
As it stands now , the Yankees ' only weakness is their young pitching staff ... which happens to be loaded with potential .
In other words , the triumvirate of Phil Hughes , Joba Chamberlain , and Ian Kennedy should help some combination of veterans Chien - Ming Wang , Andy Pettitte , and Mike Mussina to form a much - improved rotation in 2K8 .
The bullpen is more troubling , though ; after Mariano Rivera , there are precious few viable options , meaning they 're probably going to need to acquire help at some point during the season .
Still , if the pitchers can muster even an average performance , New York will challenge the World Champs for AL East supremacy .
Just do n't ask me what to expect from this group once they get to the playoffs ...
Upside : 99 wins
Downside : 89 wins
Projected Record : 94-68
873 Runs Scored ( 5.39 per game , 2nd )
743 Runs Allowed ( 4.58 per game , 3rd )
Team MVPs : David Ortiz & Josh Beckett
Analysis : Despite these projections , Boston 's a much safer bet to put up a great season than their division archrivals to the south .
Why ?
Balance .
The Sox not only boast a top - notch offense -- led by standbys David Ortiz & Manny Ramirez , young guns Jacoby Ellsbury & Dustin Pedroia , and bounce - back candidates J.D. Drew & Julio Lugo -- but also a standout pitching staff which allowed the fewest runs in the league a year ago .
Now , without Curt Schilling , Clay Buchholz will have to step up for the rotation ... so it 's a good thing that he 's the best pitching prospect in the game and has already thrown an MLB no -hitter .
And you gotta think Daisuke Matsuzaka will be better in Year 2 of his Boston career , which means this rotation could potentially be even better in '08 .
Meanwhile , the bullpen is led by the game 's best closer , and boasts plenty of quality arms behind him , many of whom still have their best years ahead of them .
So while the Yankees ' monster offense gives them the potential to jump in front of the Sox if their pitching improves , the defending Champs are a steadier and more well - rounded team because they can win with pitching or hitting .
Upside : 104 wins
Downside : 92 wins
Projected Record : 90 -72
744 Runs Scored ( 4.59 per game , 11th )
665 Runs Allowed ( 4.10 per game , 1st )
Team MVP : Roy Halladay
Analysis : Toronto has now officially made themselves over , transforming from an offensive team with marginal pitching to a club which relies heavily on pitching and defense because it struggles to score runs .
Will this new formula work for them in one of baseball 's most crowded divisions ?
Well , on the plus side , their pitching + defense combo is probably the best in the game , especially if Boston 's staff regresses to the mean .
So if they post the best RA/G in the league ( which they should definitely be close to ) , GM J.P. Ricciardi will have reached his goal and the team should be pretty competitive , even in the East .
Exactly how competitive , though , will depend on how many runs they can squeeze out of a weak lineup which , aside from Alex Rios , is overflowing with question marks : Frank Thomas is really old , Scott Rolen is washed up , you never know what you 'll get out of Vernon Wells , and the rest range from mediocre ( Adam Lind , Lyle Overbay ) to downright awful ( David Eckstein ) .
Their pitching / defense should bring them up over .500 and could take them as high as 90 wins , but this punchless offense will eventually prove Toronto 's Achilles ’ heel in 2008 .
Upside : 91 wins
Downside : 84 wins
Projected Record : 82-80
834 Runs Scored ( 5.15 per game , 5th )
822 Runs Allowed ( 5.08 per game , 10th )
Team MVP : Scott Kazmir
Analysis :
Do n't look now , but after a decade as the AL East 's whipping boy ( the franchise has never won more than 70 games in a season ) , the Tampa Bay " do n't call me Devil " Rays are suddenly an up - and - coming collection of young talent .
No , seriously .
They have a solid lineup that ought to be among the top 5 or so AL teams in runs scored ( Carlos Pena , Carl Crawford , B.J. Upton ... not bad at all ) , with plenty of high - ceiling kids like Evan Longoria and Reid Brignac in the mix as well ( meaning this offense could be a force for years to come ) .
Of course , scoring has n't been Tampa 's problem recently -- the prevention of runs has been the hard part , whether because of an awful pitching staff or a leaky D that ranked among the worst of all time .
The good news is that they 'll probably be better on that front in ' 08 , as long as Scott Kazmir , James Shields , and Matt Garza stay injury - free and start living up to their potential .
Also , if new closer Troy Percival can stay healthy / not suck after his spotty injury record of late ( hey , he did have a 1.80 ERA in 40 innings last year ) , the Rays might improve on what was a terrible bullpen a year ago .
Of course , the fielding is n't likely to improve significantly this year ( beyond the standard progression to the mean you 'd expect after such an awful showing ) , but improved pitching and a talent - laden young lineup could be just what the Rays need to break the mythical 70 - win barrier -- and maybe even make a run at .500 .
Upside : 84 wins
Downside : 71 wins
Projected Record : 60 - 102
728 Runs Scored ( 4.49 per game , 12th )
940 Runs Allowed ( 5.80 per game , 14th )
Team MVP : Nick Markakis
Analysis :
What a mess -- in the short run , at least .
Just two years after hanging around in the tough AL East until mid-July , the Orioles are going to hit rock bottom record - wise in 2008 , as it will take several seasons for their recent rebuilding moves to have a chance to pay off .
A brief plot summary of the O's offseason is in order :
They just traded away their best pitcher by far , Erik Bedard , and while they pulled in a good haul of prospects ( headlined by OF Adam Jones ) , their effects wo n't be felt for a few years .
Meanwhile , they have very few other pitchers of any worth , and their bullpen is a disaster ( newcomer George Sherrill will help a bit , but still ) .
The offense also saw perhaps its best player depart when SS Miguel Tejada was dealt to Houston for OF Luke Scott , homer - prone LHP Troy Patton , and a handful of role players .
Considering they were already struggling to score runs and keep them off the board before these moves , you can imagine how difficult things are going to get for Baltimore in the short term ; while I think 60 wins is a bit low , it would be very hard to see them putting up more than 65 in '08 .
Still , it 's good news for Baltimore in the long run , because it means the franchise is finally doing the tear - down job it should have done 10 years ago .
Sometimes you have to take on short - term losses for long - term gains ; the fact that Peter Angelos and Co. might finally be realizing this can only be a good sign for the Orioles and their fans .
Upside : 67 wins
Downside : 60 wins
AL Central
Projected Record : 92-70
853 Runs Scored ( 5.27 per game , 3rd )
746 Runs Allowed ( 4.60 per game , 4th )
Team MVPs : Grady Sizemore & Fausto Carmona
Analysis : After a season which ended with disappointment -- no offense to the Colorado Rockies , but a blown 3 - 1 lead against the Red Sox in the ALCS probably cost Cleveland a World Series championship -- the Indians decided to stay the proverbial course this winter , neither adding nor losing anyone of note over the offseason .
On the other hand , the Detroit Tigers ( their closest division rivals ) were the talk of baseball over the winter , adding Miguel Cabrera , Dontrelle Willis , & Edgar Renteria to their already - talented roster .
Since only 8 games separated the two clubs in 2007 , it certainly seems like the Tigers have improved to the point where they 're at least even with the Indians in the AL Central race ...
But even considering Detroit 's acquisitions , you still gotta call Cleveland the favorite for their balance ( they 'll be in the AL's top 5 both offensively and defensively this year ) , and a dominating 1 - 2 pitching punch that few ( if any ) teams can match .
That combination , of course , consists of reigning Cy Young Award winner C.C. Sabathia and 24 - year - old phenom Fausto Carmona , and it alone would give Cleveland one of the game 's best rotations ( the LAIMs behind them do n't hurt , either ) .
The bullpen is not quite as dominant , with incumbent closer Joe " 5.07 ERA " Borowski just a handful of blown saves away from assignment with the Buffalo Bisons , but they manage to get the job done nonetheless .
The lineup is largely unchanged from last year , but will probably be more effective simply by virtue of Pronk 's bounce - back and the continued development of Grady Sizemore into a superstar .
All in all , there 's still a lot to like here -- enough to give them the tentative nod going into 2008 despite Detroit 's splashy offseason moves .
Upside : 94 wins
Downside : 86 wins
Projected Record : 89-73
852 Runs Scored ( 5.26 per game , 4th )
769 Runs Allowed ( 4.75 per game , 7th )
Team MVP : Miguel Cabrera
Analysis :
It 's amazing how far the Tigers have come since their 119 - loss disaster in 2003 .
In just four short seasons they 've almost completely erased the memories of that dismal year , replacing them with a World Series berth in 2006 , an 88 - win 2007 that saw them contend for the Central until late August , and now an eventful 07 - 08 offseason in which they picked up 2 of the game 's biggest trade - bait prizes ( in the non-Johan Santana division , that is ) .
Of course , none of Detroit 's flashy winter deals will mean a thing if they do n't produce results in October -- and as it stands now , Detroit is still a nose behind Cleveland in the AL Central race .
With newcomer Miguel Cabrera in the lineup this offense should have no trouble putting runs on the board ( barring injuries ) , but the jury is still out on the Tigers ' pitching corps , a group which ranked just 9th in the league a year ago .
Prize pickup Dontrelle Willis is a talent , to be sure , but he also posted a 5.17 ERA last year and has been a burnout candidate for years ; meanwhile , the rest of the staff is either old ( Kenny Rogers ) or inconsistent ( Jeremy Bonderman , plus the entire bullpen ) .
And then there 's the matter of replacing one of baseball 's best hot - corner glovemen ( Brandon Inge ) with one of its worst ( Cabrera ) ...
Detroit 's offense may have surpassed Cleveland's , but their pitching + defense is still lagging well behind the Tribe's , and it's this disparity that could eventually end up costing the Tigers the AL Central , big - name additions or not .
Upside : 96 wins
Downside : 88 wins
Projected Record : 77-85
726 Runs Scored ( 4.48 per game , 13th )
763 Runs Allowed ( 4.71 per game , 5th )
Team MVP : Joe Mauer
Analysis :
In many ways , the 2007 season marked the end of an era for the Minnesota Twins .
Longtime GM Terry Ryan , who had put together the pieces of the Twins ' 2001 - 2006 run on a shoestring budget by constantly finding cheap ways to win , announced his resignation with 2 weeks left in the team 's 79 - win season .
Ace southpaw Johan Santana and CF defensive wiz Torii Hunter , the two on - field cornerstones of that run , also played their final games in a Twins uniform last September .
So now Minnesota is left with a gaping hole in their defense and a decimated rotation -- innings eater Carlos Silva and top prospect Matt Garza also left the twin cities this winter -- that they will try to re-tool with the return of 2006 All - Star Francisco Liriano from a year lost to injury .
Luckily he has a decent bullpen to back him up , led by star closer Joe Nathan , but the rest of the rotation is either young & inexperienced ( Boof Bonser , Scott Baker , Kevin Slowey , etc. ) or , well , Livan Hernandez .
Besides , pitching is n't going to be the Twins ' problem as much as hitting -- beyond the powerful pair of Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau , there are more question marks than answers in this lineup .
Now maybe Delmon Young puts it all together , and maybe Mike Cuddyer repeats his 2006 performance at the plate ...
What 's more likely , though , is that the Twins continue to struggle on offense , this time without the pitching staff to compensate .
I do n't doubt that Minnesota will eventually rebuild ( and probably faster than most teams would ) , but as far as 2008 is concerned , they will be lucky to stay anywhere near .500 .
Upside : 78 wins
Downside : 70 wins
Projected Record : 71-91
792 Runs Scored ( 4.89 per game , 7th )
891 Runs Allowed ( 5.50 per game , 12th )
Team MVP : Nick Swisher
Analysis : Another year , and it's the same old story for the Pale Hose , who are apparently still under the impression that they 're contenders in the AL Central .
But in case Kenny Williams , Ozzie Guillen , & Co. have n't noticed , we should point out that in reality they 're an aging team coming off a disastrous 72 - win season that most rational analysts saw coming a mile away .
Their 2005 title run was certainly magical , but Williams is stubbornly clinging to the delusion that the ChiSox can make one last run with that core , and it just is n't going to happen .
Now , Williams is no idiot , that 's for sure , and it 's only human nature to dwell on your successes and try to recapture past greatness ; that 's why he " rebuilt " Chicago on the fly this offseason , adding Nick Swisher , Orlando Cabrera , Scott Linebrink , Carlos Quentin , and Octavio Dotel under the belief that they would improve the team enough to contend again .
But this team is n't merely a fixer - upper -- it needs a total tear - down .
The offense , while legitimately improved over the winter , is still not even average , and there 's little reason to think the pitching staff will be any better than their 12th - place showing a year ago .
Meanwhile , the rest of this division has not only passed them by , but lapped them several times ( LOL of the offseason : Williams ' quote that the Cabrera +
Willis trade will " help the Tigers compete with us " ) .
So while Chicago 's roster has changed a bit from ' 07 to ' 08 , I expect the results to be no different this time around .
The only question that remains is : will another 72 - win season finally convince them to rebuild ?
Upside : 77 wins
Downside : 70 wins
Projected Record : 64-98
745 Runs Scored ( 4.60 per game , 10th )
917 Runs Allowed ( 5.66 per game , 13th )
Team MVP : Billy Butler
Analysis :
You might not know it to look at their record , but Royals GM Dayton Moore is slowly but surely changing the culture in Kansas City .
No longer is this perennially sad - sack franchise weighed down with nothing but AAAA types and useless veteran stopgaps -- but rather theirs is a roster teeming with ( dare I say ! ) young talents like Alex Gordon , Billy Butler , Zack Greinke , and Joakim Soria .
That 's not to say that KC should be planning their World Series parade anytime soon ( let 's face it , the rest of the roster is fairly unremarkable ) , but what 's important is that there are finally signs of life for a moribund franchise that has finished .500 or better just 3 times in the last 18 years .
Under Moore , the process of running the Royals has changed dramatically for the better , which means the results will follow suit someday as well .
Whether or not the Royals ' eventual breakthrough comes under new manager Trey Hillman remains to be seen , but given the current crop of youngsters ( and their successors , the players whom the keen - eyed Moore will select in the draft over the next 5 years ) , it definitely feels like it wo n't be long before the Royals break out of the doldrums and finally give their long - suffering fans something to cheer about .

Analysis : Ladies and gentlemen , your 2008 AL West Division Champions ... by default !
The Halos added two solid pieces over the offseason in CF Torii Hunter and RHP Jon Garland , but it 's not like they needed any extra help to get over the hump in this division -- longtime foil Oakland slipped last year and is entering a rebuilding phase , Seattle is about to feel the full wrath of the Johnson Effect , and the Rangers are years away from their deep farm system paying MLB dividends .
So when it comes to the Angels , it 's all about whether they can find the answers to their questions by the time they get to the playoffs :
Do they have enough offensive firepower to match the likes of Boston , New York , Detroit , and Cleveland ?
Can top relievers Francisco Rodriguez and Scot Shields bounce back from their 2nd - half declines a year ago , or have they burned out from overuse ?
Will SS Erick Aybar be able to step up and replace the departed Orlando Cabrera ?
And how long before the years of wear and tear finally catch up to OFs Vladimir Guerrero and Garret Anderson ?
Whatever happens , Los Angeles will still cruise to the West crown -- but how far they go once they get there will depend on whether or not the answers are made apparent before October rolls around .

Analysis : After everything that has transpired since Michael Lewis ' infamous book hit the shelves , what if it turns out that the typical Moneyball season gives you results more like 2007 than 1999 - 06 ?
That 's certainly the fear in Oakland , where a year ago there was a distinct lack of either Barry Zito , Mark Mulder , or Tim Hudson for the first time since 1998 , and the A's finished under .500 for the first time since ... you guessed it , 1998 .
Now , I 'm not saying that the erstwhile Big Three were the only reasons for Oakland 's low - budget success story under Billy Beane ; the man is still one of the sharpest GMs in the game , and like all the great execs he has an uncanny knack for getting rid of players precisely before their careers go downhill ...
But even the most ardent Beane - worshipper would have to admit that having 3 of the game 's top pitchers made it awfully easy to draft 5 years ' worth of low - ceiling college players and still field a competitive team in a weak division .
Now facing life without any superstars , at least partially because of poor drafting ( although in all fairness , injuries have hit Oakland pretty hard as well ) , the A's have to hope a half - decent pitching staff and defense can carry another underwhelming offense until Beane 's recent rebuilding moves start to pay dividends .
There are worse positions to be in , of course , but in the cold light of morning one has to concede that much of what we hailed Beane as a genius for in 2002 was in fact attributable to a once - in - a - lifetime ( read : lucky ) haul of pitchers in the 1997 , 1998 , and 1999 drafts .

Analysis :
Hey , Seattle .
6th - century BC Ionian Greek mathematician / philosopher Pythagoras here .
How you doin ' ?
Yeah ?
That 's great .
So , uh ... well , I 'm just going to get to the point here .
You remember that whole " you have to score more runs than the other team to win a baseball game " thing ?
You do ?
Terrific .
That 'll make thismuch easier .
Anyway , it has recently come to my attention that you guys won 88 games last year ( and congrats for that , ) while scoring 794 runs and allowing 813 .
Yeah , I know , that 's fantastic and everything , but it means the other team scored 19 more runs than you did .
And remember what I said about needing to outscore the opponent to win ?
Well , it turns out that teams which get outscored by 19 tend to win 79 - ish games in a 162 - game season , not 88 .
Mmm-hmm , it 's sad .
And because of this little glitch in accounting , I 'm afraid the best you guys can hope for this year is to play like the 79 - win team you really were a year ago .
If fact , you 're probably going to be a bit worse than that , because you 're kinda old , and your offense is going to fall off a cliff , and -- Hey !
There 's no reason to take that tone , this is difficult for both of us .
You think Ibeing the bearer of bad news ?
I did n't have to come in to work today ; I could be kicking it with my eponymous secret religious society right now instead of -- ahem .
I believe I 've said too much .
Anyway , sorry about the news .
I just thought you should hear it from me , a guy Herodotus called " the most able philosopher among the Greeks , " and not some hack like Heraclitus .
Mmkay ?
Cool .
Welp , I 'm gonna go now , this golden thigh is n't going to polish itself .
You have a good one , Seattle !

Analysis : Honestly , I should just copy and paste my Rangers preview from each of the past two years in this space , because nothing has changed for this franchise in ages .
In a nutshell , the following describes the Rangers just about every season :
They can hit .
They have a half - decent bullpen .
Their rotation is a catastrophe .
And they can't field .
What was true of Texas a decade ago is still true today , and you can't even blame the park anymore for their total inability to build a pitching staff ( Arlington was actually neutral last year ) .
Having made the playoffs just three times in their 47 - year history , the Rangers are simply the model franchise when it comes to terrible front office decision - making and ownership groups with motives other than winning .
Since Doug Melvin left town in 2001 ( having led the team to their only 3 playoff appearances ) , it 's been business as usual for Texas : As GM from 2002 - 2005 , John Hart showed none of the acumen he had displayed when building the Indians into a contender in the 1990s .
His successor , Jon Daniels , has been almost as bad on the trade front -- the rest of MLB is littered with quality players who have passed through Texas at some point over the past 3 + years , often departing with little in the way of compensation .
However , there is one bright spot to his tenure : Daniels has taken Texas ' farm system , decimated under Hart , and rebuilt it into one of the best in the game .
Of course , that 's of little help in the short term , so do n't expect anything out of the ordinary from the Rangers in '08 .
Someday this franchise may break the endless cycle of all - hit / no - pitch teams and terrible personnel decisions , but I would n't count on that day coming anytime soon .
Upside : 78 wins
Downside : 73 wins
To read the questions which led to this series , check out part 1 which focused on the motivations and weaknesses of hardcore and softcore rape denialists .
In part 2 , I am focusing on the marketing of rape denial .
To understand how active rape denialists sell rape denial to society at large , I will need to highlight basic psychology and how that relates to behavior which does n't on the surface make any sense .
First , unpopular rape denial .
This is what we hear from child rapists who say their toddler - victim was asking for it .
Definitely bad marketing .
The popular rape denialists hate these people and for many of them it seems to have little to do with the crimes child rapists are trying to deny .
I believe the popular rape denialist 's hatred has more to do with the way this form of rape denial makes the popular rape denialists look suspect when they say , " she was asking for it " about an older rape victim .
Because of this , active and successful rape denialists have a vested interest in seeing that the public dismisses child rapists as monsters who can not be understood .
The popular rape denialists must be seen as having nothing in common with child rapists .
If most of the child rapist 's rationalizations line up with the rationalizations of the popular rape denialists and the public sees this clearly that would make the popular rape denialists much less popular .
This distancing from " real " rapists such as those who rape small children is one of the reasons women rape denialists can become popular .
Katie Rophie 's coldblooded response to college women who talked about about their sexual assaults at anti-rape events was seen by too many people as an impartial assessment when it was no such thing .
Because of Roiphe 's gender , appearance and demeaner she was perceived by many as being more similar in character to genuine rape victims than she was to those who who rape college women .
Yet she squarely aligned herself with those who " rape " college women .
Those " rapists " were in the right and those " rape " victims were in the wrong .
That 's the power of marketing .
To help maintain this power those who reject this bit of marketeering need to be made non-credible quickly so that what they say is ignored or never heard .
Rape denialist marketeers gave us the term feminazi .
As for my claim that the popular and active rape denialists hate of " real " rapists has little to do with the crime , it is important to remember that they are already numb to the pain caused by most rapes .
If a person cannot or will not feel the pain of a college woman who is raped by her boyfriend , how can that person genuinely feel the pain of any rape victim even one attacked while following all the rape denial rules ?
Just look at where these people put their effort .
When they talk or write about rape what percentage of that is dedicated to those they acknowledge as real rapists ?
How much genuine effort has Katie Roiphe put into helping those she acknowledges as real rape victims ?
Yet when a rape denialist hears about someone who is convicted of falsely accusing a man of rape and that woman is n't given a day of jail time , they are outraged -- but look through their past statements and see if you can find similar outrage from them about the number of rapists who are n't convicted or who are n't given a day of jail time .
How often is their discussion of real rape and real rapists little more than a disclaimer before attacking " rape " victims and those who are dedicated to reducing all types of rape ?
Next look at the comparisons rape denialists make .
Keep in mind that rape denialists will stress that real rape is a crime second only to murder .
Now for the comparison : " Rape is a serious crime , but being accused of rape is just as serious . "
Many people who do n't view themselves as rape denialists will nod in agreement .
It is a serious matter when someone is accused of rape .
And rape is a serious crime .
But that is n't what the rape denialist said and this is not the meaning of the comparison .
Through the equivalency of this statement a true accusation of rape becomes an equal punishment for rape .
Rapists who are accused but not charged become people who have suffered as much as their victims have suffered .
This is false and if most of those who agreed with the original comparison considered what they were being sold , they 'd ask for a refund .
This explains the rape denialist passive acceptance of lack of jail time for rapists .
It is also important to note that while this comparison gets used in discussions of false rape reports , the word falsely is omitted before the word accused .
This is no oversight , but is done for marketing purposes .
Also implied through sentence structure is " ... being accused of rape is just as serious of a crime . "
Rape denialists frequently and unashamedly treat girls and women who report rape as if they are criminal defendants so this implication is n't something I am imposing or projecting on them .
Some denialists will come right out and say that alleged rape victims should be the ones who are considered on trial during rape trials .
Some rape denialists have claimed directly that being accused of rape is a form of rape .
This rape of a name has gotten decidedly mixed reviews in the blogosphere and I have n't seen it used much lately .
The claim that attacking a man 's name ( by testifying about sexual harassment , for example ) is no different from attacking a woman 's body might be loved by active rape denialists , but it is a much harder sell to the public at large .
The comparisons made between actual rape and accusations of rape are not part of calls for ethical and complete investigations .
They are calls which support shutting most rape investigations down before they start .
Aborted rape investigations and sloppy investigations are what leave a taint on men who are truly innocent of the accusations made against them .
The more rapists who get away with rape , the greater the taint there is on men who are not rapists .
That means that the rape denialists are not protecting the best interests of men who have never committed a sex crime .
But fear of false accusations sells .
The solution to the taint on the men who are truly innocent is n't to change the law so more rapists get away with rape .
That would increase the taint on the innocent .
It is real rapists not the genuinely innocent who benefit from the changes the rape denialists want so badly .
If a jury ignores a rape defendant 's admission that he forced himself on the alleged victim and acquits that rapist because of their biases about non-stranger rape , the popular denialists declare the man wrongfully accused .
To understand how popular forms of rape denial can work on generally decent people like those allowed to be jurors in rape cases , this post at the The Situationist about the difference between fact and perception shows how our brains adjust based on expectations .
A study found that the same wines described as being of differing quality and cost were perceived in line with the expectations that the description created and out of line with the reality that all of the supposedly different wines were identical .
When rape denialists successfully market false expectations they are having a real impact on those people 's perceptions .
If the expectation in a child rape case is that disclosures of rape and other forms of sexual abuse come from children 's lurid imaginations and the power of vindictive adults then the perception of the evidence in that case will be altered .
When the evidence of abuse is undeniable , the defendant may be judged by how that adult compares to the juror 's expectations about those who sexually abuse children .
The inherent weakness of rape denial marketeering is that thorough investigations can disprove the marketing message .
This is why rape denial marketeers want most rape investigations stopped before they start collecting evidence .
Good research can also disprove many elements of the rape denial marketing message .
Because of this the rape denialists need to attack solid research even if it is clear that their attacks have no validity and are simply a rehash of old attacks which have been discredited .
Here are the most popular rape denialist descriptions for rape followed by a description of this type of rape and the opinions denialists want people to have toward the rapist and rape victim respectively .
Note :
The descriptions are gendered because popular rape denial is gendered .
The saying is " women lie about rape " not " people lie about rape . "
1 ) Real rape : Stranger abducts an innocent young girl from the bus stop or abducts a respectable woman from the mall parking lot .
Hate the rapist .
Feel nothing but respect and pity for the truly innocent rape victim .
2 ) Preventable rape ( includes all date rapes ) : Rape which cannot be denied but which is preceded by any action taken by the rape victim that can be attacked by rape denialists such as consuming even 1 alcoholic beverage .
Not serious enough to warrant criminal charges against the rapist .
Mild disdain for the rapist for taking advantage of stupid or immoral victim .
Strong disdain for rape victim for inviting rape .
3 ) Morning - after regret non-rape ( alternatively called gray rape ) : Rape which gets denied because the rapist claims the victim seemed like a consenting sort of person or because the victim did n't say no convincingly enough or which can be denied because the rapist could n't tell the difference between non-verbal consent and unconsciousness .
Extreme pity for the rapist .
Disgust for the rape victim who is either vindictive or delusional or reckless .
4 ) Get out of trouble non-rape : Rape which is discovered because a parent or someone else asks why the rape victim is in distress or acting oddly .
Extreme pity for the rapist .
Hatred for the rape victim .
5 ) False rape : Rape against one of " those lying women " where there is no DNA evidence proving sexual contact and the rapist does n't use the " it was consensual " defense .
Also used when it is discovered that this rape victim was raped previously and reported that rape .
No conviction of the alleged rape victim is needed for the rape denialist to want a criminal label to stick to the rape victim .
Martyrdom for the rapist .
Hatred for the rape victim and all those who do n't instantly accept this bit of marketeering .
These marketing terms all get used to excuse real rapes -- sometimes even after the rapist is convicted by a jury .
Those who use these marketing terms will describe " real rape " as being horrific and make it clear that they " suffer immeasurably whenever someone is raped . "
A rape victim who is able to keep functioning after rape cannot be a victim of " real rape " because " real rape " makes that impossible .
This is true except when the crime is so horrific that it can not be denied .
Then the rape victim is heroic and brave for continuing to function .
When cops hold rape denialist expectations that 's where there are likely to be hostile interrogations of rape victims .
Some of these cops can learn to see the flaws in their expectations , but others will keep being hostile to most rape victims until they no longer do interviews with rape victims .
We understand the nonsense of snap judgments which come from expectations when a doctor takes one look at a patient who complains of persistant abdominal pain and says , " you 're fine . "
At best that 's guesswork .
Someone with cancer or someone having a heart attack may not look sick .
Guesswork in medicine can cost people their lives when competent medical investigations could save lives .
This is also true in criminal investigations .
Rapists who are ignored because of snap judgments about the victims who report them have gone on to rape and murder .
But rape denialist marketeers do n't want the public to think about that .
The marketing of rape denial demands guesswork and the guess always needs to favor the man accused of rape .
When they get called on this they will often say , " I 'm just looking out for defendant rights . "
If they do n't treat all crimes and all those who report being crime victims in this same way , their response is a well - marketed lie .
The key here is for everyone to be aware that rape denial is being actively marketed and that there are people who work to reframe unacceptable messages until they becomes acceptable and memorable enough for the buyers of rape denial to turn around and become sellers of rape denial .
Part 3 will focus on understanding why some people are passive rape denialists .

Two days ago the Washington Post ran a front page story ... check that ... ran a front page list of debunked rumors , known in some ethical circles as lies , about Barak Obama , titled :
Foes Use Obama 's Muslim Ties to Fuel Rumors About Him
Appalled that thechose to give a national platform to smears and politically motivated whisper campaigns , I asked if thewas The New Drudge ?
I was not alone in my outrage .
As cataloged in a diary by psericks , Media Matters pointed out that they , " reported only Obama 's denials of madrassa smear , not media debunkings , " while the Columbia Journalism Review called it , " the single worst campaign ‘ 08 piece to appear in any American newspaper so far this election cycle . "
Even theown political cartoonist slammed the newspaper , with his caption reading , " So much discussion they ran out of space for the word ' lies ' . "
Making all of this doubly infuriating , was that at the same time the Washington Post was using the front page of their national newspaper to rehash lies , they all but ignored the well - researched , documented news that Rudy Giuliani had sex with his mistress on the taxpayer 's dime .
And what was the Washington Post 's response to the overwhelmingly negative reaction to their new , Drudge - style " reporting " ?
I first checked in with their ever - vigilant ombudsman , Deborah Howell , but she was busy covering the question of whether the murder of Sean Taylor had received too much coverage .
But Lois Romano , " a member of The Washington Post 's team of White House and Congressional reporters , " did respond during the Post Political Hour .
First , on the Obama story :
These are always very difficult decisions -- how to address something that people are talking about , that has clearly become a factor in the race , without taking a position .
Part of our job is to acknowledge that there is a discussion going on and to fact check and lay out the facts .
The Internet has complicated this responsibility because there is so much garbage and falsehoods out there .
This discussion has reached a high pitch on the Internet and our editors decided it was in the readers interest to address it .
I have heard people say that they wo n't support Sen .
Obama because they read he does n't put is hand over his heart during the Pledge of Allegiance .
He has denied this -- so airing some of this and giving him a chance to deny its accuracy could be viewed as setting the record straight .
Where to begin ?
First , their job is to report the news , not to acknowledge and repeat , " so much garbage and falsehoods . "
And did it occur to her that that garbage was n't just on the internet ( s ) , it was on the front page of her so - called respectable newspaper ?
And if it 's their job to lay out the facts , can she start by showing where , " this dicussion has reached a high pitch " ?
Because if repeating lies from random , whacko sites is now newsworthy bystandards , I have a few suggestions for next week 's political coverage : Laura Bush , Murderer , or maybe , George Bush , Complicit Role in 9/11 Attack .
And while they 're at it , maybe they can finally set the record straight ; Apollo Moon landing , fact or fiction ?
Because , hey , it 's all on the internet .
Finally , they were giving Senator Obama , " a chance to deny its accuracy " ?
Great idea .
Perhaps next week the Washington Post will allow him to deny that he beats his wife .
And what about the non-coverage of the Rudy - does - Judi story ?
I would disagree that it was underplayed .
If you 're asking why we did n't put it on the front page , that is because we had nothing new to add to the Politico story at this time .
Well , sure .
The leading contender for the Republican nomination for president was , at best , using creative bookkeeping to subsidize his illicit affair , and three sentences in the middle of an article about the debate wasof coverage .
It 's not like he paid a lot for a haircut or anything .
nd they had nothing to add ?
So , if they had nothing new to add to the fact that the WTC was hit on 9/11 , they would n't run it on the front page ?
If they had nothing new to add to Al Gore announcing his candidacy , they would n't run it on the front page ?
Is that another new standard for the ?
If we do n't break the story , we do n't cover it ?
Matt Drudge will be crushed .
Digby 's take on the Washington Post 's embarrassing lack of journalistic ethics was , " It does n't matter if it 's true or not .
t's out there , " and sadly , their own political reporter seems to agree .
Unless of course what 's out there is a substantial , investigative piece about Rudy Giuliani .
A plan to carry out a Columbine - style shooting at Belvidere High School in June was foiled this week after the town police chief took his suspicions to federal authorities .
Now the FBI and New Jersey State Police are looking at four young adults and six juveniles implicated in a plan that had reached the stage of surveilling school security officers and mapping escape routes after the attack , state police spokesman Al Della Fave said .
" This is a great example in this day and age of how important awareness is , " Della Fave said today .
" This ( school ) administrator took a little bit of information and gave it to the right people and averted a real tragedy . "
Authorities could provide no motive behind the alleged plot .
As of tonight , Della Fave said just one person had been charged .
James M Shipps , 22 , of Water Street , Belvidere , is charged with making terroristic threats , false public alarm and hindering apprehension .
He was sent to Warren County jail in lieu of $ 50,000 bail .
Della
Fave said various homes were searched in Belvidere and White Township .
Belvidere School District Superintendent Dirk Swaneveld said he was told Friday that some staff and students were concerned about a male student involved in a " potential organized threat to the school . "
" Our staff and even a couple of our students provided us with information that would lead us to be concerned , " he said .
Belvidere police Chief Kent Sweigert received a call Sunday night from school officials .
He met with school officials the next morning to discuss concerns they had about a student .
The 17 - year - old White Township boy was coming to school dressed in military clothing and boots and making statements about attacking the school , Sweigert said .
Sweigert said school officials had been monitoring the 17 - year - old and noticed a sudden change in his behavior .
That 's when they contacted police , he said .
The chief spoke to the boy 's father Monday and transported the juvenile to Warren Hospital for a mental - health evaluation .
The boy was admitted to the hospital Monday .
Authorities there recommended his commitment to a mental health facility at St. Clare 's hospital , officials said .
" The father of the juvenile was tremendously cooperative , " Della Fave said .
Heightened security is in place at the school , Sweigert said .
Swaneveld said he stayed in touch with law enforcement officials throughout the day Monday and Tuesday .
The district also brought in substitute teachers to help watch the halls and doors , he said .
" There 's no threat to our students , and there 's been continued police coverage at the school , " Swaneveld said .
Now that the economic crunch is reaching those near the top of the pyramid , there is finally a sense that the U.S. is facing a real crisis .
Forget about a soft landing .
The stock markets continue to tumble .
The dollar has weakened .
The subprime mortgage debacle has morphed into a full - fledged panic .
And Joe Stiglitz is telling us the war in Iraq will cost $ 3 trillion .
Maybe now we can stop listening to the geniuses who insisted that the way to nirvana was to ignore the broad national interest while catering to the desires of those who were already the wealthiest among us .
We have always gotten a distorted picture of how well Americans were doing from politicians and the media .
The U.S. has a population of 300 million .
Thirty - seven million , many of them children , live in poverty .
Close to 60 million are just one notch above the official poverty line .
These near - poor Americans live in households with annual incomes that range from $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 for a family of four .
Gaming has been a hot topic in politics for some time now , with a number of states trying ( and failing ) to put restrictions on the sale of violent video games .
It 's also been touched on in the presidential campaign .
The ESA has responded by talking about making campaign contributions as a way to fight legislation on the sale of games , among other issues .
The Parents Television Council ( " Because Our Children Are Watching " ) has already begun to fight back .
" Let me be clear of our intentions , " PTC president Tim Warner wrote in a press release .
" Any public servant who cashes a check from the video game industry will be exposed by the PTC as taking a stand against families , and his or her actions will be communicated to constituents in his or her congressional district . "
Ars Technica had a chance to talk with Gavin McKiernan , PTC 's national grassroots director about Warner 's strong words .
" The political issue that has the greatest likelihood of being discussed by legislators is also the one that the ESA has expended a great deal of time and money on , and that is to prevent laws that would assist parents in protecting their children from adult entertainment , " McKiernan told Ars .
" The ESA 's contributions will be overwhelmingly based on this issue and their stance on this issue is one that is opposed to the interests of families . "
It was time to ask the obvious question : why focus on games ?
The FTC has found that children are for more likely to be able to buy R-rated movies than M- rated games , so why fight so hard for legislation on the smaller issue ?
" We frequently hear from our members and parents that keeping violent video games out of their children 's hands is a top priority , " McKiernan replied .
" And the evidence is conclusive : countless independent studies confirm that repeated exposure to graphic sexual , violent and profanity - laced video games has a harmful and long term effect on children . "
Well , actually the evidence is anything but conclusive .
In fact , there has never been a conclusive study about the effects of gaming content on children .
A recent meta - analysis of the body of research concluded that there does n't seem to be a link .
Other research simply points out there have not been any solid conclusions at all .
We do know that linking violence and gaming is an attractive option for people looking for answers to the very troubling question of youth violence , but it 's proving to be a harder sell than the PTC would like to admit .
" It is not hard to ' link ' video game playing with violent acts if one wishes to do so , as one video game playing prevalence study indicated that 98.7 percent of adolescents play video games to some degree , " noted one researcher in the meta - analysis study .
Trying to get legislation passed that would " assist " parents in keeping adult entertainment away from children has proven to be an uphill battle , and it wo n't be any different for the PTC ; laws have been attempted and have failed in California , Illinois , Michigan , Indiana , and in many other states .
As Ars has noted before , the " courts have spoken clearly and unanimously : video games are protected by the First Amendment and singling them out for regulation violates the Equal Protection clause in the Fourteenth Amendment . "
The PTC is not discouraged by these past defeats .
" These laws have been struck down on relatively narrow premises , and the opinions have fallen into two basic lines of reasoning , " McKiernan argued .
" The first being that the laws were too vague in their definition of what would be prohibited or restricted or that they developed new definitions that the state was not in a position to create and or interpret .
The second being that some justices felt that there was not sufficient evidence at the time of the hearing to show clear harm to minors as a result of playing certain types of games . "
The PTC claims that it can prove the violence and gaming link in court , but we 've already seen how contradictory the research in this area has been .
The other issue , the vagueness of what would be prohibited , is the big hurdle , and is another reason why games have been given free speech protection in every case .
" Because the ( Illinois law ) potentially criminalizes the sale of any game that features exposed breasts , without concern for the game considered in its entirety or for the game ’s social value for minors , distribution of God of War is potentially illegal , in spite of the fact that the game tracks the Homeric epics in content and theme , " the judges wrote when striking down the Illinois law .
In other words , the context of the sex and violence needs to considered , not just that the sex and violence exists .
This is the case with every other protected work of art , including movies and the written word .
In the case of the Illinois law , the state had to dip into their welfare programs to pay for the defeat , a setback that was sadly predictable .
" Video games , like many other forms of media , have great potential as teaching tools and to entertain and bring families and people together , " McKiernan said when asked about the high number of families who enjoy gaming together , and the mainstream acceptance of the hobby .
" Our members ' greatest concern is with violent video games that can be purchased by children because there currently are no legal ramifications for retailers who sell ' M ' or ' AO ' rated games to minors .
" We limit the sale of firearms , cigarettes and alcohol to minors because of their obvious detrimental effects .
We have reasonable age restrictions for operating motor vehicles .
We should employ similar logic and reason with other products that repeatedly have been proven to be harmful to children , " McKiernan concluded .
The Parents Television Council has its mind firmly made up : violent video games are harmful to those under 18 , and the sales of those games to minors should be made a crime .
Unfortunately , the PTC is giving the concept of parental oversight and responsibility short shrift in its quest for retail legislation .
Janeane Garofalo :
If Colin Powell had found his integrity , he could have changed the course of history Nick Langewis and Mike Aivaz
Published : Saturday September 22 , 2007
Print This Email This Bill Maher sits down with musician Rob Thomas , comedienne Janeane Garofalo and author Salman Rushdie .
The panel discusses the phenomenon of people who do n't speak their minds until they have left their positions of influence , preferring instead to write a memoir or sit down with a reporter to share their grievances , after they can no longer influence change .
Maher cites Alan Greenspan 's latest book , indicting the Republican Party for " abandoning their principles . "
He asks : " Would n't that have been a good thing for him to say while he was the Fed Chairman , perhaps ? "
" It 's not about change , " says Thomas .
" They do n't speak out when it can affect their career . "

" Colin Powell knew he was lying in that ' war of the worlds ' scenario in front of the United Nations . "
" There is no glory , " continues Garofalo .
" In fact , it 's worse afterwards to say ' You know , I knew this was wrong ' -- or ' I knew this was a lie . '
And , if Colin Powell had found his integrity on that day he addressed the United Nations , he could have changed the entire history of most of the world , on that day . "

Interesting Statistical Comparisons
Every 9.74 days , there is an equivalent amount of casualties in Iraq & Afghanistan as September 11th .
There are 9.53 Virginia Tech shootings in Iraq & Afghanistan every day .
There is on average 305 daily civilian deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq .
In 14 days , as many Iraqi and Afghani civilians are killed as the entire amount of American military personnel killed since the invasion of Afghanistan in 2002 and the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Note :
There is some discrepancy between various sources on the amount of civilian casualties since the US - led invasion in Iraq and Afghanistan .
A study in October of 2006 listed over 650,000 killed ( see Washington Post article below ) while other sources vary from over 1 million to just over 80,000 ( see British - government funded Iraq Body Count below ) .
I computed 400,000 Iraqi civilian fatalities and 45,000 Afghani civilian fatalities by averaging several sources , though I personally feel these are conservative estimates .
Update :
The differing methodologies among these studies led to these wide variations .
For example , the lowest figure from IBC is based solely on media reports of violent deaths , while the Lancet study surveyed random families in Iraq and includes non-violent war related deaths , such as those dead to lawlessness and collapsed infrastructure .
Raw Data : 400,000 Iraqi Civilian Deaths , 45,000 Afghani Deaths , 4,208 US Deaths in Iraq ( 3,972 of which are US armed forces and 236 private contractors ) , 415 US Deaths in Afghanistan , and 2,974 September 11th Deaths .

At may resemble a giant rotary washing line , but it might just help Britain meet its hugely ambitious new wind energy targets .
At least that 's the claim of the company developing a novel " vertical axis " wind turbine dubbed the Aerogenerator .
The 144 - metre high V - shaped structure would be mounted offshore and capable of generating up to 9 megawatts of electricity , roughly three times as much power as a conventional turbine of equivalent size .
Switching to such a design could ensure that thousands fewer turbines would be needed in order to meet the government 's new wind power target , says Theo Bird , founder of Windpower , the Blyth - based firm behind the new turbine .
As unique as it may sound , the Aerogenerator is in fact just the latest addition to a family of wind turbines that generate power through a rotating vertical shaft as opposed to the horizontal shafts of the more familiar windmill design .
The idea for VAWTs has been blowing around for decades , but despite many advantages the technology has so far attracted little interest .
That is about to change , according to Bird .
Invented by aeronautical engineer David Sharpe , the Aerogenerator is an adaptation of the egg - whisk - shaped Darrieus wind turbine that solves a number of problems originally posed by the technology .
Not least is the ability to build giant turbines , says Neven Sidor of architectural firm Grimshaws - Windpower 's collaborator and the company behind the Eden Project .
What Sucks About Erlang
There are the languages everyone complains about , and there are the languages no one uses .
Having said that , it 's time to whine about my favorite language I use quite extensively .
Erlang , I love ya , but we need to have a word .
Basic Syntax
Erlang is based originally on Prolog , a logic programming language that was briefly hot in the 80's .
Surely you 've seen other languages based on Prolog , right ?
No ?
Why not ?
Because Prolog sucks ass for building entire applications .
But that has n't deterred Erlang from stealing it 's dynamite syntax .
The problem is , unlike the C and Algol based languages , Erlang 's syntax does away with nested statement terminators and instead uses expression separators everywhere .
Lisp suffers the same problem , but Erlang does n't have the interesting properties of a completely uniform syntax and powerful macro system to redeem itself .
Sometimes a flaw is really a strength .
And sometimes it 's just a flaw .
Because Erlang 's expression terminators vary by context , editing code is much harder than conventional languages .
Refactoring -- cutting and pasting and moving code around -- is particularly hard to do without creating a bunch of syntax errors .
Consider this code :
blah ( true ) -> foo( ) , bar( ) ; blah ( false ) -> baz( ) .
Lets say I want to reorder the branches :
blah ( false ) -> baz( ) ; blah ( true ) -> foo( ) , bar ( ) .
Or change the order which foo ( ) and bar ( ) are called .
blah ( true ) -> bar( ) , foo( ) ; blah ( false ) -> baz( ) .
What 's the problem ?
Note in each example the bar ( ) lines , they have a different character ending each line : bar ( ) ; bar( ) , bar ( ) .
In Algol based languages the statement terminators are the same everywhere ( usually semi-colon , newline or both ) .
The Javascript version : function blah ( flag ) { if ( flag ) { bar ( ) ; foo( ) ; } else { baz( ) ; } }
Erlang expression separators vary context to context and it's simply more mental work to get right .
If Expressions
You might think if branching as something that no language could ever get wrong .
Does n't seem possible does it ?
I was young once too .
The first problem is that every time an if executes it should match at least one of the conditional expression branches .
When it does not , an exception is thrown .
In this example : if X == foo -> foo ( ) ; X == bar -> bar ( )
end
X must be foo or bar , or an if_clause exception is thrown .
This sorta makes some sense since the if 's are n't statements like in C language family , they are more like the C ternary operator ( x == foo ? foo ( ) : bar( ) ) and so must return a value to the caller .
The problem is it prevents simple code like this : if Logging -> log ( " Something happened " ) end
Because if Logging is false , the if throws an if_clause exception !
Instead you are forced to do something like this : if Logging -> log ( " Something happened " ) ; true -> ok end
The only purpose of the true -> ok line is to give it an else condition to match .
That weird taste in the back of your throat ?
It 's probably vomit .
Erlang if s could be so much more useful if it would just return a sensible default when no conditionals match , like an empty list [ ] or the undefined atom .
But instead it blows up with an exception .
If Erlang were a side - effect free functional language , such a restriction would make sense .
But it 's not side effect free , so instead it 's idiotic and painful .
It gets worse .
You cannot even call user defined functions in if conditional expressions !
For example , this wo n't even compile because of the call to user defined should_foo ( X ) :
should_foo( X ) -> X == foo. bar( ) -> if should_foo ( X ) -> % compile error on this line ! foo( ) ; true -> ok end .
This limitation is due to Erlang 's " when clause " pattern matching engine , which needs certain guarantees from the expressions for static optimization .
Erlang allows a subset of the built - in functions ( BIFs ) in conditional expressions , but no user defined functions can be called whatsoever .
How can a language have butchered the if and still be useful ?
Well , fortunately case expressions in Erlang are powerful and damn useful , and a decent substitute for most uses of if : case should_foo ( X ) of true -> foo( ) ; false -> ok end
But like if expressions , case expression also have the limitation that it must match at least one conditional or an exception is thrown .
Bleh .
You Say String of Characters , I Say List of Integers
The most obvious problem Erlang has for applications is sucky string handling .
In Erlang , there is no string type , strings are just a list of integers , each integer being an encoded character value in the string .
It 's not all bad .
It has the benefit of taking the same built - in list operations , libraries and optimizations and reusing them for string processing .
But it also means you can't distinguish easily at runtime between a string and a list , and especially between a string and a list of integers .
From the Erlang Console you get this : 1 > [ 100,111,103 ] == " dog " .
true
Erlang string operations are just not as simple or easy as most languages with integrated string types .
I personally would n't pick Erlang for most front - end web application work .
I 'd probably choose PHP or Python , or some other scripting language with integrated string handling .
Functional Programming Mismatch
Erlang has been a great fit for CouchDB , a network database server .
Once I got over Erlang 's weirdness and accepted its warts , I almost could n't imagine using anything else .
So much of the code seems to want to be expressed in a recursive , functional manner and the lightweight , shared nothing concurrency is a great match for network servers and database internals .
The code is typically much more compact , elegant and reliable than it would be in more conventional languages .
But when it came time to write the test suite code for CouchDB , I found Erlang to be needlessly cumbersome , verbose and inflexible .
Immutable variables in Erlang are hard to deal with when you have code that tends to change a lot , like user application code , where you are often performing a bunch of arbitrary steps that need to be changed as needs evolve .
In C , lets say you have some code :
int f( int x ) { x = foo( x ) ; x = bar(x ) ; return baz(x ) ; }
And you want to add a new step in the function :
int f( int x ) { x = foo( x ) ; x = fab( x ) ; x = bar(x ) ; return baz(x ) ; }
Only one line needs editing ,
Consider the Erlang equivalent :
f ( X ) -> X1 = foo ( X ) , X2 = bar ( X1 ) , baz ( X2 ) .
Now you want to add a new step , which requires editing every variable thereafter : f ( X ) -> X1 = foo ( X ) , X2 = fab ( X1 ) , X3 = bar ( X2 ) , baz ( X3 ) .
Erlang 's context dependent expression separators and immutable variables end up being huge liabilities for certain types of code , and the result is far more line edits for otherwise simple code changes .
For the CouchDB test suite I could feel the syntax fighting me at every turn .
When I switched over to writing the tests in Javascript , things just flowed faster and edits were easier .
Erlang was n't a good match for tests and for the same reasons I do n't think it 's a good match for front - end web applications .
Records
The " records " feature provides a C - ish structure facility , but it 's surprisingly limited and verbose , requiring you to state the type of the record for each reference in the code .
Not once for each variable binding , but you must state the variable 's type each and every place a member of the variable record is referenced .
- record ( foo , { a=0 , b=0 , c=0} ) . bar ( F ) -> baz1 ( F#foo.a ) , baz2 ( F#foo.b ) , F#foo{c=F#foo.c + 1} .
Each of those F#foo is a statement that says " I'm a record variable of type foo " .
And it 's not enough to say it once .
We must say it over and over again each time we use it .
Here is a more idiomatic use of records , which uses pattern matching to extract members into local variables :
bar ( #foo{a=A , b=B, c=C}=F ) -> baz1 ( A ) , baz2 ( B ) , F#foo{c=C + 1} .
Which is still noisy compared to the equivalent in C : struct foo { int a ; int b ; int c ; } foo bar ( foo f ) { baz1 ( f.a ) ; baz2 ( f.b ) ; f.c += 1 ; return f ; }
Another problem is records often feel like a tacked - on hack .
They are compile - time static and record members cannot be added or removed at runtime , and do n't fit with Erlang 's otherwise dynamic nature .
Records are a compile time feature -- not a VM feature -- and are statically compiled down to regular tuples , with the first slot holding the record name atom , and each slot N + 1 corresponding to the Nth entry in record declaration .
At compile time the record member references are converted to integer offsets for tuple operations .
The most noticeable problem is they are n't usable from the REPL command line , it wo n't accept record syntax without special steps and it still does n't show you result records in record syntax .
Same when debugging and dumping stack traces and symbols , the records always look like the tuples they are under the covers , requiring you to mentally decode which tuple slot corresponds to a record member .
Erlang records give you most of the penalties of static typing with very little of the benefit .
Give me memory , or give me death !
Update : On OS X with the most recent Erlang VM ( R12B - 1 , emulator version 5.6.1 ) , I can no longer reproduce this problem .
Yay !
With CouchDB we discovered the hard way how Erlang handles memory allocation errors from the OS :
exit ( 1 ) ;
When the VM cannot get memory from the OS , it just commits hara - kiri .
It does n't just kill the virtual Erlang " process " that needs the memory .
It kills the whole VM , taking along any child OS processes with it .
But at least it's an honorable death .
See for yourself , try this at the Erlang console : Eshell V5.5.3 ( abort with ^G ) 1 > << 0:429967295 >>. beam ( 722,0xa000d000 ) malloc : *** vm_allocate ( size=1782579200 ) failed ( error code=3 ) [.... snip stack trace ....]
Crash dump was written to : erl_crash .dump eheap_alloc : Cannot allocate 1781763260 bytes of memory ( of type " heap " ) .
Abort trap
So no problem you might think , given Erlang 's robust , fail - fast and restart nature , it will restart itself automatically and barely miss a beat .
Well , that 's what I thought , but then I 'm generally a positive guy .
Nope , Erlang wo n't restart itself automatically , that 's something you have to build all by yourself .
The only solution we 've found is to create a parent watchdog process to monitor the VM and restart it if it crashes .
The built - in " heart " child OS process , whose job it is to monitor for an unresponsive Erlang VM and restart it , is also killed when the VM exits .
So we have to roll our own " restart the dead VM " solution and deal with cross- platform issues providing something I 'm still shocked Erlang can't handle itself .
Code Organization
The only code organization offered is the source file module , there are no classes or namespaces .
I 'm no OO fanatic ( not anymore ) , but I do see the real value it has : code organization .
Every time time you need to create something resembling a class ( like an OTP generic process ) , you have to create whole Erlang file module , which means a whole new source file with a copyright banner plus the Erlang cruft at the top of each source file , and then it must be added to build system and source control .
The extra file creation artificially spreads out the code over the file system , making things harder to follow .
What I wish for is a simple class facility .
I do n't need inheritance or virtual methods or static checking or monkey patching .
I 'd just like some encapsulation , the ability to say here is a hunk of data and you can use these methods to taste the tootsie center .
That would satisfy about 90 % of my unmet project organization needs .
Uneven Libraries and Documentation
Most of core Erlang is well documented and designed , but too many of the included modules are buggy , overly complex , poorly documented or all three .
The Inets httpd server we 've found incredibly frustrating to use in CouchDB and are discarding it for a 3rd party Erlang HTTP library .
The XML processor ( Xmerl ) is slow , complicated and under documented .
Anything in Erlang using a GUI , like the debugger or process monitor , is hideous on Windows and pretty much unusable on OS X .
The OTP build and versioning system is complicated and verbose and I still do n't understand why it is like it is .
And crufty .
I know Erlang has been evolving for real world use for a long time , but that does n't make the cruftyness it 's accumulated over the years smell any better .
The coding standards in the core Erlang libraries can differ widely , with different naming , argument ordering and return value conventions .
It 's tolerable , but it 's still there and you must still deal with it .
Erlang Really Sucks ?
Yes , in all the ways I just described and more that I did n't .
But also no .
Erlang is amazing in ways it would take a whole book to describe properly .
It 's not a toy built to satisfy the urges of academics , it 's used in successful , real world products .
But there is a good chance that Erlang just is not a good match for your uses .
This list is n't meant to put down Erlang , but as an honest assessment of it's weaknesses , which I think are n't discussed enough .
Posted March 9 , 2008 3:46 PM
As I read through Aaron Gustafson ’s Beyond DOCTYPE : Web Standards , Forward Compatibility , and IE8 , my immediate gut reaction was deeply negative .
The version - targeting mechanism Aaron described was just wrong , completely backwards , the exact opposite of what we ought to be doing .
Every one of my instincts , honed over a decade - plus of web development , was in opposition .
Article Continues Below
Why did I react that way ?
Partly because version targeting looked like the revenge of browser sniffing .
True , before browsers supported standards correctly , sniffing was often a necessary way of coping with their incompatibilities , but it never really worked in the long run .
No sooner did you finish uploading your script than a new version of an old browser came along to break it .
The fragile , self - defeating nature of browser sniffing was one of the forces behind the rebellion that eventually brought standards to our browsers .
And here it was , I thought , being legitimized and enshrined in the code base of a web browser .
Primarily , though , I was bothered by version targeting because it runs contrary to the principle of forward - compatible development .
This has been the best practice of our industry for years now , a way - of - being learned the hard way in the browser wars .
We develop with an eye to the future , using features that are widely and stably implemented and only adding “ cutting - edge ” features when they do n’t impair use of the site — this last practice known as progressive enhancement .
One example of this approach is the techniques described in “ Going To Print ” , which add URLs in printed pages for advanced browsers but do n’t prevent or break printing in less capable browsers .
With version targeting , the incentive to plan ahead , to be forward - looking , is almost entirely destroyed .
Instead , the browser makes a promise to always be backwards compatible .
In effect , version targeting is like Time Machine for web browsers .
The idea is that when IE10 loads up my IE7 page , it rewinds itself to act like IE7 did , all those years ago — no matter what changed in the meantime .
Thus , as a developer , there ’s no need to look beyond the current state of browsers .
I can just assume that browsers will always support what I ’ve done even if it ’s the worst kind of short - sighted , browser - specific , who - needs - standards - anyway type of development possible .
And as for the expected direction of browser support for CSS or JavaScript or HTML5 or whatever …who cares ?
Reality check#section2
Well , who does care ?
The readers of A List Apart , surely , and there are a great many of us .
But as survey after analysis shows , the vast majority of web content is produced without much regard for standards - based , forward - compatible principles .
Yes , we have made great strides ; yes , the work of educating developers has borne some fruit .
Still , we need to be honest about this .
We ’re not reaching everyone , and probably never will .
Some sites will be developed according to what the browser - of - the - moment does , no matter how incorrect that might be in comparison to a specification or even other browsers ’ behaviors .
This creates a dilemma for browser vendors when faced with bugs in their implementations : fix it or preserve it ?
The classic example of this was the original implementation of height and width in Internet Explorer , which was wrong per the CSS specifications .
The IE team at the time became aware of this fairly soon after they shipped it in IE3 … and yet the problem was n’t fixed until IE6 , a delay that slowed the adoption of CSS and gave rise to a whole family of JavaScript sniffers and CSS hacks .
DOCTYPE switching came to the rescue there , of course , allowing IE6 to preserve its old ( wrong ) behavior in “ quirks mode ” and do the right thing in “ standards mode ” — a mechanism introduced in IE5 for the Macintosh and quickly adopted by other browsers .
Let ’s consider that for a moment .
With the DOCTYPE switch , web browsers effectively recognized two version states : old and current .
There was the way things were done in Ye Olden Days , before DOCTYPE switching , and the latest and greatest .
Speeding advances#section3
So we already have an example of version targeting in the DOCTYPE switch .
Once I came to that realization , my instincts were thrown into confusion .
After all , I was a big proponent of DOCTYPE switching , and still rely on it to this day .
Did I hate this whole idea , or not ?
Like DOCTYPE switching did in 2000 , version targeting negates the vendor argument that existing behaviors ca n’t be changed for fear of breaking web sites .
If IE8 botches its implementation of some CSS property or DOM method , the mistake can be fixed in IE9 without breaking sites developed in the IE8 era .
This actually makes browser vendors more susceptible to pressure to fix their bugs , and less fearful of doing so .
That ’s huge , as fundamentally game changing as was DOCTYPE switching , but on an ongoing basis .
Just imagine how much sooner “ height ” and “ width ” could have been fixed in IE , had this mechanism been in place from the beginning .
Furthermore , if this all works as advertised , it ’s eventually going to make web development a lot less reliant on virtual machines .
If you need to support the current and previous versions of a browser , you just change your X - UA - Compatible value to the older version and see how things are — no copy of Virtual PC required .
That wo n’t happen right away , but it ’s a reasonable eventual outcome .
The new sniff test#section4
We ’re over browser sniffing , though , are n’t we ?
Did n’t somebody call it “ fragile ” and “ self - defeating ” ?
( Ahem . )
Well , yes , but there are crucial differences between “ browser sniffing ” as we know it and the proposed version targeting .
For one thing , “ browser sniffing ” at present means “ writing code to check what browser is being used and make adjustments to the markup / CSS / JS / server response / whatever accordingly . ”
Version targeting reverses that completely , making it “ the browser checking the page to see when it was developed and making adjustments to its behavior accordingly . ”
In other words , version targeting frees web developers from sniffing and places the onus on browser developers instead .
That ’s not a change to be lightly dismissed .
Browser implementors , for all they frustrate us with ( often justified ) pleas of limited resources , still command far more resources and expertise in regression testing than any of us can muster .
Furthermore , browser developers have a far more vested interest in making sure the version targeting works as promised and does n’t break old sites than site authors do in updating their old sites to work in new browsers .
The benefits of hindsight # section5
The second major difference between browser sniffing and version targeting is that browser sniffing looks forward while version targeting looks back .
Looking forward is one big reason browser sniffing is fragile : it ’s hard to predict the future .
To pick one example , Safari ’s inclusion of “ like Gecko ” in its user - agent identifier broke a fair number of sniffer scripts — even those that were comparatively well done .
The authors of those scripts had simply failed to predict that a non-Gecko browser from Apple would include the word “ Gecko ” in its user - agent identifier .
Now we have the prospect that browser sniffing will be done by the browsers , and will look back .
This is inherently far more stable : the past is always a lot easier to predict than the future .
Besides which , we ’ve written enough scripts and hacks to make our pages adjust to browsers .
Is n’t it about time browsers started adjusting to our pages ?
To sum up #section6
We know forward - compatible development works .
More to the point , though , it ’s all we ’ve had .
Since the inception of the web , with the sole exception of DOCTYPE switching , browsers have been a “ what I do is what you get ” proposition .
Developers have been forced to conform to past browsers ’ behaviors while making educated guesses about what future browsers would do .
Forward - compatible development and its cousin , progressive enhancement , were necessary and proper because they were the only hope we had of sites continuing to work into the future .
The mantra of forward compatibility was necessitated by the world in which we worked .
In a world where browsers had done version targeting from the outset , there would have been another option .
Who knows what might have happened ?
Perhaps we ’d find the very idea of forward - compatible development hopelessly fragile , even laughable .
We say forward - compatible development is the mark of a professional because that ’s what the profession demands .
With the advent of version targeting , that need may simply evaporate , rendered not wrong but moot .
And though my deeply - ingrained instincts still fight that conclusion , I have to do my best to look at this possible future and ask myself if it looks better or worse than what we ’ve known .
It looks better .
So in the end , and much to my surprise , it turned out that I do n’t hate the idea after all .
Version targeting allows browsers to much more easily develop new features and fix bugs and shortcomings in existing features , which has the potential to speed up the evolution of web design and development .
That alone is reason enough to give it a chance .
Of course , I still have concerns .
The biggest concern is fidelity .
Will the backwards - compatible code for IE8 always act exactly like IE8 did , or will there be subtle changes that still break old sites ?
Might there even be , dare we mention it , new bugs that affect the backwards compatibility of future browsers ?
After all , the door swings both ways : vendors might get lax about their backward - looking code just as developers might get lax about their forward - looking code .
Talk about irony .
A small concern is the effect of version - targeting code on the size of browser applications themselves .
Could this be a step toward browsers becoming bloatware ?
Someone will chime in with “ Who cares ?
Hard drives are huge now ! ” but I remain solidly unconvinced by “ resources are cheap ” arguments .
No matter how cheap they are , people still keep filling them up .
I sincerely hope the browser of the future wo n’t require a gigabyte or two of storage space , chained to every previous version of itself like Jacob Marley to his past misdeeds .
I ’m definitely not a fan of the “ edge ” keyword .
The reason for its existence seems to be so that nobody has to hack their way around the targeting mechanism with “ IE=1024 ” or some other large number .
The problem is that providing a keyword equivalent for that creates an aura of official blessing that I do n’t think Microsoft wants to give .
It ’s in their interest to have everyone use this mechanism , and the keyword acts as a wink and a nod to people who want to avoid it .
I ’m all for people hacking around the targeting mechanism if they want — I may well do it myself — but that should be done with a hack , not an official keyword .
DOCTYPE as version targeting #section9
I wish I could be happy about the way pages are handled in the absence of any version - targeting information .
If a page does n’t have any version - targting information , then the DOCTYPE will be used as a proxy for version targeting .
For example , all the HTML4 and XHTML1 DOCTYPE s will be targeted to IE7 by default .
In the future , HTML5 DOCTYPE s might by default be targeted to IE9 or IE10 , depending on how things shake out .
Of course , a developer can avoid all that by providing an explicit browser version : an HTML2 document can be targeted to IE9 ; an HTML6 document can be targeted to IE7 .
But in the absence of explicit version - targeting information , the DOCTYPE will be used as a stand - in and map to a specific version .
From Microsoft ’s point of view , this is necessary : without this , untargeted pages could be broken by new versions of IE .
I get that .
But it means that in order to have pages handled they way they ’ve always been , essentially moving forward with browsers , you have to hack around the targeting mechanism with a really large version number — or the edge keyword , if it does n’t get dropped .
The biggest challenge , it seems , will be to make sure that version targeting is done in such a way that it will work into the future and not break down over time like DOCTYPE switching did .
In other words , we need to make sure it ’s forward - compatible .
I guess those instincts came in handy after all .

Data Structures in the Andrew Text Editor

With bit - mapped graphics systems , like IBM 's RT PC , text can be much more than a stream of ASCII characters .
There can be many variations as shown in Figure 1 : differences in font , face code , size , justification , indentation , sub - or superscripts , and so on .
In this article I want to describe how the Andrew system stores text and displays it on the screen .
As a focus , I will look at the question of how a character gets to the screen after being typed .
In older hardware this echoing was done by the display device itself , but in modern workstations considerable software is involved .
My emphasis will be on the data structures .
In a given font family , like the seriffed font in this sentence , there are relatives in several sizes , both smaller and larger .
For each of the sizes the family will have variants with bold and italic faces , and sometimes even bold - italic .
For displaying computer listings there will be a font family with fixed width characters .
For a modern look there are other font families having no serifs .

Before getting on , however , I need to say just a few words about workstations and Andrew .
For this article let me define a workstation as a deskside computer with :
a hard disk - - twenty or more megabytes ,
at least two megabytes of real memory ,
a virtual memory management system ,
a speed of at least a million instructions per second ,
a network connection ,
a mouse ,
and a mega - pixel bit - mapped display .
Andrew is the name of the software produced by the Information Technology Center , a joint project of IBM and Carnegie - Mellon University .
One aspect of the project is a distributed file system designed so that if you have an account you can sit down at any of five thousand work stations and get your files .
You can also give anyone permission to read your files , without the inconvenience of making and transporting a floppy disk .
This same communication network is the basis of Andrew 's comprehensive electronic mail system .
The Andrew user interface software includes a window manager , a subroutine package for dealing with text , an editor and mail system that utilize the text package , and numerous other facilities .
I find the large screen to be a significant advantage in my work .
I often look at two or more source files at once to write a third or answer a mail message .
In the screen image shown in Figure 2 , I am writing this article and checking a source file for the definition of the data structure for documents .
Figure 2 : An Andrew Screen Image .
In this example I am writing this article and checking a source file .
Top to bottom in the left column are a system status window , a shell window for giving commands , and an editor for the styles in this article ; the latter is open to the style used for Algorithms .
In the right column are the editor working on this document and another editor where I am checking source code .
This article attempts to describe how the Andrew system stores and displays text .
However , I have taken liberties with the names of routines and simplified many of the details so they are not the same as the actual implementation .
Moreover , an improved Andrew formatting system is being built and it differs in many ways from what is described here .
Much of the software described below was originally written by James Gosling who based it on his version of the Emacs editor .
Documents : How to Store Text
Figure 3 : An Andrew document .
The length of this document is 35 characters .
Characters 0 , 9 , 22 , and 34 are W , r , w , and question mark , respectively .
At this point I could tell you how documents are implemented , but I prefer to let you puzzle over that while I describe how applications manipulate documents .
Conceptually , the program refers to the document as a stream of characters , with the first numbered as zero .
See Figure 3 .
To have a document , a program first declares a variable to refer to it :
struct document * doc ;
This declares doc to be a pointer to a control block for a document ; one element , length , is the number of characters in the document .
The principle operations on documents are these four routines :
NewDocument ( initiallength ) - returns a pointer to a control block for a newly created document with capacity for initiallength characters .
The document can get bigger than initiallength , so the exact value is not particularly important .
CharAt ( doc , position ) - returns the character presently at location position in document doc .
Will return nonsense if position is negative or as large or larger than the number of characters in the document .
If doc has the contents shown in Figure 3 , CharAt ( doc , 1 ) returns the value ' h ' .
( For performance , CharAt is implemented as a macro in C. ) InsertString ( doc , position , string , length ) - inserts length characters from string into document doc .
The insertion is such that the first inserted character will wind up in location position .
The call InsertString ( doc , 9 , " talking " , 8 ) will convert Figure 3 to discuss a " talking raven " .
DeleteChars ( doc , position , length ) - Deletes length characters from doc , beginning with the character at location position .
The call DeleteChars ( doc , 22 , 8 ) would result in " Why is a raven like a desk ? "
With just these routines we can implement all of the operations on documents that are usually available in text editors .
For example , when the user types a letter to be inserted in the document , the routine called is InsertCharacterCommand , as shown in Algorithm 1 .
Here and below the Algorithms are written in a subset of C similar to Pascal .
Note that a declaration containing an asterisk before the identifier declares that variable to be a pointer to the indicated type .
As a special case , if variable str is to refer a string of characters it is declared as " char * str " .
Given a pointer one may either extract an element -- as in doc -> length to get the length of a document -- or subscript it to get an element of an array of the given type -- as in str[ i ] to get the ( i+1 ) st character of str .
( The first character is str [ 0 ] . )
Algorithm 1 : Code called when a character is typed .
Doc is the document being edited and CaretLocation is the place currently selected for insertion .
InsertCharacterCommand ( c ) char c ; { char s [ 1 ] ; /* string to pass to InsertString */ s [ 0 ] = c ; /* copy the character into s */ InsertString ( doc , CaretLocation , s , 1 ) ; /* insert it */ }
For a more extensive example , consider the global replace operation .
The user is prompted to provide an old string and a new one , then the editor replaces every instance of the old string in the text with the new one .
We need first the routine in Algorithm 2 to find an instance of a string in a document and return its location .
Note that the outer while loop terminates when the length remaining in the document is shorter than the string str .
The inner while loop terminates either when it finds the string , when i>=len , or when the ith character of the string does not equal the ( pos+i ) th character of the document .
Given the routine find we can write Algorithm 3 to do the global replace .
In practice it would be called by the command processor after it has requested the old and new strings from the user .
Algorithm 2 : Finding a string in a document
/* find - search document doc forward from location pos for string str .
Return the location of str or - 1 if it's not there */ int find ( doc , pos , str ) struct document * doc ; /* document to search */ int pos ; /* where to start looking */ char * str ; /* what to look for */ { int len , i ; len = strlen ( str ) ; /* compute length of string */ while ( pos+len <= doc-> length ) { /* check to see if str is in document starting at pos */ i = 0 ; while ( i < len && str[ i ] ==CharAt( doc , pos+i ) ) /* the first i+1 characters of str match the characters in the document at positions pos , pos+1 , pos+2 , ... , pos+i */ i = i + 1 ; if ( i==len ) /* the entire string matches */ return ( pos ) ; pos = pos + 1 ; /* no match at pos , go on to next */ } return ( - 1 ) ; /* no match at all , report failure */ }
Algorithm 3 : Global replace operation
/* subst - Replace every occurence of string old in doc with string new */ subst ( doc , old , new ) struct document * doc ; /* where to do the global replace */ char * old ; /* the string to be replaced */ char * new ; /* the string to replace it with */ { int pos , oldlen , newlen ; /* declare local variables */ oldlen = strlen ( old ) ; /* compute length of strings */ newlen = strlen ( new ) ; pos = find ( doc , old , 0 ) ; /* find first instance of old */ while ( pos >= 0 ) { /* there is an instance , replace it */ DeleteChars ( doc , pos , oldlen ) ; InsertString ( doc , pos , new , newlen ) ; pos = find ( doc , old , pos+newlen ) ; /* find next instance */ } }
How then is a document implemented ?
By brute force .
The struct document control block points to a single array of characters large enough to store the text of the document .
You can perhaps imagine two problems with this scheme .
The first is that each insertion might entail moving the entire rest of the document for each character inserted .
This is avoided by leaving a gap in the middle of the text array at the location of the most recent insertion or deletion .
If I insert a character in the first paragraph and then move to the last paragraph and make an insertion there , the gap is moved by moving all intervening characters , filling the old gap and leaving a new one .
After too many insertions the second problem is reached : the document text exceeds the array size .
But some documents will never grow large .
How then can the size of the text array be adjusted to accomodate both small stable documents and large growing documents ?
Again Andrew uses a brute force solution :
When an insertion would make the text too large , a new array fifty percent larger is allocated and the existing text is copied to it .
The solutions to both problems potentially require copying large portions of a document , which might be thought to be disconcerting to the user .
I can report , however , that after two years of experience with the system I have never noticed a delay for copying the text .
After all , a typical document is less than a 100,000 characters and a typical copy loop has about six instructions .
At one million instructions per second , the entire copy takes no more than 0.15 seconds , when moving four characters per cycle .
Most documents are shorter , so the time to copy the text is insignificant ; it takes longer than that to paint a full screen of text .
Instead of the data structure in Figure 4 , some editors use an alternative with a linked list of control blocks , one for each line .
It is undeniable that this structure can be much faster for the operations of insertion and deletion of characters ; there is never a copy anywhere near as long as 0.15 seconds .
But other delays are encountered , especially in a paging environement .
Not only does the data structure take considerably more space -- sometimes twice as much -- but the control blocks and text lines can become scattered over numerous virtual memory pages .
When that happens a single screen repaint may require touching twice as many pages as there are lines on the screen .
If they cannot all fit in memory , lengthy paging delays occur .
With the Andrew data structure paging is minimized .
struct document { char * body ; /* points to text area */ long size ; /* space available at `body ' */ long length ; /* total length of the present contents */ long part1len ; /* number of characters before the gap */ char * part2body ; /* ( see caption ) */ } ;
writing -
The complete Andrew document data structure is shown in Figure 4 .
With this structure InsertCharacter and DeleteChars are written in terms of two subroutines .
GapTo ( doc , position ) moves the gap so it occurs just before the character at the given position .
Then a deletion can be made simply by decreasing the size of the document and increasing the value which says where the text after the gap begins .
( The initial part of the text after the gap is thus deleted . )
For insertions the routine RoomFor ( doc , size ) is also used .
It ensures that the gap is big enough for an insertion of size characters .
It is a bit of C arcanery , but here is the full declaration of CharAt :
/* CharAt ( d , n ) accesses character n of document d. d and n must be side - effect free .
*/ #define CharAt( d , n ) ((n ) <(d ) -> part1len \ ? ( ( unsigned char *) ( d ) -> body ) [ n ] \ : ( ( unsigned char *) ( d ) -> part2body ) [ n ] )
Markers : How to Update the Display
Marker magic occurs because they are updated two ways by InsertString and DeleteChars .
These routines adjust marker limits so they always refer to the same part of the text .
If the string " talking " is inserted in Figure 5 at position 9 , just before the ' r ' , the position value of marker C is incremented by eight , the length value for marker B is increased by eight , and marker A is unchanged .
While adjusting limits a changed flag is set in a marker if the text it refers to is modified .
For the insertion of " talking " , the flag is set only for marker B . ( The text referred to by C has moved , but not changed . )
Once the flag has been set , it remains set until some routine outside the document package turns it off .
Usually this is a routine associated with the routine that created the marker in the first place .
Figure 5 : Three markers on a document .
Marker A ( position :0 length : 6 ) refers to the text " Why is " , B ( position : 7 length : 12 ) refers to " a raven like " , and C ( position : 15 length : 14 ) refers to " like a writing " .
Note that the text refered to by markers can overlap .
From the discussion so far we can deduce the fields of a marker control block .
Each struct document has a pointer to the list of markers associated with the document , and each marker has a pointer , doc , to its document .
The extent of the text referred to is given by position and length .
If the referenced text is changed the changed flag is set .
And finally we have next and prev fields to connect the markers together in a doubly - linked list .
The routines to update markers are straightforward except for one decision that must be made :
If an insertion is made at either end of the text referred to by a marker , is the length field of the marker made bigger ?
The Andrew answer is that the marker is made longer if the position of the insertion is a character that is referred to by the marker .
Thus the length of a marker m will be increased only if m->position <= InsertionPosition < m->position+m->length .
Note that this rule will never extend the length of a marker that has length zero .
How then do markers aid in updating the display ?
The trick is that the display management portion of the editor keeps a marker for each line displayed on the screen .
The line is redisplayed on the screen only if the text it refers to has changed .
To make this possible , the editor is carefully partitioned between the routines which respond to user inputs and those which update the display .
At the highest level is a main loop which determines whether there is user input and processes it .
The loop defers calling the screen update routine until no input is pending .
This main loop utilizes a data structure for each portion of the screen .
For a document the data structure representing its screen image is the view , a structure that keeps all the information needed to format the document for display .
Among the fields of a view are these :
ViewTop - a marker whose position indicates the first character to be displayed on the top line of the image for this document .
Line - an array of LineImage data structures , one for for each line to be displayed .
The LineImage for each line includes m , a marker for the text displayed on the line ; y , the screen y coordinate of the top of the line ; and height , the height of the line .
NumberOfScreenLines - how many lines are displayed for this view .
left , top , width , height - these describe the subrectangle of the window devoted to this text view .
Left and top are the x and y coordinates of the upper left corner ; width and height give the size of the window .
The marker for the ith line is view -> Line [ i ] ->m.
Curiously , it must refer to text beyond the end of the ith line because insertion of a space in the first word of the ( i+1 ) st line may require the ith line to be redrawn with a short new word at its end .
Thus the marker must include all the text on the line and also the first word of the next line .
Given these considerations we can now describe the update routine ; it reconciles the screen image with the new contents of the document in three phases .
The first determines which text lines have to be redrawn based on the changed flags in the Line array .
In this process it calls a subroutine , DetermineSpacing which marches across the line interpreting the formatting information so it can find the height and width of each character and the widths for spaces to perform justification .
All this information is preserved in the LineImage structure for the line and the value returned by DetermineSpacing is the position in the document of the first character for the next line .
Note that an unchanged line may have to be redrawn if its y coordinate changes or if the previous line ends at a different position in the text .
The second phase of the update routine erases the old text from each portion of the display that is to be redrawn .
The third phase then plots each line that has been identified as needing to be redrawn .
The heart of this phase is a call on SendTextToDisplay which uses the information recorded in the LineImage by DetermineSpacing and actually sends the characters to the screen ,
The three phases of the view update process are sketched in Algorithm 4 .
Algorithm 4 : Updating a view .
The work of understanding the style information is hidden within DetermineSpacing and SendTextToDisplay .
/* Phase 1 : Find lines that need to change
in this view due to changes in doc .*/
{ int NextPosition ; /* position of start of next line */ int y ; /* y coordinate of top of next line to display */ int i ; /* i sequences through the lines displayed */ NextPosition = view -> ViewTop -> position ; y = 0 ; i = 0 ; while (y < view - > height && NextPosition < doc-> length { /* decide which lines need to be redisplayed and choose space width for justification */ struct LineImage * ThisLine ; /* address of the ith line */ /* ( " This Line " is used for lack of Pascal 's with statement ) */ ThisLine = & ( view -> Line[i ] ) ; if ( NextPosition != ThisLine ->m->position || y != ThisLine ->y ) { ThisLine ->m-> changed = True ; ThisLine ->m->position = NextPosition ; This Line ->y = y ; } if ( ThisLine ->m -> changed ) NextPosition = DetermineSpacing ( ThisLine ) ; y = y +
This Line - > height ; i = i+1 ; } view -> NumberOfScreenLines = i ; }
{ int i , j ; For each group of consecutive changed lines { set i to the first in the group and j to the last ; erase the rectangle that has an upper left corner of ( view - > left , view - > Line [ i ] ->y ) and a lower right of ( view - > right , view -> Line[j ] ->y+ view ->
Line[j ] -> height - 1 ) ; } }
{ int i ; /* cycle through the lines */ i = 0 ; while ( i < view -> NumberOfScreenLines ) { /* now redisplay the changed lines */ struct LineImage * ThisLine ; /* address of ith line */ ThisLine = & ( view -> Line[i ] ) ; if ( ThisLine ->m -> changed ) { SendTextToDisplay ( ThisLine ) ; ThisLine ->m-> changed = False ; } i = i+1 ; } }
To review , here is how a typed character gets to the screen : the interaction routine updates the document with InsertString , which sets the changed flag in a marker in one of the elements of the Line array in the view .
The update routine finds that the marker for the line is changed , erases the existing line , and replots the line -- now with the new character .
It is part of the miracle of modern workstations that this all happens fast enough to keep up with any typist .
( Incidentally , if Lewis Carroll had been asked the Mad Hatter 's riddle , I suspect he might have answered that the desk wrote " Nevermore " . )

It was at the Au’some Candies booth along with a bunch of their other Nintendo - themed candy .
The company showed it to me behind the glass so I never actually got to touch it but I did take the picture you see above .
It looks like it dispenses blue disc candy from the top … maybe using one of the controller buttons ?
Perhaps these will be easier to find than a real Wii ( curse you Nintendo ) !

Dr. Lawrence Britt , a political scientist , wrote an article about fascism which appeared in Free Inquiry magazine , a journal of humanist thought .
Dr. Britt studied the fascist regimes of Hitler ( Germany ) , Mussolini ( Italy ) , Franco ( Spain ) , Suharto ( Indonesia ) , and Pinochet ( Chile ) and found that the regimes had 14 things in common .
The 14 characteristics are :
1.. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism – Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos , slogans , symbols , songs , and other paraphernalia .
Flags are seen everywhere , as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays .
2.. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights – Because of fear of enemies and the need for security , the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of “ need . ”
The people tend to ‘ look the other way ’ of even approve of torture , summary executions , assassinations , long incarcerations of prisoners , etc .
3.. Identification of Enemies / Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause –
The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe ; racial , ethnic or religious minorities ; liberals ; communists ; socialists ; terrorists , etc .
4.. Supremacy of the Military – Even when there are widespread domestic problems , the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding , and the domestic agenda is neglected .
Soldiers and military service are glamorized .
5.. Rampant Sexism –
The government if fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male - dominated .
Under fascist regimes , traditional gender roles are made more rigid .
Opposition to abortion is high , as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy .
6.. Controlled Mass Media – Sometimes the media is directly controlled by the government , but in other cases , the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation , or through sympathetic media spokespeople and executives .
Censorship , especially in wartime , is very common .
7.. Obsession with National Security – Fear is used as a motivation tool by the government over the masses .
8.. Religion and Government are Intertwined – Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion .
Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders , even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government ’s policies or actions .
9.. Corporate Power is Protected –
The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders in power , creating a mutually beneficial business / government relationship and power elite .
10 .. Labor Power is Suppressed – Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government , labor unions are either eliminated entirely or are severely suppressed .
11.. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts – Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education , and academia .
It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested .
Free expression in the arts is openly attacked , and governments often refuse to fund the arts .
12 .. Obsession with Crime and Punishment – Under fascist regimes , the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws .
The people are often willing to overlook police abuses , and even forego civil liberties , in the name of patriotism .
There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations .
13 .. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption – Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions , and who use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability .
14 .. Fraudulent Elections – Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham .
Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against ( or even the assassination of ) the opposition candidates , the use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries , and the manipulation of the media .
Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections .

WASHINGTON  President Bush chastised Iran on Tuesday for committing a “ provocative act ” by confronting United States Navy warships in the Persian Gulf over the weekend .
The Pentagon released video showing Iranian speedboats maneuvering around the American convoy .
“ We viewed it as a provocative act , ” Mr. Bush told reporters in the Rose Garden , just hours before he left for a weeklong trip to the Middle East .
“ It is a dangerous situation , and they should not have done it , pure and simple . ”
The episode took place Sunday in the strategic Strait of Hormuz and was initially described by American officials on Monday .
They said five armed Iranian speedboats approached three United States Navy warships in international waters , then maneuvered aggressively as radio threats were issued that the American ships would be blown up .
The confrontation ended without shots fired or injuries .
The video runs just over four minutes and , according to Pentagon officials , was shot from the bridge of the guided missile destroyer Hopper .
It supported the American version of events , by showing Iranian speedboats maneuvering around and among the Navy warships , quite close to the convoy .
Andrew Leonard notes the administration 's unwillingness to share the benefits of trade with the losers :
" Free " trade has a price , President Bush , by Andrew Leonard : On Tuesday , President Bush stumped for free trade in Jacksonville , Fla .
Compared to at least one other speech delivered the same day , it would be stretching to call his address newsworthy .
He picked a port town that benefits from trade to deliver a well - worn message : trade is good for America .
This is not an argument that How the World Work disagrees with , fundamentally .
But " trade , " in general , is a quite different beast from bilateral free trade agreements designed to gain market access for highly - capitalized special interests , such as the pharmaceutical industry .
And that 's what Bush was really stumping for :
The President wants the Senate to get moving on three FTAs currently awaiting ratification : deals with Colombia , Panama , and South Korea .
You might imagine that during a week in which the deepest financial crisis to threaten the U.S. economy in many years reached a fever pitch , Bush would find other matters to occupy his attention , but no : in Jacksonville , Bush 's big lament was how unfair it was that " many U.S. exports going to Colombia face heavy tariffs . "
Unhappily for the President , the Senate is evincing very little interest in ratifying the Colombian FTA .
Sen .
Max Baucus , D - Mt. , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , has his own priorities .
He wants the government 's Trade Adjustment Assistance ( TAA ) program beefed up before he is willing to even consider a vote on the Colombian FTA .
...
The Trade Adjustment Assistance program is designed to compensate manufacturing sector workers who are displaced by trade .
It includes financial support for education and training , a health care credit , wage insurance and other goodies .
But its scope is limited , not just to the manufacturing sector , but also to trade that takes place with countries with whom the U.S. already has signed free trade agreements .
TAA , theoretically , has bipartisan support .
In Jacksonville , the President made a gesture towards it : Now , you 're going to hear the word trade adjustment assistance talked about in Congress ....
That basically says that we 're going to have education programs aimed at helping people find skills ...
And I 'm a supporter , and I believe it 's important that trade adjustment be a component of our trade policy .
I look forward to working with Congress to reform it and to reauthorize it , to make sure it does the job that it can -- is supposed to do .
Just like I 'm looking forward to signing those trade bills , particularly starting with the one from Colombia .
A supporter ?
In October , when the House of Representatives passed a revamped and expanded TAA , the White House immediately announced that the President would veto the bill if it was presented to him .
The House bill would have , among other things , doubled funding , extended coverage to service sector workers , included trade with non-FTA countries , and significantly boosted the health care credit .
The White House opposes all of those elements .
When George Bush says he is looking forward to a " reformed and reauthorized " TAA what he really means is a bill without teeth .
Thus , the deadlock in the Senate -- a classic case of horse - trading in action .
Sen .
Baucus has made his position clear -- no new FTAs without a bigger safety net .
A very good argument can be made that the existing Trade Adjustment Assistance program is n't the best way to take care of American workers who have been adversely affected by globalization .
It is expensive to administer , covers a relatively small number of workers , and requires a lot of governmental judgment calls -- were those Ohio workers laid off because of competition with China , or because technological productivity enhancements made their jobs obsolete , or because their employer mismanaged the business ?
Does it make sense to try to shoehorn a health care credit for unemployed workers into a program that covers only a fraction of Americans , instead of a comprehensive national health care plan that would cover all Americans , and make a real difference in a world of global competition ?
These are questions that policy wonks can get righteously agitated about for weeks on end .
But such policy parsing is not relevant to the political fight now taking place in the Senate -- a struggle that once again demonstrates how utterly tone - deaf the Bush administration is to the concerns of working class Americans in the early 21st century .
Preaching the benefits of free trade without being willing to take care of the " losers " created by trade is n't very bright in an election year when workers are feeling squeezed , and the opposition party controls Congress .
And pretending to support trade adjustment assistance when in actuality you are opposed to meaningful trade adjustment assistance is just shameless .
When the administration says it will veto proposed enhancements to TAA , it 's telling that they do n't suggest amendments that would be acceptable or come up with their own counterproposal - perhaps through a different program - that will provide relief to those displaced by trade .
It seems to me that an administration that truly cared about the working class would be eager to find a way to help those who are hurt from trade , that they would make it a high priority and insist it get done , but there 's little indication - through actual action - that helping workers hurt from trade , or from economic conditions more generally , is a priority ( remember how they insisted that business tax breaks come with an increase in the minimum wage -- no lack of willingness to play hardball for business , why not play as hard on worker 's behalf ? ) .
On a similar note , I think a lot of people are missing the point about John McCain 's lack of knowledge about economics .
The main point is not that he does n't understand it , though that that is certainly a red flag - will he even know who to trust for advice ?
But the fact that , by all indications , he never took the time to try to learn anything about it , that 's what 's troubling .
Anyone who really cared about economic policy and its effect on households would have taken the time to become familiar with the basics .
How will he know how best to help workers if he has no idea about the underlying economics ?
If he asked , there are very prominent economists who would be happy to spend an hour once or twice a week - kind of like a principles course - explaining how the economy operates .
But he never bothered , never took the time , because he apparently does n't care enough to give up the time necessary to actually understand the polices he is voting on .
I would n't mind the ignorance so much if there was any indication at all that he had tried to over come it , any indication he thought it was important enough to learn about , but there is n't .
I think it 's pretty clear that if you care about helping those who are hurt from trade , or care about economic issues more generally , the Republican party is the wrong place to be .

Many people ca n’t just get down to one calendar .
Here are some programs to make using multiple calendars easy .
It 's nearing lunchtime and the few people left on the hard chairs in the clinic waiting room are glancing at the television hanging high on the wall .
In his examination room , Dr Jamal Gwathney has seen a two - month - old baby , a young woman with a heart pacemaker and chemical burns brought in after a fight with the police , and patients with asthma and diabetes .
But in clinics such as this , just across the Anacostia river from the great white dome of the Capitol , many of the ailments have an underlying cause : none of these people have access to adequate medical care .
" Their healthcare sometimes just takes a back seat to putting food on the table and a roof over their heads , " says Dr Gwathney .
" They do n't come in until their health gets to a critical mass - until they have been having chest pain every day for two or three weeks , or until they start throwing up a little blood with that ulcer that they have and it gets them worried . "
On the west side of the dome , in the K Street offices of the doctors profiled in local glossy magazines , medical practices are moving towards concierge - style care : for an annual fee topping $ 1,000 ( £ 500 ) , a trip to the doctor is akin to a visit to the spa , with appointments on demand , and even the most trivial ailments investigated by costly tests .
Between the two extremes is where America 's healthcare system has unravelled .
A patchwork of employer benefits and government assistance for the very poor and elderly has produced distinct differences .
Those with very good jobs and generous benefits packages enjoy extensive , often almost wasteful , health cover .
Meanwhile , tens of millions regularly put their health on hold because they cannot afford basic treatment , prescriptions , or even a visit to the doctor .
" We see a lot of things that could have been treated a lot earlier and even prevented , but they are unable to come in because they do n't have health insurance and they do n't have the funds to pay for it , " says Dr Gwathney .
He has spent three years at this free clinic , run by Unity healthcare in a poor , almost entirely African - American district of Washington .
" You have to have a tough skin , " he says .
The disparities seem to have brought America to a tipping point , and there is growing consensus - among business people , politicians , and economists - that the time has come for a change .
America spends more money on prevention and treatment of disease than ever before , yet it is falling behind on such basic indicators of health as infant mortality and life expectancy .
The US spends about 16 % of GDP on healthcare , a proportion expected to climb to 20 % by 2015 , according to the National Coalition on Health Care .
At present spending levels of $ 1.6 trillion a year , which works out at $ 6,700 per capita , is double what is spent in countries such as France .
And yet that still leaves some 47 million Americans entirely without health coverage , and tens of millions of others under - insured , according to latest census figures .
It also fails to guarantee a better service to those Americans with access to healthcare .
The US ranks last or near the bottom on quality , access , efficiency , equity and healthy lives , according to a report in May 2007 from the Commonwealth Fund , which studies healthcare .
" The US healthcare system is considered a dysfunctional mess , " writes Ezekial Emanuel , chairman of the department of clinical bioethics , in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Amy Robinson has known that all her life .
She was born with a kidney condition that required 25 operations by the time she was eight .
But in some ways the financial consequences have loomed almost as large as the disease .
By the time she was 21 , and her kidneys were failing , she was spending up to $ 1,400 a month on medication as well as the dialysis paid for by the state .
By 23 , she had a kidney transplant .
A year later , despite working two or three jobs to pay off her medical bills , she was forced into bankruptcy by debts of up to $ 10,000 .
Although the cost of the transplant and other medications were supposed to be met by insurance and state assistance , " things slipped through the cracks a lot " .
Now 31 , she works for a teaching union in Topeka , Kansas , and although she has insurance , she still spends up to $ 500 a month - nearly a third of her take - home pay - on medication , lab work , vitamins , and doctors ' visits .
Hers is a common experience of the chronically ill in America , especially over recent years as the common expectation that a good job would automatically include health benefits has been repeatedly betrayed .
Since 2000 , there has been a steady decline in the number of employers who offer health coverage , particularly among small businesses .
Others are scaling back on the range of coverage .
In part that is because providing health coverage has grown too expensive , with the lack of regulatory controls encouraging a steady rise in costs .
The average cost of insurance premiums rose 7.7 % last year , far above the rate of inflation or rise in salaries , says the Kaiser Family Foundation , which studies healthcare .
The rising costs have shifted the burden of cover on to the individual .
In 1996 , about 15.8 % of adults under 65 spent 10 % or more of their disposable income on insurance premiums and other healthcare costs .
By 2003 , it was 19.2 % , says the Commonwealth Fund .
For those at the lower end of the income scale , healthcare is not affordable .
" If you do n't work for an employer who offers insurance your options are very limited unless you are a child or very , very poor , " says Sara Collins , an economist at the Fund .
Healthcare experts say that there is sometimes no rational reason for the rising costs , and that there are huge disparities across the country .
In Miami , for example , it will cost $ 11,352 a year to treat the average pensioner , but just $ 4,273 to treat one in Salem , Oregon , says the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care .
The cost of dying also varies from hospital to hospital , and state to state , the study found .
Americans say they are determined to fix a broken system .
In March more than 30 major corporations from Safeway to Pepsi joined together to lobby for healthcare .
America 's unions have also adopted the cause and all three frontrunners in the Democratic race for the White House have tuned in early .
One Republican contender , Mitt Romney , introduced a system of universal health cover as governor of Massachusetts .
None of the mainstream proposals would move America towards the national healthcare systems of Europe or Canada .
That idea remains taboo .
But there is strong support for building on the existing system to make sure all children have healthcare , and a growing proportion of the working poor .
Under the Massachusetts plan , which became law last year , all residents must buy private health insurance or face a fine .
As well as extending coverage of children and the elderly , Massachusetts required employers to provide health insurance , or join an insurance scheme that would subsidise the cost for staff .
Similar proposals are under consideration in states from Illinois to California .
On the campaign trail , meanwhile , John Edwards , who was the first Democratic contender to unveil his health plan , has proposed subsidising insurance for the middle class , a scheme he would fund by rolling back George Bush 's tax cuts .
His rival , Barack Obama , has proposed a similar fix , while Hillary Clinton has focused on cutting costs via better access to preventive medicine .
But if any of those initiatives are to cure America 's health system , they will have to move quickly to help the likes of Amy Robinson .
After paying for her medicine , she sinks $ 200 further into debt each month .
" Every bit of money I spend is a decision .
Even the McDonald 's coffee I bought this morning .
Every dime , " she says .
" I 'm probably never going to get out of the hole .
Even if the status quo holds with my kidney , all I am looking at is more medical bills . "
Explainer : US and the NHS
Successive health secretaries , grappling with a vast and cumbersome NHS , have looked across the Atlantic for inspiration .
But the most they manage is to cherry - pick an idea here and there .
While they admire the skills and technological advances of the best US hospitals , no politician wants to risk electoral wrath by tampering with the founding principle of Nye Bevan 's NHS - that healthcare provision in the UK should be universal and free at the point of access .
Even in the UK , though , some patients are more equal than others .
Those in deprived areas and members of ethnic minorities are more likely to fall ill and receive poorer healthcare than their more affluent , argumentative compatriots .
But the government recognises this inequality and tries to address it with funding .
However , the US has - with this government 's encouragement - made inroads here .
United Health , a US healthcare provider based in Minneapolis , arrived in the UK in 2004 to develop a scheme which had succeeded in keeping frail and elderly people out of hospital in the US , although an evaluation in November showed it had reduced neither the number of admissions nor deaths .
But arguably these developments in the UK are just adjustments .
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence decides which drugs the NHS can use , leading to patient outcries .
But the government says a state - funded system cannot afford everything .

In a few months from now the trial of The Pirate Bay four will start .
The " Free The Pirate Bay " group on Facebook has proclaimed Friday February 8th to be " wear yellow for sharing day " , so everyone can show their support for the Pirate Bay team , and filesharing in general .
At the moment of writing , over 300 people have confirmed they will join the event .
The “ Free The Pirate Bay ” group , with Peter Sunde ( aka Brokep ) as officer , is hosting the “ wear yellow for sharing ” event that will take place tomorrow .
At this point it is not even clear whether the Pirate Bay has to be freed .
The Pirate Bay case is likely to be delayed until after the summer due to its complexity , according to Anita Thimberg from the Stockholm district court .
“ It can take weeks for the parties to simply go through all the documents included in the summons , ” she told The Local .
Meanwhile , The Pirate Bay team can do with some support , since they are once again fighting their enemies from the anti-piracy lobby in the media .
They even launched a court blog to respond to all kinds of wild accusations , and keep the users of the site informed .
There they write : “ Our enemies in Hollywood know that a court ruling wo n’t stop us .
They know that silly legal threats wo n’t stop up .
We believe they are using this process to spread as much dirt about us as possible .
To make filesharing look dangerous and illegal . ”
The blog post continues : “ Expect the months around the trial (s ) to be dirty !
Expect our enemies to spread some nasty lies about us !
This will not be a battle of right or wrong .
It will be about who wins the debate in the media . ”
To be continued …
Massachusetts is considering taxing them .
Reno is talking about banning them .
Plastic shopping bags are increasingly popular targets of governments looking for ways to help the environment .
" It 's a small , simple , modest act that makes people feel that they 're actually contributing " to reducing litter , waste and dependence on foreign oil , says Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi , sponsor of San Francisco 's ban on petroleum - based plastic bags in big grocery stores .
Since that ban — the USA 's first — took effect in November , he says , there 's been a noticeable decline in plastic - bag litter and " a sea change in the habits of consumers , " many of whom now tote reusable bags .
New York City and California require some retailers to recycle plastic bags .
Industry groups such as the American Chemistry Council prefer that approach .
Plastic bags require at least 40 % less energy to make than paper and produce less than half the greenhouse gases , says ACC 's Sharon Kneiss .
Plastic bags can be recycled into construction materials , decking and more bags , she says .
The group says Americans use about 90 billion plastic bags a year .
Paper bags are easier to recycle , the Sierra Club says , and the equivalent of 11 barrels of oil is saved for every ton of plastic bags reused or recycled .
It recommends reusable bags .
Ireland started taxing plastic bags in 2002 ; within weeks , usage dropped more than 90 % .
China 's ban on free plastic bags takes effect June 1 .
In the USA : • Massachusetts state Sen.
Brian Joyce introduced a bill that would charge consumers 2 cents for every plastic bag , gradually increasing to 15 cents over seven years .
Half the revenue would go to the store to improve consumer awareness and half would go to state recycling programs .
" It 's designed to be a gentle nudge to consumers to change their behavior , " he says .
• Connecticut is considering a bill that would fine retailers up to $ 1,000 if they use non-biodegradable plastic bags beginning in 2010 .
Stan Sorkin , executive director of the Connecticut Food Association , says his group " is really pushing mandatory recycling programs for plastic bags " instead .
• In Reno , city environmental services administrator Jason Geddes is researching options that include a ban and recycling incentives .
" There 's a lot of interest and … community buzz , " he says .
• In Maryland , legislation that would ban plastic bags in all grocery stores might not make it out of committee this session , but its sponsor , Delegate Todd Schuler , says he 'll reintroduce it .
" It 's going to be a long campaign , " he says .
• An energy committee in Valparaiso , Ind. , is considering ways to reduce plastic - bag usage , including the possibility of a small tax .
" Those bags are made from petroleum - based products and they travel a lot of miles to come to us and we use them in abundance , " committee member Ann Kenis says .

Addicts helped by ancient arts Islington Gazette , September 19 , 2007 London , UK -- A PIONEERING scheme to tackle alcoholism and drug addiction in Islington using 1,000 - year - old Buddhist meditation techniques has been hailed as a success .
<< EXPERT : Dr Groves
Dr Paramabandhu Groves , 46 , a consultant psychiatrist in substance misuse for the Camden & Islington Mental Health and Social Care Trust ( CIMHSCT ) , has been treating alcoholics with spiritual " mindfulness meditation " since 2005 .
Although a study into the success rates of the revolutionary new treatment is currently being carried out , Dr Groves says despite an " inevitable " drop - out rate most patients have found it " very helpful " .
He said : " Mindfulness - Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) is about bringing awareness to different parts of your body by meditating and to notice where your mind has gone to and what are the sensations of what 's happening in your body .
" It was originally used in the US to treat relapses in depression , but it occurred to me that it would work in cases of addiction relapse .
I applied and developed it in that way but it 's suitable for any addiction . "
Dr Dominic O'Ryan , a chartered clinical psychologist at CIMHSCT , said : " Mindfulness techniques are based on 1,000 - year - old traditions .
The most recent course was the most successful in terms of how many people attended and how engaged they were .

WASHINGTON  As Congress and the public focus on more than $ 600 billion already approved in supplemental budgets to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and for counterterrorism operations , the Bush administration has with little notice reached a landmark in military spending .
When the Pentagon on Monday unveils its proposed 2009 budget of $ 515.4 billion , annual military spending , when adjusted for inflation , will have reached its highest level since World War II .
That new Defense Department budget proposal , which is to pay for the standard operations of the Pentagon and the military but does not include supplemental spending on the war efforts or on nuclear weapons , is an increase in real terms of about 5 percent over last year .
Since coming to office , the administration has increased baseline military spending by 30 percent over all , a figure sure to be noted in the coming budget battles as the American economy seems headed downward and government social spending is strained , especially by health - care costs .
As you know , I ’m not enthusiastic about a fiscal stimulus plan .
What we need is a stimulus plan that does not increasing the budget deficit or waste taxpayer funds but that does increase the incentive to produce output .
So what would I do ?
Here ’s a new idea .
The IRS knows how much income that each taxpayer reported last year .
So let ’s cut everyone ’s marginal tax rate based on last year ’s income .
In other words , suppose that last year Joe earned $ 66,520 which puts him in a 25 % tax bracket .
Joe ’s tax schedule this year will be exactly the same as last year except for every dollar earned above $ 66,520 the tax rate drops to 15 % .
We do this for all taxpayers so that each taxpayer has their own schedule and for each taxpayer there is a decreasing marginal tax rate .
Note that this plan increases the incentive to work and it does n’t increase the deficit .
In fact , the Tabarrok plan increases tax revenues !
The key is a marginal tax cut with a different margin for every taxpayer based upon last year ’s return .
That ’s the basic idea but there are some obvious modifications that could solve various problems .
For example , the new schedule could be based on an average of say the last three years of income or the average plus some roundup for growth etc .
It ’s also possible to cap the base on which the lower marginal tax rate applies , for example , we could create a lower tax rate on every dollar of income above last year ’s income up to an increase of 20 % .
It is true that a permanent system like this could be ( partially ) gamed but the system can work very well if used occasionally , say for the most serious recessions .
We would also learn a lot by applying this system and looking at the taxpayer response .
In the first part of my testing of VMware Fusion and Innotek Virtualbox I looked at boot time and geekbench scores .
Since Geekbench had issues on VMware ( and I still have n’t got to the bottom of that ) I have moved onto real world tests .
I used the Adobe Photoshop CS3 trial and VLC for the testing .
I ’m fairly certain everyone has heard of Photoshop , and VLC is an open source media player for a wide range of operating systems .
Photoshop tests first , and I ran three tests using three different filters on a common subject .
This was a 5,000 by 5,000 pixel RGB image filled with the first of the available patterns .
The filters and results are shown below .
Platform VMware Virtualbox Macintosh Radial Blur 100 % 31 31 11 * Charcoal filter 1,5,50 8 8 7 * Water Paper filter
15,60,80 13 10 13 *
* – Mac filter used all four cores
* – Mac filter used one core
Some interesting results again .
VMware and Virtualbox are well matched in the first two tests , and Virtual box is a bit faster on the last .
The strange thing here was the results from running the tests using CS3 natively on the Mac .
The first test was way faster than either virtual machine which makes sense as they are using one core and the Radial Blur filter uses all four available cores on the Mac .
The Charcoal filter appears to only use one core so was slightly faster on the Mac .
The Water Paper filter again only uses one core , but VMware matched the Mac and Virtualbox beat both .
I ran the test multiple times to confirm the results and still cannot see how the virtual machine beat the Mac .
Is the Windows version of CS3 faster than the Mac version ?
The only way I can see of getting a genuine comparison will be to install Windows XP natively on the hackintosh and run the tests again .
The VLC test was next , and for this I used VLC ’s conversion abilities to produce a file with Divx3 3072 Kb /s video and MP3 192 Kb /s audio .
The source file was a 1280 ×720 Mpeg4 video of 29 seconds length and 31.2 Mb size .
Here are the results .
Platform VMware Virtualbox Macintosh Convert 1280 ×720 Mpeg4 to 1280 ×720 Divx3 17 16 15 *
* – Mac filter used one core
These were more what I was expecting .
VLC only uses one core of the Mac ’s Core 2 Quad processor so the results are fairly close .
Using either virtualisation package gives performance close to the Mac , so for single tasks they are a good solution for those Windows applications you have to run .
Of course the Mac would perform far better when multiple applications are running , but for that you could use boot camp to run Windows XP natively and benefit from the full four cores available .
So which of these packages would I choose ?
Virtualbox is free so has a big advantage over the commercial VMware .
The downside is that Virtualbox is still beta software , and does n’t support direct file dragging from host to guest OS .
The gap between Beta 2 and Beta 3 on the Mac was eight months , so hopefully the time to the final release wo n’t be as long .
GOP donors funding Nader / Bush supporters give independent 's bid a financial lift

Independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader -- still not on the ballot in a single state -- has received a recent windfall of contributions from deep - pocketed Republicans with a history of big contributions to the party , an analysis of federal records show .
Nearly one in 10 of Nader 's major donors -- those writing checks of $ 1 , 000 or more -- have given in recent months to the Bush - Cheney campaign , the latest documents show .
GOP fund - raisers also have " bundled " contributions -- gathering hefty donations for maximum effect to help Nader , who has criticized the practice in the past .
The donations from wealthy Republicans -- combined with increasingly vocal Democratic charges that they represent a stealth GOP effort to wound Democrat John Kerry -- prompted Nader 's vice presidential running mate , Green Party member Peter Camejo , to suggest the consumer advocate reject the money that does n't come from loyal Nader voters .
" If there has been a wave of these ( donations ) , then that 's something Ralph and I will have to talk about -- and about returning their money , " he said Thursday in an interview with The Chronicle .
" If you oppose the war , if you 're against the Patriot Act , your money is welcome .
" But if your purpose is because you think this is going to have an electoral effect , we do n't want that money .
I take no money from people who disagree with us , " Camejo said .
" We 're not interested in that . "
But Camejo's views differ with Nader 's recent defense of the contributions .
" We have no indication that the Republicans are trying to maneuver support for us , " he said at a recent press conference .
" There are three or four major Republican donors who have contributed to my campaign .
But that 's because I worked with them on a number of issues .
...
It 's all very small , relatively small , contributions .
And we like it that way . "
But the financial records show that $ 23,000 in checks of $ 1,000 or more have come from loyal Republicans .
Among those who have given recently to Nader are Houston businessman Nijad Fares , who donated $ 200,000 to President Bush 's 2000 inaugural committee ; Richard J. Egan , the former ambassador to Ireland , and his wife , Pamela , who have raised more than $ 300,000 for Bush ; Michigan developer Ghassan Saab , who has given $ 30,000 to the RNC since 2001 ; and frozen food magnate Jeno Paulucci , and his wife , Lois , who have donated $ 150 , 000 to GOP causes since 2000 alone .
All have donated the maximum $ 2,000 to Nader 's campaign since April , records show .
Asked about the money from GOP backers , Nader campaign spokesman Kevin Zeese countered that many of Kerry 's donors also had given to Republicans , including Bush in the past .
" ( Kerry ) should renounce those donations and give them all back , " he said .
Pressed if Nader would do the same , Zeese said that would n't even be discussed " until ( the parties ) start to change the rules . "
With just under four months left to the election , Nader has yet to qualify for a single state ballot .
A statewide poll by the Survey and Policy Research Institute at San Jose State University released Wednesday indicates that if Nader qualifies as a presidential candidate on the California ballot , the former consumer advocate would steal support from the Democratic ticket almost exclusively .
" He would drain about 4 percent of Kerry 's support , almost all of it from Democrats , while having a negligible impact on Bush 's vote or his support among Republicans , " according to Institute director Phil Trounstine .
Democrats are worried about Nader 's influence because they believe as a Green Party candidate in 2000 , he pulled votes that would have gone to Democratic Vice President Al Gore in key states , thus helping Bush win the election .
Chris Lehane , a Democratic strategist who was a spokesman for Gore 's 2000 presidential campaign , said the check - writing was not " a merely serendipitous confluence of events , " adding that " folks supporting Bush because they want fewer environmental protections and less corporate regulations do n't have a lot in common with the Ralph Nader agenda .
The only thing they have in common with Nader is they want to take votes from Kerry . "
But Christine Iverson , spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee , calls such charges ridiculous , adding : " It 's unfortunate that Democrats seem determined to disenfranchise voters who want an opportunity to cast votes for Ralph Nader . "
Still , other Republicans acknowledge that many in the party have mentioned that a donation to Nader may boost Bush , particularly in states where the vote is expected to be close .
" Republicans have no problem with it , if the goal is to keep President Bush in office , " said Hoover Institution research fellow Bill Whalen , a veteran GOP strategist .
" It 's not pretty .
But putting a guy ( in the White House ) you do n't like is not pretty either . "
Whalen said the Republican National Committee or the Bush - Cheney campaign can't technically condone such donations , but " you absolutely want your activists to get out there and help Ralph run " because of the effects he had on the 2000 election .
" Do the math , " Whalen said .
Nader , who has decried the influence of corporations in the political arena , also has received more than $ 20,000 in " bundled " contributions since March from GOP fund - raisers , according to the Federal Elections Commission documents that tally donations through May 31 .
Bundling is the practice of gathering contributions together for maximum influence .
Records show Nader raised just more than $ 1 million for his presidential effort through May 31 .
Most of the money came from small , individual donors .
But Zeese said the Republican donors were " people whom Ralph knows from previous work . "
He downplayed the bundled donations , such as $ 18,850 in checks collected and submitted to Nader in May by Peter Tanous , president of Washington D.C. - based Lynx Investment Advisories .
" That was a house party , " Zeese said of the donations collected by Tanous .
Tanous , who also made a personal $ 2,000 donation to Nader in May , was traveling and unavailable for comment Thursday , but his wife , Ann , said that her husband raised money for Nader because " he 's a good friend . "
" My husband 's a die - hard Republican who 's supporting ( Nader ) so that there are other voices , other than the ones we 're hearing in this election , " particularly on issues that include Middle East politics , she said .
She declined to say whether her husband , who also donated $ 4,000 to the Republican National Committee and $ 2,000 to the Bush - Cheney campaign this year , would vote for Nader .
Tanous , records show , has also donated in the past to some Democrats , including $ 500 last year to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco .
Whalen says that Nader is playing games when he suggests that his donors are merely acting in friendship and that his message will resonate with GOP faithful .
" What 's at the heart and soul of the Nader campaign ?
That corporations are evil and that we need to get out of Iraq , " Whalen said .
Nader 's Republican supporters
$ 275,249
Total contributions of $ 1,000 or more to Nader as of May 31
$ 23,000
Contributions from those who have also given to Republican causes , including the Bush - Cheney re-election campaign .
Among Ralph Nader 's top Republican donors :
-- Billionaire corporate executive John Egan of Massachusetts , who has raised at least $ 200,000 for the president 's re-election campaign , donated $ 2,000 to Nader .
-- Nijad Fares , a Houston businessman , who donated $ 200,000 to the Bush inaugural committee and who donated $ 2,000 each to the Nader effort and the Bush campaign this year .
-- David Reed , president of Washington - based Foundation Petroleum Inc. , who donated $ 1,000 to Nader and $ 2,000 to the Bush - Cheney campaign .
-- Jack and Laura Dangermond , both executives in Redlands - based Environmental SystemsResearch Institute , who each donated $ 2,000 to Nader 's campaign and the Bush - Cheneycampaign and $ 25,000 to the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee .

Finding The Best 8 - Bit Nintendo Art From Japan
Japan always gets the best videogame artwork .
I ’m not bitter , but it definitely makes decorating a grown - up - friendly game room more challenging .
Since we ca n’t just wander into your average gaming shop and expect to find a wide array of frame - worthy artwork , we have to be a bit more creative in finding suitable pieces .
This time around , I just happened to be browsing around some Nintendo - themed photos on Flickr and found a collection of framed Famicom Disk System posters belonging to djdac .
Considering how pathetic most of the NES - era art is here in the US , I was amazed by how much some of them reminded me of epic posters you might see in a movie theatre .
It turns out that these posters were distributed in Japan either at game stores and on the streets for advertisements or folded up and included with the actual Famicom Disk System games .
They measure up to about 11.75 x 8.5 cm , so they are n’t very large , but when matted and framed , they can be a great addition to your wall .
Even though there are some good Nintendo Power posters out there , these Famicom posters ( sometimes referred to as handbills ) typically have a more artistic look to them in addition to the Japanese charm that intrigues us foreigners .
I did an eBay search for “ Famicom poster ” and found a handful of other excellent examples that I did n’t see on Flickr .
The Metroid poster is my personal favorite ( especially when compared to an American alternative ) due to the finely detailed drawing , beautiful color work , and the creative use of animation frames accenting the background .
You can see the rest of my favorites below including the epic , old - school Link saving Zelda and the geeky Japanese kid pwning a terrified adult at Tetris .
If the original prints are too pricey or hard - to - find for you , you can pick up a few reproductions for a low price from “ i heart yuna ” on the FamicomWorld forums .
From the 8.15 ″ x 11.6 ″ dimensions he mentions , it sounds like he enlarged them , so these may actually be a better solution for hanging in a game room .
If you know of any other sources for these posters , let me know in comments section below .
「 Java BlockingQueueで遊ぶ：パイプラインごっこ」でパイプラインの話をしたので、本来の、つまりUnixのパイプやリダイレクトを少し調べてみました。
たまに話題となる some - command > file 2>&1 と some - command 2>&1 > file の挙動の違いについて、 「 シェルは コマンドライン リダイレクトの指定を右から左に解釈実行する」なんて説明が見つかりました。んなバカな！
パージングは左から右にするものですよ。パーズツリーを逆順にたどることはできるけど、そんなことする必然性はなんにもないよ。
次の記事を読むと、 「右から左」なんて事情じゃないことが分かるでしょう。
さてここでは、複雑なリダイレクト処理も完全に理解できる処方箋を示しましょう。例えば、次のコマンドラインが何をするか分かるようになるってことです :-)
some - command 3>&1 >/dev/null 2>&3 3>&- | less
シェルが行っている内部処理を知ればいいのですが、ここでは別のアプローチを取ります*1。
内容：
コマンド実行を記述するミニ言語 パイプラインのなかのコマンド実行単位 リダイレクトは代入文 複雑な例もスッキリわかる
●コマンド実行を記述するミニ言語
パイプ記号 「 | 」や逐次実行の記号 「 ;」を含んだ長いコマンドラインも、１つのコマンドとその引数、それとリダイレクト指定からなる“成分”に分解できます。こういった成分をなんと呼ぶか僕は知らないので、仮に「コマンド実行単位」とでも呼びましょう*2。
例えば、 grep ^a < infile > outfile は全 体
で1つのコマンド実行単位です。これを次のように書いてみましょう。
# デフォルトの初期化
in fd0 = in ( / dev/tty )
out fd1 = out ( / dev/tty )
out fd2 = out ( / dev/tty ) # リダイレクト指 定
fd0 = in ( infile ) # < infile に対応
fd1 = out ( outfile ) # > outfile に対応 grep ^a
なんじゃこりゃ？ たった今、僕が考えたエエカゲンな記法です。この記法を使ってリダイレクトの秘密をあばこう、という魂胆です。
fdはファイルディスクリプタのつもりで、fd0は「0番のファイルディスクリプタ」のことです。詳細はともかく、次のことは知っておいてください。
0番のファイルディスクリプタは標準入力 1番のファイルディスクリプタは標準出力 2番のファイルディスクリプタは標準エラー出力
他に、fd3からfd9まで使えます（シェルの実装によりますけど）。
in fd0 は、
「0番のファイルディスクリプタfd0を入力用に使う」という宣言です。 in (/dev/tty )
は、ファイル/dev/ttyを入力用に開いたモノを示します。そしてイコールは普通の代入演算子です。 out fd1 = out ( / dev/tty ) なら、 「 出力用に開いたファイル/dev/ttyを、1番のファイルディスクリプタ（出力用）fd1に割り当てる」と読めます。/dev/ttyは特殊なファイルで、in(/dev/tty)はキーボードからの入力、out(/dev/tty)は画面への出力を意味します。Windowsなら、/dev/ttyの代わりにconという名前を使います。
リダイレクト指定がなければ、デフォルトの初期化がそのまま使われます。今回の例では、
< infile > outfile に対応する代入文によりデフォルトの初期化が上書き（変更）されています。 grep ^a が実行されるときには、fd0 がin( infile）に、fd1がout( outfile )に設定されています（fd2はそのまま）。実際のシェルは、無駄な初期化はしないと思いますが、デフォルトを書いておいたほうが分かりやすいかと。
このよう な “ 代入文 ” を並べてファイルディスクリプタ達を設定してから、最後の行に実行するコマンドと引数を書きます -- これが、コマンド実行を記述するミニ言語の構文です。
●パイプラインのなかのコマンド実行単位
次に、 cat infile | grep ^a | less を考えてみましょう。このパイプラインのなかにある grep ^a はコマンド実行単位ですが、次のように記述されます 。
in fd0 = in ( l - pipe )
out fd1 = out ( r - pipe )
out fd2 = out ( / dev/tty ) grep ^a
ここで、l -pipe、r-pipeはファイル名ではなくて、コマンドの左側（left）のパイプと右側（right）のパイプを意味するとします。 grep ^a だけ見ていてもファイルディスクリプタの状況は分かりませんが、パイプラインのなかにいるという状況を含めて記述しています。
同じパイプライン内のlessの実行は次のようですね。
in fd0 = in ( l - pipe )
out fd1 = out ( / dev/tty )
out fd2 = out ( / dev/tty ) less
grepのr-pipeとlessのl-pipeは同じパイプをさしているので、データがgrepからlessへと流れます。
●リダイレクトは代入文
前節の例ではリダイレクトが出てこなかったのですが、今度は cat infile | grep [ 2 >&1 | less を考えましょう。 grep [ はエラーで grep : Invalid regular expression というエラーメッセージが標準エラー出力、つまりfd2に出力されます。
コマンド実行単位 grep [ 2>&1 は、次のように記述できます。
# デフォルトの初期化
in fd0 = in ( l - pipe )
out fd1 = out ( r - pipe )
out fd2 = out ( / dev/tty ) # リダイレクト指 定
fd2 = fd1 grep [
リダイレクト指定 2>&1 は、 fd2 = fd1 という代入文と解釈されます。fd1の値はout(r-pipe)だったので、代入文によりfd2の値もout(r-pipe)となります。その結果、grepによるfd2への書き込み（エラーメッセージ）はパイプに送り込まれ、結果的にlessに流れます。
なお、このパイプラインを実行しても、受け手がlessだと分かりにくいので、 cat infile | grep [ 2 >&1 | cat > outfile として、ファイルoutfileの中身を見るといいかもしれません。
●複雑な例もスッキリわかる
番号 > file は、fd 番号 = out ( file )
> file は、fd = out ( file ) 番号1>&番号 2 は、fd番号1 = fd番号2
という翻訳規則に基づいて、冒頭に挙げた2つのコマンドライン some - command > file 2>&1 と some - command 2>&1 > file を分析してみましょう 。
some - command > file 2>&1 は、
# デフォルトの初期化
in fd0 = in ( / dev/tty )
out fd1 = out ( / dev/tty )
out fd2 = out ( / dev/tty ) # リダイレクト指 定
fd1 = out ( file )
fd2 = fd1 some - command
リダイレクト指定 > file 2>&1 は、左から右に解釈されます。 > file は 1 > file の略記で、 fd1 = out ( file ) と翻訳されます。デフォルトの初期化が上書きされて、fd1の値はout( file)となります。その後で、 fd2 = fd1 が実行されるので、fd2の値もout(file)になります。その結果として、fd1の出力もfd2の出力も同じファイルに入ります。
一方、 some - command 2>&1 > file は、
# デフォルトの初期化
in fd0 = in ( / dev/tty )
out fd1 = out ( / dev/tty )
out fd2 = out ( / dev/tty ) # リダイレクト指 定
fd2 = fd1
fd1 = out ( file ) some - command
fd2 = fd1
fd1 = out ( file )
some - command > file
が先に実行されるので、fd2の値はfd1と同じout(/dev/tty)となりますが、これは結局、何もしないのと一緒ですね。その後のでfd1の値は変更されます。これは、と何も変わりません。
むずかしそうな例をやってみましょう。 some - command 3>&1 >/dev/null 2>&3 3>&- | less の最初の実行単位の場合は 、
# デフォルトの初期化
in fd0 = in ( / dev/tty )
out fd1 = out ( r - pipe )
out fd2 = out ( / dev/tty ) # リダイレクト指 定
fd3 = fd1
fd1 = out ( / dev/null )
fd2 = fd3
fd3 = none some - command
n>&-
ここで、none は 「 何も表さない値 」 で、noneがファイル ディスクリプタ に代入されると、そのファイル ディスクリプタ は閉じられ使えなくなります。一時的に使ったファイル ディスクリプタ の後始末にnoneを使います（後始末しなくても、たいてい大丈夫ですが）。 コマンドライン 構文では、番号nに対してとしてファイル ディスクリプタ nを閉じます 。
さて、代入文を追いかけると、
fd3 = fd1 # fd1 の 値をfd3 に保存 fd3 = out ( r - pipe )
fd1 = out ( / dev/null ) # fd1の値をout(/dev/null ) で上書 き
fd2 = fd3 # fd2 の値はfd3 の値であるout ( r- pipe ) となる
fd3 = none # fd3 を後始末 # fd1 is out ( / dev/null )
# fd2 is out ( r - pipe )
# fd3 is none
よって、some - commandの標準出力（fd1）は/dev/nullに捨てられ、標準エラー出力（fd2）がパイプに送り込まれます。パイプの先にlessがいるので、some-commandのエラーメッセージだけをlessで閲覧できるわけです。

Obama Lawyer : Pro-Clinton Group Violating Law A spokesman for the 527 blasted the attack on the group as ' legal bullying .'
Feb. 21 , 2008  -- Sen. Barack Obama 's lawyer argued today that American Leadership Project , a 527 group producing pro-Clinton issue ads , is breaking the law and warned that those involved with the group could face criminal as well as civil liability .
The group 's ads are set to launch by Monday in Ohio and Texas , two states whose primaries on March 4 could determine the fate of Sen.
Hillary Clinton 's candidacy .
" This is not a case where there 's shades of gray .
This is not a case where there is room for argument .
This is not a case where they will be spared by some version of Philadelphia lawyering , " Obama lawyer Bob Bauer said during a conference call with reporters .
" This is absolutely a cold , calculated move to violate the law to the benefit of the candidate and to assume that any penalty will be so deferred into the future that the immediate benefits can be taken now without consequence . "
" The calculation on their part is that the penalties will be bearable for them , " he added .
" But I think in the end , the penalties will be unbearable for them .
This is going to wind up being a very , very miserable experience for the people involved .
Maybe , in some cases , life changing . "
Bauer argued that A.L.P.'s activity is " so brazen " that it raises " very serious questions about knowing and willful misconduct . "
" It was established only now , has no prior operating history , and press accounts make it very clear that it responded to the financial difficulties announced by the Clinton campaign to provide resources the Clinton campaign could not provide for itself on the air in two primary election states , " Bauer said .
" The advertisement makes a very clear reference to Clinton 's opposition candidate , but even more explicitly airs material that is meant to be highly supportive of Sen. Clinton . "
You can preview the group 's Ohio ad HERE .
" At the end of the day , there will be a reckoning here , " he added , " and I think it will be rough on the officers .
It 's going to be rough on the employees .
It is going to be rough on the donors .
But I think there certainly is going to be a reckoning here . "
You can read more about the group from ABC's Jake Tapper HERE .
The blistering attack from Obama 's lawyer followed an email to Obama supporters from campaign manager David Plouffe , attempting to use the creation of the group to pad the Democratic frontrunner 's fundraising lead .
An ALP spokesman defended the legality of his group and charged that Bauer was engaged in " legal bullying . "
" There is n't anything in what we 've been doing that would warrant this type of quelling of free speech with the type of unsupported legal bullying we heard today , " ALP spokesman Roger Salazar said .
" The bottom line for us is that we 've put together this committee in a way that complies with all of the rules and regulations that have been set forward , " he said .
" We are not going to be airing any advertisements that contain express advocacy on behalf of a federal candidate .
These are issue ads that focus on issues that are important to the middle class . "
While 527 groups are allowed to receive unregulated sums of money because they are not supposed to engage in express advocacy , Salazar noted that 527s like his group are still subject to certain reporting requirements .
" Every time we spend $ 10,000 or more on electioneering we have to within 24 hours list all of our donors with the Federal Election Commission , accessible on the FEC 's website , " Salazar said .
In addition to charging that ALP was breaking the law , Bauer said that the Obama campaign will " wait to see if Clinton will take steps to shut it down . "
The Clinton campaign , which has not issued a letter calling on the group to halt its activities , responded to Bauer 's challenge by saying that it has no connection to ALP .
It also charged that Obama benefited from outside group spending in California .
" Talk about chutzpah , " Clinton spokesman Phil Singer said .
" I do n't recall the Obama campaign 's expressions of outrage when the VoteHope 527 was set up to help their efforts in California and elsewhere . "
" Mr. Bauer is well aware that we have no connection to this group , " he added .
The Obama campaign responded to the Clinton camp 's VoteHope criticism by providing a copy of a Dec. 28 , 2007 , letter in which Bauer called on the pro-Obama VoteHope 527 group to disband immediately .
" If Hillary Clinton said , ' stop , ' and made clear that it was her wish , it might not work , " Bauer told ABC News in a short interview following his conference call with reporters .
" But there is no reason not to try .
By saying nothing , the Hillary Clinton campaign is sending a very clear signal to this group that she has no objection to them continuing . "
ABC News ' Talal Al - Khatib contributed to this report .
It 's breakfast time in Orlando and thousands of people are clambering aboard tour buses all over the city ready for fun in the Florida sunshine .
One group , however , wo n't be following the others to Disney World or the area 's many other theme park attractions .
They 'll be taking a shopping trip in the company of estate agents and mortgage brokers , hoping to find a bargain among a selection of repossessed and run-down homes .
The growing popularity of the six - hour " foreclosure express " tour is one symptom of the worst housing crisis to afflict the Sunshine State in recent years , a slump set off by the sub - prime mortgage crisis that has sent repossessions soaring and prices into freefall .
The bus follows a pre-determined route through residential neighbourhoods and stops at up to a dozen empty houses already repossessed by lenders .
The passengers disembark and size up the premises as they decide whether to offer an asking price often already below the open - market value .
Tickets cost $ 45 ( £ 22.50 ) , or $ 65 a couple , including breakfast and lunch at a fast - food restaurant , and demand is so high that another tour is planned for the middle of April .
" It pulls everyone together , " said Orlando real estate agent Janice Ziesig , who organised the first tour for 24 would - be buyers last month after adapting a similar concept she saw in California two years ago .
" It 's really a rolling classroom with realtors , a lawyer , a property appraiser and a mortgage broker aboard with the buyers and investors .
People can get a good idea of what 's available . "
In many parts of southern and central Florida , especially Orlando and Kissimmee , where most of the state 's half - million Britons with second homes or rental or retirement properties are based , there is plenty available .
Recent figures from realtytrac.com showed 279,325 homes have been repossessed in Florida since January last year , making it second to California , where there were 481,392 foreclosures , among the worst - affected states .
The news for those wanting to sell their homes , particularly in Florida 's larger metropolitan areas , is almost as bleak .
February sales of existing homes were down 25 % on a year ago , at only 8,310 statewide , according to the Florida Association of Realtors .
Three - bedroom houses in Kissimmee that sold for $ 240,000 a year ago can now be snapped up for $ 198,000 , a 17.5 % decrease .
And prices in Miami , which were rising by more than 20 % annually as recently as 2005 , showed a 19.3 % decline from a year ago , the biggest drop in the US alongside Las Vegas , according to the Standard & Poor 's / Case - Shiller home price index .
Miami advice
" When the pendulum swings so far to the right , it has to swing that much more to the left to even things out again , " said Kimberly Kirschner , chair of the Realtor Association of Greater Miami and the Beaches .
" Prices went much higher than they were expected to , and even though the drop is significant they 're getting back close to normal . "
Even so , she says , houses that would normally take six months to sell can remain on the market for up to a year and a half .
Other industry experts blame greedy developers for fuelling the slump .
Giant tower blocks of waterfront apartments sprang up everywhere , some dwarfing the classic lower - rise buildings of Miami Beach 's picturesque Art Deco area , and many were left unsold or half - built when the collapse came .
" The builders just jumped right in when the condos were in demand and selling fast , " said Martha Bullman , chief executive of the Realtor Association of Miami - Dade County .
" But it takes a lot of time to build condominiums .
By the time they got them finished , the boom was over .
There were hundreds and hundreds of gorgeous apartments in spectacular buildings but the buyers did n't come . "
Florida keys
Now , to make their properties stand out among the glut in a stagnant market , developers are slashing prices and offering unprecedented incentives .
" They 're throwing in big - screen TVs , country club fees , whatever they can do to get a deal done , " said Bob Hudgens , treasurer of the Florida Association of Realtors .
" What we are seeing is sellers being realistic after the speculation that fuelled the incredible appreciations in 2004 and 2005 .
Back then people were n't in the market for the long term - it was get in , get out and make a quick buck . "
Kirschner agrees that parts of the Miami housing market are already on the road to recovery , aided by overseas buyers taking advantage of the weak US dollar .
" Miami is a mega - market , " she said .
" We have tourism , beautiful beaches , sunshine , clean air and water , great healthcare , good universities and a lot of other things that feed our market .
Add to that the number of baby - boomers entering retirement and it's sure to rise . "
Britons who purchased Florida property at the peak of the market should not panic .
" Most people bought as a mid- to - long - term investment , to live in a property , have it as a second home or as a retirement fund , " said Lee Weaver , director of the British Homes Group in Kissimmee .
" Unless they really have to sell , the advice is 100 % to sit tight . "
Weaver , who has 14 years ' experience selling properties to Britons , says he has seen similar boom - to - bust cycles but that the underlying trend has always been upwards .
" A house bought for say $ 169,000 between 2000 and mid-2004 , which might have peaked at $ 307,000 two years ago , would still be worth about $ 240,000 now .
Property here is still a sound investment . "
Home pages
The housing squeeze has led to a growth industry in foreclosure websites , which collate details of repossessed homes from mortgage lenders .
Among the most popular are realtytrac.com , which charge an average of $ 10 a week ( £ 5 ) for unlimited searches of a nationwide database and a regular email .
Critics point out the information can be obtained free and that many of the best deals have been cherry - picked by those in the know .
Other websites have been promising they can save homes threatened by repossession .
Bill McCollum , the Florida attorney general , filed a lawsuit this week against three companies accused of deceiving homeowners into signing over their properties .

These are lectures on some fundamental mathematics underlying many approaches and algorithms in machine learning .
They are not about particular learning algorithms ; they are about the basic concepts and tools upon which such algorithms are built .
Often students feel intimidated by such material : there is a vast amount of " classical mathematics " , and it can be hard to find the wood for the trees .
The main topics of these lectures are Lagrange multipliers , functional analysis , some notes on matrix analysis , and convex optimization .
I 've concentrated on things that are often not dwelt on in typical CS coursework .
Lots of examples are given ; if it 's green , it 's a puzzle for the student to think about .
These lectures are far from complete : perhaps the most significant omissions are probability theory , statistics for learning , information theory , and graph theory .
I hope eventually to turn all this into a series of short tutorials .

Bayesian Learning
Video Lectures ( by Zoubin Ghahramani from University College London )
Description of video course :
Bayes Rule provides a simple and powerful framework for machine learning .
This tutorial will be organised as follows :
1. Lecturer will give motivation for the Bayesian framework from the point of view of rational coherent inference , and highlight the important role of the marginal likelihood in Bayesian Occam 's Razor .
2 . He will discuss the question of how one should choose a sensible prior .
When Bayesian methods fail it is often because no thought has gone into choosing a reasonable prior .
3. Bayesian inference usually involves solving high dimensional integrals and sums .
He will give an overview of numerical approximation techniques ( e.g. Laplace , BIC , variational bounds , MCMC , EP ... ) .
4. Mr. Ghahramani will talk about more recent work in non-parametric Bayesian inference such as Gaussian processes ( i.e. Bayesian kernel " machines " ) , Dirichlet process mixtures , etc .
Learning on Structured Data
Video Lectures ( by Yasemin Altun from TTI )
Lectures description :
Discriminative learning framework is one of the very successful fields of machine learning .
The methods of this paradigm , such as Boosting , and Support Vector Machines have significantly advanced the state - of - the - art for classification by improving the accuracy and by increasing the applicability of machine learning methods .
One of the key benefits of these methods is their ability to learn efficiently in high dimensional feature spaces , either by the use of implicit data representations via kernels or by explicit feature induction .
However , traditionally these methods do not exploit dependencies between class labels where more than one label is predicted .
Many real - world classification problems involve sequential , temporal or structural dependencies between multiple labels .
We will investigate recent research on generalizing discriminative methods to learning in structured domains .
These techniques combine the efficiency of dynamic programming methods with the advantages of the state - of - the - art learning methods .

Information Geometry
Video Lectures ( by Sanjoy Dasgupta from University of California )
Description :
This tutorial will focus on entropy , exponential families , and information projection .
We 'll start by seeing the sense in which entropy is the only reasonable definition of randomness .
We will then use entropy to motivate exponential families of distributions — which include the ubiquitous Gaussian , Poisson , and Binomial distributions , but also very general graphical models .
The task of fitting such a distribution to data is a convex optimization problem with a geometric interpretation as an " information projection " : the projection of a prior distribution onto a linear subspace ( defined by the data ) so as to minimize a particular information - theoretic distance measure .
This projection operation , which is more familiar in other guises , is a core optimization task in machine learning and statistics .
We 'll study the geometry of this problem and discuss two popular iterative algorithms for it .
Tutorial on Machine Learning Reductions
Video Lectures ( by John Langford from Yahoo Research )
Tutorial description :
There are several different classification problems commonly encountered in real world applications such as ' importance weighted classification ' , ' cost sensitive classification ' , ' reinforcement learning ' , ' regression ' and others .
Many of these problems can be related to each other by simple machines ( reductions ) that transform problems of one type into problems of another type .
Finding a reduction from your problem to a more common problem allows the reuse of simple learning algorithms to solve relatively complex problems .
It also induces an organization on learning problems — problems that can be easily reduced to each other are ' nearby ' and problems which can not be so reduced are not close .
Online Learning and Game Theory
Video Lectures ( by Adam Kalai from Toyota Technological Institute )
Description :
We consider online learning and its relationship to game theory .
In an online decision - making problem , as in Singer 's lecture , one typically makes a sequence of decisions and receives feedback immediately after making each decision .
As far back as the 1950's , game theorists gave algorithms for these problems with strong regret guarantees .
Without making statistical assumptions , these algorithms were guaranteed to perform nearly as well as the best single decision , where the best is chosen with the benefit of hindsight .
We discuss applications of these algorithms to complex learning problems where one receives very little feedback .
Examples include online routing , online portfolio selection , online advertizing , and online data structures .
We also discuss applications to learning Nash equilibria in zero-sum games and learning correlated equilibria in general two - player games .
On the Borders of Statistics and Computer Science
Video Lectures ( by Peter Bickel from Berkley University )
Description :
Machine learning in computer science and prediction and classification in statistics are essentially equivalent fields .
I will try to illustrate the relation between theory and practice in this huge area by a few examples and results .
In particular I will try to address an apparent puzzle : Worst case analyses , using empirical process theory , seem to suggest that even for moderate data dimension and reasonable sample sizes good prediction ( supervised learning ) should be very difficult .
On the other hand , practice seems to indicate that even when the number of dimensions is very much higher than the number of observations , we can often do very well .
We also discuss a new method of dimension estimation and some features of cross validation .
Decision Maps
Video Lecture ( by Nadler Boaz from Toyota Technological Institute )
Measures of Statistical Dependence
Video Lectures ( by Arthur Gretton from Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics )
Description :
A number of important problems in signal processing depend on measures of statistical dependence .
For instance , this dependence is minimised in the context of instantaneous ICA , in which linearly mixed signals are separated using their ( assumed ) pairwise independence from each other .
A number of methods have been proposed to measure this dependence , however they generally assume a particular parametric model for the densities generating the observations .
Recent work suggests that kernel methods may be used to find estimates that adapt according to the signals they compare .
These methods are currently being refined , both to yeild greater accuracy , and to permit the use of the signal properties over time in improving signal separability .
In addition , these methods can be applied in cases where the statistical dependence between observations must be maximised , which is true for certain classes of clustering algorithms .
Anti-Learning
Video Lectures ( by Adam Kowalczyk from National ICT )
Description :
The Biological domain poses new challenges for statistical learning .
In the talk we shall analyze and theoretically explain some counter - intuitive experimental and theoretical findings that systematic reversal of classifier decisions can occur when switching from training to independent test data ( the phenomenon of anti-learning ) .
We demonstrate this on both natural and synthetic data and show that it is distinct from overfitting .
The natural datasets discussed will include : prediction of response to chemo - radio - therapy for esophageal cancer from gene expression ( measured by cDNA - microarrays ) ; prediction of genes affecting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway in yeast .
The main synthetic classification problem will be the approximation of samples drawn from high dimensional distributions , for which a theoretical explanation will be outlined .
Brain Computer Interfaces
Video Lectures ( by Klaus - Robert Müller from Fraunhofer FIRST )
Description :
Brain Computer Interfacing ( BCI ) aims at making use of brain signals for e.g. the control of objects , spelling , gaming and so on .
This tutorial will first provide a brief overview of the current BCI research activities and provide details in recent developments on both invasive and non-invasive BCI systems .
In a second part -- taking a physiologist point of view -- the necessary neurological / neurophysical background is provided and medical applications are discussed .
The third part -- now from a machine learning and signal processing perspective -- shows the wealth , the complexity and the difficulties of the data available , a truely enormous challenge .
In real - time a multi-variate very noise contaminated data stream is to be processed and classified .
Main emphasis of this part of the tutorial is placed on feature extraction / selection and preprocessing which includes among other techniques CSP and also ICA methods .
Finally , I report in more detail about the Berlin Brain Computer ( BBCI ) Interface that is based on EEG signals and take the audience all the way from the measured signal , the preprocessing and filtering , the classification to the respective application .
BCI communication is discussed in a clincial setting and for gaming .

I found some great Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) video lecture courses recently and I will share them with you this month .
Here are lectures from Machine Learning Summer School 2003 , 2005 and 2006 .
Machine Learning is a foundational discipline of the Information Sciences .
It combines deep theory from areas as diverse as Statistics , Mathematics , Engineering , and Information Technology with many practical and relevant real life applications .

Tara " Miss Rogue " Hunt , Alex Barnett and Ben Barren have been hacking Memeorandum - trying to get a post to appear on the front page of the automated news site by gaming the system .
And it appears to have worked .
Alex even created a screencast showing exactly how they did it ( very easily , it seems ) .
The serious point here is that once someone figures out how an algorithm works , they will use that knowledge to their own advantage - if Memeorandum ever goes mainstream , it will be targeted by spammers and lose much of its usefulness to the community .
Google 's Pagerank algorithm has suffered the same fate : the abundance of spam links has undermined the usefulness of the service , resulting in a constant and unending battle between Google and the spammers .
In my post Humans vs Algorithms , I suggested that we need to put human minds in the loop if we are to keep the spam out of search engines and news sites .
Time to quote myself :
As you may already know , my feeling is that humans are generally better at editing than algorithms , but by the same token you could say that the main algorithms in use today ( Google PageRank , Memeorandum , Google News ) are largely based on human decisions , where a link generally counts as a vote .
At the other end of the spectrum , you have sites like Digg and Reddit , which are entirely edited by humans in a distributed way .
But I ’m not sure if it ’s really a case of humans versus algorithms : I think the future could lie with services like Wink , where Google ’s search results are rated , tagged and built upon by human minds .
In this way , humans could make up for the obvious failings of algorithms - namely the scourge of spam and splogs .
This recent success in " hacking Memeorandum " confirms to me that we need some kind of human intervention in these systems .
The answer may indeed lie with human annotation ala Wink.com , or it may be the case that entirely human systems ( Digg , Reddit ) are less prone to attack .
Perhaps Google could send off its search results to be rated by the human minds at Amazon 's Mechanical Turk .
Either way , I do n't believe that algorithms can survive in their current form .
Human judgement is n't infallible , but it 's the best thing we 've got .
[ More Memeorandum hacking at Hellonline and supr.c.ilio.us ]
Update : Okay , looks like I wo n't have time to follow this up today , but I 've clarified some points in the comments .
I think the key thing to say here is that I 'm not criticizing Memeorandum , but simply pointing out that humans can often step in to fix the problems we experience with algorithms .
And I do n't think I should have quoted that original post - that makes this look like a debate between human and algorithms , which is n't really the case .
