That Sheldon , so funny with his science -y jibber jabber and social awkwardness .
Except in this clip , since you do n't know when to chuckle because there is n't a laugh track .
You can compare the clip to the laugh tracked version ( after the jump ) and appreciate just what having every joke punctuated with laughter does for a comedy show * AHHAHAHAHAHAHA !* but not a blog .
Hit the jump for the laughier version .

What -- wrong time ?
The North American anime distributor Viz Media has confirmed with ANN that it will be streaming the Cross Game baseball anime on its VizAnime.com website later this month .
Viz had revealed its plans via an ad at the bottom of the Shojo Beat email newsletter that announced the streams of another anime , Vampire Knight , on Friday .
Viz will announce more details about the streaming of Cross Game later this week .
Viz had already confirmed in March that it will release Mitsuru Adachi 's original Cross Game manga starting this October .
Director Osamu Sekita and the Synergy SP anime studio adapted the story into 50 episodes that aired in Japan from April of 2009 to March of 2010 .
( The manga itself ended in February . )
The story revolves around Koh Kitamura , a grade - school boy whose family runs the Kitamura Sports store .
He gets to know the four daughters of the family who runs the nearby Tsukishima Batting Center , thanks to the store 's business and his own batting practice at the center .
Aside from playful bantering between Koh and the Tsukishima daughters , all is peaceful in their lives until a tragedy strikes their world .
Four years later , Koh continues his baseball training , despite not playing a single game since the tragedy .
The manga follows
Koh 's gradual full return to the sport he loves , and his coming - of - age surrounded by the Tsukishima daughters and others .
Adachi is best known for his sports manga , particular his baseball titles Touch and H2 .
Like Cross Game , these earlier titles were adapted into anime as well .

An estimated 50,000
Thousands of people walked five miles through the streets and heat of Phoenix on Saturday in protest of Arizona ’s new immigration law , which is slated to take effect July 29 .
A considerably smaller crowd gathered later in a nearby stadium in support of the bill , where speakers ridiculed any suggestion that the crowd was motivated by racism .
— JCL
Update : According to the Arizona Republic , which did a little police band eavesdropping , the march was anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 people strong .
Monday ’s little diatribe on git seemed to stir up quite a bit of strong opinion , both agreeing with me and disagreeing .
As is often the case , they two camps seem to be split about 50 - 50 , which makes me happy .
It means I can be confident that I ’m not talking complete arse - gravy , but I have a good chance of actually learning something .
For anyone who was n’t around on Monday , the substance of my post was “ git is bad because I do n’t understand it ” .
Or to paint myself in a slightly less bad light , “ git is bad for me because it makes assumptions about how I work that do n’t match how I actually work ” .
Or , to summarise the summary , “ git is the work of Sauron Gorthaur , the Abhorred , servant of Morgoth Bauglir , the Dark Lord that was called Melkor , destroyer and despiser , the corrupt Ainu and corrupter of Arda ” .
I ’ll admit that yesterday ’s post was more a howl of anguish than a reasoned argument ( although I still like the Harrier analogy ) .
Having now calmed down a little , I thought it might be worth explaining myself a bit more , and addressing some of the comments , both here and at Hacker News .
Explain yourself , Taylor !
First , I was a bit shocked at the number of people ( mostly at HN ) who seemed to think that my whole problem with git is the need to specify - a when doing a git commit of all changed files .
Folks , that was what is known as an example of how its model is n’t a good fit for how a lot of us work .
There are many more of these — for example , the fact that if you run git tag and subsequently push your repo , the tag does n’t get pushed .
Here is a more serious problem that I run into all the time ( including once this very day ) :
I make a one - line change to a single file .
I commit my change .
I git push , only to be told “ ! [ rejected ] master -> master ( non-fast forward ) ” .
( This is git ’s cuddly way of telling you to do a pull first . )
, only to be told “ ! [ rejected ] master -> master ( non-fast forward ) ” .
( This is git ’s cuddly way of telling you to do a pull first . )
I git pull , only to be told “ CONFLICT ( content ) : Merge conflict in filename .
Automatic merge failed ; fix conflicts and then commit the result . ”
So far , so good — someone else edited the same region of the same file as I did ( among their other edits ) : of course its a conflict , there ’s nothing git could do differently here but notify me and ask me to fix it .
So I edit the file , fix the trivial conflict , and git commit filename .
Nuh-uh .
“ fatal : can not do a partial commit during a merge . ”
Well , darn .
So , OK , no problem , I already fixed the conflict , so now I ’ll just git merge again to get it to make its world consistent , right ?
Nope : “ fatal :
You have not concluded your merge .
( MERGE_HEAD exists ) ” .
Well , duh !
I was telling you to merge , you stupid git .
You ’re the branches - and - merges - are - easy version - control system around here .
All right , so I will just git pull again , and this time the merge will work OK .
Gotta work , yes ?
No .
“ You are in the middle of a conflicted merge . ”
Well I knew that !
That ’s why I am trying to resolve it .
In fact , that ’s why I have resolved it !
All I am asking you to do is accept my resolution .
Please ?
Is that so much to ask ?
But wait — it ’s worse than that !
Not only can I not commit the file that had the conflict : I ca n’t commit any other file .
My whole repo is stuffed until I satisfy the hungry god .
But wait — it ’s worse than that !
git status shows that there are many , many modified files even though I know full well that I only edited the one line of the one file .
Because all the other changes that my colleague made have been splunged across my tree and suddenly , what the heck , they ’re my responsibility !
The solution turns out to be that I have to use git commit - a , i.e. commit all my changes in one go .
But , dammit , git , that ’s not what I wanted to do !
If I like to commit on a file - by - file basis , what business is it of yours to forbid me ?
And : much , much worse : my commit - a re-commits all the changes my buddy had already made and commited !
Seriously , git : what the hell ?
Something is rotten .
A handy household hint : how to abandon your changes when dealing with a conflicted merge
Of course , in the merge - conflict scenario above , you may sometimes see that your friend ’s changes are correct and leave yours irrelevant , so that you just want to throw your own changes away and use the version you pulled .
Should be pretty simple , huh ?
Well , according to the top-voted answer to this question on Stack Overflow , the correct thing to do is :
git reset –hard HEAD
git fetch origin
git reset –hard origin
Talk about intuitive .
Here ’s another one that I hate .
I needed to get back an older version of a binary file , foobar.doc , so I could compare it with the current version and see what had changed .
( git diff is no use in this situation , because it works on text : I needed to get hold of the earlier revision so I could pull it into OpenOffice , which knows how to compare documents . )
The command that does this is git show , which writes the old version on standard output so you can redirect it into the file of your choice .
In general , the command is git show revision : pathTo File .
revision can be HEAD^ to mean “ the one before the current one ” .
But when I did git show HEAD^ : foobar.doc , I got back a more than usually incomprehensible error message .
fatal : ambiguous argument ‘ HEAD^ : foobar.doc ’ : unknown revision or path not in the working tree .
Use ‘ – ‘ to separate paths from revisions
It turns out that this is because the file in question is n’t at the top level of the git module : when I said pathToFile earlier , I really meant it — you have to give the whole path relative to the root of the module .
( The bit of the error message about using ‘ – ‘ turns out to be complete red herring . )
So I have to use git show HEAD^ : dino / epub / foobar.doc , even though I am already in the directory dino / epub .
You ca n’t tell me that ’s right .
What makes it much , much worse
I just know that someone — probably several someones — are going to reply to this article saying : “ you are mistaken ; git is correct . ”
These people , most of them kindly and gently , will talk me through my misconceptions about what a version is , what a commit is , how it affects the index , what a merge means , why it has to be this way and why I am sadly mistaken in thinking it should be otherwise .
If we were discussing this in a pub rather than over the Internet , they would probably find a scrap of paper and draw a nice state - transition diagram for me , showing how the various change - sets propagate between the various checkouts , branches , indexes and repositories .
Nine times out of the ten , this will be done with patience and tact , with a side of burning evangelistic fervour .
Here is my rebuttal :
I. Do. Not. Care .
This is what I meant last time about git not degrading gracefully .
It ’s great that it handles multiple local and remote branches and merges and all the other stuff , but you ca n’t Just Not Know about that stuff .
You start out believing what you ’re told , that you can just use clone , pull , add , commit and push , and ignore the other 139 git commands ( * ) .
But you can’t .
You have to keep learning more of them , and learning new and baroque ways of invoking them ; and , more importantly , learning more of the concepts .
Any day now , I expect to learn that before git moves files into the index , it first keeps them in a top - secret pre-index stash - cache area .
(*) I am not exaggerating : / usr / local / git / libexec / git - core on my Mac contains 144 commands .
/ usr / lib/ git-core on my Ubuntu box is less promiscuous : it contains only 138 commands .
Who is the user around here ?
Is it terribly old - fashioned of me to believe that when a user uses a tool , he should be the one who determines how it ’s used ?
The bottom line for me with git is that I am sick of being pushed around .
It swans about as though it owns the place .
It make arbitrary demands .
It tells me what to do .
It ’s as though ext2fs insisted on particular file - naming conventions , or vi mandated a specific indentation regime for your C code .
Unless of course …
Unless git is a hammer and I am trying to use it as a screwdriver .
Or perhaps more appositely , it ’s a bandsaw and I ’m trying to use it as a bread - knife .
Or indeed , it ’s a Harrier and I ’m trying to use it as a bicycle .
Which I suspect is the case , and why I think the move back to CVS / Subversion might be the way to go .
Some responses to comments
But git does all these cool things !
I know it ; and All These Cool Things are of course the main reason I sideways - graded to it in the first place .
In particular , the ability to commit ( and do other things ) when offline and not connected to the master repository is a huge win , and if I do grade back to CVS or Subversions I am really going to miss it .
So I ’m not saying , or did n’t mean to say , that git does n’t offer real advantages over CVS and its brethren .
I ’m just saying that these things come at a cost ; a significant cost , that git advocates are in a bad habit of greatly downplaying .
( Sometimes git advocates remind me of The Borg , or perhaps Moonies — they seem so earnest and so committed to what they ’re doing , and so completely wired into their tribe ’s way of thinking that they can seem unable to contemplate the possibility of any other way of thinking . )
But git has cheap branching
I know it ; but I do n’t want to branch .
To read a lot of the tutorials it seems like git people branch all the time just for the fun of it ( and therefore merge all the time , too ) .
Sorry , do n’t want to play that game .
Cheap branching is better than expensive branching , sure , but that ’s like saying influenza is better than cancer .
I ’d rather just not be ill at all , thanks .
Your mileage may vary , of course .
The point is that git does n’t give you the choice .
Oh sure , it pretends it does ( “ just use clone , pull , add , commit and push ! ” ) , but the truth is that branches lurk everywhere — in tags , for example — and you simply ca n’t Just Not Use Them .
That ’s not a good model for how I want to work .
( Git Advocate : “ That ’s not a bug , it ’s a feature ! ” Sorry , not interested . )
But git lets you use any unique prefix of a commit ID , so you can use 23 bbcf 84 instead of 23bbcf847889c1fbfbb368b27e7b4ef3648879b1
And yet , I am unmoved .
Call me weird , but somehow I still prefer 1.8 .
This should not need pointing out , but typing 40 - character nonsense identifiers is only one of their many drawbacks .
That I can abbreviate them to a prefix that might be unique enough mitigates the pain , but in no way eliminates it .
Anyone can tell that 1.9 is later than 1.8 .
Who knows whether 745a4a4275c0322e5e699b02f8783b86ec14dc99 is later than bb7619b6568507d696516b1dd663b7b343d782f6 ?
There are n’t many sushi pictures in this article
Sorry , my bad .
Here you go :
Try Mercurial instead , it ’s similar but has a great tutorial !
I might just do that .
Try Fossil / Bazaar / Darcs / Arch instead !
Sorry , not gonna happen .
The problem is that to try out a version control system , you have to trust a bunch of your code into it , and use the system to share that code across multiple computers .
In the DVCS world , git seems to be the most popular by a long way ; Mercurial has a biggish following so might be workable , perhaps as a staging post on the way to learning to love git , but I just do n’t have the time or energy to spend in learning half a dozen different systems .
But wait , Taylor !
“ git seems to be the most popular by a long way ” — is that any criterion to use in choosing something ?
vi is more popular than Emacs ; Windows is more popular than Linux ; Britney Spears is more popular than Dar Williams ; Big Brother is more popular than Veronica Mars .
Yet you will never find me hacking with vi on a Windows box while listening to Britney with Big Brother on in the background .
So why would I select a version - control system on that basis ?
Simply because nine tenths of the point of version control is so that my colleagues and I can hack on the same code - base together .
And that requires that we all use the same repository , which has to be under a single , jointly agreed , VCS .
If I decide that Darcs is the answer for me , then I have to persuade all my friends to try the same experiment at the same time .
Not gonna happen .
In fact , I think I ’ve probably just persuaded myself not to use Mercurial , either .
I might still read hginit.com , though .
Try reading Insert name of git tutorial here !
Thanks for the link .
I may well do so .
You should read the Pro Git book
I probably will , thanks for the all the endorsements .
Git is not version control ; it ’s change control
I will ponder this .
It seems profound .
( Although I notice that not all commenters seem agreed on whether it ’s true . )
the biggest step is using git the way it ’s intended : lots of branching , partial commits and rebase / merge to keep your downstream changes clean , etc .
Yeah , I know .
That ’s exactly what I ’m trying to avoid .
The conclusion of the matter
One of the more thought - provoking comments on the last article was this one from teh :
I disagree with “ Git ’s just version control .
I resent the idea of investing a month of evenings and weekends just to be able to check my freakin ’ files in . ” .
Version control is not “ just ” version control , it ’s a first class tool for every programmer , up there with recursion and all that jazz .
A programmers work is transforming code from one state to another .
Git treats these transformations as first class objects , allowing you to rewrite or reorder them , have alternative transformation branches , send them around etc .
I still , frankly , resent the idea of spending the amount of time that I know will be necessary to become a git wizard .
But I am increasingly reconciled to the idea that it will be time invested rather than time wasted .
I do n’t intend to be graceful about this —
I plan to mutter and groan and whine incessantly — but I have a horrible feeling the the outcome of this article and its predecessor is that I ’m going to end up Deeply Learning git .
I do n’t want to — I hate the idea of ending up as one of the Git Advocates that I was complaining about earlier — but I think I ’m going to have to .
And if I do it , I ’m going to do it properly , which means * sigh * another book , and probably another Long Overdue Serious Attempt
At series .
As Xiong Chiamiov wrote in a comment :
I use it because the benefits outweigh all of the things that you mentioned .
Dammit all , he ’s right , is n’t he ?

Update 1 ( a couple of hours later )
Very important point in a comment by Chris , which I should have made in the original article :
And at the risk of sounding absolutely trite , at the end of the day is n’t the important thing that we actually use some form of version / change / source control at all , implementation be damned ?
After all , is n’t that what separates us from the monkeys ?
So , so , true .
From 1990 to 2000 , I used SCCS , a version - control system written in 1972 that was so amazingly primitive that it still thought digital watches were a pretty neat idea .
It makes CVS look like the height of power and sophistication .
I am here to tell you that difference between not using version control and using SCCS was like the difference between night and day ; after that , everything else is trivial in comparison .
Well , maybe not trivial , but the productivity gap from No Version Console to SCCS is much greater than the gap from SCCS to git .
Thanks for reminding me of that basic fact , Chris .
Update 2 ( the next morning )
Many thanks to all of you who have commented ( well , nearly all of you ) .
I think I ’ve seen more genuinely helpful insights in the comments here and on the previous article than in any of the various git tutorials I ’ve read .
In particular , I have learned the important concrete lesson than git commit - a is not my friend : an important lesson that should be taught to every git newcomer .
I do n’t like to single out individual comments when so much useful stuff has been said ( though I ’ve also been called an idiot rather more times than I usually like ) , but for those of you who do n’t usually read comments , please just take a look at this one from Kragen Javier Sitaker : apart from anything else , it contains by far the best justification I ’ve ever seen for git rebase ( or git lie , as I prefer to call it ) .
You know the business lore joke .
The departing CEO meets his successor and hands him three envelopes to be opened in the prescribed order when trouble strikes .
First crisis , the message in envelope # 1 says : Blame your predecessor .
Easy enough .
Another storm , the the CEO opens the second envelope : Reorganize .
Good idea .
And when calamity strikes yet again , he reaches for the third :
Get three envelopes …
This past Tuesday , Steve Ballmer reorganized Microsoft ’s Entertainment & Devices division , let go of its execs , Robbie Bach and J Allard , and moved a few more pieces around .
All wrapped in the most mellifluous , Orwellian language we ’ve seen from Microsoft in awhile .
The full memo is here .
We ’re treated to encomiums to great work , friendship , spending more time with one ’s family , leaving on a high note … under the guise of decency , this is indecent .
Ballmer ’s view of executive leadership does n’t admit standing up and taking responsibility .
He ca n’t say ‘ I screwed up ’ and then explain what he ’ll do to rectify the situation .
No .
Instead , two gents are fingered while they pretend they are n’t being blamed .
In a surreal , a cappella farewell memo , J Allard writes to his soon former troops :
‘ No one can touch our talent , our impact or our ambition .
We ’re the only high - tech company with the track record and self - confidence to reinvent ourselves as we have .
If you want to change the world with technology , this is still the best tribe out there . ’
Robbie Bach dutifully plays his part in the down - is - actually - up corporate farce .
He gives a long exit interview to the Microsoft - friendly blog Tech Flash where he claims the dual departures are coincidental , that everything is fine .
What does he have to say about tablets ?
Nothing much :
‘ Well , tablet is an area that will evolve going forward .
Certainly it ’s a focus for what we ’re doing in the Windows space , and how they ’re thinking that space .
We ’re going to have a bunch of netbooks and tablet stuff that ’s in the works there .
We ’ll just see how that evolves .
I do n’t think there ’s anything earth - shattering about that .
It ’s just another set of devices , and we ’ll figure out how we make sure we bring a good offering to consumers . ’
And , regarding the now defunct Courier tablet :
‘ Courier , first of all , was n’t a device .
The project and the incubation and the exploration we did on Courier I view as super important .
The “ device ” people saw in the video is n’t going to ship , but that does n’t mean we did n’t learn a bunch and innovate a bunch in the process .
And I ’m sure a bunch of that innovation will show up in Microsoft products , absolutely confident of it . ’
Serves us right for not reading the small print on the screen during the demo .
These guys obviously think we ’re idiots .
That ’s their privilege , but they ought to be a little more discrete about their low regard for us .
Not everyone buys this BS .
One blogger , Horace Dediu , offers what many believe is the right explanation : Robbie Bach was fired because he lost the HP account .
As the largest PC maker , HP is a hugely important Microsoft customer .
A few weeks ago , HP acquired Palm for its WebOS smartphone software platform .
The slap in Microsoft ’s face still resonates ; it ’s a verdict on the failed Windows Mobile offering and a negative prognosis on its upcoming Windows Phone 7 Series operating system for smartphones .
Days after the acquisition , Mark Hurd , HP ’s CEO , let it be known that WebOS will be used in connected printers .
As a final blow , HP ’s ( future ) Slate Tablet , once held high as a Windows 7 device , will also use Palm ’s WebOS .
Steve Ballmer has always been Microsoft ’s most powerful salesman .
That he lost the HP mobile devices account — and it was Ballmer who lost it , not Robbie Bach — is yet one more reason why Microsoft shareholders are troubled .
Their unhappiness can be charted by comparing two stock price graphs , spanning the January 2000 — May 2010 period .
Microsoft ’s stock dropped from $ 56 to $ 25.80 …
… while Apple shares rose from $ 25 to $ 256.88 :
The morning after Steve Ballmer opened the proverbial Second Envelope , Apple ’s market cap , the total value of its shares , surpassed Microsoft’s .
In Wall Street terms , Apple is now the largest high - tech company , worth about $ 230B , a few percentage points ahead of Microsoft .
Across all industries , Steve Jobs ’ company is now second only to an oil company , Exxon , at $ 285B .
When questioned about Apple overtaking Microsoft , Ballmer had this to say :
‘ It is a long game .
We have good competitors but we too are very good competitors , ’ he said .
‘ I will make more profit and certainly there is no technology company on the planet that is as profitable as we are . ’
When it comes to profits , Ballmer is willing to take credit .
Over the last decade , Wall Street has declined to reward Microsoft for its superior profit .
The explanation is simple : Professional investors do n’t believe Ballmer , and they do n’t see bigger profits in Microsoft ’s future .
Conversely , they bid up Apple ’s shares precisely because they think the company will keep growing revenue and profits .
Apple has managed to enter new , growing markets , a feat Ballmer has repeatedly failed to accomplish .
January 2000 was when Steve Ballmer was made CEO of Microsoft .
Yes , we can discount the year 2000 , that ’s when the Internet Bubble burst causing most high - tech shares to collapse .
Still , since the end of 2000 , Microsoft stock has stagnated , hovering between $ 25 and $ 30 .
This never appeared to faze Ballmer .
While we joke about the Steve Jobs Reality Distortion Field , Microsoft shareholders ought to worry about Steve Ballmer ’s own distortion , and about the self - inflicted effects of such a strong field .
We all remember Vista , it was a godsend for Apple .
Did Ballmer acknowledge that there were problems ?
What about the Xbox 360 reliability nightmare ?
The apologies were left to underlings .
Then Google comes out of nowhere to take 65 % of the Search market , leaving Microsoft with an Apple - like market share ( I ’m referring to Macs , not iPods ) .
In MP3 players , Microsoft failed again and again in its attempts to unseat the dominant ( 65 % market share ) iPod /iTunes combo .
Social networks ?
A tiny investment ( 1.6 % ) in Facebook .
And where is Microsoft in the Microblogging world , a.k. a Twitter ?
Nowhere , the old Microsoft Messenger is fading away .
Now we have the most recent Microsoft failure : Smartphones .
When the iPhone came out in 2007 , Ballmer pronounced it a “ passing fad ’’ .
Then , in 2008 , he promised that Windows Mobile would have 40 % market share by 2012 .
To be fair , he did recognize the failure in October 2009 : ‘[ We ] screwed up with Windows Mobile . ’
The platform was effectively dead .
Earlier this year in Barcelona , Ballmer introduced his new smartphone OS , Windows Phone 7 Series , available in time for the Holidays .
Two months after the Barcelona event , two Kin phones emerge to a lukewarm reception … and neither of them run on the old generation software , nor the next one , orphaned at birth .
Undeterred , Ballmer now predicts there will be 30 million Windows Phone 7 smartphones sold in 2011 .
Ballmer has proudly proclaimed there will be no iPod or iPhone in his household , so that ’s a few Windows 7 Phones sold right there .
As for the rest of the 30 million … has he heard of Android ?
At last week ’s Google I - O , the company announced there were over 100,000 Android phones activated every day , more than 35 million Android phones this year .
Given the enthusiasm of handset makers for Google ’s OS , they ’ll probably sell twice as many next year .
Ballmer ’s Reality Distortion Field is overheating .
There ’s no dearth of advice for Ballmer to right the ship .
You can find Galen Gruman ’s at Infoworld and Anders Bylund ’s at the Motley Fool .
But I ’m afraid none of it will work .
The same leadership will cause the same effects .
Ballmer is running out of envelopes .
One of Microsoft ’s problems , paradoxically , is that it makes a lot of money .
It can spend 15 % of revenue in R&D — about $ 9B a year — with no market breakthrough to show for it .
Great concept demos and prototypes … and then nothing .
( How many new Googles , Facebooks , and Twitters could we VCs fund with that kind of money ? … )
A bigger problem is Microsoft ’s Board of Directors .
Ten women and men with distinguished backgrounds ranging from banking to pharma , from university president to venture capitalist .
( There ’s a lonely entrepreneur there , Reed Hastings , CEO of Netflix .
He ’s a math whiz , which could explain the NetFlix prize . )
Three out of the ten members are old - time friends , connected through Harvard ( Gates and Ballmer ) and Stanford ( Ballmer and Marquardt ) .
Such closeness makes it difficult to make painful decisions .
Furthermore , it ’s not obvious how a research mathematician , the President of Harvey Mudd College — a terrific place for gifted kids — an auto executive , and a banker can parse the finer but essential points of a mobile software strategy .
The PowerPoint slides look professional , the occasional demo looks good … but what can a “ generalist ’’ director do ?
In theory , the directors ’ most important function is to hire and fire the CEO .
But how independent are the Microsoft directors ?
How could they get the CEO to open the third envelope ?
Microsoft did n’t have Apple ’s stroke of luck .
Fire one if its founders who goes on to start two companies , Pixar and NeXT , and then comes back twelve years later , tempered by the experiences , good and bad , ready to lead the company to an amazingly successful second act .
Except for Ballmer ’s two - year stint at Procter & Gamble , all he and Gates have ever known is Microsoft .
So , there we are .
An immensely successful company , still making large amounts of money but unable to go beyond its original Windows +
Office +
Exchange franchise , left behind by a combination of newcomers such as Google and Facebook with the old frenemy , Apple .
Someday , a large institutional holder will get tired of waiting , tired of watching yet another rah-rah , ‘ the future will be great ’ speech from Ballmer , and they ’ll dump their shares .
That might shock the Board into taking the required drastic action .
Take a look at the institutional ownership of Microsoft stock .
Many have already started selling portions of their holdings .
Next week in Los Angeles we have the Wall Street Journal ’s D8 conference ( the speaker line - up is here ) .
Steve # 1 and Steve # 2 will be interviewed on stage by Walt Mossberg , the newspaper ’s high - tech guru .
We ’ll see how Walt broaches the Second Envelope question with Steve # 2 .
Will he pose hard questions or toss softballs , allowing Ballmer to give one more of his now tired and tiring ‘ We ’ll win…eventually ’ speeches ?
Come to think of it , Steve Numero
Uno might very well heap praise on Microsoft ’s CEO , he likes him just the way he is : with enemies like Ballmer , who needs friends ?
I ’ll be in attendance , and will report back next week .

Journalist 's horror as ' Commander Red ' is shot in head during face - to - face interview
A rogue army general who modelled himself on ' Braveheart ' has been shot in the head by a sniper during a face - to - face an interview with a New York Times reporter in Bangkok .
Major General Khattiya Sawasdipol is said to be leading the red shirts – a militant wing of Thai anti-government protesters – and had been organising their defences in the centre of the city .
The Major General , also known as Seh Daeng ( meaning Commander Red ) was shot in his head as he was giving an interview to New York Times correspondent Thomas Fuller .
He survived the shooting overnight but is still fighting for life in hospital today .
[ caption ]
When the bullet hit him , he was inside the barricaded red shirt encampment , facing a road , overpass and a business district with several tall buildings , said the journalist .
In his initial report for the New York Times , Mr Fuller did not betray the horror he must have felt as the leader was gunned down before his eyes , writing only that the Major General ' was shot before this reporter ' .
A later New York Times report , co-authored by Mr Fuller and another journalist , simply said that the general had been gunned down in front of a ' a reporter for the New York Times ' .
In clinical language , they wrote : ' The reporter , who was two feet away and facing the general , heard a loud bang similar to that of a firecracker .
The general fell to the ground , his eyes wide open . '
The shooting came as violence broke out in the Thai capital yesterday .
Today troops were firing on protesters as the situation threatened to intensify .
Up to three foreign journalists are believed to have been shot in the fighting , one from France 24 .
Khattiya is also in charge of security at an encampment occupied by thousands of demonstrators .
Around the same time as Khattiya was shot , a loud blast was heard , followed by bursts of automatic gunfire near the heavily guarded business district .

The hospital where Khattiya was taken said today he was unlikely to survive .
He is suspected to be behind several grenade attacks on army , police and civilians which have injured more than 100 people , which he denies , saying : ' No one saw me !'
Khattiya was named as a terrorist by Thailand prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and is a figure the government would want removed from the scene .
Khattiya , a personal friend of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , had fallen out with his army superiors after which he was put in charge of military aerobics training .
' Everybody laughed at me .
You do n't assign a warrior like me to do a stupid thing like that , ' he was quoted as saying afterwards .
In an interview with a wire service reporter he said : ' Do you know the Braveheart movie ?
Mel Gibson is the same as me . ’
While many considered him to be slightly loopy , or a loose cannon , he was admired by red shirts who queued for his autograph .

Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva is under enormous pressure to end the violent political crisis that has killed 29 people , wounded more than 1,400 , paralysed parts of the capital and slowed growth in Southeast Asia 's second - biggest economy .
On Wednesday , he cancelled a proposed November 14 election under his ' national reconciliation ' plan and called off talks with the red- shirted protesters after they raised new demands .
The 22 - member red shirt leadership council has struggled to find common ground on how to end the protests and appeared in disarray tonight .
Its chairman and several others have not been seen in days .
The situation was tense in Bangkok last night where some 20 civilians were reported to have been injured in a new series of grenade attacks .
The British Embassy in Bangkok shut down as troops moved in on anti-government red- shirt demonstrators with permission to use live ammunition .
The Embassy will close until further notice .
An Embassy spokesman said British citizens should watch the Embassy 's website for any developments .
As protests continued today , demonstrators captured and vandalised two military water cannon trucks today , ripping the cannon from its moorings and using its plastic barrel to shoot firecrackers .
Mixas Epilog Thomas Pany
Der zurückgetretene Bischof sieht sich als Opfer " haltloser Missbrauchsvorwürfe " ; der Bericht des Sonderermittlers widerspricht ihm .
Gestern konnten sich die Leser der Bild am Sonntag noch einmal davon überzeugen , dass sich der zurückgetretene Augsburger Bischof Mixa vor allem als Opfer einer Kampagne begreift .
" Es tut mir weh , dass viele treue Christen wegen der haltlosen Missbrauchsvorwürfe an mir gezweifelt haben " , äußerte Mixa gegenüber der Boulevardzeitung .
Sein Anwalt beklagt eine " öffentlichen Hinrichtung " , der eine " erkennbar vage Mitteilung " zugrunde lag .
Gemeint ist der Vorwurf des sexuellen Missbrauchs , der am Freitag vor einer Woche zu Vorermittlungen der Staatsanwaltschaft Ingolstadt geführt hatte .
Dieser Verdacht hatte sich nach Angaben der Staatsanwaltschaft nicht erhärtet , wie am vergangenen Freitag bekannt wurde .
Worauf Mixa und dessen
Anwalt jedoch nicht eingingen , waren die anderen Vorwürfe , die den öffentlichen Fall Mixa erst begründeten und die sich - trotz der wochenlangen Gegendarstellungen Mixas ( " Ich bin zutiefst erschüttert über die Anschuldigungen " ) - nicht als haltlos heraustellten .
Der Aussage Mixas -
" Ich versichere nochmals , dass ich zu keiner Zeit gegen Kinder und Jugendliche körperliche Gewalt in irgendeiner Form angewandt habe . " - standen eidestattlich abgegebene Aussagen von acht Opfern gegenüber , die sich an anderes erinnerten .
Der zur Aufklärung eingeschaltete Sonderermittler Rechtsanwalt Sebastian Knott , der die " Anschuldigungen aus dem Halbdunkel " ( Bistumssprecher Hermann Voß ) lichten sollte , legte seinen Abschlussbericht am vergangenen Freitag in einer Pressekonferenz vor .
Sein Ergebnis : Der Tatbestand der Körperverletzung , gefährlicher Körperverletzung und der Misshandlung von Schutzbefohlenen ist erfüllt , aber verjährt .
Auch stiftungszweckfremde Ausgaben ( Solarium , Teppich und Weineinkäufe ) wurden nachgewiesen , nicht jedoch eine Bereicherung Mixas durch diese Einkäufe aus dem Geld der Stiftung .
Weshalb er nach Einschätzung des Sonderermittlers strafrechtlich auch in diesen Fällen " nicht zur Verantwortung zu ziehen ist " .
Details , die der Sonderermittler in seinem Bericht vorlegte , rücken jedoch die beharrliche Weigerung des ehemaligen Kirchenfürsten , die Wirklichkeit der gegen ihn geäußerten Vorwürfe überhaupt nur anzuerkennen , in ein schlechtes Licht .
So zitiert die Augsburger Allgemeine aus dem Bericht : " ... worauf er sie mindestens fünfmal so stark boxte , dass sie gegen die Wand fiel und zusammenbrach ... Schwester I. und N. stachelten Mixa noch mit den Worten , hau nei ...‘ an . "
An anderer Stelle heißt es :
" Herr Mixa zog ihm die Hose herunter und prügelte mit einem Stock auf den nackten Hintern .
Nach fünf bis sechs Schlägen begann der Betroffene zu weinen .
Danach brach der Stecken ab und Herr Mixa lockerte seinen Hosengürtel und schlug noch weitere fünf - bis sechsmal auf seinen Hintern . "
Der Bericht des Sonderermittlers enthält nach Medienberichten auch eine Passage , wonach Mixa einen Missbrauchsskandal in Österreich in den 1990er Jahren mit den Worten kommentiert haben soll , dass er " auf Teufel komm raus " lügen würde , wenn ihm so etwas passieren würde .
Space is black .
I mean , duh , right ?
But really , it 's black because it 's almost entirely empty , so even with stars scattered around , there 's nothing to light up .
But some parts of space are bright : clouds of gas can be lit up by nearby stars , making them glow .
However , just to make things more fun , there can be thicker patches of dust mixed in that block the light from the stars and gas behind them .
We see lots of those , they 're pretty common .
But there 's yet another " however " : that dust only blocks the visible light .
In the infrared , that dust should itself glow because it 's warm .
NGC 1999 -- seen here in a famous Hubble picture -- has all these ingredients .
It 's a thick region of gas and dust .
Stars are being born in and around it , brightening it with their reflected light ( as seen in the image ; the star V380 Orionis on the left is lighting up the surrounding space junk ) as well as warming it up and making it glow on its own .
Even so , the oddly - shaped patch to the right was thought to be an unusually dense blob of dust , blocking the light from gas on the other side of it from us .
A lot of the time those dense spots are where stars are being born , and the only way to see them is in the infrared .
So astronomers pointed the European space - based Herschel infrared observatory at it , fully expecting to see the whole thing glowing with perhaps a nascent star forming in the dark blob .
But that 's not quite how it worked out ...
Here 's the Herschel image they got .
See that green blob near the top ?
That 's the part you can see in the Hubble image .
In fact , it looks an awful lot like the Hubble shot , with the star V380 Orionis on the left , lots of glowy stuff , and that dark spot just to the right of it ...
Wait , what ?
That spot is still dark ?
In the far infrared ?
That can't be right .
Even if it were only a few degrees above absolute zero it should be glowing at least a little bit .
So the astronomers followed up with more observations from the ground , and found something astonishing : it really is a hole , an actual empty region in the middle of a dense cloud !
That 's the exact opposite of what they expected .
There 's no there there .
What could have done this ?
It turns out that the fault may lie in the stars themselves .
Many times , when stars are born , they form twin beams of material that blast out of their poles .
That must have happened here ; there are plenty of very young stars in this volume of space .
It 's likely that one ( or maybe more ) of them switched on beams like this .
The furious torch of matter and energy punched its way into the surrounding nebulosity , creating this tunnel right on through to the other side .
I 'll note it 's unlikely that V380 Orionis had much or anything to do with carving this hole ; it 's actually well past the age where it would make such beams .
That only happens with stars that are only a million or so years old at most .
V380 is already a stable star , well past that age , so it 's probably innocent .
NGC 1999 is a familiar object to a lot of astronomers .
The odd shape of the dark spot ( it 's always reminded me of a Shuttle Orbiter ) makes it fairly iconic .
So this news is a bit of a shake up ; I was delighted when I read it .
I love it when we see something new under any circumstances , but something we thought we knew -- something we could almost dismiss as being well - enough understood that it was no big deal -- to find out it 's actually unique and wholly unexpected ... well , that 's just awesome .
Surprises in science are the best results you can get .
Nothing makes scientists happier than having to turn their pencils around and use the other end .

Today 's no-shit study says infertility can do a number on a couple 's sex life .
Just like fertility !
Advertisement
According to Slate 's Sarah Elizabeth Richards , researched the Stanford have found that 40 % of women dealing with infertility also suffer sexual problems , like lack of arousal and desire , compared to only 25 % of women in general .
Hormone shots may be part of the cause , but researchers think the problems are mostly psychological .
Therapist Ronny Diamond says that for infertile women , " Sex , rather than being a place where you can escape the world , becomes a reminder of what you can't do .
You can't make a baby . "
She adds that the scheduled sex mandated by fertility treatments can be a turnoff : " When the woman calls her husband at work and says ' I 'm ovulating .
Come home .
We 've got to do it now , ' it ruins people 's ideas of romantic conception . "
None of this is a shock , unfortunately — as Richards notes , " anyone who has had trouble getting or staying pregnant knows that infertility is hard on relationships , " and it's not surprising that it can reduce sex drive as much as it increases conflict .
But it 's interesting to note how many of the problems caused by infertility can also be caused by its opposite — efforts to have sex without having a baby .
Birth control pills , for instance , can lower libido and mess with body image and mood .
Anybody who 's ever found a lost NuvaRing in the bed several days later knows how much fun that is , as do those who 've experienced side effects from Plan B .
And there 's always the fear of these or other methods failing — an occasional mood - killer , I 'd wager , for even the most careful contraceptor .
It 's true that one of the perks of protected sex is relative freedom from worry — that " place where you can escape the world " — but just as no fertility treatment is guaranteed to generate a pregnancy , no birth control is 100 % guaranteed to prevent one .

All this is not to trivialize the troubles of infertile women , who , if the Stanford study is correct , are disproportionately suffering .
Rather , I 'd like to point out that 25 % — the number of fertile women who experience sexual problems — is still really high .
This may be in part because women still bear the responsibility for the reproductive aspects of sex .
Some of this is biological — we are the ones with the wombs — but some of it is social : women are the ones judged when they do n't procreate , or when they get pregnant too young or out of wedlock .
And the fact that all the myriad forms of hormonal birth control , with all their myriad side effects , must pass through our bodies is surely due in part to where the research money goes .
A male birth control pill would sure be nice , but so would a general recognition that whether the goal is preventing or creating a pregnancy , men need to be equal partners .

Deutsche Sensation in Oslo Lena Meyer - Landrut gewinnt Grand Prix

Gold hit a new record high on Tuesday as the $ 1 trillion bailout of the Euro - zone region combined with the giant U.S. deficit leaves bullion as the only reserve currency of choice .
“ You finally have a fundamental reason to own gold , ” said Joe Terranova , chief market strategist for Virtus Investment Partners and Fast Money trader .
“ It ’s a diversification tool for central banks around the world , especially China and India , now that the Euro is on the run . ”
Today gold settled at new all - time high of $ 1,220.3 an ounce .
Investors sent the metal reeling earlier in 2010 as government data showed concerns about inflation were overblown .
The SPDR Gold Trust , one of the many ETFs out there focusing on the metal , is up 14 percent from its 2010 low in February .
The ECB ’s purchase of government debt as part of the bailout plan will be at the very least “ detrimental to the integrity of the currency itself , ” wrote Dennis Gartman of The Gartman Letter .
“ That process shall tend on balance to put upward , perhaps relentless , pressure upon gold as gold becomes every day to be seen as the second reservable currency , supplanting the EUR which had assumed that rule until quite recently . ”
Gartman , who predicts the Euro will eventually be forced to break apart one day , agrees with Terranova that the central banks of the world have no other choice now than to own gold .
Sure , there are other currencies , like the Canadian Dollar , which will gain favor , but none have the liquidity and fungible value of gold .
This enormous force will put a long - term bid under the metal , they said .
Gold lost its inflation - hedge identity following a loss of its safety identity in 2008 .
Gold plummeted in 2008 along with almost every other asset class as investors were forced to take profits in the metal to raise cash for margin calls and redemption requests .
But now we face a crisis centered around a currency and not exotic derivatives which had diseased every corner of the financial system .
“ It ’s different this time , ” said Terranova , who is also a ‘ Fast Money ’ trader .
“ It ’s true identity is a safety play and inflation hedge and this time around it will be viewed as such . ”

An ISP must hand over the identity of the operator behind a major BitTorrent tracker , a court in Sweden ruled today .
OpenBitTorrent , probably the world 's largest public tracker , is currently hosted by Portlane .
The ISP must now reveal the identity of its customer to Hollywood movie companies or face a hefty fine .
Yesterday we reported how a Swedish appeals court had upheld an earlier ruling which ordered an ISP to hand over the details of a torrent site operator .
If it fails to supply several movie companies with the name of the customer behind the SweTorrents site , ISP TeliaSonera faces a 750,000 kronor ( $ 96,500 ) fine .
Although TeliaSonera may yet appeal the decision and potentially win , today brings news of a new IPRED case on an altogether bigger scale .
Just as The Pirate Bay has relocated and obfuscated its real location to avoid detection , it has also changed its structure and modus operandi in order to stay alive .
A major part of this strategy became apparent last year when it shut down its tracker , instead relying on DHT , PEX and trackers operated by 3rd parties , in particular OpenBitTorrent .
Hollywood did n’t take long to react .
Portlane must hand over the identities of those behind OpenBitTorrent
“ OpenBitTorrent is used for file sharing , and we suspect that it is the Pirate Bay tracker with a new name .
It is added by default on all of the torrent tracker files on Pirate Bay , ” Hollywood lawyer Monique Wadsted said in an earlier comment .
In November last year Hollywood announced they would sue OpenBitTorrent host Portlane in an attempt to force the closure of the tracker .
In December the Stockholm District Court rejected calls to close down the tracker , a decision that is currently under appeal with the studios claiming that Portlane should take responsibility for the infringements being facilitated by OpenBitTorrent .
While that game of legal - tennis continues , the studios have today won another significant battle , this time in a Stockholm court .
While there has been speculation about the identities of those behind OpenBitTorrent , that information has been impossible to verify .
All that could be about to change .
“ The Court orders Portlane under pain of a fine of SEK 500,000 ( $ 63,633 ) to provide the Studios with the name and e-mail address information [ of those behind OBT ] , ” said movie industry lawyer Monique Wadsted as she provided TorrentFreak with a translation of a decision announced in the Stockholm City Court today .
The ruling covers the customer behind the IP addresses 188.126.64.2 and 188.126.64.3 and / or any other IP addresses in Portlane ’s entire range ( 188.126.64.0 – 188.126.95.255 ) which have been allocated to tracker.openbittorrent.com since August 28 , 2009 .
The Court also ruled that Portlane should state whether or not the customer is situated inside the EU .
The operators of OBT say they first got together in Lima , Peru , although their nationalities and current locations are unknown .
Portlane has 14 days to hand over the information to the studios but may yet still appeal this decision .
At the time of publication Portlane has yet to respond with comments .
OpenBitTorrent has never portrayed the ‘ jolly roger ’ style of The Pirate Bay and even has a DMCA - style notice and takedown procedure to stop the tracking of torrents .
Even so , it would be surprising if they had n’t anticipated the possibility of a court ruling like this and taken the necessary steps to hide their identities from Portlane .
Rand Paul , the Tea Party candidate who won the Kentucky Republican nomination for Senate , is one scary dude who is finding that his politics of division and hatred do n't transfer very well under the harsh glare of fact and sanity .
This article was updated at 10:04 am Thursday , May 20th to replace the video originally embedded with the correct video intended for this piece .
Rand Paul , the Tea Party candidate who won the Kentucky Republican nomination for Senate in last night ’s election , is one scary dude .
And like other scary dudes coming out from under a rock to face the national media he is finding that his politics of division and hatred do n’t transfer very well under the harsh glare of fact and sanity .
Paul is an anti-government , anti-establisment agitator who ran on a platform of shaking up Washington , and “ taking our government back . ”
To him that means possibly dismantling pesky little laws such as the Civil Rights Act and other protections against discrimination that override the rights of business owners to run their businesses the “ way they see fit . ”
If , for example , they see fit to hang a sign saying “ No Coloreds Allowed . ”
As one example .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

Paul appears , however , not to have practiced articulating his arguments for a national audience , because either he does n’t understand the implications of his own positions very well or he does n’t have the courage to clarify them on national television .
It ’s a long clip , but watch this one from Rachel Maddow tonight , during which Paul is completely incoherent in responding to questions about whether , for example , he would allow business owners to bar people of color from eating at their restaurant .
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
Paul is also deeply anti-choice .
He claims he is a libertarian .
According the website Libertarianism :
Libertarians believe that , on every issue , you have the right to decide for yourself what ’s best for you and to act on that belief so long as you respect the right of other people to do the same and deal with them peacefully and honestly .
According to this definition , Rand Paul may be a LINO ( Libertarian In Name Only ) .
He is a libertarian , except , of course , when it comes to women ’s rights , health , and lives , at which point he draws the line on women ’s lives , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
Men only in this club , gals .
And by that I mean heterosexual men because gays , lesbians , transgender persons–and persons with disabilities –are all in the “ women ” category because they do n’t deserve federal protections , according to Mr. Paul .
Indeed , in an interview tonight on NPR Mr. Paul suggested we could just get rid of the Americans with Disabilities Act because ( I am paraphrasing ) companies that had offices with two or more floors could just put the “ disabled ” offices on the first floor , so business owners do n’t have to spend a lot of money on elevators to accommodate the needs of disabled workers to , say , get around the rest of the building .
The true meaning of “ able-ism . ”
He ’s for civil rights , but just does n’t think we should “ legislate them . ”
Like , leave them to the states , man .
He feels , according to the Kentucky Courier - Journal , that while the federal government can enforce integration of government jobs and facilities , private business people should be able to decide whether they want to serve black people , or gays , or any other minority group .
These and other views be what prompted Matt Yglesias of ThinkProgress to call Paul a lunatic .
He ’s also a “ personhood ” guy and , if elected , he ’d like to pass some laws that would basically make criminals out of women who have abortions or miscarry .
On his website :
I am 100 % pro life .
I believe abortion is taking the life of an innocent human being .
I believe life begins at conception and it is the duty of our government to protect this life .
I will always vote for any and all legislation that would end abortion or lead us in the direction of ending abortion .
I believe in a Human Life Amendment and a Life at Conception Act as federal solutions to the abortion issue .
I also believe that while we are working toward this goal , there are many other things we can accomplish in the near term .
These , are , of course , sentiments strongly shared by the Republican Party , yet even though he ’s still in the “ family ” on the rights of women , gays , and people of color , even they seem to be keeping a wary arm ’s distance from Paul .
Yet despite his distate of government regulation of business ( because lack of regulation is working out so well in , say , the case of the BP oil spill )
Paul actually wants to expand government in other ways , once again focusing on those non-liberties of women :
I would strongly support legislation restricting federal courts from hearing cases like Roe v. Wade .
Such legislation would only require a majority vote , making it more likely to pass than a pro-life constitutional amendment .
and :
I would support legislation , a Sanctity of Life Amendment , establishing the principle that life begins at conception .
This legislation would define life at conception in law , as a scientific statement .
I did n’t know you could legislate a “ scientific fact ” that does n’t exist .
But give him points for creativity .
There is of course debate across the political spectrum of the meaning of the results in last night ’s race in Kentucky , with various bets on whether Paul ’s win is ephemeral or if he might actually end up heading to the Senate .
Many of course hope that having Paul as the nominee will result in the addition of a Democratic Senate seat in November .
Others shudder at the prospect that Paul might win .
In a piece for Atlantic Wire , Nick Ottens summarizes reactions from a range of commentators :
Some are skeptical that Paul ’s victory signifies much however .
According to Joshua Green , writing for The Altantic , Rand Paul ’s win does n’t herald a Tea Party tidal wave .
For one thing , “ Paul ’s celebrity dad brought him money , volunteers , name recognition , and media attention , particularly on Fox News .
What other Tea Party candidate can match that ? ” he wonders .
Ottens writes that at Newsweek , David Graham warns against a “ conservative backlash ” to Paul ’s victory , noting that , “ Even some heterodox conservatives are voicing concern . ”
And , notes Ottens , commentators on the left have been quick to convince themselves that Tuesday means nothing .
Andy Ostroy at The Huffington Post believes that Paul ’s victory only shows “ that Republican voters are sick of establishment GOP candidates . ”
The Tea baggers can beat their chests and crow all they want about the “ hugeness ” of their movement ’s big victory , as Paul boasted last night , but all it portends for the party in November ’s midterm elections is Republican - on - Republican bloodletting .
Ottens concludes , however :
Considering that Paul led Grayson by 59 to 35 percent of the vote ; considering the predominance of the Republican Party in Kentucky politics , with the state opting for GOP candidates in the last three presidential elections ; and considering today ’s political climate in all of the United States , Rand Paul as senator is by no means unthinkable .
Quite to the contrary .
“ [ B ]y nominating a lunatic , ” writes Yglesias , “ Republicans have suddenly raised the odds that a lunatic will represent Kentucky in the United States Senate . ”
ORLANDO , Fla . –
The nation ’s labor movement will hold picket lines and rallies in front of banks and financial institutions in 200 cities across America the week of March 15 - 20 , the AFL - CIO announced at its executive council meeting here yesterday .
Union leaders here said the demonstrations , under the banner “ Good Jobs Now , Make Wall Street Pay , ” will be the first of many mass mobilizations that will bring labor and its allies into the streets throughout the year .
The institutions to be targeted starting March 15 include Bank of America , Citibank , JP Morgan , Wells Fargo , Morgan Stanley , AIG and Goldman Sachs .
Leaders of more than 50 major unions met for two hours here March 3 to finalize plans to mobilize local unions , labor councils and community allies to descend on the big banks .
“ We ’ve already got the plans in place for 90 of those demonstrations and the response is pouring in from local unions and from local labor councils , including ones we have hardly ever heard from , ” said AFL - CIO Communications Director Denise Mitchell , when the labor leaders broke for lunch .
“ The big financial institutions created this crisis , so they should pay to restore the 8.4 million jobs lost as a result of it , ” said Richard Trumka , the federation ’s president , as he emerged from the meeting .
“ In fact , it ’s 11 million jobs that we need , the 8.4 that they destroyed plus the 2.6 needed to make up for population growth . ”
Mitchell said the demands on the banks will come down to three things : “ Stop refusing to pay your fair share , stop fighting financial reform and start lending to ordinary folks again so they can do business and create jobs . ”
The announcement of the Week of Action capped a string of labor actions around the country in the last few days including demonstrations in Evansville , Ind. , against Whirlpool , which wants to pack up and move to Mexico ; a march and rally against job cuts on Florida ’s Space Coast ; and a mass meeting for job creation in Orlando .
The Space Coast cuts , affecting everyone from Machinists union members who tool rockets to Theatrical and Stage Employees members who film takeoffs , would occur at Cape Kennedy if Congress approves President Obama ’s plan to dump the back - to - the - moon program .
Explaining why the March protests will focus on banks Damon Silver , the AFL - CIO ’s policy director , said banks not only created the crisis but “ they are the ones who can and should pay for the solution . ”
Although the AFL - CIO backs Obama ’s demand that banks repay money they got under the Troubled Assets Relief Program , Silver said stronger additional measures are needed to raise the kind of money needed for a massive federal jobs program .
The president ’s proposal would generate $ 70 billion at most , Silver said , “ but a tiny financial transactions tax would raise $ 400 billion , enough to create many jobs . ”
“ And they ca n’t use the excuse that this would drive business out of the American markets and into the overseas ones , ” Trumka said , “ because there is strong support for this type of tax in the United Kingdom , in all the European Union countries and elsewhere . ”
“ This type of tax would n’t hurt serious investors , ” Silver said , “ but would discourage reckless speculators and gamblers who buy and sell at astronomically high frequency rates to make money and run . ”
Asked by reporters whether labor leaders had talked to the Obama administration about such a tax and whether the administration would support it , Trumka said he had raised the issue and that “ it depends upon who you talk to in the administration – some support it and others are not so sure . ”
Trumka and Silver both also called for higher taxes on CEO pay .
“ We need these measures , in addition to measures already supported by the president , those in the House bill and those being called for by many of the organizations in the coalitions for financial reform , ” Silver said .
Those other measures he was referring to include establishment of a strong consumer protection agency , regulations on the “ shadow ” markets , including hedge funds , and what has been called the “ Volcker proposal ” – reinstituting laws that separate the functions of regular and commercial banks .
The GOP - run Congress , back in 1999 , passed a bill that tore down the wall between regular and commercial banking , the trading of stocks , bonds and other pieces of paper .
Democratic President Bill Clinton signed it into law .
The barrier had been erected by Congress and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt after finance industry excesses plunged the nation into the Great Depression .

Angela Merkel has warned decisive action is needed to allay market fears Germany 's parliament has approved a 22.4bn euro ( £ 19 bn ) contribution to a bail - out plan for debt - ridden Greece .
The lower house , the Bundestag , passed the bill after fiery criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel .
The upper house also endorsed it .
Greece 's 15 partners in the eurozone will lend it 80bn euros spread over three years - the IMF 30bn euros .
Later on Friday , Chancellor Merkel will join other eurozone heads of state for an emergency summit in Brussels .
They aim to finalise details of the loan package to Greece , while the G7 finance ministers are also due to discuss the Greek debt crisis and its implications for the global economy .
Concerns about Greece 's economic crisis have spread fear of contagion in global markets .
France 's Cac 40 index fell by almost 2 % and Germany 's Dax index down 1 % .
Leading Asian shares indexes had slipped overnight , with Japan 's Nikkei closing down 3.1 % .
Unable to act ?
The bill was passed by 390 votes to 72 , with 139 abstentions in the German lower house , the Bundestag .
Mrs Merkel has defended her plan , saying the EU was at stake .
She had warned that if the 27 member states did not work together on such crises , " the markets will think we 're unable to act " .
What went wrong in Greece ?
Greece 's economic reforms that led to it abandoning the drachma as its currency in favour of the euro in 2002 made it easier for the country to borrow money .
Greece went on a debt - funded spending spree , including high - profile projects such as the 2004 Athens Olympics , which went well over budget .
It was hit by the downturn , which meant it had to spend more on benefits and received less in taxes .
There were also doubts about the accuracy of its economic statistics .
Greece 's economic problems meant lenders started charging higher interest rates to lend it money and widespread tax evasion also hit the government 's coffers .
There have been demonstrations against the government 's austerity measures to deal with its 300bn euro ( £ 267bn ) debt , such as cuts to public sector pay .
Now the government is having to access a 110bn euro ( £ 95bn ; $ 146.2 bn ) bail - out package from the European Union and International Monetary Fund .
Greece 's problems have made investors nervous , which has made it more expensive for other European countries such as Portugal to borrow money .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT Mrs Merkel 's critics used the emotional Bundestag debate to criticise her handling of the crisis , saying she had been slow to act , says the BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Berlin .
The opposition Social Democrats abstained , saying the burden of the country 's contribution fell too heavily on ordinary tax payers rather than on the financial markets .
But the bill was passed as Mrs Merkel 's Christian Democratic Union and its coalition partner , the Free Democratic Party , have a comfortable majority in parliament .
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had asked the opposition to support the legislation , saying markets would " pay attention to how the help is being backed on a national level " .
The German press has labelled the country 's contribution as " the fattest cheque in history " .
Even if the legislation is approved , one group of Eurosceptic academics will challenge the decision in Germany 's highest court , our correspondent says .
Rulebook to be rewritten ?
On Thursday , Greek MPs approved drastic spending cuts in exchange for an international rescue plan , amid violent protests in Athens .

The austerity measures include pay and pension cuts for public sector workers , and tax rises .
But there is deep anger at the programme in Greece , which has seen days of occasionally violent protests outside parliament .
The French Senate has also approved France 's contribution of up to 16.8 bn euros to the aid package for Greece .
Italy 's government also adopted a decree to supply 5.6bn euros as part of its 14.8 bn aid contribution to Greece .
Germany and France have already called for the single currency 's rulebook to be rewritten - with tougher sanctions for those countries that run up big budget deficits , our correspondent adds .
Fears of contagion from Greece 's debt crisis have rocked global stock markets , with Europe 's benchmark indexes opening sharply lower on Friday after US and Asian stocks incurred major losses .

The mill , it turns out , was located in the middle of New York corn country , with an ample supply of vodka - ready apples at a farm down the road .
And the water , if not exactly the naturally filtered stuff that bubbles up through Kentucky limestone , was extraordinarily clean .
Even more luck came when , a few months later , the state of New York slashed the price for a distiller 's license from several thousand dollars to a few hundred .
A couple of years later , Tuthilltown turned out its first bottle of whiskey , and it 's been expanding its line ever since — to rum , absinthe , and white dog , as well as wheat , oat , rye , and single - malt whiskeys alongside the vodka and bourbon .
Behind the parking lot is a small field with the beginnings of a hop garden — the fruits of which will be used to make a hopped whiskey .
But Tuthilltown 's success is n't just about luck .
Like Virginia 's Copper Fox Distillery , it is able to do a viable business because it uses a few tricks to age its bourbon quickly .
For one , the whiskey goes into small , narrow barrels , which increases the surface area to volume ratio and , according to the distillers , allows them to cut the aging process in half .
Another trick is to place speakers among the stacks of barrels in the storage room and blast rap music at night — a process , they say , that gently agitates the liquid and creates a mellower flavor faster ( a few other distillers use a similar process , most notably South Korea 's Busan in its Clean No. 1 soju ) .
Jacob Beam is rolling in his grave for sure , but who knows ?
What 's exciting about Tuthilltown is that , like a craft brewer , it 's mastering traditional methods and then tweaking them , taking chances that big , old producers neither need nor want to risk .
Hopped whiskey ?
Why not ?
Oats ?
Sonic vibrations ?
Sure .
It might not work , but even the image of innovation is itself a good investment .
Of course , to coin a phrase , the proof of the pudding is in the eating .
So does Tuthilltown stand up ?
A few years ago I bought a bottle of their Four Grain Bourbon , made with 60 percent corn alongside an equal share of wheat , rye , and barley .
It tasted like Cheerios drenched in vodka — not , by the way , the worst flavor in the world , though hardly the mark of a quality whiskey .
But Erenzo & Co. seem to be getting the hang of it .
The whiskeys I sampled at the distillery still tasted young and fiery , but there was also more complexity to them .
I was particularly enamored with their white dog corn whiskey , which was surprisingly easy to drink and came with some pleasant grapefruit and floral notes .
I did n't get to sample their entire range of products , thanks to the vagaries of New York distillery laws — a tasting room can only offer products if at least 80 percent of their ingredients come from inside the state .
So the corn whiskeys were in , but the absinthe — there 's no wormwood in New York — was out .
The vodka was in , the rum was out .

An iPad pretending to be a full on hardware synth ?
Has the time come when our beloved hardware is replaced by software ?
Anybody who has used a software synth is rolling on the ground laughing now but Korg may get the last laugh .
They have released a digital version of their much - loved electribe for only 10 bucks , making us wonder how serious is this thing ?
What is it really ?
The iElectribe is a 8 voice rhythm synthesizer .
In short you can synthesize up to 8 different voices and sequence them into a maximum of 64 steps ( essentially 4 bars of 16th notes ) .
So do n’t let the default red anodized skin of an ESX fool you , it is not a sampler .
Rather the native color should have been blue for the EMX that it more closely resembles .
Beyond the 8 voices ( called parts ) , there is an effects section .
The effects can only be run one - at - a - time , but , like the synthesizer , can be animated ( motion sequenced ) to provide different effects and effect settings at different parts of the pattern .
You can , however , chose which parts and which sequences are effected .
Patterns can be copied , completely modified ( editing tool set included ) and saved .
They can be called up in any order on the fly , with or without tempo lock , in a user selectable quantization .
Therefore a performance ( pattern set ) can be laid out to put longer pieces together for more varying ideas than 8 voices would imply .
Can It Produce Quality Sounds ?
[ audio : http://djtechtools.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Techno-6-Basic.mov]
I tested it through an AK1 in Traktor as an Audio Through on an Internal Mix and the sound was so - so .
It sounds like a low bit rate song when mixed with a 320 kbps MP3 .
On the other hand , recording in GarageBand produced decent results .
The audio quality does not seem as muddy and played with a couple of AppleLoops it was fun to grow the same pattern into something more useful .
Dropped into a higher end DAW , the patterns could definitely be used professionally ( especially compared to some of the loop packs available out there … ) .
How good are the preset patterns ?
I would rate the presets ( 64 in total ) as examples more than workable patterns .
They can be used to give you an idea of how different parts could be broken down and stay within a genre .
The differences between say two minimal patterns is too vast to have a good flow between the two for use in a performance .
But by copying one to a blank memory slot ( there are 64 blank slots ) modifying it , then copying it again to the next blank slot , modifying it , etc , would allow you to build a performance set to make a complete “ song ” ( the iElectrible does not have its hardware cousin ’s song function ) .
The only drawback is that the pattern select feature that lends itself well to performances only allows selection of the first 64 patterns , so you will need to move some of the factory presets into blank slots to get the full benefit of the feature .
The other 32 memory slots contain “ templates ” of different genres ( you can overwrite any of the presets to give yourself more slots ) .
These are interesting in that you get a pre-biased canvas for ideas .
The parts in the template that are already laid out tend to be mostly drum parts so that you can build a bass and / or melody over it .
Of course , you can tweak and do what you want to the drum part too ( make minimal - hardcore ? yeah ) .
Can you actually play this thing ?
Load a pattern , mute all but the kick , press play , wait 4 bars , bring in the HH and snare , wait 4 bars , bring in the bass , wait 4 bars and bring in the melody , wait 4 bars and drop the bass while tweaking the melody part on the mod and pitch , bring back the bass , start throwing some effect to the bass and melody , drop all the drum parts and the bass , more effects , switch pattern , etc .
Yeah , you can play it .
The feel of the controls during playback is maybe one of things that is questionable ( age old tactile screen thang ) .
For those with a lot of DAW experience , you will quickly want to switch the knob feel to linear from the default rotary .
Now you touch the control and drag up and down for changes .
For large wholesale changes the feel is quite good , but to move to a precise setting on the fly is not intuitive .
So what is good for ?
As a production tool , it can be used to sketch in a background that you will build from .
As a performance tool it can be used to do some tricks and interludes .
But I feel the real strength of the app is as a mobile idea sketchpad .
Want to see if that little groove playing in your head would sound good to a hammering DnB drum line or if that glitch noise that you think would drop in great syncopated to a soft throbbing tweet ?
Here is a tool in you back pack that will give you that open avenue of creative possibility .
Should I be running out to buy this ?
If you do n’t already have an iPad , no .
But if you do this is a really cool app for anybody who has used an Electribe and can appreciate how smooth of an idea sketchpad it is , or an Electribe noob who would like to explore some new possibilities .

The Labour Party 's New Media Campaigns Spokesperson and candidate for Bristol East is in hot water this morning after Tweeting postal vote results last night .
Kerry McCarthy 's post was immediately re-tweeted by a Tory blogger with the suggestion that ' someone call the police ' .
Revealing postal votes could have an impact on voting intentions on the day and is therefore a breach of electoral law .
Avon and Somerset Police have been informed and are investigating .
McCarthy quickly deleted the Tweet and apologised .
She could face six months in jail if prosecuted and found guilty .
Postal votes are opened in the presence of candidates ' agents .
McCarthy insisted the numbers she published were a straw poll , not an official count .
She posted an apology on her blog and said it was a thoughtless thing to do and " not appropriate to put such information in the public domain " - a nice understatement .
She also said that it would be illegal for anyone to re-post the content of her original post - which is now widely available online .
She said : " I am not the first person to make such a mistake , and I 'm sure I wo n't be the last , but as you can imagine , I 'm cross with myself .
Tweet in haste , repent at leisure .... "
Anyone wishing to keep an eye out for her next mistake can access her Twitter feed here .
Feel free to comment on this article but please do not repost the results - they are widely available but I do n't want to follow Kerry to chokey . ®
It was very classy of the Capitals fans at the Verizon Center last Friday to give the Canadian anthem a huge cheer .
Some Montreal fans at the Bell could learn from their respectful manners .
When it has gotten to the point where the public address in Montreal has to list the names of Gomez , Gill and Gionta to quiet the booing problem , then it has gotten a little extreme .
I addressed this all in a post last week and may have gotten a few facts off .
In that regard , I 'll ask a simple question in pardon of my ignorance :
Is it just me , or can it be possible that the booing comes over loader on the TSN , HNIC and Versus broadcasts than it does on RDS ?
I 'll admit that my hearing has been electric guitar damaged over the years , but I strain to hear the booing , and can not tell much .
I hear something I have trouble disiphering that tells me the numbers doing it can't be many .
Respectfully , I 'd just like to know if I am that far off , need a hearing aid , or a better set of TV speakers .
In the article , I closed the comment section because I sensed that the usual comraderie and chatter of this site might turn ugly .
Seeing as I was away that day and not able to monitor what I feared would turn into verbal sparring , I closed shop on that one .
In doing so , I asked that I instead be e-mailed with concerns about the post and that perhaps I would publish those I felt had a well rounded grip on the subject .
After a day or two , I had received a bunch of notes , more than one taking me to task on different matters .
Most were kind , a few questioning , several were thankful and a couple downright ignorant .
Finally I came across one that was well - rounded enough to share .
It was a nice long letter from an American Habs fan named Don in Texas , who is naturally not comfortable with this .
Don has travelled and lived in many parts of America , proudly displaying his CH colours wherever he goes , and I understand what he 's getting at when he expresses his sentiments .
In Don 's comments , he notes the changing demographics of Habs fans at the Bell , without actually pointing that facet out .
I agree with him to an extent .
Through time , fans that used to fill the Forum dressed in suits , ties and fedoras have been replaced by raving hockey lunatics .
It makes for a great game atmosphere , until it gets into the booing of anthems and players , sometimes on the home team too .
Here are the contents of this gentleman 's letter , edited to remove some personal information , but with the gist of his sentiments remaining .
I 'll accept comments on this one , though anyone taking the writer to task for his sentiments in the comments section will have those words removed .
Starting today , Google Maps for mobile has a few new ways to help you and your friends quickly get to where you ’re going whether you ’re on 4 wheels or 2 ( or maybe even 3 ) .
With Google Maps 4.2 for Android you can now get biking directions on the go , start Navigation from your Home screen , share places with friends , and more .
Biking directions
Since launching biking directions on desktop Google Maps , we ’ve wanted to get you biking directions , lanes , and trails on your phone too .
Just in time for National Bike Month , select the bike icon when getting directions to get an optimal bicycling route in the U.S.
If you ’re in the mood for a more scenic ride , you ’ll also see the Bicycling layer on the map which shows dedicated bike - only trails ( dark green ) , roads with bike lanes ( light green ) , or roads that are good for biking but lack a dedicated lane ( dashed green ) .
You can always turn on this layer from the Layers menu to pick your own route .
Add in the Labs ’ Terrain layer , and you can decide to either climb or avoid that big hill on the way home !
Google Navigation shortcut
If you ’re driving instead of riding , we wanted to make it easier and faster for you to get on the road with Google Maps Navigation as soon as you ’re ready .
With the new Navigation shortcut , you can pick a destination and be on your way with as little as 2 taps of your finger .
Select the “ Navigation ” icon in your phone ’s app launcher to get the new destination selection view .
Then , speak or type your destination , pick one from your contacts , choose a starred place , or select a recent destination .
Navigation will begin and you ’re good to go .
Make it even easier on yourself by adding the Navigation icon right on your Home screen .
Sharing
Google Maps
Once you figure out where you ’re going , why not get some friends to meet you there ?
From any search results page , choose to “ Share this place ” to send that place ’s info , such as its address and phone number , to whomever you like .
If you want to meet someone on a street corner or gather friends at an outdoor concert , you can also send an exact location from the map -- even a snapshot of your current location .
Just use the share option after selecting a point on the map , your “ My Location ” blue dot , or yourself in Latitude if it ’s enabled .
Whether you ’re sharing a place or a location , you ’ll be able to send it to small groups via an email or text message or send it widely with apps like Google Buzz , Facebook , or Twitter .

Five lions and a hyena have died after eating bait laced with poison in southern Kenya , wildlife advocates say .
Found on a community - owned ranch near a major national park , a bloody bucket streaked with purple stains suggests the animals were killed with a controversial pesticide that 's become a conservationist 's nightmare .
It 's believed Maasai men , who live on the ranch and are traditionally nomadic herders , are responsible for the lion and hyena deaths .
At least one Maasai herder has been arrested in connection with the crimes , according to Paula Kahumbu , head of the Nairobi , Kenya - based conservation group WildlifeDirect .
In southern Kenya months of drought have heightened long - standing tensions between wild predators and Maasai people .
As arid conditions make food and water harder to obtain , livestock become ever more valuable to both their owners — and to neighboring predators .
The poisoning occurred on April 2 at the Olgulului Group Ranch near Amboseli National Park , Kahumbu said .
Kahumbu received the news from the Kenya Wildlife Service , which had been alerted by a resident of the ranch , where lions were said to have killed two cows several days earlier .
The luridly stained bucket , she said , probably contained the laced bait .
The type of bait , though is unknown , as no trace of it remained .
( WildlifeDirect receives some funding from the National Geographic Society , which owns National Geographic News . )
Kahumbu said test results had not yet arrived but that she believes the pesticide Furadan was used in the poisonings .
Sold by Philadelphia - based FMC Corporation , Furadan is a trade name for carbofuran , a highly toxic , odorless pesticide , which comes in purple granules .
Though FMC maintains that Furadan is safe if used properly , the company stopped selling the substance in Kenya and neighboring Uganda and Tanzania after numerous reports emerged in 2008 that herders were using the pesticide to kill lions and other large predators .
In Kenya the company quickly launched a buyback program .
But two years later , conservationists say Furadan lingers on some store shelves .
" Although you can't find Furadan in the main shops , I do n't think they withdrew it from some of the main outlying areas , " Kahumbu said .
" We know that some dealers are selling it by the spoonful . "
Ban Furadan ?
Conservationists are pressing the Kenyan government to ban Furadan , because they do n't believe the government has the resources to regulate its use .
Many farmers see the pesticide as a way to kill birds , rats , dogs , and large predators .
" The issue is really whether a country has the capacity to educate its people to handle this safely , " said Oliver Nasirwa , the Kenya - waterbirds officer for Wetlands International .
" That 's the problem for Kenya and most developing countries . "
It seems to be a problem in developed countries too .
In 2006 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency banned the pesticide after ruling that Furadan posed an unreasonable risk to the environment , particularly birds .
Carbofuran is also banned throughout Europe .
" Communities Are Pissed Off "
Olgulului Group Ranch has been part of an experimental program by which local Maasai herders are reimbursed if lions or other predators kill livestock such as cattle , for which the payment can equal about U.S. $ 200 a head .
( Related : Maasailand lions fund . )
That program has struggled during the drought as Maasai herders in the area grew more intolerant of livestock losses , even with the compensation program in place .
" Apparently the communities are pissed off , " WildlifeDirect 's Kahumbu said .
" They 're not getting what they think is the real value through the compensation scheme , " which she noted is technically a " consolation " program .
" The full value of the lost animal is not replaced , but a token amount is given to say , Sorry for your loss . "
Compensation projects generally have community support and are still among the few viable options for protecting wildlife from aggrieved livestock owners , Kahumbu said .

As someone who has been moderating comments for over two years ( and using the internet for about 17 ) , I 've seen a lot of internet slang fads come and go .
But there are some phrases , it seems , that just wo n't die :
I 'm not going to go so far as to say these phrases should be outright banned ( mostly because that never works ) nor am I going to deny using any of these phrases at one point or another ( everyone has at some point , I 'm sure ) , but lately it seems like it 's getting harder and harder not to feel slightly irritated when coming across one of the following phrases , which seem to have overstayed their welcome by at least four years :
5. " DIAF / Die In A Fire . "
This is one of those expressions that people throw out in order to let everyone know just how much they HATE somebody , as dying in a fire is perhaps one of the worst possible ways to die .
I really , really hate this expression .
I 've always hated this expression .
How did this expression ever get popular ?
It 's one of those things that is strictly internet - only : if you ever went to some random party and pointed to another human being and said , " That 's Alan .
I hope he dies in a fire , " everyone would look at you like you were Patrick Bateman in a dress and then whisper , " That was a bit much , right ? " as soon as you hopped off to pet a kitten or talk about American Idol or what have you .
And even if you do n't agree with my personal distaste for the phrase ( and wish that I , too , would DIAF ) , you have to at least admit that the phrase is really , really tired .
It 's so old and overdone at this point that it 's akin to saying " get bent " or " drop dead " or " stick a rubber hose up your nose " or what have you .
I 'm not telling you you can't hate people , internet .
God knows I would n't take that away from you .
But when your go - to attack phrase is as overused at this one , it probably needs to die , too , in whatever horrible way you can imagine it to .

4. FAIL : " Fail , " as a concept , can be fun .
Look at FailBlog !
You can easily laugh at whatever dumb / funny stuff gets thrown up there , because it is , in fact , a failure of sorts , but one that finds success in being awful / unusual , and therefore actually ends up winning in some bizarro Bad News Bears kind of way .
But " fail " has replaced " awesome " as the word that everyone needs to pull back on by roughly 9000 % .
Your inability to finish breakfast at the diner last week was not a " Pancake Fail . "
Your mascara getting in your hair is not a " Cosmetics Fail . "
Fail is catchy and easy to use , which makes it the - ista of internetisms , attached to everything to make it conversationally trendy .
You do n't have to give it up completely , but if you 're using FAIL ! to scold the government and FAIL !
to mock your cat 's inability to piss in the litter box and FAIL !
to recall that time you ate a paper clip , the phrase itself kind of loses a bit of power , does n't it ?
3. " THIS . "
We have all done THIS .
This !
THIS THIS THIS !
SO MUCH THIS !
THIS !!!!
THIS THIS !
It 's a more enthusiastic way to say , " Yes , I agree , you 've completely captured my thoughts on this subject and expressed them in a way I could n't quite express myself .
Thank you , fellow internet user .
You are correct , and I appreciate your input . "
And that 's fine .
I get that .
It 's a relief , sometimes , to see that someone has perfectly put together the thoughts that are floating around in your brain .
But lately it seems that " THIS " has taken on a life of its own .
People tend to get annoyed in forums when people pipe in with " me , too ! " or " I totally agree ! " but somehow , " THIS " gets a pass , because it 's more definitive , and currently quite popular as an internet tool of expression .
But " THIS " can actually be detrimental to a conversation , especially when the THIS !
poster only posts that one word , and nothing else .
Yeah , you agree , but why ?
For what reasons ?
Why is whatever this comment is so very THIS to you ?
Why can't it be THAT ?
It 's one of those things that 's fine in moderation , but used too often , the very emphasis it 's supposed to provide — that whatever comment it follows is a definitive statement or the truth , end of story , thanks for playing , have a nice day — becomes watered down and meaningless .

2. TL ; DR / " Too long ; did n't read . "
People are still doing this !
In 2010 !
( They are also using too many exclamation points !
And by they , I mean me !
THIS ! Epic Fail ! )
I have no idea why this still exists .
If something on the internet is too long for you to read , I 'm sorry .
Life is hard .
Go to Twitter .
1. " Wow ... just , wow . "
NO , JUST NO .
This is maybe the most annoying phrase in internet history .
" Wow ... just wow , " is one of the laziest remarks you 'll see in any comment section , because it requires no thought whatsoever while implying that the reader does , in fact , have several thoughts on whatever brought them to the brink of implied speechlessness .
It is never " wow , just wow . "
That phrase holds a million reactions , all watered down into a cliche , and it 's unfortunate , in that some of the best emotional reactions to seriously weird / insane / disturbing / amazing things on the internet could be written in place of this tired , tired , tired remark , and they are n't .
If something has moved you to the point where you have no words , fine .
But do n't throw out three overused words to express it .
If you 're able to hit your keys , go beyond " wow , just wow , " and explain why you 're so amazed / horrified / blown away by whatever it is you just read / saw .
Either that , or skip to another site and catch the latest trend that 's suddenly bordering on overexposure by posting a picture of someone you want to have sex with alongside the caption " UNF , " which the Urban Dictionary defines as the " Universal Noise of Fucking . "

So there you have it .
Like I said earlier , we 've all done these things .
We 'll all , myself included , probably do these things again , millions of times .
But I do n't think it would hurt to consider , at the very least , pulling back on a few of these phrases , at least for a little while .
All requests to STFU , DIAF , tell me things are full of win , TL ; DR , or a total fail , yell THIS !

Video footage of Mildred — the world 's only surfing sheep — heading out to sea to catch some waves is taking the internet by storm .
More than 50,000 web surfers have flocked to get a glimpse of the six - year - old .
In the footage of her unprecedented surf at St. Agnes in Cornwall the anything but sheepish ewe is seen being helped on to her board by three surfers in wetsuits before being towed out to sea .
As the waves carry her back to shore she uses her skill and clever footwork to keep the board steady and straight — before leaping on to the sand .
But for her legions of admirers all is not quite as it seems - the film is actually a computer generated viral designed as a publicity stunt for a British clothing firm .

Strong Negative Feedback from the Latest CERES Radiation Budget Measurements
Over the Global Oceans
By Dr. Roy W. Spencer , Ph. D .
Arguably the single most important scientific issue – and unresolved question – in the global warming debate is climate sensitivity .
Will increasing carbon dioxide cause warming that is so small that it can be safely ignored ( low climate sensitivity ) ?
Or will it cause a global warming Armageddon ( high climate sensitivity ) ?
The answer depends upon the net radiative feedback : the rate at which the Earth loses extra radiant energy with warming .
Climate sensitivity is mostly determined by changes in clouds and water vapor in response to the small , direct warming influence from ( for instance ) increasing carbon dioxide concentrations .
This can be estimated from global , satellite - based measurements of natural climate variations in ( 1 ) Earth ’s radiation budget , and ( 2 ) tropospheric temperatures .
These estimates are mostly constrained by the availability of the first measurement : the best calibrated radiation budget data comes from the NASA CERES instruments , with data available for 9.5 years from the Terra satellite , and 7 years from the Aqua satellite .
Both datasets now extend through September of 2009 .
I ’ve been slicing and dicing the data different ways , and here I will present 7 years of results for the global ( 60N to 60S ) oceans from NASA ’s Aqua satellite .
The following plot shows 7 years of monthly variations in the Earth ’s net radiation ( reflected solar shortwave [ SW ] plus emitted infrared longwave [ LW ] ) compared to similarly averaged tropospheric temperature from AMSU channel 5 .
Simple linear regression yields a net feedback factor of 5.8 Watts per sq. meter per degree C.
If this was the feedback operating with global warming , then it would amount to only 0.6 deg .
C of human - caused warming by late in this century .
( Use of sea surface temperatures instead of tropospheric temperatures yields a value of over 11 ) .
Since we have already experienced 0.6 deg .
C in the last 100 years , it would also mean that most of our current global warmth is natural , not anthropogenic .
But , as we show in our new paper ( in press ) in the Journal of Geophysical Research , these feedbacks can not be estimated through simple linear regression on satellite data , which will almost always result in an underestimate of the net feedback , and thus an overestimate of climate sensitivity .
Without going into the detailed justification , we have found that the most robust method for feedback estimation is to compute the month - to - month slopes ( seen as the line segments in the above graph ) , and sort them from the largest 1 - month temperature changes to the smallest ( ignoring the distinction between warming and cooling ) .
The following plot shows , from left to right , the cumulative average line slope from the largest temperature changes to the smaller ones .
This average is seen to be close to 10 for the largest month - to - month temperature changes , then settling to a value around 6 after averaging of many months together .
( Note that the full period of record is not used : only monthly temperature changes greater than 0.03 deg .
C were included .
Also , it is mostly coincidence that the two methods give about the same value . )
A net feedback of 6 operating on the warming caused by a doubling of atmospheric CO2 late in this century would correspond to only about 0.5 deg .
C of warming .
This is well below the 3.0 deg .
C best estimate of the IPCC , and even below the lower limit of 1.5 deg .
C of warming that the IPCC claims to be 90 % certain of .
How Does this Compare to the IPCC Climate Models ?
In comparison , we find that none of the 17 IPCC climate models ( those that have sufficient data to do the same calculations ) exhibit this level of negative feedback when similar statistics are computed from output of either their 20th Century simulations , or their increasing - CO2 simulations .
Those model - based values range from around 2 to a little over 4 .
These results suggest that the sensitivity of the real climate system is less than that exhibited by ANY of the IPCC climate models .
This will end up being a serious problem for global warming predictions .
You see , while modelers claim that the models do a reasonably good job of reproducing the average behavior of the climate system , it is n’t the average behavior we are interested in .
It is how the average behavior will CHANGE .
And the above results show that not one of the IPCC climate models behaves like the real climate system does when it comes to feedbacks during interannual climate variations … and feedbacks are what determine how serious manmade global warming will be .

CLEVELAND , Ohio --
A hard - fought effort to rewrite the Cleveland teachers contract places the district in the thick of a nationwide challenge to entrenched unions and their rights .
School systems across the country are pressing for more flexibility in managing buildings and assigning teachers .
Unions , on their heels and facing layoffs in a bleak economy , have given ground in stunning ways .
But in Cleveland , with the teachers ' existing contract set to expire June 30 , negotiations have essentially broken down .
The stalemate may jeopardize an " academic transformation plan " that Chief Executive Officer Eugene Sanders is to launch this fall .
Nearly 550 teacher layoffs , which could be avoided if the union agrees to salary concessions , would swell classes to as many as 45 students and make the plan difficult to execute , Sanders has acknowledged .
The national agenda is simple : Evaluate teachers based on test scores , swiftly fire those who can't cut it , fill positions on merit , not seniority , and put charter - school operators in control of buildings .
Encouragement and financial incentives come from an unlikely source : a Democratic president who won office with backing from teachers unions .
The reforms remain too new to have built much of a track record .
But here are some examples :
* In Philadelphia , a new contract allows principals to choose their teachers from a pool of applicants , rather than go by seniority .
Operators brought in to turn around failing schools will pick their teachers with input from the community .
* Denver began piloting a pay - for - performance system in 1999 and expanded it to the rest of the district in 2005 .
Teachers can receive raises and bonuses for getting good evaluations , meeting student - achievement goals and working in hard - to - staff schools or subjects .
* A tentative contract would allow Washington , D.C. , school leaders to decide which teachers are laid off when buildings are shut down for financial reasons or declining enrollment .
( In return , teacher pay would rise by more than 20 percent by 2012 . )
Sanders wants to gut seniority rights , clean house at failing schools , adopt data - driven evaluation , institute longer work days and years and welcome charters to be partners .
He also has asked for pay cuts and other economic concessions .
Cleveland Teachers Union leaders say they have agreed to and even initiated progressive reforms in the past .
They insist they are willing to go further but believe Sanders does n't want to bargain with those who work most closely with students .
" We get absolutely no respect from this district for teachers , " union President David Quolke said .
" When you do n't respect teachers , you do n't respect children . "
What a difference three years make .
When the present agreement was signed in 2007 , Sanders toasted it as a landmark in collective bargaining , remarkable for shared emphasis on reducing class size and closing the achievement gap in the earliest grades .
Now he sneers at what he calls incremental improvement , plodding labor - management committees and pointless choruses of " Kumbaya . "
" As long as nearly half of our graduates leave our schools without diplomas in their hands , systemic change is no longer a negotiable item in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District -- it is a moral imperative , " Sanders said .
Cleveland contract restrictive , critics say
The existing contract book is only the width of a folded road map , but it 's an inch thick , and , critics say , weighted down with impediments to education .
Its layers , not atypical for a large urban system , give teachers a voice in matters as piddling as the location of the vending machines they use .
Cleveland teachers enjoy one of the shortest workdays among large U.S. school districts -- 6 hours and 40 minutes , including 40 minutes for lunch and at least an hour of planning or " unassigned " time -- according to the National Council on Teacher Quality .
The union also has negotiated one of the more generous helpings of sick and personal days .
The Thomas B. Fordham Institute , which sponsors charter schools in Ohio , rated the Cleveland union 's 2000 - 03 contract as the second - most restrictive among those in the nation 's 50 largest school districts .
The institute has not rated the current agreement , but Cleveland 's remains stifling , said Terry Ryan , a Dayton - based Fordham official who analyzed the document for The Plain Dealer .
He predicts the provisions will paralyze the transformation plan .
" Trying to reform education under the constraints of the district 's current collective bargaining agreement is akin to trying to do health - care reform without upsetting doctors , patients or the insurance companies , " Ryan said in an e-mail .
" The space for real change is marginal . "
The transformation plan , approved by the school board in March , provides for customized school - by - school reform , a broader choice of school options for families and a high level of accountability for all employees .
Sanders , who needs agreement from the union on many of his reform strategies , listed seniority and evaluations as top contract issues in a letter he sent to school benefactors on May 11 .
He said the district , because of its tight budget , also needs a " rational " increase in the size of classes for preschool through third grade .
The present agreement caps classes at 20 .
Another issue is each teacher 's right to unilaterally remove persistently disruptive students .
Teachers can remove as many as three students at a time , banishing them for up to five daily periods or two full days .
Sanders ' letter says evicting students without " intervention " is " simply wrong and consigns a lot of students to academic failure . "
" This kind of thinking , which puts the interest of the adult above the interest of the child , too often results in a child 's slide toward dropping out , and this has to change , " he wrote .
Union says contract deters abuses
Cleveland Teachers Union leaders say the contract guards against abuses by management and that many , if not most , teachers go far above and beyond its requirements .
For example , union officials say teachers are in schools well before and after the official workday , though the contract requires only that they be there 10 minutes longer than their students .
Michelle Rzucidlo - Rupright , a teacher at Anton Grdina Elementary School , said she recently traveled at night to a homeless shelter to speak with a mother about her son 's special - education plan .
And she and other teachers say they spend hundreds or thousands of dollars of their own money each year on school supplies and necessities like coats and shoes for needy students .
Teachers contacted by e-mail said they are all for getting rid of incompetent colleagues , but they defended seniority and extolled the benefits of experience .
One teacher said she was reluctant to give subjective - minded principals too much power over her evaluation or pay .
" There are plenty of instances where a teacher is well - liked one year and disliked the following year when there has been a change in administration , " said the teacher , who asked to remain anonymous out of fear for her job .
Cleveland teachers say they are willing to take cues from their national leader , American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten .
Weingarten visited Cleveland in January , trying to patch up the widening rift between Sanders and Quolke .
Cleveland was Weingarten 's first stop following a speech in which she pledged significant cooperation from the AFT on reform .
She expressed support for more - thorough evaluation of teachers and speedier removal of those who are unfit , provided that districts ensure due process and a fair opportunity to improve performance .
CTU leaders say the critics of the Cleveland agreement ignore additions such as " peer assistance and review , " a new mentoring program proposed by the union .
It gives flailing teachers a second chance but can lead to dismissal within a year if they do n't improve .
In the first round of results , the school board recently fired four teachers on the recommendation of their colleagues and administrators .
Two other teachers retired , one took disability and 10 will be monitored for another year , said Quolke .
The union also has signed separate memorandums for district " innovation schools , " allowing the schools to hire from the outside and set longer workdays and school years .
Officers say they are willing to discuss expanding that flexibility to other schools , though they caution that more work will mean more pay .
Pressure strong to institute reforms
Like other districts facing financial and academic crises , Cleveland faces external pressure to go far with reform .
President Barack Obama 's Race to the Top program is dangling millions of dollars in front of states and school systems that agree to use student data to assign , fire and determine pay for teachers .
As part of Ohio 's application , Cleveland and its teachers have agreed to discuss most of those principles .
They opted out of the merit - pay provision .
Cleveland officials also are hearing from the Cleveland and George Gund foundations , faithful financial backers who ideally would like to see the teachers ' contract started anew with a single sheet of paper .
Foundation representatives openly lobby to weaken seniority and give principals more authority to determine who teaches in their buildings .
" The most important element in an organization is people , " said Helen Williams , who oversees education programs for the Cleveland Foundation .
" If you do n't have the right people in place , you 're not going to get different results . "
Even when urban teachers unions agree to reform , do n't expect students ' test scores to surge , said Adam Urbanski , who has served as president of the Rochester Federation of Teachers for nearly 30 years .
While poor children clearly can learn , staggering numbers of them overwhelm classrooms with learning deficits , illness and other handicaps , he said .
Urbanski , head of the national Teachers Union Reform Network , jumped out way ahead of the change curve in the mid- to late 1980s .
He said his seizing of the initiative caused a Rochester superintendent to accuse him of meddling in management affairs and his union members to howl over what they viewed as collusion .
The Rochester union long ago negotiated a peer - review program that leads to dismissal of 8 percent to 12 percent of new teachers every year .
Parents get a say in teacher evaluations .
The union is moving to give principals more flexibility in determining working conditions .
After all the compromise , test scores are up only slightly , Urbanski said .
Still , he does n't think his efforts were wasted .
" We face long odds if we work together , " he said .
" We are dead in the water if we do n't . "
Finding Noah's Ark : Hong Kong Filmmaker Claims to Have Found Biblical Treasure Christian filmmaker claims to have found pieces of Noah 's Ark on Mount Ararat .
April 28 , 2010  --
A new claim by an evangelical Christian filmmaker and Turkish scientists that Noah's Ark has been found encased in ice on Mount Ararat has been met with equal parts excitement and skepticism .
Yeung Wing - Cheung of Hong Kong said he is " 99 percent " sure the wooden structure he filmed along with Turkish scientists and archeologists is the remnants of the famed ark God instructed Noah to build to save himself and the world 's animals from an epic flood .
" We are not saying that we are 100 percent certain that what we found is Noah 's Ark .
No one has ever seen the ark , no one knows what it looks like , " Yeung said .
" We are only 99 percent certain that it is Noah 's Ark based on historical accounts , including the Bible and local beliefs of the people in the area , as well as carbon dating . "
It would be a discovery for the ages .
But skeptics are already questioning Yeung 's find , especially since he refuses to say exactly where he found the supposed ark with its wooden chambers still intact .
" I 'm not quite 99.9 percent sure it 's Noah 's Ark , but they 've got something , " George Washington University 's Eric Cline told " Good Morning America . "
" I 'm waiting for them to convince me . "
He suggested it could even be a very old shepherd 's hut .
" I would want to first of all try to figure out their data , verify it , " he said .
Even though the precise location of the latest find has been kept secret , Cline said Yeung and his scientists would need to " parachute in " a large team of independent experts and archaeologists to study the wood and surrounding areas .
" In terms of Noah 's Ark , I would have suspected it would have perished long ago , " he said .
" The wood should just have disintegrated . "
Cline said that if Noah 's Ark had come to rest atop a remote mountain , as the Bible suggests , it 's reasonable that he would have dismantled his ship to use the wood for shelter .
" Instead of Noah 's Ark , I would be looking for Noah 's first house or something like that , " he said .
Filmmaker Appeals for Help Verifying Ark Discovery , Plans to Go Back for More
Yeung said he filmed inside the structure for about an hour .
He brought back samples that were later tested in Iran .
They say the wood has been tested and carbon dates to around the time Noah was afloat .
Yeung said the Turkish scientists told him there has never been any evidence of human settlement on top of the mountain .
" We heard from the people living near the mountain that there are remains of a wooden boat on top of the mountain , " Yeung said .
" Some of them said they have seen it but we were the first to bring back video of these wooden remains . "
Mount Ararat has long been the favored theory for the ark 's final resting place .
At 2 ½ miles up , Yeung 's video shows straw lying on the structure 's floor .
" We are sure , " one Turkish scientist said with the help of a translator , " these parts belong to the ship of Noah . "
For centuries , every few years people have claimed to have found Noah 's Ark .
In 2006 , American Christians claimed to have found a rock formation that resembles the ark very close to Yeung 's site .
" I 'm waiting for them to convince me , " Cline said .
" But who knows ?
Stranger things have happened . "
Yeung got involved with the project in 2004 .
He said he used three cameramen .
The research and the trip to Mount Ararat was financed by his Christian organization , but he declined to say how much was shelled out .
Yeung said he plans to go back to the site again , but first will appeal to scientists throughout the world to examine their findings .
These are the priorities of OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS .
" Democrats are still committed to their out - of - control spending spree , " Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , the Republican leader , said Thursday .
And the $ 60 billion more for a incoherent , murderous war where NO ONE , not even you , knows why the fuck we 're even there is not out - of control spending ?
" It is already a deep - seated fear in Afghanistan that the United States will abandon the region , " Mr. Levin said .
Well , Senator Levin , what about the deep - seated fears of our millions of unemployed ?
Hmmmmmm ???
Senator Levin ( in other words ) :
Why , they can go fuck themselves .
But thank you for asking .
How can we take care of the deep - seated fears of our citizens when the Afghans have deep - seated fears at the same time ?
Go figure .
Azureus Rising is a proof of concept developed by the San Diego production company Black Sun Entertainment .
We know very little about them other than the fact they created a pretty epic piece in hopes of fleshing it out into a feature film trilogy .
Independently , I might add .
The basic premise thus far involves a “ heroic freedom fighter ” pitted against a mecha-scorpion .
We are n’t entirely sure about his motivations but he definitely has some impressive talents navigating his way through the hyper futuristic metropolis he inhabits .
Motionographer ’s
Harm got a little bit more info from the director , David Weinstein , when he asked him about how much story can be crammed into 5 minutes .
A note we pulled , as it turns out , from the Q&A from Black Sun Entertainment ’s site and not from conversation with the director .
That ’s the thing .
With 5 minutes — how much story can you really get ?
I knew I could not get a emotional reaction with only 5 minutes of screen time .
There ’s no time to set up the characters so you feel like you can relate to them , and then watch how they handle and react to the events that unfold around them .
For me story is about showing change .
The change in a character — or the changes in the world and the hero ’s impact on those transformations .
So instead of trying to half ass my story into a 5 minute short film , I opt to make a exciting visual display of the world and the character in action .
The 5 minutes do fly by rather fast , but in a good way .
We look forward to seeing more from Black Sun Entertainment and the budding saga of Azureus .
A wind turbine that uses boundary layers instead of blades to generate power has been patented by Solar Aero , a New Hampshire based not - for - profit scientific research organization .
Modeled on the 1913 Tesla steam turbine , the Fuller turbine is virtually silent and completely enclosed , which avoids many of the drawbacks of bladed turbines such as noise , radar interference , visual pollution and wildlife injuries .
Solar Aero's Howard Fuller says the principal of operation is roughly the same as for the Tesla steam turbine .
" Closely - spaced discs trap the motive fluid molecules ( in this case air ) in a laminar flow adjacent to the disc surface .
This provides aerodynamic drag , which imparts force to the disc surface .
By using multiple discs , the turbine then provides considerable torque to accelerate the rotation of the central driveshaft , which is directly coupled to an alternator , typically located at the base of a tower , or alternatively co-located on a rooftop . "
The turbine is likely to have a cut - in speed of about 3.5 knots and optimum speed is about 20 knots and near transparency to radar microwave transmissions can be achieved with proper construction materials and techniques .
Although currently only in pre-prototype stage , it is anticipated that units would be available in different sizes .
The smallest unit would be likely to produce about 5 kW at 15 knots .
Solar Aero expects costs to be comparable to coal - fired power generation - around $ 0.05 / kWh .
When used in conjunction with a suitable storage device , this should provide reliable , inexpensive power in either residential or commercial applications .
Maintenance costs should be less than for bladed turbines .
As the up - tower turbine is supported solely on zero maintenance magnetic bearings , there will be no friction to impede acceleration and no routine lubrication required .
Solar Aero is currently completing a full scale prototype .
The design will be available for worldwide production licensing following testing .
Contact Solar Aero for further information .
New Scientist has a barrage of articles on “ denialism ” , including one from DeSmog Blog misinformer Richard Littlemore , who runs with the tired old comparisons of today ’s skeptical public to tobacco industry campaigns .
He bashes what he calls “ manufactured doubt ” while at the same time ignoring the billions poured into the climate industry , including the funding he and his namesake publisher ( Hoggan and Associates PR firm , who run DeSmog Blog ) receives from that industry .
It ’s quite the sanctioned hatefest going on there .
It is truly sad that like Scientific American , New Scientist has become nothing more that a political science mouthpiece , and a shell of its former self .
Here ’s links to all the New Scientist articles on “ denial ” .
They did include one article from Michael Fitzpatrick that is a feeble attempt at balance , but even it too strays into the ugly territory of comparing climate skeptics with AIDS deniers .

Baghdad , Iraq ( CNN ) --
A recount of votes in the Iraqi election found no change in seat allocation for any of the blocs in the most populous province , Baghdad , officials said Sunday .
That is a blow to Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , who claimed there was election fraud and won a court appeal for the recount after his coalition came in second by two seats .
Many international observers , however , described the March 7 elections as fair .
Saad al - Rawi , commissioner of the Independent High Electoral Commission , said the recount of Baghdad votes has been completed .
The province is allowed 68 seats out of 325 in Iraq 's parliament .
Qassim Al - Aboudi , another IHEC commissioner , told reporters Sunday there was a minor difference in the number of votes , but not enough to affect the results for Baghdad province .
It did not exceed 3,000 votes , he said .
More than two months after the balloting , there has been no clear winner , and the final results in each of Iraq 's 18 provinces need to be certified in federal court before the parliament can be seated .
Former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's mainly secular al - Iraqia won a narrow victory with 91 seats , while al - Maliki 's predominantly Shiite State of Law coalition won 89 .
To form a government , a 163 - seat majority is needed .
Critics of al - Maliki say he has been wrangling to chip away at Allawi's lead by pursuing the recount and forming a coalition with the rival Iraqi National Alliance , a coalition of Shiite parties .
That merger would form a bloc with 159 seats , four seats away from having the majority they would need to form a government .
But Allawi's bloc maintains that it has the right to try to put together a Cabinet first because it won the election .
Iraq has been torn by Shiite and Sunni tensions for years .
And the re-emergence of a united Shiite alliance , the same one that has ruled the country since 2005 , could stoke sectarian tensions , especially if the Sunni Arab minority feels that it is not being represented .
Allawi's bloc , meanwhile , has had much support from the Sunni community .
Western and Iraqi officials , including Allawi , have said that Iraq 's next government must be inclusive and representative or the consequence may be violence .
Sunni Arabs largely boycotted the 2005 elections , leading to a Shiite - led government which left the once - ruling Sunni minority feeling alienated .
That was a factor driving some Sunnis into a bloody insurgency and a sectarian war that gripped Iraq for years .
Extremist groups , mainly al Qaeda in Iraq , are known to take advantage of political fissures and carry out attacks to create further turmoil .
The U.S. military is scheduled to draw down its troops , leaving behind a residual force of about 50,000 with a non-combat mission by the end of August .
According to the security agreement between the two countries , all American troops are scheduled to be out of Iraq by the end of next year .

This image of the galaxy M82 was taken by NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope .
Scientists now think the galaxy is home to an oddity known as a micro-quasar .
A strange and mysterious newobject in space may the brightest and long - lasting " micro - quasar " seen thus far , a miniature version of the brightest objects in the universe .
Theobject suddenly began pumping out radio waves last year in the relativelynearby galaxy M82 , some 10 million light - years away .
Its discovery wasannounced Tuesday .
" The new object , whichappeared in May 2009 , has left us scratching our heads — we 've never seenanything quite like this before , " said researcher Tom Muxlow , a radioastronomer at the University of Manchester 's Jodrell Bank Observatory inEngland .
M82 is a " starburstgalaxy , " one that churns out new stars at a prodigious rate .
Most ofthese stars die in huge explosions , with supernovas occurring roughly every 20to 30 years in M82 .
However , the supernovas the researchers expect to seein that galaxy brighten at radio wavelengths over several weeks and then subsidein later months .
In comparison , the mystery objectturned on very rapidly within a few days and has shown no sign of dying down , even after nearly a year .
" It 's actually even brightened slightly , " Muxlow explained .
Quasars big and small
Quasarsare found in the center of galaxies and contain supermassive black holes .
They are no more than a light year or two across but thousands of timesbrighter than our entire galaxy , which allows them to be seen more than 10 billion light years away .
Their energy is thought to emerge from matterspiraling at high speeds into the super - massive black holes theoretically atthe centers of most major galaxies .
However , this newfound object seemsto lie roughly 100 light years from M82's heart ?
far enough away to make itunlikely it is linked with that galaxy 's core .
Micro-quasars , liketheir larger counterparts , likely involve matter spiraling into black holes .
However , the object in M82 isthree to 10 times brighter than any micro-quasar seen until now , and hasoutlasted any micro-quasar seen thus far , which generally peak in brightnessafter a few days or weeks .
" We think a massive blackhole must be involved , but we do n't really understand how it 's gettingfueled , " Muxlow said .
More study needed
To learn more about this enigma , " we have just started processing data from an array of 20 radio telescopesacross the Earth taken for the central nuclear region of M82 , " Muxlowexplained .
" These images will allow us to examine the structure of the newradio source in detail .
However , processing such huge datasets takessignificant amounts of computing effort and painstaking work .
Only then will webe able to see if it is some rare form of micro-quasar .
Watch this space ! "
Such bright , enduringmicro - quasars might exist in our galaxy as well .
" We might expect to seeone maybe once every 100 years , " Muxlow conjectured .
Muxlow will detail the discoveryon April 14 at a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society inGlasgow , Scotland .
A paper on the discovery has accepted by the Monthly Notices ofthe Royal Astronomical Society Letters .
Claim :
More people are killed by donkeys every year than die in airplane accidents .
LEGEND
Origins : Fear of flying is one of our more prevalent phobias , ranking right up there with a dread of heights or terror of snakes .
However , unlike
many other phobias , it ’s reinforced on an ongoing basis by events featured on the nightly news .
Coverage of plane crashes works to remind those who have a fear of flying exactly what they ’re afraid of , and these grim images are familiar TV fodder because mishaps involving airliners are given prominent news coverage , even if no one aboard is injured .
When there is loss of life , the death toll per incident is usually high because an accident serious enough to kill one person generally kills everyone aboard .
All
of this serves to reinforce the fears — that many people died in one fell swoop as a result of engaging in a particular activity ( i.e. , flying ) is interpreted to mean that the activity itself must be inherently dangerous .
Other activities are far more likely to lead to loss of life , but because the death tolls associated with them mount up more slowly — only a body or two at a time — we are not dramatically reminded of this fact in the same way the dangers of flying are brought home to us when we snap open our morning newspapers and are confronted with the news of another plane crash .
Automobile accidents resulting in loss of life occur every day , but we gloss over recognition of the number of car - crash deaths because the information comes in dribs and drabs .
The annual figures of automobile accident fatalities never carry as much impact as a single front - page headline of an airplane crash that claimed hundreds of lives .
It becomes easy for the average air passenger to believe that airline travel involves significant risks , even though statistically it may be much safer than any number of
activities people regularly undertake without much concern over potential dangers .
The statistic about more people being killed every year by donkeys than by airplane crashes works to counter those misperceptions by highlighting that , contrary to what we may think , a slow , clumsy , primitive mode of transportation is actually more dangerous ( or at least kills more people ) than air travel .
We like it because it makes us feel better about flying , and because we ’re sadly in need of reassurance .
Yes , but is this donkey - to - airplane comparison true ?
No one could possibly say , because while data about airplane crashes is readily available , we have yet to find so much as a single source for donkey - induced death statistics .
This fanciful comparison certainly vexes donkey lovers though , as evidenced by the vehement denial of it in the FAQ on the American Donkey and Mule Society ’s ( ADMS ) web site :
Q : I saw this statement on the internet that “ More People are killed by donkeys than in airline crashes each year .
Now my spouse does n’t want me to get a donkey !
Is this true ?
Help ! ” Q : I saw this statement on the internet that “ More People are killed by donkeys than in airline crashes each year .
Now my spouse does n’t want me to get a donkey !
Is this true ?
Help ! ” A : NO , this statement has been plaguing us for several years now .
It first appeared somewhere as a “ factoid ” , but it , along with several others on that list , is TOTALLY FALSE .
( We now hear that the National Geographic channel is using it in a commercial ! )
Until recently , we had absolutely NO IDEA where they got the so - called fact to base this rumor on .
We have now found out that it was spawned due to the numbers of auto accidents caused by loose donkeys in Mexico and the Middle East !
We often hear of people being INJURED by their donkeys , but ca n’t yet name one case where someone in the USA was killed by a donkey — and there have certainly been hundreds of people killed each year in plane crashes .
You ’d think that several hundred people killed by donkeys each year would be publicized better somewhere OTHER than a “ factoid sheet . ”
People contact the ADMS for all sorts of reasons , but having searched the archives , we cannot find any notices of members or people killed by a donkey .
( In Nov 2005 we found one headline of a man in Egypt being killed by his donkey — he had beaten the animal and it savaged him . )
In truth more people are bitten by their family dog !
Being killed in an auto collision with a loose donkey is not being killed by a donkey – it ’s being killed in an auto collision , which happened to involve a donkey .
Help us to dispell this awful rumor - mill factoid — it ’s not true , it ’s bunk , treat it as such .
Please do n’t let this statement stop you from getting a donkey or any other animal if you wish to own one !
We ’ve traced the claim at least as far back as 1987 , when it was cited in the London Times in an article about — not surprisingly — efforts to help people overcome their fear of flying :
The statistics on the safety of flying are immensely comforting , despite recent reports of a near - miss between a 747 and an RAF Hercules over Carlisle , and the Boeing 747 captain who apparently had to be reminded to lower his craft ’s undercarriage before landing at Heathrow .
One expert has estimated that more people in the world are kicked to death by donkeys than die in plane crashes .
And that ’s pretty much it .
From then on , this statistic has been cited over and over in newspapers and year after year on the Internet , but never with any references to support its validity .
Well , if it ca n’t be proved , is it at least plausible ?
We might be willing to believe that more people are injured ( i.e. , kicked , bitten , trampled , or thrown ) in donkey - related accidents than in airline - related accidents .
Or , given a worldwide growth of air travel and a declining use of donkeys , we might be willing to believe that the rate of donkey - related accidents exceeds the rate of airline - related accidents .
We might even be willing to believe that there are as many donkey - related fatalities ( such as people getting hit by cars while leading or riding donkeys ) as airline fatalities .
But the claim that donkeys directly kill ( by kicking ) more people every year than airplane crashes do is a bit much to swallow without something to back it up .
( The number of airline - related fatalities varies from year to year , but a figure of 1,200 deaths per year is a reasonable average . )
The donkey statistic sounds like what the Times ( almost ) claimed it was back in 1987 : something invented on the spot by an “ expert ” to make the point that people are too often influenced by considering isolated bits of information rather than examining them in an appropriately larger context .
Others confronted with this item have offered some pithy rejoinders :
The Weekend Australian maintained that “ flying is safer than any other form of transport except escalators ” ( and presumably including donkeys ) .
maintained that “ flying is safer than any other form of transport except escalators ” ( and presumably including donkeys ) .
The Hartford Courant ‘s Jim Shea quipped that the higher number of donkey deaths was understandable because “ the faster mode of transportation always poses the higher risk . ”
‘s Jim Shea quipped that the higher number of donkey deaths was understandable because “ the faster mode of transportation always poses the higher risk . ”
In the Wellington Evening Post , Phil Pennington offered : “ Ever wondered whether it ’s the airlines themselves , knowing the value of a reassuring urban myth , who pass these sorts of comparisons around ? ”

Late Sunday afternoon , the well - heeled residents of Chevy Chase , Maryland , a bucolic suburb northwest of Washington , DC , witnessed a commotion rare for their neighborhood .
Toting signs and megaphones , fired up and chanting at the top of their lungs , some 700 demonstrators from around the nation paid a visit to two residents who work as powerful lobbyists for the United States ’ biggest banks : Gregory Baer , a deputy counsel for Bank of America , and Peter Scher , a high - ranking executive and lobbyist for JPMorgan Chase .
Bussed into Washington by the Service International Employees Union ( SEIU ) and National People ’s Action ( NPA ) , a community organzing network , the protesters visited Baer ’s and Scher ’s homes as part of a multi-day stand in Washington .
On Monday , SEIU and NPA will lead a series of protests on K Street in Washington — a street synonymous with influence and lobbying .
The groups are pushing for strong new financial reforms ( as teh Senate continues debating legislation to bolster the rules governing Wall Street ) and urging banks to stop foreclosures and to promote job creation .
But before Main Street arrives on K Street , a fleet of yellow school buses and motor coaches delivered the demonstrators , clad in red , blue , and purple t- shirts , to a park in Chevy Chase near the home of Bank of America ’s Baer .
After a quick briefing , the throngs of protesters , hailing from Chicago , San Francisco , Staten Island , and other locales , gathered on Baer ’s front lawn and marched to his front door .
Members of NPA delivered a letter to a family member who opened the door .
Baer , this family member said , was n’t home .
The letter , addressed to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan , asks Moynihan to meet with groups “ to address the critical problems facing our neighborhoods and our country — problems that were caused in part by Bank of America and that continue to fester due to Bank of America ’s inaction . ”
Here ’s a video , courtesy of National People ’s Action , of the scene at Baer ’s home :
Undeterred by Baer ’s absence , the boisterous group chanted — ” Bank of America , Bad for America , ” “ Take It Back , ” “ Fired Up , Ca n’t Take It No More ” — and , via megaphone , blasted Bank of America for foreclosing on homeowners and lobbying against financial reform .
One woman who took the mic explained how she ’d called Bank of America dozens of times to fight off foreclosure but had n’t had any success with the bank ’s unresponsive and unhelpful employees .
People in the crowd booed references to the bank .
Many hoisted signs that read , “ People First Economy ” ” and “ Hold Wall Street Accountable . ”
Just as the crowd was about to leave around 4:15 pm , Baer , in a baseball cap and shorts , strode up his front lawn and into the crowd .
Baer briefly spoke with one of the protest ’s organizers , declined to say much at all , then ducked into his house .
The crowd hung around Baer ’s house for another 25 minutes , their chants drawing curious ( and agitated ) neighbors onto their porches .
Then they left for their second stop of the day .
A 15 - minute ride later , the buses arrived at the stately home of JPMorgan lobbyist Peter Scher .
Like the previous demonstration , people poured out of the buses and quickly filed onto the neatly manicured front lawn and rushed Scher ’s red front door .
This time , no one answered , despite repeated demands by the Rev. Eugene Barnes from Illinois People ’s Action .
At Scher ’s house , Montgomery County police nudged protesters off the lawn onto a nearby street , where the speeches and chanting and banging of drums continued .
( One of the officers said the event was “ very peaceful . ” )
A handful of protesters walked to neighboring houses and handed fliers criticizing Scher and JPMorgan to neighbors watching the scene .
On the street , Mark Freeman , a Minneapolis resident and lifelong union member , told of battling Bank of America , which was attempting to foreclose on his modest home in north Minneapolis .
“ It ’s time that we repossess America , ” Freeman shouted into the megaphone .
As the sun sank lower in the sky , the activists returned to the buses and headed to their hotels .
On Monday , their target is a more obvious one : K Street , the Rodeo Drive of Washington lobbying shops , where they will protest Wall Street ’s influence - peddlers ’ attempts to whittle down financial reform .
Last month the gaming giant Ubisoft announced their new über - DRM which requires customers to be continuously online in order to play purchased games .
Of course , this DRM was circumvented in a few hours and while downplaying this blunder , Ubisoft fails to see that they 've only increased piracy .
As an anti-piracy tool DRM simply does n’t work – and it never will , although not everyone fully realizes this .
For example , Ubisoft recently decided to introduce a new solution to prevent pirates from playing their games .
Their new DRM requires gamers to be online all the time when playing the game .
Without an Internet connection the game simply wo n’t work .
The new plans were welcomed with skepticism by fellow game developers and the majority of gamers .
Instead of hindering piracy the DRM only restricts legitimate customers from playing the game how and where they want , most people agreed .
A survey among members of the Subsim community regarding the DRM on Silent Hunter 5 shows that , if anything , the new DRM is putting off customers from actually buying the game .
Only 15 % of the respondents said that the DRM would n’t affect their plans to buy Silent Hunter 5 , while 85 % said they would delay or cancel their purchase until a DRM - free version becomes available .
From these responses it could be concluded that many potential customers would prefer to use a DRM - free ( pirated ) copy instead of the legitimate product , which is the opposite of what Ubisoft wanted to accomplish .
Silent Hunter 5 was released on Tuesday and just a few hours later a cracked version of the game was published on many file - sharing sites .
Ubisoft , worrying that DRM - haters would download the game illegally , quickly responded to the news about the cracked DRM and released a statement in which they downplay ‘ the issue ’ .
“ You have probably seen rumors on the web that Assassin ’s Creed II and Silent Hunter 5 have been cracked .
Please know that this rumor is false and while a pirated version may seem to be complete at start up , any gamer who downloads and plays a cracked version will find that their version is not complete , ” Ubisoft quickly responded .
While many downloaders report that the game works just fine , Ubisoft ’s statement does hold some truth because in their view the game is obviously ‘ not complete ’ without the DRM .
At this point it is not entirely clear what else could be “ missing ” in the cracked version , but that is beside the point .
The bottom line is that their revolutionary DRM invention was cracked in a matter of hours , and although the crack might not be perfect yet , it will be eventually .
The end result will be that the pirated version of the game will be more appealing and less restrictive than the actual retail product .
Thus , the DRM is encouraging and increasing piracy instead of putting a halt to it .
It looks like Ubisoft has made a massive mistake with their strong focus on DRM .
In fact , the time and effort spent on fine - tuning the DRM would have been better spent on game development , so that they did n’t have to release a patch with bugfixes a day after the game was released .
Let ’s hope Ubisoft quickly comes to its senses and releases another patch that removes the needless DRM from the game .

Cincinnati , Ohio ( CNN ) --
As she began a foot pursuit of a suspect down a dark alley and around a forbidding street corner , Cincinnati police officer Mandy Curfiss radioed to headquarters that she was heading toward a local gas station .
" Fourteen - 26 , still running towards Shell , " Curfiss said as the suspect ignored her commands to stop .
Seconds later , the man wheeled around , grabbed Curfiss and , after a brief struggle , ripped her Taser from her hands and charged toward her .
Then he charged the officer who arrived to back up Curfiss .
The second officer wrestled the suspect to the ground and cuffed him , with no injuries to anyone .
The suspect was charged with two counts of assaulting a police officer .
If he had chosen to fight the charge in court , he would have had to contend with a piece of evidence only recently available : a videotape of the entire incident .
The confrontation on February 24 was recorded with a small camera Curfiss was wearing on her head .
It 's called the AXON , manufactured by Taser International , the same company that makes the widely used stun guns .
Curfiss is one of 10 Cincinnati police officers who have patrolled the streets with the AXON camera mounted behind an ear .
Five police departments across the United States are testing the AXON and one department -- in Aberdeen , South Dakota -- has purchased a set .
It 's a crucial tool for gathering evidence , said officers who 've used the device .
They like that it is capable of moving with them where mobile video recorders , so - called " dash cameras " in squad cars , ca n't go .
They say the camera often pre-empts " he said - she said " disputes in court .
Since the Cincinnati Police began testing them in January , the cameras have recorded several confrontations .
In another incident in February , an officer ordered a suspect to lie face down after a traffic stop .
Despite repeated commands to show his hands , the suspect did n't respond and appeared to reach toward his pockets .
Officers quickly handcuffed him and discovered he had two pistols .
On an overnight ride - along with Cincinnati officer Melissa Cummins in early April , a CNN camera -- and Cummins ' AXON camera -- rolled as a man on a street corner ignored her request to throw away an alcoholic beverage .
The man ran , and Cummins , with the CNN crew in tow , took off after him .
After ignoring repeated instructions to stop , the man was tased and arrested for obstructing official business .
We later reviewed the incident on Cummins ' portable recorder .
" What 's your evaluation of how you handled it ? " CNN asked .
" Good , I think , " said Cummins .
" I mean , I gave him every chance to stop running . "
The AXON camera played a pivotal role in a case in Fort Smith , Arkansas , in November .
When Cpl. Brandon Davis responded to a domestic violence call , he was led to the front door of a small one - story house .
When the door opened , Davis saw the suspect sitting at a table , holding a gun .
Despite Davis ' repeated commands to drop the weapon , the suspect refused .
Davis fired two shots , killing the man .
Because his warnings -- at least 10 of them -- were recorded , Davis was cleared of wrongdoing in an internal investigation .
But the camera is not without controversy .
To record an incident , the officer has to double - click a button on a communications hub , a small box mounted in the chest area .
The video is recorded and stored in a " tactical computer , " a box strapped to the waist .
All three devices -- the camera , communications hub and tactical computer -- are connected with one wire .
If the officer does not double - click the communications hub , the incident will not be recorded .
That means the beat cop has sole discretion over what gets recorded and what does n't .
" That 's a problem , " said Cincinnati criminal defense attorney Steven Adams .
" That puts too much bias and prejudice against the person that 's suspected of a crime , or the person that 's being interviewed , or the person that 's being interrogated . "
Cincinnati Police Chief Thomas Streicher was asked about a theoretical case in which police beat a suspect and make sure among themselves that the scene was not recorded .
" Well in the scenario that you 're talking about right there , No. 1 , I 'd say to you I hope to God something like that never does happen .
And if it does happen , I can tell you this :
There are some real serious questions that have to be answered .
And I 'd have to tell you also that peoples ' jobs would be in jeopardy here in Cincinnati , " Streicher said .
Streicher has instructed his officers to record every encounter with citizens .
There are also questions about the chain of evidence captured by AXON cameras .
After an incident is captured and stored in the portable computer carried by the officer , that computer is placed into an electronic panel at headquarters .
The video is uploaded into a data file in Arizona called Evidence.com , run by Taser International , where it is stored .
Taser International officials said that evidence cannot be altered or erased and that police are the only people with access to it .
No one at Evidence.com or Taser has that access .
Defense attorney Adams said that despite the best intentions of the police departments and Taser , the business relationship between those parties has the potential to create conflict .
" They need to put it in the hands of an independent forensic scientific examiner to make sure it's out of the hands of the police and outside of the company 's domain , " he said .
Streicher said some officers were initially reluctant to wear the cameras .
" A cop goes into a world that is very mean and down in the gutter and can get downright nasty , and sometimes words are said that we might not use at the dinner tables with our families , " he said .
" So the cops worry about that kind of thing , and let 's face it , not everyone is an angel here . "
But Streicher said that most officers have reconciled with the device .
" It 's just another tool in the toolbox to help us capture evidence , and that 's what becomes critically important about this .
And that 's what eventually the cops learn to understand and they learn to accept . "
Want to quickly share a file , test some code , or broadcast something ?
You can instantly create a web server out of the current directory by using nothing but python , yup , no apache , no nginx , no litespeed , all python , which ships with pretty much every unix variation these days .
The command is remarkably simple considering how useful it is , and test it out yourself open up a Terminal window and any web browser .
This trick starts a simple web server instantly with nothing but python , it works in Mac OS X , Linux , FreeBSD , and any other unix platform that has python .
How to Start an Instant Web Server with Python
To create the instant web server from the command line , type the following in whichever directory you wish to have accessible via browsers and HTTP :
Start a Simple Web Server in Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Start Simple Web Server in Python 3
python -m http.server
This will publish the current directory as a web server immediately , so if you have an index.html file that will immediately be displayed , otherwise it will just list the directory contents at either your localhost IP or “ 0.0.0.0 ” .
Note that port 8000 is the default port setting for this feature , meaning to access the web server from a browser one would enter the following address : http://0.0.0.0:8000
Remember , without an index.htm or index.html file in the directory , a simple directory listing of the CWD / PWD would show up to the browser instead .
Once running , the terminal will update as pages and data are loaded from the python web server , showing standard http logging information like GET and PUSH requests , which files are being accessed and by whom , 404 errors , IP addresses , dates , times , and all that you would expect from a standard http log as if you were tailing an apache access log file .
You can get fancier if you ’d like and specify a port , giving some level of obscurity to the web server if you ’re hoping to only broadcast something to a specific individual , or if you just do n’t want it showing up on a standard 8000 portscan .
All you need to do is specify a port number at the end of the aforementioned command , like so :
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 4104
This would make the web server launch in the current directory at the IP with port 4104 , for an example let ’s assume the localhost IP : http://127.0.0.1:4104, or http://0.0.0.0:4104 depending on your settings .
This is a very handy tip if you ’re doing some quick web development and want to immediately check it in a browser or show it to someone else , and you do n’t want to take the time to sftp or commit it to a repository .
This should work on any unix variant OS , including FreeBSD , Linux , Ubuntu , Redhat , and of course Mac OS X is included as well .
The video below demonstrates a python server being launched in a directory with a simple index.html file , it also shows how the running python command reflects what is going on with the http connection like a normal http server log would :
Let us know if you find any particularly worthwhile uses or additional secrets for this great little trick .
Very cool news : the flying infrared observatory , SOFIA ( Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy ) -- which has been in the works for many years -- has seen first light .
What 's remarkable about this observatory is that it 's mounted in a hole in the side of a 747 !
Do n't believe me ?
Check .
This .
Out :
[ Click any of the images here to embiggen . ]
See that ginormous square hole in the back of the plane ?
That 's where the telescope sits , looking out at the sky .
Why put it in a plane ?
Because SOFIA looks in the mid to far infrared , and observations like that are impossible from the ground .
Water vapor in the air absorbs the kind of infrared light seen by SOFIA , but by the time you go up to about 10 km ( 35,000 feet ) you 're above 99 % of the Earth 's water vapor .
That little bit left does still absorb the light , but a telescope at that altitude receives about 80 % of the IR an orbiting observatory would .
So , amazingly , they cut a big hole in the side of a modified 747 and stuck a telescope in it .
A big one : SOFIA sports a 2.5 meter ( 8 foot ) mirror , which is bigger than Hubble's !
Here 's a sample of what it saw :
That is , of course , Jupiter .
On the left is an image in visible light , and on the right the SOFIA image .
It 's a composite of three infrared colors : 5.4 ( colored blue in the image ) , 24 ( green ) , and 37 microns ( red ) .
Your eye can see wavelengths only as long as about 0.7 microns , so these represent wavelengths well outside what we can see .
See the stripe on the left that 's reddish ?
In the infrared it 's brighter , because the gas in that belt is transparent to infrared light and we can see deeper into Jupiter 's atmosphere where it 's warmer .
Note that the other belt is still missing , in the visible and infrared .
Whatever is blocking the light from that belt is opaque to both our eyes and SOFIA's .
SOFIA also took a look at the nucleus of the nearby weird galaxy M82 , which is undergoing a burst of star formation , and is lousy with thick dust that blocks visible light .
SOFIA peers through that dust , revealing the star factories hard at work in the center of that galaxy .
According to preliminary reports , SOFIA is performing perfectly , and getting great observations at a far , far cheaper price tag than putting something in orbit .
We still need telescopes in orbit to do other work -- some IR is still absorbed even at that height -- but SOFIA will make terrific achievements .
It also has a robust educational arm , which includes taking as many as 200 teachers per year up on observation flights !
If you 're an educator and interested in this , contact the team at SOFIA .
You may just qualify to get the airplane ride of a lifetime .

The question has caused me and countless others many a sleepless night ( OK , many a fruitless hour ) for the better part of three years :
Why in the name of Steve Jobs does every picture of every iPhone in every Apple ad show the time as 9:42 .
Always 9:42 .
( 2012's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
We here at Buzzblog did our best to answer the riddle back in June 2007 by dutifully asking the Apple public relations department for an explanation .
A spokesperson told me she would " try to find an answer , " but , alas , she tried and failed .
I moved on , reluctantly .
Fast - forward to yesterday and a blog post by Jon Manning , lead developer at Secret Lab , which makes software for the Mac , iPhone and iPad .
Manning noticed two things of importance on Saturday : first , that the iPad shows a time of 9:41 , not 9:42 ; and , second , that the fellow standing over there in the Palo Alto Apple store appeared to be Scott Forstall , senior vice president of iPhone software .
( Dying Jobs kept letter from Gates at his bedside )
Manning walked over to Forstall and asked the question that 's been bugging ( some of ) us for years .
Here is Forstall 's reply :
" We design the ( product launch ) keynotes so that the big reveal of the product happens around 40 minutes into the presentation .
When the big image of the product appears on screen , we want the time shown to be close to the actual time on the audience 's watches .
But we know we wo n't hit 40 minutes exactly . "
" So you add a couple of minutes ? "
" Yeah !
And for the iPhone , we made it 42 minutes .
It turned out we were pretty accurate with that estimate , so for the iPad , we made it 41 minutes .
And there you are - the secret of the magic time . "
What a relief .
Now , it should be noted that others had speculated as far back as 2007 that the time in the photos was somehow related to the time of the initial iPhone announcement .
However , this is the first I 've heard of Apple looking to synch that time on the pictures with the time on the watches of audience members ... and that the practice has been extended to the iPad .
Thanks ,
Jon , for asking ... and , thanks , Scott , for answering .

DOSE :
4.0 g oral Syrian Rue ( ground / crushed ) repeated smoked Cannabis ( plant material ) 10 g oral Psychotria viridis ( extract )
BODY WEIGHT : 10 kg
The foreplay begins as soon as I arrive home after work on FridayI place my key in the lock ; cross the threshold and check the cage that catches the letters ,
She releases a postcard 
Information that a book I ordered has arrived :  Ayahuasca Visions  by Pablo AmaringoNow , this is a good sign  for today I decided would be the day of the brew First thing I do is begin cleaning the kitchen and my room .
Im cleaning for her , putting myself in the necessary mindset for interactionI take a glass casserole dish ; this dish will house conversion of our shared intent into a common action : Extraction .
( All figures are guesstimated ) I mix 15 ml of lemon juice in about 100 ml of boiled tap water in the bottom of the dish , just to soften her up a bit .
With care and respect I take the leaves of her host  Chacruna ( Psychotria viridis ) from a zip - lock baggy .
I take one handful at a time , crumbling the leaves into my pestle & mortar for further grinding
All in all six handfuls of various sizes go into the casserole dish , just under 30g .
I go into the kitchen and fetch her a glass of 75 ml lemon juice to 250 ml boiled water , when I re-enter my bedroom I announce the intent of my action :
Here is our meeting place , the fluid of communication I ask for your spirit to enter this liquid , to infuse the solution  I pour the juice over her and stir a while with my wooden spoon .
A few inhalations of Ganja herb as I contemplate my actions
She asks for another glass .
This cycle manifests once more  three glasses prepared as detailed So She is swimming in an acid solution , will her tryptamine alkaloids migrate ( ? ) .
I prepare the gas stove as an alter , a candle either side and some sweet incense burning above A small blue ring of gas where she shall sit .
And there she sits .
I stir her occasionally over the course of the next five hours ; the murky white of the acid solution has turned a deep red brown by the end of her slow simmer I edge off the lid slightly , leaving a small gap to prevent the flow of plant material as I pour the liquid into a glass saucepan .
I re-submerge her body in a solution of approximately 150 ml lemon juice to 500 ml of boiled water and ask her soul to migrate .
She simmers as I sleep Blessed be .
I awake and perform another pour off into the saucepan .
I leave the extracted solution uncovered , with just enough heat to create a spiraling expulsion of steam where her aqueous solution meets the air .
One last extraction is set into action , this time about 100 ml lemon juice in 400 ml boiled water .
I leave the following words ( and the Cosmic Circle Cross ) inscribed upon a post - it - note for her protection : LeaveBrewBeBecoming And I set off to acquire some more Ganja to burn as I work .
On my way back home I purchase a measuring jug and a funnel as well as the necessary food supplies for a comfortable nights camping .
The final simmer ends after five hours , I add this last extraction ( still reasonably deep in color ) to the others and continue boiling her off .
I take an old pillowcase and cut off a corner , scooping the sodden plant material from the casserole bowl and placing it inside .
I squeeze her body in my fist and watch her soul emerge from between my fingers and flow below into the saucepan I do not discard the leftover plant material but decide to pack it in my bag , out of respect I cannot chuck it away  
I must take it with me and lay it to rest , return it to the cycle somehowI leave the culmination of my efforts : a thick ( about fruit juice consistency ) suspension of red brown particles , to boil down some more while I prepare for the voyage I pack my white linen trousers and my orange poncho with ritual intent , I pack a bunch of other clothes to keep me warm  and a sleeping bag to contain my body while Mind wanders .
I take some personal power objects : two Buddha for insight and protection , two crystals for focus , a special stick with which to stir fire and direct will I also pack  The active side of Infinity  by Carlos Castaneda to read should I need , and some paper upon which to write if it feels right .
Last thing in the bag is my pestle & mortar and a baggy containing about 10g of Syrian Rue ( Peganum harmala ) I follow her delicate spiritual fragrance into my kitchen :
She sits on the stove deep red brown and steaming , I place my face above her liquid body and breathe in her ever flowing breath  bless my head in her steam 
As I return some breath to her I open my eyes , I see the sight of my eye cast in light reflected from her shining surface
The volume of the Chacruna extraction is down to just over a pint , I want to boil it off some more (  Surely I cant get a whole pint down ?  ) but the last bus to my destination is not far from departure I pour it from the saucepan into the measuring jug and finally through the funnel ( fitted with a pillowcase filter ) into a clean plastic bottle .
I have to say my attempt at filtration is poor ; she is too viscous to pass through the tight crosshatch of the cotton any faster than a drip a minute 
 This will not do !?
I have bus to catch *!* I end up giving her a helping hand by picking up the folded cotton triangle and giving it a shake , then a squeeze A few moments later I have this divine DMT solution contained in a bottle , and an old section of pillowcase covered in a thick layer of red brown plant bits .
The foreplay is almost over I set off for Shell BaySo here I am , somewhere between the start of the story and sitting here typing it , the wind is blowing my locks in all directions  massaging my skull
The bus stops to pick up some more passengers , I take advantage of this brief respite from the Wind to light a small spliff 
Ah !
The joys of the open top bus !!
Im transported from the town center to Sandbanks ferry via the Bournemouth coastal roads ; a sporadically clouded Sky seems closer than usual  the clouds almost touchable !
And so I board the ferry with a hot chocolate in my hand ( my first food today but for water and fruit ) and I watch as we retreat from the mainland A short crossing to the other side :
A peninsular of sand , beaches surround and heather plains inland Swampy copses hold themselves around the veins of water passing through to the Sea , lone trees are suggestive of Africa  but this is a place of Deer & Hare , Gull , Crow & Butterfly , Red ants & Wild flowersI trek a short distance along the beach before I reach my turn inland , passing down sandy paths through purple heather and yellow gauze , towards my destination : A circular dune rooted by plants and built up by the Winds own hand , its medium sand .
I arrive , giving my praises and blessings to this magical place .
I place my heavy baggage in a heather bush and go off to forage for firewood .
There are some felled birch , dried by the Sun and hollow from the Wind , that yield one good load  all I shall require for a small ceremonial fire .
I also find some nice sections of bark that I take with the intention of painting upon I dump my firewood at the dune and begin slowly unfolding myself into my surroundings .
I spread my poncho not far from the intended site of the fire , here I sit and smoke up a haze while I clarify my intent : I intend to initiate myself fully into the life I have been cultivating , to become closer to what I am .
I intend to transmit Perfect Peace & Love to all capable of reception ( and that is all ) .
I read a chapter from Castanedas book :  The intent of infinity  
It is most apt to my current situation .
Unfolding some more involves placing an effigy of Buddha in the raised center of the dune , facing the soon to set Sun .
I place another Buddha on the wall of the dune , facing the Sea , our town and the direction of the rising Sun .
I place my two crystals on the bark I collected earlier , either side of me , perpendicular to the line of the Buddha .
I mark the site of the fire with my special stick  drawing a circle , round and round , then I mark the cross through its center Blessed be .
I make three more inscriptions of the Cosmic Circle Cross in the sand around my poncho :
The circle above my head finds a shell at its center , I leave it be Praise thee .
Here &
Now I take out the Chacruna brew and place it beside me .
Here &
Now I take out the Syrian Rue and place it beside me .
I place two palm - sized measurings of Rue into the pestle & mortar and begin the grind .
I manage to crush a good few of the tough little seeds as the Sun moves closer to the Horizon .
Anticipation rising
There are a few dark clouds collecting at the edges of an otherwise inviting Sky .
I have no tent with me and decide to voice my intention that the Weather stays good  I intend that the Sky stays clear , no rain on me , the Stars shall shine through I Praise thee & send my Blessings to you .
I feel strange immediately after having spoken this , had I supposed to interfere beyond a respectful level ?
Was I a fool to ask such a significant force to keep such an insignificant thing as me from the damp ?
Was being wet really all that bad ?
I calm my nervous ego by formulating a deal with the unknown A spell for protection :  I pray for Protection from the forces of Peace & Love Should I be given it I shall endeavor to ensure I am always worthy of protection in the eyes of Perfect Peace & Love Profound . 
This certainly worked to calm a nervous mego ; I believe it also goes beyond .
I take a healthy pinch of Peganum between three fingers and my thumb ( estimated amount just over 1g ) place it in my mouth and swill it back with water .
It is bitter and Earthy but it goes down and stays down without a quibble I let it settle before standing with my special stick and tracing two laps of a large circle , its circumference contains my possessions , the fire and I , all but the more distant sentry Buddha 
In eternal ecstatic observation I repeat the dose of Rue and dual circle laps twice more , now sat - is - fact - orally - dosed I offer the small amount of leftover seeds to each of the four elements in their perceived directions
While I await MAO Inhibition I use the last of the fading light to craft a few reefers , thinking this may be the last opportunity to do so for a little while
Here & Now , the Sun light is falling elsewhere on our orb
The subtle suggestibility of Nighttime rolls in with the effects of the Harmaline , HarmalaI decide I will soon be ready to consume the brew and I set about attempting to light the fire
You should know that I placed the leftover plant material from my brew at the center to this fire , mirroring its consumption by flame would be my own 
Two burning energy centers in my circle , Chacruna at the center of bothBut the fire refuses to light for me The Rue is pleasantly active and in my heightened but nervous state I begin to worry that it was perhaps wrong of me to build a fire around the Chacruna , maybe it did not wish to be consumed by flame but buried or scattered ?
I build little flares to stick underneath the newspaper but to no avail , any flame ends up a smolder , I have no desire to frustrate myself ( the Wind is intense and making things difficult ) and I believe that perhaps I am to carry on without a fireI take out the brew and unscrew the cap , smelling this fruity Amazonian juice I imagine it may not be so difficult to consume after all I hold this thought instead of my nose as She slips down my throat , one big gulp straight down is fairly bitter and entirely plant - tasting but quick to fade into a not so bad  aftertaste
She does feel strange in my stomach , so I take a few tokes of Ganja herb and sit with it .
I probably took no more than 50ml in that gulp , there is still about 450 ml of my intended dose to go I am slightly apprehensive therefore I worry not that I probably cannot drink the lot for full effect tonight , I feel altered enough as it is from the Rue & Marijuana !
I see a bright yellow star / planet ( Venus ? ) that I have been noticing recently ( after a spell with Mars ) and I command it to  Shine through  and I bless it The Wind is moving the clouds fast across the Sky but my stomach is a contrasting calm .
I am beginning to sense things flowing past in the darkness , just out the corner of my eyes
The silhouettes of heather , grass and tree dance a little more than usual :
The darkness they possess is having problems defining itself against the lighter dark of the rushing clouds in the swift Night SkyI take another gulp of the brew with a certain contented happiness arising from my thoughts that this maybe the last gulp I attempt :
The Fire leaps into flame !!!
I am astounded by this synchronicity ; the Wind must have kept on at some hidden smolder
But no sooner had the bottle left my lips than there was flame !!Fantastic !
I watch as the wind builds  bearing down on the fire , pushing it away from the wood into the ground the edges of my circle sand - barrier fanning it slightly up & out : I am overjoyed at being in the presence of FireI am Aries  particularly attuned to this element .
I restate my intent of transmitting Peace & Love , receiving Power & Protection Reforming myself as that which I know I am , that which I know I can be I sense so profoundly that I recall seeing a shock - wave rainbow of ripples emanating out from the boundary of the larger circle I had drawnSuddenly I need to purge myself , the need to puke arises so unexpectedly that I forget my plan about just walking calmly toward the grassy area at the center of the dune and letting it flow Stomach spasm , I stand up quickly and look about quickly trying to figure out what I should do :
What should I do ?
Didnt I have a plan ?
I run out the back of my circle then calm slightly , stomach spasm ,  Go near Sun-set Buddha and I head for the grass  here I stop moving and give my stomach the go ahead 
I dry heave twice and I worry that I may not be puking just once and getting it over with My stomach spasms again and I expel a small amount puke , it just doesnt seem to be coming up I hunch over and help my stomach spasms with some pressure from my fist :
Now I let forth a healthy stream of bile and I am enjoying myself .
One more purge and I take my hands off my knees and stand up straight 
Spit a bit and smile !
I feel much better , very well in fact , and I stop worrying about how to wipe my mouth when my sleeve just does itI re-enter my circle the opposite side from which I left , symbolizing my cleansing I am anew I lie on my back and watch the stars peeping through the gaps of the fast moving ( now further dispersed ) clouds :
The colorful geometric circus played out in my retina has the Sky for its projection screen 
There exists a focus to this circus , a ringleader , permanently at the center of my visual field A fractal skin peels from him and floats down towards me , it is She !
Things begin to suggest other dimensionsClouds are figures flying across the Sky , all recognizable to me 
All friends & family from one place or another Some of them stop and interact with I , revealing motion beyond personality A very good friend of mine dances into my mind and out again 
This I understand as it isI feed the fire some more and crawl inside my sleeping bag
Those two gulps have permitted me an experience of an intensity I would never have imagined !
Still
She rises .
I begin to sense the infinite in every phenomenon on every level in every momentMego mutters on until it hits an ending word Like e - goooooooo and then its gone :
Then Eye and I loop through the endless circuit of being and come back where I left off
Where I slip off againAnd again .
Again .
( A - gain ) As I loop through the circuit I begin to build up a better picture of the overall structure of BEING , its infinite complexities arising from a permanently productive ecstatic sex with itself Images of some chocolate - skinned Goddess straddle me , blacking out the disturbing witch that was naked before me I m sort of back in my body and the imaginal realms , my heart is beating fast and I encourage the images of the Goddess to stiffen my cockAnd then the blood is beating through it & through me and I masturbate for a whileJust ecstatic Making LOVE to the Goddess
And the images of her begin to fade , I release my cock without spilling my seed  right now I understand that I never wish to put that to waste I have images of retaining that energy  feeding myself with it Then there are little super - sperm growing in my super - balls and I vow that only Superwoman is getting them !!!
Hahaah !
The tide is going back out , I come back to the sensing in the darkness
Is that a Man ?
No its a Tree but you sense its spirit  calm yourself I feed the glowing embers of the fire and soon it flames again .
I fight fear of the dark and my self - imposed loneliness with Power of the Circle & projection of Perfect Peace & Love Profound I feel myself as a beacon and pray that I attract so much Good that Evil dare not approach , though I feel its presence ( as well as the presence of some huge UFO just beyond the veil of the clouds 
Wait ... I see it ? )
I am assured of the triumphant nature of Love every time I conquer Fear and this assertion makes me stronger still .
I get the feeling the UFO is going to stay in observation for now , in neutral I certainly do not desire abduction ; I think I may even fear itI see there is a huge circle above my circle  inscribed in the clouds !
As above , So belowE - gooooooooo going going *
Try a toot * Gone .
* It s a hoot * Back . *In cahoots ?
* GoneInner roots
After taking a toke on a spliff , our Man , who was sitting cross-legged , slowly leaned back  his hands coming to rest behind his head , elbows up & out The configuration of his limbs reminded him of the mid-section of the Tree of Life He looked for the Soul of Man and he found it at his centerHello ?
Heylo ?HALOThe angles , of my triangles The AngelsCan you see them in the ringleader ?
Can you see them in the Stars ?
They reflect themselves above and below and in every direction out into infinity , Then her arms unfold  leaving tracers becoming more armsSHIVA !!!
How I wish to please her !
That is my intent !!LOVE IS ALL !!!
Another wave retreats , and by some amazing feat :
There is my protection A huge Rasta in the sky , manifest in the clouds , is it I ?
Who am I ?
Here I amOn the ground , feeling sick
The wave is coming back in , surging through my body and pushing puke onto the sand beside me , which is me for a second before I am me again
Then I purge myself from myself once more and re-enter .
I have to lie on my side as I leave myself , I cannot support my weightMy stomach contorts and I feel pain  not just physical distress but the distress of being expelled from myself and then accepted then expelled then accepted
It gets less like pain and more like the sheer intensity of existence until I can no longer contain myself , this is the last of the purge and I roll onto my backInfinite then definite 
Yes , definitely sweating 
Heart beating fastI crawl out of my sleeping bag , peeling off another layer of personality with itDepth perception and angles are all sorts because I am perceiving from so many places , taking off a jumper is a transcendental delight because I am perceiving from so many dimensions Still I sweat , is this dizziness ?
No it s disassociation diffusion Confusion for a while , then the Wind cools my burning body and I slip into a lesson :
Every time I close my eyes I become that nothing adjusted to the infinite non-action of that nothing Something :
So I open my eyes and suddenly I m flowing out into everything enjoying the infinite results of that one - action Becoming too intense , my body twists , back to nothing :
So I open my eyes and suddenly I m flowing out into everything enjoying the infinite results of that one - action Becoming too intense , my body twists , back to nothing :
So I open my eyes and suddenly I m flowing out into everything enjoying the infinite results of that one - action Becoming too intense , my body twists , back to nothing :
And this in itself is a joyous blissful agonizing eternity of flux between identity and BEING , off and on , On and on then longing and seeing and feeling and BEING and SEEING and BEING to infinity ( even beyond !
As Buzz would say ) That s what I am : What I am : I AM .
Each time is increasing or superior or just different but the same Evolved on somehow , mutated maybe
But baby its all the same because its new KNEW
There is no memory of what has gone before Just the living product of it Extending infinitely from where its been to where its going in a big fat Circle ( which ( when viewed from multiple dimensions ) is really a Spiral ) Man !
It s all so complex I think Ill just ride it for a while SmileAnd then I start to think that I may have to shit Am I already shitting ?
My body grumbles and growls so I take it to the edge of the circle , I walk on my hands and feet with my stomach facing the Sky , which reminds me of that little girl from the Exorcist , and all of a sudden paranoia is present  I cannot leave the circle !
I dig myself a pit and sit my bum in it .
* Ignore the Evil  Spread Love * I feel a rapturous energy stir in my bowel so I raise myself above my pit and wait for it Nothing but a humongous fart results , even when I try and push  effort feels far too strange so I stop it I crawl away ( still in crab - position ) from my no - shit pit towards my water bottleI drink and immediately know my mistake 
The water hits a strange plateau inside me and sloshes about on this flatness I feel hollow now I can feel this water - platform inside me 
It seems to reach right to the edge of my being I need to puke again and am not so sure I will not shit simultaneously  back to my pit , where I manage to puke with great ease but not shit This whole experience is rather disconcerting ; all events being scrutinized by a vivid awareness  all infected with a subtle paranoia 
Shit and Puke and an irrational Fear of death ( poor little mego ) I cast a spell while my butt is submerged in Sand , I ask to be grounded 
I can hardly deal with this constant barrage of Spiritual Physicality
This flux , this off and on and on and onI check my arse with my hand and can tell its clean , trousers back up time !
This time I take the water only to swill around my mouth , this refreshes me rather than freaks me out and I realize I am now feeling good but starting to shiver I crab - crawl back over to my sleeping bag and slither inside her .
I fall back into her arms and anticipate the final stretch .
I leave the glowing embers of my fire to fadeI manage to extend my awareness to check far beyond my circle , its clear everything seems near
Do you want to go home ?
And I could be by my window and float in and go to sleep but I will wait it out here I am so tired But is nt it BEAUTITUL .
e v e r y t h i n g i s j u s t p e r f e c t . . . . . . . A big ferry passes by Shell Bay ; its loud hum reaches me and infests me  wont let me rest I am arrested by this constant drone ; I cannot escape to sleep 
I cannot hear anything else 
That sound is all Then I start to lose myself and the buzzing becomes the eternal laugh of Buddha Whom I can see in the clouds as well as hear !
Staring at the Stars is what I am for a while , when they shoot I intend my intent to manifest 
I wish Perfect Peace & Love ProfoundThings for me and you to do aboundAround and around and aroundI become the sand  There is no sand in my eye .
I am told that I know what to do and I do and I do it for you and for all of us .
There are Fishermen on the beach and in my state their drunken shouts reachThey combine with a re-merging ego to produce paranoia , delusions
Are those shouts of anger ?
Are they gypsy fishermen on some sort of peace - shattering rampage ?
What would they do if they found me ?
They could never enter the circle , all the same I conjure up another antidote delusion to combat the first 
I imagine that anyone passing me would see only Sand , and I think there may be some truth in this And The Evil gypsy fishermen are on the rampage and I hear a dog bark 
 Stay back my friend ! 
I begin to believe that the Evil gypsies are soon to pass me by ( The shouts are closer  that is my only justification , that and a feeling that is either intuition or illusion , I am too confused to tell any difference )  Move over to the tree , a safe place to sleep 
But I am in my circle ?
Yes , but the gypos will be here soon  leave your possessions in the circle and go hide under that tree  they will rob you and leave
There are Red Ants by the tree and I feel it may be them calling me over
This is too much 
Everything is either trying to push its way in or pull me out I place my faith back in my circle spell and begin fighting the useless paranoia that I will be killed in my sleep , or rather  that I will cease to exist and that will be itI phase back in with some buzzes and rings and all sorts of outside things so close I feel them inside me buzzing and vibrating and building and threatening to become me or with a paranoid slant : overcome me but I manage to calm it downGetting closer to sleepy town
Thats a Smile not a frown , no were up not down , no there is no direction when your all around but every direction is all around so I frowned my way back round to smiling .
In what direction is sleep ?
And how might I find it ?
I am there my dear sleeping nothing blissAnd I awake , not knowing how sleep came but knowing it must have done because I just woke up I look up and see the fast gray clouds still sprinting across the Sky I didnt die !
Hehehe I have a chuckle at some of the delusions I entertained  I feel ecstatic Love for the Other ( within / without my self ) and the wisdom I gained ; I find half a spliff beside me and smoke it up Up So Jesus visited me last night , somewhere between Shiva & Buddha 
Perhaps he was with me all the time Christ consciousness sure feels fine 
We are all Sons & Daughters of the Divine We are all One - divided into Two then Three , and Six and on to infinitySo I think that in some way  though all is One  Good & Evil do exist
You can make the wrong decision Know yourself as Divine seed , respect and care for yourself Cultivate Love & Happiness in your Heart Always try to better yourself , do not fear evolutionDo not fear change
There is Righteousness & there is Truth , of this I am proof 
Live like me so that every Man might  This is what Christ means to me , this is what I hear when I speak his name
If you do not agree then remember you are not me .
And try to find out for yourself
Here & Now , a few drips of Rain start their fall , really pretty minor stuff I simply pull my poncho from below me and place it above I enjoy the few specks that hit my face , fully feeling the cleanliness of this purified Sky water Praise thee & Blessed be .
Eye see Isis rises
She pops out from behind a cloud and I bless her , sleeping satellite : Master of the night  Intuition she emanates , guiding me in the suggestible darknessI see her now in the light of day
In a new way : Contemplation protects the intuition she emitsContemplate ( reflect upon ) her reflection of the SunOf the Soul of ManMan !!!
Everything is relativeWe are all relatives  I begin folding myself away  leaving some here but taking some with me
The circle that surrounds me remains unbroken , of the smaller Circle Crosses only the one at my head remains ( I must have slithered over the other two ) I take the shell from its center leaving my blessing in its place .
I feel very special and remain highly sensitive to the ecstasy of existence , the soft rain pitters outDark clouds cling to the distant Horizon , however , here above me : Blue Skies ( still hinting at Sun rise ) prevail until the gray does indeed draw the veil .
So I begin my trek back along the beach , seemingly lighter on my feet but I know I weigh the same 
Calm , easy , firm steps that roll smoothly from heel to ball and back again 
All I have to do is pay attention ( who accepts his own utilization as payment )
As I watch the fantastic peninsula shrink away from me , the huge underwater chains that drag this ferry along clank and chatter I am stunned into silence
It is golden !
Crossing the channel Im back on the other side : I sit under a tree while the Sky decides to drip a little ; as I await the appearance of my bus ride home I watch the cars cuing up , ready to board the ferry :
An old gray - haired man is mingling with the stalled vehicles ; he is collecting for a Cancer charity I see him approach a few windows , often an arm will drop some cash into his bucket , other times people will get out their cars and deliver a donation to him  Here I see him fighting cancer , not through donation to research , but by allowing those tormented non-thinkers to drop their guilt into an old mans bucket
He allows these people some release from their tension and guilt  the root of all tumor
And so they give to him , to feel a little better themselves
But this is a brief respite , and soon their frustration will build again and they will find themselves overly emotional , perhaps ill
All because they lack the skill to transcend themselves , they see in front or behind and that is how they travel , they live in straight lines so will never build a map of themselves beyond rationality , beyond what they think is true , what they think they know They will live who they think they are , without ever knowing who they might have thought themselves to beAn open - top bus arrives , I thank infinity for all I have known , been shown , in this place and I climb the steps to sit by myself under the Sky 
It rains a bit but I am happy to be spat upon from above , I relax into my journey home
It is not long before I am funneled back into the straight - lines and Soul - restraint of Bournemouth town center I have to keep glancing up at the Sky to remind me of my nature
Why have we done this to ourselves ?
We are not the roads we travel we may turn off at any moment why build walls ?
We are new in every moment we are free  we exist in all directions at once , there are no limits
But we build our own limits , concrete boxes we must live in  jobs we must do , all the while maintaining the illusion of happiness  some not even bothering to do that Well , happiness is it simply is !
You must have forgotten how to BE !!
Re -new your selves , re-birth , change , become the latest trend  the heights of fashion : Become this moment Become you NOW HERE ... Sitting in the Gardens watching folk walk by , a Fox walks by  I am waiting for the bookshop to open so I can go and collect my order :  Ayahuasca Visions A Magpie makes itself known to me , so I greet it and comment on its beauty I sense little messages relating to the success of last nights transmittion :
Peace & Love for all Every person and every thing seems a little happier this morning ; I reason that it may just be a reflection of my mood I keep on reasoning :
Even if it is a mere  reflection of my mood 
I can be sure that it is happeningI can be sure that I owe it to myself and to others to put myself in this mood  as often as possible , for this feeling is contagious  This feeling is attractive This feeling is attraction in non-action : :: Perfect Passive Peace - filled LoveThe Sunday shops open and I go to pick up my bookI really feel nervous about having to say  Ayahuasca Visions  out loud in a crowded shop I feel nervous because I m thinking about the Spirits , considering my respect for them 
Not because I will surely come across like some mad trip - head in front of the shop assistant I am physically shaking as I tell him I have ordered a book and I start to think that all this apprehension is actually a result of the intense significance of this moment :
A significance I am only too aware of A result of the vast web of inter-connectivity that receiving this book at this moment in my life symbolizes
He asks for my name instead of the title of the book and soon he is handing me a large glossy paperback with some fantastic depiction of the infinite beaming out at me from its front cover Blessed be & Praises to theeMay I find the lock with my keyMay the door swing on open for meMay I pass through all limits and be freeCan I do this and still remain me ?
No ?
Your self ?
Know yourself ( Psilly Persistently Pushes Perfect Peace & Love Profound to all Brothers & Sisters )
There are currently 1302 games with speedruns listed at SDA , including Quake where it all began .
As the number of bank failures in the United States continues to accelerate , many analysts are warning that we could soon see unprecedented changes in the U.S. banking industry .
In fact , there are some economists that are warning that we could be about to witness the greatest banking consolidation in U.S. history .
As dozens of small and medium size banks have failed , the megabanks have systematically been gobbling up larger and larger slices of market share .
In fact , if current trends continue , it does n’t take much imagination to foresee a future where the entire U.S. banking industry has been consolidated down to between 5 and 10 “ superbanks ” .
So would that be so bad ?
Well , yes it would .
It would represent a massive shift in financial power away from the American people to big , global corporate banks .
But if you happen to be a fan of big , global corporate banks perhaps you will really love what is about to happen to the U.S. banking industry .
On Friday , federal regulators seized Pinehurst Bank , which brought the total number of U.S. banks closed this year to 73 .
At this point in 2009 , only 36 banks had failed .
That means that the number of bank failures has doubled compared to the same time period a year ago .
Is that a good trend ?
Well , it is a good trend if you are one of the megabanks that is gobbling up the remnants of these banks that were “ small enough to fail ” .
And the sad thing is that we are likely to see dozens and dozens more small and medium size banks fail in the coming months .
The FDIC recently announced that the number of banks on its “ problem list ” climbed to 702 at the end of 2009 .
That is extremely alarming considering the fact that only 552 banks were on the problem list at the end of September 2009 and only 252 banks that were on the problem list at the end of 2008 .
In fact , the FDIC is expecting so many banks to fail that they are opening up new offices just to handle all the expected failures .
The FDIC has opened a massive 100,000 square foot satellite office near Chicago that will house up to 500 temporary staffers and contractors to manage receiverships and liquidate assets from what they are expecting will be a gigantic wave of failed Midwest banks .
Not only that , but the FDIC has also opened similar offices in Irvine , California and Jacksonville , Florida .
But can the FDIC realistically handle all of these bank failures ?
No .
The FDIC is backing 8,000 banks that have a total of $ 13 trillion in assets with a deposit insurance fund that is basically flat broke .
So if the FDIC completely runs out of money , where will all the necessary funds come from ?
From U.S. taxpayers of course .
It seems that we are the ultimate bailout machine .
Meanwhile , the biggest U.S. banks are hoarding cash in preparation for hard times .
In fact , the biggest banks in the United States cut their collective small business lending balance by another 1 billion dollars in November 2009 .
That drop was the seventh monthly decline in a row .
The truth is that in 2009 , the biggest U.S. banks posted their sharpest decline in lending since 1942 .
So what were they doing with their money ?
Well , thanks to the Federal Reserve , the megabanks were using the U.S. Treasury carry trade to make huge gobs of cash .
In fact , the little game that they are playing with U.S. Treasuries is working so well that four of the biggest U.S. banks ( Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America and Citigroup ) had a “ perfect quarter ” with zero days of trading losses during the first quarter of 2010 .
The truth is that the game is rigged to benefit the largest financial institutions , and they are slowly but surely gobbling up the entire U.S. banking market .
Back in 2000 , the “ Big Four ” U.S. banks – Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America and Wells Fargo – held approximately 22 percent of all deposits in FDIC - insured institutions .
As of June 30th of last year that figure was up to 39 percent .
The Founding Fathers of this country warned us of the danger of big banks getting too much power , but we have not listened to their warnings .
Now we have monolithic global banks that are so immense in size that we seem almost powerless to control them .
In fact , the six biggest banks in the United States ( Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup , Bank of America , and Wells Fargo ) now possess assets equivalent to 60 percent of America ’s gross national product .
And there is every indication that they are only going to get bigger and more dominant – especially if there is a major economic downturn ahead .
Unfortunately , that is what a number of respected economists are forecasting .
For example , Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster recently warned his readers that things could get really , really bad by the end of 2010 … .
It should interest you to know that my Intel source inside the Fed says absolutely no later than November the banking system should implode .
Presently 75 % of banks have problems and that the top 5 banks will take over all the others in a general nationalization .
There is tremendous fear and uneasiness in the banking world .
Now , let us hope that Bob Chapman ’s source is wrong .
Certainly the U.S. banking system is in a state of complete and total chaos , but hopefully we can make it into 2011 without a complete implosion of the banking industry .
However , Bob Chapman has been in the industry for decades and he would not have put out a warning like this without good reason .
Let us just pray that what this source is warning of does not actually come to pass .
But Bob Chapman is not the only one warning of difficult times ahead .
CNBC recently quoted Brian Kelly , the founder of Kanundrum Capital , as saying that the chances of a global depression breaking out have increased dramatically in recent days ….
“ Two weeks ago I would give the global depression scenario a one percent chance , but the chances have increased to 10 percent today . ”
In fact , world famous economist Nouriel Roubini is absolutely convinced that there is a good deal of economic trouble ahead of us … .
“ We are still in the middle of this crisis and there is more trouble ahead of us , even if there is a recovery .
During the great depression the economy contracted between 1929 and 1933 , there was the beginning of a recovery , but then a second recession from 1937 to 1939 .
If you do n’t address the issues , you risk having a double - dip recession and one which is at least as severe as the first one . ”
So will the end of 2010 be a very difficult time for the U.S. economy ?
Only time will tell .
But what does seem certain is that small and medium size banks will continue to fail in large numbers , and the big dominant banks will continue to gobble up market share .
We are witnessing a dramatic consolidation of the U.S. banking industry , and the only question seems to be how fast it is all going to play out .
It ’s milestone time for South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone .
Below is a video taste of tomorrow night ’s 200th episode .
They are set to make their Broadway debut in March on The Book Of Mormon , a stage musical .
Parker and Stone wrote the book and music with Avenue Q’s Bobby Lopez and Parker will direct with Avenue Q’s Jason Moore .
Scott Rudin is producing with Anne Garefino .
The Broadway move comes as Comedy Central prepares to air the 200th episode of their irreverent comedy series .
The musical deals with two wide - eyed Mormon boys who go on a two - year mission to Third World countries and underprivileged communities , where they try to convert people to join the Mormon faith .
After watching them lacerate scores of notable celebrity and faith–every star skewered in the 14 seasons of South Park appear in tomorrow ’s 200th episode–my instinct is to fear for the Mormon faithful .
Insiders describe the musical as highly subversive and satiric , but with a generous spirit .
The theater has n’t yet been named , but financing is in place and the musical is fully formed after being run through three workshops .
Rudin was producer and Garefino was executive producer on the 2004 feature Team America : World Police , the puppet film that was written by the South Park duo and directed by Parker .
While they were making the film , Rudin suggested that Parker and Stone see Avenue Q , the Tony - winning musical that is also done with puppets .
The South Park duo stayed in touch with Lopez and Moore and that led to them collaborating on the Broadway - bound musical .
Though they are new to Broadway , Parker and Stone are no strangers to musicals .
Their 1999 film South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut , featured n Oscar - nominated song , and the film was such a hit with the New York Film Critics Circle that it established its first award for an animated film to honor the picture .
The musical is expected to be one of Broadway ’s highest profile openings for the 2010 - 2011 season , and it comes as South Park moves into its 15th season on Comedy Central .
Below is teaser for tomorrow night ’s 200th episode :

AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - A
Dutch sex shop will be giving away 2,000 “ Pope condoms ” this weekend in a dig at the Roman Catholic Church .
De Condoomfabriek ( The Condom Factory ) said it wanted to make a point about sexually transmitted diseases , unwanted pregnancies and the Vatican ’s opposition to contraceptives .
The condom wrapper carries the image of a papal figure with an unmistakable general likeness to Pope Benedict , though the figure ’s face is removed .
It bears the words “ I SAID NO !
We say YES ! ” framing the papal image .
The suggestion of a “ pope condom ” caused a diplomatic row last month when Britain ’s Foreign Office was forced to apologize for a memorandum by a civil servant that suggested Benedict launch a papal - brand condom on his pending visit to the UK .
Get the Recipe Spatchcocked ( Butterflied ) Roast Chicken With Quick Jus
Who does n't love roast chicken ?
Crackly , crisp , salty skin .
Moist tender meat .
Deep aromas filling the house .
Little bits of fat and meat to tear off with your fingers and teeth as you linger over the the last sips of your whiskey ( whiskey goes with chicken , right ? ) .
It 's about as classy and classic as food can get , and my go - to meal for company .
But to be perfectly frank , most of the time , I do n't like roast chicken , because most of the time , well , chickens just are n't roasted very well .
You see that perfectly golden - brown beauty above ?
Well here 's what 's really going on .
The problem is one I 'm sure everyone here has experienced : dry breast meat .
And at first glance , there seems to be no way around it .
With a chicken , there are two factors that inevitably conflict with each other .
Above 150 °F , breast meat dries out .
Chicken breast meat is very lean .
Looked at under a microscope , it 's essentially a bundle of straw - like fibers filled with juice .
As these fibers are heated , they begin to shrink , squeezing that juice out .
Despite government warnings to cook chicken to an unthinkable 165 °F , in reality , above 150 ° F or so , muscle fibers are almost completely collapsed .
Congratulations
Your chicken is now officially cardboard .
On the other hand ...
. Chicken breast meat is very lean .
Looked at under a microscope , it 's essentially a bundle of straw - like fibers filled with juice .
As these fibers are heated , they begin to shrink , squeezing that juice out .
Despite government warnings to cook chicken to an unthinkable 165 °F , in reality , above 150 ° F or so , muscle fibers are almost completely collapsed .
Your chicken is now officially cardboard .
On the other hand ...
Leg meat must be cooked to at least 170 °F .
OK , that 's a bit of an overstatement .
It 'll still be perfectly edible at around 160 °F ( any lower than that and the abundant connective tissue will remain tough ) , but the juices will still be pink or red , and it will not have yet reached optimal tenderness .
Unlike breast meat , leg meat contains plenty of collagen .
Given a high enough temperature ( say 160 °F and above ) , and a long enough time ( say , the 10 minutes it takes the legs to get from 160 °F to 170 °F ) , this collagen will begin to convert into rich gelatin , keeping the meat moist and juicy , even after the muscle fibers have shed most of their liquid .
So the question is , how do you cook legs to 170 °F without taking the breasts beyond 150 °F ?
I 'm going to go ahead and give away the answer here : Butterflying .
Why does this work better than any other method ?
Well let 's first take a look at some of the other " fixes " I 've experimented with in the past :
Brining the bird ( which we 've already discussed in relation to turkey ) by placing it in a salt water bath for a few hours helps a bit .
It loosens up muscle fibers , allowing them to retain more moisture as they cook , and giving you a slightly expanded moist temperature range for the breasts .
The problem ?
Well , first off , it 's fussy .
Secondly , it soaks the skin right through to the skin* ruining its chances of attaining crispness ( and let 's face it , what 's a roast chicken without crisp skin ? ) .
It also tends to dilute the flavor of the bird .
Not so bad for robust turkey , but mild chicken needs all the flavor it can muster .
* Bonus points for anyone who can name that reference .
Hint : classic 1960s comedy .
Salting ( or " dry - brining " ) the chicken is a better solution .
It works much like brining does , but rather than use a water and salt solution , you instead rub salt directly onto the meat and and skin of the bird and let it rest uncovered in the fridge for a few hours ( or overnight ) .
Initially , the salt draws moisture out through the process of osmosis .
It then dissolves in this liquid , creating a concentrated brine , which eventually gets reabsorbed .
So you get the benefits of the brine , without watering down the flavor of the chicken .
It also does n't saturate the skin the way a wet brine does .
Sounds great , but it's at best a buffer , keeping the breast meat a little moister , but still far from optimal .
I 've seen it mistakenly suggested that barding or basting by draping the chicken with a fatty meat like bacon or spooning melted butter or pan juices over the top as it cooks will help it stay moist .
The theory is that some of the fat will get absorbed into the breast meat .
Poppycock .
That breast is shrinking , and it ain't absorbing nothing !
As much as I love most things wrapped in bacon ( yes dear , I 'm talking about you ) , bacon makes the chicken taste like , well , bacon .
And if I wanted bacon , I 'd cook bacon .
It also precludes the possibility of crisp skin .
Basting with hot pan juices not only increases the rate at which it cooks , exacerbating the dryness , the moisture content in it ( or in melted butter , for that matter — about 18 % ) also keeps the skin from crisping properly .
It 's much better to brush it occasionally with oil ( or rendered duck or chicken fat if you want to get fancy ) as it cooks , which can help the skin brown more evenly , but does nothing for the moistness issues .
At the very least , if you 're going to cook a whole chicken , you ought to truss it , like the chicken in the photo at the top .
What 's the point there ?
Well , it plumps up the breast meat a bit , making it thicker .
Thicker food takes longer to cook , so that keeps the temperature of the breast meat down a bit .
It 's the method Thomas Keller recommends , and was my go - to method for a while .
But it 's still not perfect , and I found myself often having to choose the lesser of two evils between dry breast meat or chewy thighs .
So far , all these methods are at best Band - Aids .
They do n't address the root of the problem .
In order to perfectly cook chicken , you must find a way to cook it such that the breast meat comes to 150 °F just as the legs reach 170 °F .
Performing fancy acrobatics in a roasting pan , flipping the bird ( both figuratively and literally when you get splattered with hot chicken juice ) three or four times so that the legs get exposed to the bulk of the oven 's heat works , but there just has to be an easier way , right ?
I 've since switched over to butterflying the bird , and have always been impressed with the results , but it never occurred to me why it works so well until I accidentally burnt a tray full of breadcrumbs the other day .
This is what they looked like :
Turns out that as the hot air rises from the bottom of the oven , the wide sheet pan creates eddies in the convection currents , causing whatever 's at the edge of the pans to cook a little faster than the center .
Now with a quick cooking item like , say , a cookie , this is n't much of a problem .
But leave your breadcrumbs in the oven for a full thirty minutes , and you see it beginning to express itself .
Notice the center of the pan is much blonder than the dark , burnt edges ?
And notice how that blond spot is suspiciously breast - shaped ?
Butterflying the chicken allows you to take advantage of this uneven cooking .
By cutting out the spine of the chicken ( perfect for making quick jus as the chicken roasts ! ) and flattening the carcass , you can arrange it in the pan such that the breasts lie right in the cooler center , while the legs sit closer to the edge of the pan , where they are exposed to more energy .
The result is a bird that cooks exactly the way you want it .
Blast it in a hot oven ( I 'm talking 450 to 500 °F here ) , and you 'll find that miraculously , the breast will reach 150 °F just as the legs reach 170 °F and the skin reaches delicious .
No brining , no salting , no flipping , no problem .
Of course you do lose the prettiness of brining a whole trussed bird to the table for carving , but you gain the vastly preferable prettiness of perfectly cooked meat instead , and that 's a trade - off I 'll take any day .

By George Will - May 13 , 2010
WASHINGTON --
To understand the pertinence to America of events in Greece , notice General Motors ' most recent misbehavior .
A television commercial featuring CEO Ed Whitacre demonstrates the institutional murkiness and intellectual dishonesty that result when the line between public and private sectors disappears .
In the commercial , Whitacre says GM has " repaid our government loan in full . "
Rep. Paul Ryan , R - Wis. , noted that GM used government funds to pay back the government :
It " simply transferred $ 6.7 billion from one taxpayer - funded TARP account to another . "
The government still owns 60.8 percent of GM 's common equity , and the Congressional Budget Office projects that the government will lose about $ 34 billion of the $ 82 billion of TARP funds dispersed to the automotive industry .
When Ryan and two colleagues asked the Treasury Department for clarification , they got this careful reply : " Treasury has never suggested that the loan repayment represented a full return of all government assistance . "
A Treasury press release did say " GM Repays Treasury Loan in Full . "
The loan is , however , a small part of taxpayer exposure .
Under crony capitalism , when government and corporate America merge , both dissemble .
Now American taxpayers also own a little bit of a small nation .
They provide the U.S. contribution of 17 percent of the assets of the International Monetary Fund , which is giving Greece $ 39 billion ( the IMF also is contributing $ 321 billion to a " stabilization " fund for other eurozone nations with debt problems ) .
So the U.S. government , which would borrow 42 cents of every dollar it spends under the president 's 2011 budget , is borrowing to rescue Greece and others from the consequences of their borrowing .
That nation , whose GDP is below that of the Dallas - Fort Worth metropolitan area , is " too big to fail , " meaning too inconveniently connected to too many big banks .
Bailing out Greece really rescues European banks that improvidently bought Greek bonds .
Visit here for a useful New York Times graphic illustrating how European nations borrow from one another .
For example , Italy owes France ( French banks ) $ 511 billion , a sum nearly equal to 20 percent of France 's GDP .
About one - third of Portugal 's debt is held by Spain , which has $ 238 billion of its debt held by Germany and $ 220 billion by France .
Russell Roberts of George Mason University notes that this " discourages prudence and wariness " because when " everyone has financed everyone else , you can justify bailing everyone out . "
At the Parthenon last week , the Greek Communist Party , which got 8 percent of the vote in the last national election , draped banners emblazoned with the hammer and sickle : " Peoples of Europe Rise Up . "
Of course .
" Arise ye prisoners of starvation " exhorts " The Internationale , " the left 's ancient anthem .
But who is to arise against whom ?
Time was , the European left said it spoke for horny - handed sons of toil oppressed in dark Satanic mills .
But Athens ' so - called " anti-government mobs " have been composed mostly of government employees going berserk about threats to their entitlements .
Even Greek air force pilots went on strike .
The government , unable to say how many employees it has , promises to count them .
It cannot fire many of them because article 103 , paragraph 4 of the Greek constitution says : " Civil servants holding posts provided by law shall be permanent so long as these posts exist . "
America 's projected $ 9.7 trillion in budget deficits in this decade will drive the nation 's debt to 90 percent of GDP ( Greece 's is 124 percent ) .
So some people say that to avoid a Greek - style crisis , America should adopt a value - added tax ( VAT ) .
But Europe 's most troubled nations -- the PIIGS : Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece and Spain -- have VATs of 20 percent , 21 percent , 20 percent , 21 percent and 16 percent , respectively .
As part of its austerity penance , the Greek government is going to give itself more money by raising its VAT to 23 percent .
Germans are furious about being the biggest bailers in this bailout of a nation where tax evasion is pandemic .
They have not been assuaged by being told by their chancellor , Angela Merkel , that the stakes are stupendous :
Their money will save " Europe . "
Hearing that , Greeks bearing banners proclaiming " Out with the IMF " might think :
Why accept " austerity " ( as that is understood in Greece -- no more annual bonuses of two months ' salary , no more retirement at 53 ) ?
Suppose , after pocketing some of the bailout , we just threaten to collapse and make a mess of " Europe " ?
Greece now knows the terrific strength of weakness .
Beware of Greeks -- or any other people -- receiving gifts .
Let 's start by making sure everybody 's on the same page : in order to use the App Store , you have to agree to the iTunes Store Terms of Service and / or the App Store Terms of Service .
You can confirm this yourself just by reading the documents : they say as much in their all - caps preambles .
The two documents are pretty similar ; this post will give section numbers from the App Store Terms of Service , but the same language appears in the iTunes Store Terms of Service and so our analysis applies identically to it .
You can read both those documents on Apple 's site , and we have a copy of that page as it exists today to provide this commentary .
Along the same lines , we 'll be talking about GPL v2 specifically in this blog post , since that 's the license at issue , but this analysis would apply to all versions of the GNU GPL and AGPL .
Section 6 of GPL v2 says :
Each time you redistribute the Program ( or any work based on the Program ) , the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy , distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions .
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients ' exercise of the rights granted herein .
( Emphasis added . )
This last sentence is a crucial part of the strong copyleft in the GPL and AGPL : it prevents distributors from using separate legal agreements , like Terms of Service or NDAs , to take away the freedoms that the license is supposed to grant .
This is the license condition that Apple is violating when it distributes GPL - covered software through the App Store .
In the App Store Terms of Service , the programs that you download from the App Store are called " Products " ( the definition is in section 4 ) .
In section 9 ( b ) , the Terms set out " Usage Rules " for the software :
You acknowledge that Products contain security technology that limits your usage of Products to the following applicable Usage Rules , and , whether or not Products are limited by security technology , you agree to use Products in compliance with the applicable Usage Rules .
The Terms go on to list the specific usage rules .
In effect , the Usage Rules do the same thing as Apple 's Digital Restrictions Management — narrowly limiting what you can do with the software — but the method is different : they work legally instead of technologically .
Rules ( i ) and ( iii ) say that you are required to accept the Terms of Service to use the software , and that you may only install the software on five approved devices .
These rules are exactly the kind of " further restrictions " that are prohibited by the GPL : they limit your ability to use and distribute the software .
Some people have pointed out that the App Store Terms of Service say that a separate license to the software is provided to you by the developer , and that 's true .
But the Usage Rules are imposed on you no matter how the software is licensed .
The Terms themselves make this explicit this in section 9 ( c ) , which says :
The Usage Rules shall govern your rights with respect to the Products , in addition to any other terms or rules that may have been established between you and another party .
( Emphasis added . )
That 's the problem in a nutshell : Apple 's Terms of Service impose restrictive limits on use and distribution for any software distributed through the App Store , and the GPL does n't allow that .
This specific case involves other issues , but this is the one that 's most unique and deserves explanation .
We would 've liked to see Apple do the right thing and remove these limits , but it looks like that 's not going to happen .
Apple has removed GNU
Go from the App Store , continuing their longstanding habit of preventing users from doing anything that Apple does n't want them to do .
As we said in our initial announcement , this is disappointing but unsurprising ;
Apple made this choice a long time ago .
We just need to make sure everybody else gets the message : if you value your independence and creativity , you should be aware that Apple does n't .
Take your computing elsewhere .
Sadaam Maake is looking forward to meeting international fans at the World Cup
By Pumza Fihlani
BBC News , Tembisa
Sadaam Maake 's home would be a fitting shrine to the football gods .
It is filled with football memorabilia such as tickets , trophy replicas and jerseys .
More than 200 " makarapa " plastic helmets and vuvuzelas ( long trumpets ) - both essential garb for any South African soccer fan - adorn Mr Maake 's tiny lounge .
If you do n't hear a vuvuzela playing at a game you are not in South Africa .
This is our thing , international fans need to embrace it
Sadaam Maake
Before our interview , he insists on " kitting up first " - he changes into a tracksuit in the colours of the national team Bafana Bafana and completes the look with oversized glasses .
" I am ready to talk about football now , " he says , smiling .
At 55 years old , he says he has lost count of how many times he has been to a stadium .
" I 'm a soccer slave .
I drink football , I eat football , I talk football .
Everything in my life revolves around soccer .
It is my passion , " says Mr Maake .
Mr Maake has been dubbed South Africa 's " number one football fan " by local media and Kaizer Chiefs , one of South Africa 's oldest and biggest clubs , which he has supported for 40 years .
' Bitten by dogs '
An animated man , he speaks with great passion about the atmosphere in local football stadia .
" There are 80,000 people at a stadium at a go , all cheering and excited about the game .
Here I make new friends .
This is a hell of a joint , it is the first - and perhaps the last - time we ever host the World Cup in Africa .
We must do ourselves proud
Sadaam Maake
" For 90 minutes , a brotherhood prevails here , strangers become instant friends , " he says .
One of the unifiers at South Africa 's football matches is the sound of the vuvuzela .
Mr Maake is the man who made the vuvuzela famous here .
" If you do n't hear a vuvuzela playing at a game you are not in South Africa .
This is our thing , international fans need to embrace it . "
The trumpets will be blaring loudly at the World Cup , despite a number of attempts by some international clubs and commentators to have them banned because of the noise .
" I 've been arrested three times over the years and charged with public disturbance because of this vuvuzela .
I 've even been bitten by police dogs , but I will continue to play it , " he said .
But he warns fans to be careful when blowing the instrument near children or people with sensitive hearing .
Local ambassador Mr Maake says he cannot wait to see the national team play the world on home soil .
" This is a hell of a joint , it is the first - and perhaps the last - time we ever host the World Cup in Africa .
We must do ourselves proud , " he beams .
No woman can put up with a man who travels every day of the week just for football
Sadaam Maake
The avid fan adds that this is Africa 's time to shine .
" Africa 's ' six - pack ' - Nigeria , Ivory Coast , Cameroon , Algeria , SA and Ghana - must be in the final . "
" The cup must stay in Africa . "
Mr Maake is a local ambassador for the tournament - in the past year he has been touring the country educating people about the ticketing process .
He speaks candidly about the World Cup tickets , which still have not sold out .
" If the international fans do n't buy the tickets , we will .
We will fill the stadia ourselves and cheer for their teams if we have to .
" The teams will play whether the fans are there or not .
The game will go on , why should we be worried about ticket sales ? " he asks .
Sixty - four matches will be played during the June sporting event .
Mr Maake 's 13 children all have tickets to a number of them .
" If it were up to me , I 'd watch all the games .
My family and I will go to all the games where South Africa and all the African countries are playing and some international teams like Portugal , " he said .
Mr Maake , who lives in in Tembisa , east of Johannesburg , loves football so much he sings about it .
He released an album some years ago named after his son Cellular , titled Vuvuzela Cellular .
" There is a lot of singing at stadia .
I came up with the idea of an album because of that .
I love singing about football because it makes fans happy . "
He worked on it with his children .
Though none of the songs are likely to be chart - toppers , he still he has a large following in his home province of Limpopo .
A price worth paying ?
Mr Maake 's obsessive love for the game has come at a price .
He has never wed , saying he has had difficulties finding a woman who understands his passion for football .
" No woman can put up with a man who travels every day of the week just for football .
Even when I 'm at home this is all I talk about , " he laughs .
South African football fans collect decorated helmets " Just look at how the lounge is decorated , what woman would like this , " he asks pointing to the pile of helmets under a table in the lounge .
The relationship between makarapa and fans dates back to the 1970s when they were originally worn to protect the head from beer bottles thrown at riotous games .
Nowadays , they are purely decorative , with fans expressing their individuality by painting the helmets .
Mr Maake 's passion has also cost him his job - on several occasions .
He first worked at a retail store in Johannesburg and was later employed at a car rental company .
" I 'd be called to disciplinary hearings all the time because I would miss work during the week if my team was playing .
I just could n't miss a game .
" It just was n't working out ; I did n't try to find a job since .
But my football has been taking care of me , " he explains .
With a month to go to the World Cup , Mr Maake has started learning a few languages including French - all to welcome international visitors .
He has the basics down , but says the greatest welcome they will receive is the hospitality of South Africans and the buzz around the World Cup .
" We are ready , we are waiting .
This is it , " he cheers .

MANILA , Philippines -
An American seminarian convicted of sexual misconduct with a 15 - year - old boy has been ordained a priest in the Philippines , a news agency carried by a newspaper in the United Kingdom said Thursday .
The Guardian reported that Joseph Skelton , who was kicked out from the St. John Provincial Seminary in Detroic , Michigan in 1988 , is now serving as parochial vicar of the St. Vincent Ferrer Parish in Calape town , Bohol province .
The report added that Skelton is " also a popular gospel singer " in the Philippines .
It said that after his dismissal from the St. John Provincial Seminary , Skelton moved to the Philippines and continued his seminary studies in Manila and then ordained in 2001 in the diocese of Tagbilaran , Bohol .
The news item quoted retired Bishop Leopoldo Tumulak , the ordaining bishop , as saying that he was aware of Skelton 's " effeminate ways " but argued that there was no case against him .
The report , however , said that the Tagbilaran diocese was informed by the archdiocese in Detroit about Skelton 's conviction after learning that he has been ordained in the Philippines .
The former bishop said he could not remember receiving the letter and explained that the letter could have been " too late " if he " has served already the conviction . "
Tumulak said Skelton " is trying to live well " and that the American priest should already be forgiven because " it 's a little bit different " in the Philippines .
The story was part of the Associated Press ' piece on priests convicted or accused of sexual misconduct and sent to other countries .
Quoting a former Benedictine monk , Richard Sipe , the report said priests in trouble are sent to missions abroad to avoid scandals .
The story also mentioned a priest who committed an offense in Los Angeles and went to the Philippines , where Church officials allegedly mailed him checks .
YouTube wants to rock MySpace .
The Google - owned video site is expected to announce Wednesday a new program , dubbed Musicians Wanted , to lure independent musicians to its social - networking site .
The program targets independent artists , offering them an easy way to create their own home page , or channel , on YouTube and share in the ad revenues generated by their videos .
Until now , YouTube has offered the revenue - sharing option only to artists who have contracts with record labels or who have special contracts with the video - sharing site .
“ We ’re now opening up the program to all independent musicians , ” said Michele Flannery , YouTube ’s music manager . “
For YouTube , which announced a similar program called Filmmakers Wanted in January , the effort is part of a larger push by the video site to generate more revenue and become an entertainment destination for viewers rather than just a repository for homemade cat videos .
For MySpace , competition from the world ’s largest search company comes at a time when the site is struggling to regain some of its former luster ; News Corp. - owned MySpace once was the premier social network among musicians and their youthful audience .
Despite its recent travails and management turmoil , MySpace Music remains the No. 1 music site , according to ComScore .
Last month , MySpace Music logged about 30 million unique visitors , up 63 % from a year earlier , browsing through the profiles of some 13 million artists on the site .
Some musicians , however , have been migrating away from MySpace as its traffic dropped below that of other social networks , including Facebook , whose 112 visitors in February were roughly twice the overall traffic of MySpace that month , according to ComScore .
One of those musicians is Saul Paul , an acoustic hip - hop artist from Austin , Texas , who has moved away from his 4 - year - old MySpace page and is doing more with Facebook , Twitter , WordPress and YouTube .
“ Activity on MySpace has died down significantly , ” said the 33 - year - old independent musician .
“ No doubt people still go there , but my use of it has really minimized .
MySpace was a trend .
And trends are just that .
They come and go . ”
YouTube is more video - centric , while MySpace focuses on allowing users to quickly sample and discover music .
MySpace also lets artists sell concert tickets from their MySpace page via a partnership with LiveNation and Ticketmaster .
But the two are increasingly incorporating similar features , including enabling fans to buy digital music downloads and sell merchandise .
While both sites attract millions of viewers daily , they face a similar challenge , said Russ Crupnick , an analyst with the NPD Group .
“ The big issue for both YouTube and MySpace is how do they monetize this huge audience , ” Crupnick said .
“ This is an industry that ’s lost 50 % of its revenue in the last decade . ”

Another $ 1 m pay day for Blair as the former PM lands a job as a climate change guru
TONY Blair has landed a lucrative job advising an American billionaire on how to make money out of tackling climate change .
The former Prime Minister is expected to be paid at least a million dollars ( £ 700,000 ) a year to act as a ' strategic adviser ' to Khosla Ventures , a firm of venture capitalists based in California 's Silicon Valley .
The firm , set up by Indian - born dollar billionaire Vinod Khosla , backs firms looking to make a fortune out of developing technology to tackle climate change .
New partnership : Khosla Ventures founder Vinod Khosla looks on as former Prime Minister Tony Blair speaks during the Khosla Ventures Cleantech Discussion in Sausalito , California
Mr Blair , who recently told friends he needs to make £ 5 million a year to get by , already has an international role advising world leaders on climate change .
In his new job he will be expected to cash in his contacts to help open doors for the
firm , further blurring the boundaries between his public roles and private earnings .
Mr Khosla said that ' with Tony 's advice and influence we will create opportunities for entrepreneurs and innovators to devise practical solutions that can solve today 's most pressing problems ' .
Khosla Ventures declined to comment on Mr Blair 's salary , but industry sources suggested he was likely to earn at least £ 700,000 a year .
The money will be channelled through Mr Blair 's secretive network of companies , which make it impossible to pinpoint exactly who is employing him and how much he is earning .
In a statement yesterday Mr Blair insisted that his work for the firm could make a contribution to saving the planet .
He said : ' Solving the climate crisis is more than just a political agenda item , it 's an urgent priority that requires innovation , creativity and ambition .
' I share a clear vision with Vinod , one of the earliest leaders in clean - tech investment , that entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and beyond will have a tremendous impact on our environmental future . '
Mr Khosla , 55 , said the arrangement with Mr Blair would allow him to ' ask Tony for advice ' on environmental policy and other topics .
He told the Wall Street Journal : ' Tony 's going to help us in many areas that techie nerds like us in Silicon Valley do n't understand . '
The new job is the latest in a string of lucrative posts taken up by Mr Blair since he left office in June 2007 .
Earlier this year he was accused of cashing in on his Iraq War contacts after it emerged that his deals included a lucrative contract to advise South Korean oil firm UI Energy Corporation , which has extensive interests in Iraq .
He also has a £ 1 million deal to advise the ruling royal family of Kuwait , which borders Iraq .
He has been paid a £ 4.6 million advance for his memoirs and is thought to have earned at least £ 9 million from public speaking , commanding fees of £ 100,000 a time .
He has a number of financial consultancies worth at least £ 2.5 million a year and has set up Tony Blair Associates to bid for lucrative consultancy work with foreign governments , particularly in the Middle East .
Aides insist that he and his companies pay tax in the UK .
( CNN ) --
A rotund , voracious figure follows a trail through a maze .
As he rounds a corner , he is confronted by ghostlike monsters attempting to wipe him out .
He turns and flees , but soon discovers an additional source of power that briefly turns him from hunted into hunter .
This simple premise gave birth to Pac - Man , the most successful coin -operated video game in history .
The pop-culture sensation , released in Japan 30 years ago this week , created millions of glazed - eye addicts and spawned more than 400 products , including a cartoon , a breakfast cereal and a hit song .
Many credit Pac - Man , an iconic symbol of the ' 80s , with expanding video gaming to a wider audience .
" Pac - Man 's debut represents one of the earliest attempts to introduce casual gaming to a field that was already dominated by shooters and high - energy arcade experiences , " said Scott Steinberg , head of video game consulting firm TechSavvy Global .
" The original arcade cabinet was able to strike the perfect balance between challenge and fun without sacrificing depth or scope . "
The original arcade classic was imagined by Namco developer Toru Iwatani in 1979 , although it did n't reach the U.S until the fall of 1980 .
As the legend goes , Iwatani was inspired by his partially eaten pizza pie and turned it into a gaming character : a big yellow dot that gobbled up smaller dots , and avoided four deadly ghosts , as it careened through a maze .
" During the early stages of the arcade industry , where most games skewed towards a male audience , we saw the need to expand our appeal , " explained Kenji Hisatsune , president , CEO and COO of Namco Networks America Inc .
" In order to fill this void , Pac - Man was created as a ' cute ' game with both good and bad characters that were colorful and endearing . "
It took eight people 15 months to complete the orginal Japanese game , which was slightly different than the versions people would later play overseas .
The ghosts were initially called monsters , and Pac - Man ate cookies instead of the familiar dots .
Even his name was changed once he crossed the Pacific Ocean .
" The original Japanese name was Puckman , which evolved from the Japanese word paku , meaning ' chomp , ' " Hisatsune said .
" Given the closeness to a certain explicit four - letter word , a lot of arcade operators were worried that vandals would alter the letter P. Eventually , ' Pac ' was suggested as an alternate name . "
Developers also created the four colorful ghosts , Pinky , Blinky , Inky and Clyde , with distinct personalities .
For example , Blinky likes to chase while Pinky lurks in ambush .
It was a novel concept in gaming that was n't being developed at that time .
Pac -Man was licensed for distribution in the U.S. by Midway , a division of Bally , and it reached American shores in October 1980 , at a time when shooter games such as Space Invaders ruled the arcades .
Its light - hearted originality and simplicity -- players needed only to move a joystick -- made it an immediate hit .
Some speculated that Pac - Man became popular in bars in part because gamers needed only one hand to play and could hold a drink in the other .
In the first 15 months after its release in the U.S. , Namco sold more than 100,000 arcade units , while fans spent more than $ 1 billion in quarters to fuel what would become known as " Pac - Man fever . "
Lisa Sharp , a 36 - year - old finance director at Georgia Tech , remembers cashing her $ 10 weekly allowance into quarters to play Pac - Man for as long as the coins lasted .
Her first taste of the game came from an unlikely place : her dentist 's office .
" I hated going to the dentist , but he had Pac - Man and Centipede in his office where you could play for free , " Sharp said .
" It was the only thing that calmed me down , and I loved it . "
As a child , Sharp would sneak away to her corner 7 - Eleven with her pockets full of coins to pump into the arcade machine .
She was n't a gaming geek at the time , but Pac - Man gave her a sense of accomplishment .
" You keep going [ throughout the levels of the game ] .
It gets harder , but it was a feeling of progress , " she explained .
" Plus , as a kid , I did n't want to get eaten by a ghost . "
Pac - Man 's appeal to kids was reinforced by a Saturday - morning animated TV series and a breakfast cereal with marshmallow ghosts .
In all , Pac - Man has been licensed to more than 250 companies for products ranging from air fresheners to bed sheets to costumes .
An unlicensed sequel , Ms. Pac - Man , followed in 1981 .
Namco soon embraced the game and adopted it as an official title .
In all , more than 30 official spin - offs , plus numerous clones , were inspired by Pac - Man 's success .
" Pac - Man Fever , " a novelty song by Jerry Buckner and Gary Garcia , reached No. 9 on the Billboard pop chart in early 1982 .
Sharp said she tried sequels such as Ms. Pac - Man but always preferred the original game .
" I would play every chance I got , " she said , although the game disappeared from many arcades by the 1990s .
" It became harder to find Pac - Man [ as I got older ] . "
Although the game is far removed from its 1980s heyday , Pac - Man 's appeal continues to endure .
In 1999 , Billy Mitchell of Florida became the first player to achieve a perfect Pac - Man score -- 3,333,360 .
And versions of the game remain popular on the iPhone and iPod Touch .
Google 's logo , which often changes to reflect events of the day , became a playable Pac - Man game on Friday , spelling out the company 's name .
A Google spokeswoman said the game will be available over the weekend and gameplay reaches 256 levels .
Namco's Hisatsune believes Pac - Man 's combination of cute characters and cat - and - mouse gameplay are at the core of its popularity .
He also thinks Pac - Man 's biggest legacy will be its pioneering status as the first game to appeal broadly to men and women .
Some even attribute today 's wide variety of video games to Pac - Man 's acceptance in the culture .
" I do n't think that it's an understatement to say that today we would have no Mario , Master Chief or Lara Croft if it was n't for the pioneering efforts of the grinning , little , yellow dot - gobbler , " said Steinberg .
" It remains as engaging , fresh and relevant as the day it first shipped . "
Hisatsune has a message for today 's game designers .
" Pac - Man has taught game makers to not be afraid , to take risks and strive to create games that bring the world closer together , " he said .
Congressman : Bernanke broke promise that U.S. taxpayer dollars would not be sent to European banks
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Monday , May 10 , 2010
As Europe is bailed out to the tune of nearly $ 1 trillion dollars , Congressman Ron Paul warns that the constant monetization of debt , allied with taxpayer - funded bailouts , will inevitably lead to runaway inflation and the collapse of paper currencies .
Under the terms of the Federal Reserve ’s credit swap deal with the EU – in addition to an additional IMF bailout of which U.S. taxpayers will be picking up 20 per cent ( $ 57 billion dollars ) of the tab , Paul pointed out that not just taxpayers but “ anybody that buys anything ” will be funding the European bailout because of the attendant inflationary consequences .
“ The prices are going up already , producer prices are going up , the cost of living will go up so everyone in American will suffer and eventually the whole world will suffer because we cannot carry the whole world with our dollar , ” Paul told Fox Business , adding that eventually people will lose confidence in the dollar .
The Congressman agreed with the host that the bailouts would lead to the crash of paper currencies , noting that last week ’s stock market turmoil was accompanied by gold acting as a currency rather than just reacting to the value of the dollar .

A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ Gold has been money for 6,000 years and it will remain that way and it will rule the roost , ” said Paul , adding that the dollar was weak in comparison with the strength of gold .
“ All paper currencies are under attack and this cannot be sustained , ” said the Congressman .
Paul then explained how the ECB has completely reversed its promise that it would n’t monetize debt and how Bernanke had also gone back on his word that U.S. dollars would be use for this purpose .
“ When I talked to Bernanke last time in the Committee he said they had no intention of bailing out Greece but they are , through the IMF as well as opening up these swap lines to all the central banks , so it is on the shoulders on the burden of the American taxpayer and our dollar so all we ’re doing is perpetuating a very very bad system and this is not a solution at all , ” he said .
Paul agreed with the host that the bailout was merely a stunt to buy time while failing to address the underlying problem of European socialism and the entitlement culture , which is fast running out of money with which to keep itself ticking over .

Live rock is here
Today I received some Live Rock from Premium Aquatics .
I ordered from here based on the generally good reputation that this company has on the reef tank forums .
All looks good .
There are 6 or 7 rocks , all of which have spots of coraline .
I have n’t looked real closely yet , but so far no hitchhikers .
I plan to keep the rocks in the basement curing for a while .
I ’ll check the ammonia level every few days , and change the water frequently .
This will allow me to plan out a good aquascape and to make sure I get rid of any nasty critters that may have come along for the ride .
As reported by Computerworld ( from the recent Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit 2010 ) , Google plans to assign two developers to work on integrating enhancements developed for the Android Linux kernel into the official Linux development tree maintained by Linus Torvalds .
Android developer Arve Hjønnevåg has already taken a first step in this direction and sent a number of changes to the kernel development team for appraisal .
Kernel developer Greg Kroah - Hartman notes that integrating these patches into the official Linux kernel should also make it possible to merge a number of drivers .
Some kernel developers have criticised parts of the submitted code , and it will require at least one round of revision , but this is entirely normal and frequently occurs even with code from old hands .
Some time ago , with only broad agreement from the Google developers , a number of Android drivers had been merged into the staging area in Linux kernel 2.6.29 .
Then , in a highly public fashion , these drivers were ejected from Linux 2.6.33 and a number of accusations were made of poor collaboration between Google and the kernel developers .
Now the situation , which is even more complex when examined in detail , looks to be improving somewhat .
Time will tell the extent to which this leads to genuine collaboration and alleviates or dispels the causes of the current criticism of Google .
Greg Kroah - Hartman outlined the problem areas in a recent talk at the Embedded Linux Conference .
LWN . net reproduces them in some detail in its article " ELC : Android and the community " .

Small chemical ornaments ( cones ) slow the release of anti-cancer antibodies ( blue ) from this functionalized mesoporous silica ( orange ) ( artist 's rendering , not to scale ) Credit : Mike Perkins / PNNL
Packaging anti-cancer drugs into particles of chemically modified silica improve the drugs ' ability to fight skin cancer in mice , according to new research .
Results published May 3 in the Journal of the American Chemical Society online show the honeycombed particles can help anti-cancer antibodies prevent tumor growth and prolong the lives of mice .
" We are very excited by our preliminary results , " said biochemist Chenghong Lei of the Department of Energy 's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , part of the team of PNNL and University of Washington scientists .
" We plan to do some additional , larger studies with animals .
We hope the results hold up well enough to take it to clinical trials somewhere down the road . "
Anti-cancer antibodies are some of the most promising types of cancer therapies .
The antibodies target a particular protein on cancer cells and -- in a poorly understood way -- kill off the cells .
Examples include herceptin for one form of breast cancer and cetuximab for colon cancer .
Unlike popping a pill , however , antibody - based treatments require patients to go in for intravenous drips into the arm .
These sessions cost time and money , and expose healthy tissue to the antibody , causing side effects .
Packaging antibodies into particles would concentrate them at the tumor and possibly reduce side effects .
Other research has shown silicon to be well tolerated by cells , animals and people .
So , in collaboration with tumor biologist Karl Erik Hellstrom 's group at UW , the scientists explored particles made from material called mesoporous silica against cancer in mice .
" The silica 's mesoporous nature provides honeycomb - like structures that can pack lots of individual drug molecules , " said PNNL material scientist Jun Liu .
" We 've been exploring the material for our energy and environmental problems , but it seemed like a natural fit for drug delivery . "
In previous work , the team created particles that contain nano - sized hexagonal pores that hold antibodies , enzymes or other proteins .
In addition , adorning the silica pores with small chemical groups helps trap proteins inside .
But not permanently -- these proteins slowly leak out like a time - release capsule .
The researchers wanted to test whether anti-cancer antibodies packaged in modified mesoporous silica would be more effective against tumors than free - flowing antibodies .
To do so , they first chemically modified mesoporous silica particles of about six to 12 micrometers ( about 1/10 the diameter of human hair ) .
These particles contained pores of about 30 nanometers in diameter .
They found that the extent and choice of chemical modification -- amine , carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid groups -- determined how fast the antibodies leaked out , a property that can be exploited to fine tune particles to different drugs .
Additional biochemical tests showed that the antibodies released from the silica cages appeared to be structurally sound and worked properly .
They then tested the particles in mouse tumors at UW , filling them with an antibody called anti-CTLA4 that fights many cancers , including melanoma , a skin cancer .
The team injected these packaged antibodies into mouse tumors .
The team also injected antibodies alone or empty particles in other mice with tumors .
The packaged antibodies slowed the growth of tumors the best .
Treatment started when tumors were about 27 cubic millimeters .
Untreated tumors grew to 200 cubic millimeters about 5 days post - treatment .
Tumors treated with antibodies alone reached 200 cubic millimeters on day 9 , showing that antibodies do slow tumor growth .
But tumors treated with packaged antibodies did n't reach 200 cubic millimeters until day 30 , a significant improvement over antibodies alone .
The team repeated the experiment and found the treatment also prolonged the lives of diseased mice .
Of five mice that had been treated with particles alone , all died within 21 days after treatment .
But of five mice treated with the packaged antibodies , three were still alive at 21 days , and two at 34 days , when the experiment ended .
The team also measured how much antibody remained in the tumors .
Two and four days after injection , the researchers found significantly more antibody in tumors when the antibodies had been encased in the silica particles than when the antibodies had been injected alone .
The team is testing other antibody - cancer pairs in mice , especially other cancers that form solid tumors such as breast cancer .
They are also going to explore how the antibodies delivered this way induce the immune system to better fight cancer .
" We want to understand the mechanism , because not much is known about how the slowly leaked antibodies induce changes in the immune system or in the micro-environment of the tumor , " said Hellstrom .

Fabio Capello must be awfully sure that Gareth Barry is on his way to a complete recovery , because nothing else could explain his lack of interest in addressing England 's principal weakness in their final match before embarking for South Africa .
Unless , that is , he really believes himself to be the one man in the entire world capable of devising a way in which Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard can function successfully together in central midfield .
England played the second half of today 's match with the Chelsea and Liverpool kingpins alongside each other , after Gerrard had replaced the clearly underpowered Tom Huddlestone at the interval .
With Shaun Wright - Phillips and Joe Cole out wide , Gerrard and Lampard formed a double pivot as England went from a goal down to a 2 - 1 win by courtesy of a brace of Japanese own - goals .
The performance was certainly better in the second 45 minutes – less stodgy , more fluid , with fewer misplaced passes – but to ascribe this to a sudden blooming of the central midfield partnership would be to submit to an old and damaging delusion .
Many are happy to do so .
During ITV 's post - match analysis , Andy Townsend and Gareth Southgate could be heard uttering comforting phrases like " They 're such good players " and " They 're intelligent enough to know that when one of them goes [ forward ] , the other sits " and " Maybe they have to do it now… " .
Being former good professionals themselves , neither Southgate nor Townsend can see any reason why such unusually gifted players as Gerrard and Lampard cannot form themselves into an effective partnership .
Sven -Goran Eriksson used to think the same thing .
For season after season , or so it seemed , the Swede struggled to get the pair to combine effectively in matching roles , while the intensity of the national debate grew around him .
Something that seemed so obvious was refusing to produce the necessary result , and its failure affected everything .
Looking back exactly four years , Eriksson 's uncertainty is plain to see .
In the first of the two warm - up matches , against Hungary , the manager started with Jamie Carragher in front of the back four , Lampard between David Beckham and Joe Cole in midfield , and Gerrard playing behind Michael Owen .
Against Jamaica four days later Gerrard and Lampard were together in the middle , Peter Crouch had joined Owen up front , and there was no one shielding the defence .
No doubt encouraged by a 6 - 0 win , Eriksson retained Gerrard and Lampard in tandem for the opening group match against Paraguay in Frankfurt , a thoroughly unsatisfactory 1 - 0 win courtesy of an own - goal .
There was no change to the midfield for the next match against Trinidad and Tobago , an equally unconvincing 2 - 0 victory .
Something had to change for the final group match against Sweden , and finally Eriksson recognised the need for a defensive specialist in midfield , Hargreaves coming into the starting line - up in place of Gerrard for a 2 - 2 draw that allowed England to top the group .
There were injury problems at right - back , however , and against Ecuador the versatile Hargreaves was asked to fill the gap , while Carrick sat in front of the defence and Lampard and Gerrard were reunited in midfield behind a lone striker , Wayne Rooney .
Nobody 's reputation was enhanced as England scraped into the quarter - finals where , with Hargreaves restored in place of Carrick , they took Portugal to penalties .
The outcome was disappointing , but there was no doubt that England had been rendered more effective by the decision to play a dedicated shielding midfielder , just as Alf Ramsey had discovered when he shifted the emphasis of his side by creating the role for an unconsidered Manchester United player called Nobby Stiles a year before the 1966 finals .
It would be flabbergasting were Capello only now , two and a half years into his tenure as England manager , to be going through the same tortuous process on his way to the same inevitable conclusion .
On paper and probably on the training ground , Lampard and Gerrard might seem ideal partners .
But the old " when one goes , the other sits " formula only works if both of them have a complete grasp of a complex and demanding role .
The holding midfield player is an expert in the arts of positioning and anticipation and a master of quick tackling and the sort of shrewdly weighted short passes that establish the momentum for the attacking midfielders .
Discipline and self - denial are his watchwords , unremitting concentration his trademark .
Playing alongside Barry under Capello , Lampard has shown that he can make a decent fist of the job , even though it restricts his important ability to make an impact around the edge of the opposing penalty area .
Gerrard , quite simply , has never demonstrated a similar aptitude .
Had Capello not been convinced that Barry will be fit and ready for action against the United States on 12 June , surely he would have given a run-out to Scott Parker .
The decision to leave the West Ham man on the bench against both Mexico and Japan may turn out to have been as foolhardy as the refusal of English football as a whole to groom players for such a pivotal role .
Given the manager 's own playing career , this seems a little curious .
For club and country , Capello was exactly the kind of player he now needs , and he might have been expected to do better than reopen an exhausted debate .
Or perhaps , like Ramsey , he has something up his sleeve .

Senate Minority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R - KY ) was on Meet The Press today , and he came right out of the gate trying to score political points on the Gulf oil by blaming the Obama administration for the incident , “ the administration ’s involvement in this will be a big part of the inquiry . ”
McConnell also stated his opposition to lifting the damages cap and making BP pay for everything .
Here is the video :

Host David “ No Fact Check Required ” Gregory asked McConnell about BP ’s role in the Gulf oil spill , “ Well , look , we ’re all angry about it .
This is a–an environmental disaster of gargantuan proportions , but the president ’s spent a whole lot of time pointing the finger at , at BP–and you should point the finger at BP and the other companies involved in it .
We ’re also interested in knowing what the administration did .
Was the Mineral Management Service a part of this administration that approved this site ?
It also approved this spill response plan .
What kind of oversight did the administration provide during the course of the drilling ?
There are plenty of questions that need to be answered , and there ’ll be adequate time for that .
But the administration ’s involvement in this will be a big part of the inquiry .
In the meantime , we need to do everything we can to stop this spill . ”
McConnell did n’t stop at just blaming Obama .
He also said that the damages cap should not be lifted , so BP should pay , but not that much , “ Well , the danger in that , of course , is that if you raise the cap too high , there will be no competition in the Gulf and you ’ll leave all the business to the big guys like BP .
What BP has said they need to be held to , which is they ’re going to pay for this .
They ought to pay for it , and they will pay for it .
But the danger of taking the cap too high is that you end up with only massive , very large oil producers able to meet that cap and produce in the Gulf .
And look , we ca n’t walk away–and the president ’s not suggesting this either –from offshore drilling .
As horrible as this is , it ’s important to remember that we get 30 percent of our oil from the Gulf and , if you shut that down , you ’d have $ 14 gasoline . ”
McConnell was pushing a big lie , because he knows that the oil drilled in the Gulf does not belong to the United States , as per the sweetheart agreement that our government has with the oil industry , the oil extracted from the Gulf belongs to the oil companies that drill for it , and they are free to sell it to anyone on the open global oil market .
He is lying to protect the industry , pure and simple .
This is what most Americans do n’t get .
The oil drilled here is not ours .
It does n’t belong to us .
It does not help with our energy woes .
Mitch McConnell is still trying to label the Gulf oil spill Obama ’s Katrina , but as our own Sarah Jones has pointed out , this incident really belongs to the Bush administration , specifically Dick Cheney , his secret energy task force , and deregulation .
That MMS thing that McConnell made reference to , the so called ass for gas scandal , that happened during Bush too .
Of course , the biggest problem with McConnell ’s comments is that he does n’t think BP should have to pay for the entire spill .
His fear mongering about $ 14 gasoline is an industry talking point that has no basis in fact or the market .
There is no way that not continuing to drill in the Gulf could result in $ 14 gasoline .
Once again , the Republicans show that their true interest rests not with holding corporate America accountable , but enabling their crimes for profit .
Brian Greene , a string theorist known for bringing his complex field of science to the masses , and Tracy Day , his wife and organizing partner behind World Science Festival , pose in Times Square , New York , Wednesday May 19 , 2010 .

( AP ) -- Brian
Greene works in a world where scientific reasoning rules all and imagination leads to the most unlikely truths .
Greene and other " string theorists " are exploring a possible scenario in which people and the world around us are actually a 3 - D holographic projection of two - dimensional data that exists outside the accessible universe .
It 's a concept so mindbending for those who do n't understand the complex math behind it that many might decide it 's best left to the academics .
But Greene wants to build public excitement about science , even as the U.S. loses ground in some areas - and intends to bring even the most complex ideas to the masses at this week 's World Science Festival , which starts June 2 .
" The idea is to ... find the compelling narrative and stories that allow these programs to really feel like an experience and not a lesson , " says Greene , wearing a leather jacket that practically exudes old - school , rock - star cool .
It 's an appropriate look for a man who has brought the possible inner workings of the universe to scores of non-geniuses through his book " The Elegant Universe " and the PBS specials by the same name .
The physicist founded the festival in 2008 with his wife , Tracy Day .
In a way , they say , it 's an extension of his work translating into layman 's terms the fundamentals of string theory - the idea that the universe and its most fundamental forces could be best explained if everything around us were made up of minuscule , vibrating strings .
Greene is not the only scientist working to show Americans the relevance of the field , and hoping to make it cooler for U.S. youth .
Despite the recent murmurings about the era of " geek chic , " many teenagers still largely see science as a dorky pursuit , says Michio Kaku , a presenter at the festival and another string theorist who 's built a career bringing his science to the public .
The numbers in the National Science Board 's yearly examination of science and engineering indicators paint a mixed picture for American students .
The number of high schoolers passing Advanced Placement exams in science quadrupled from 1990 to 2008 ; but between 2000 and 2006 the U.S. fell from seventh to 13th place in science literacy among 15 - year - olds who took an international test .
Greene worries the U.S. is seeing a dissipation of its leadership in his field and others .
When Columbia University , where Greene is a professor , received a grant earmarked for American postdoctoral fellows , Greene says his department had a hard time finding Americans to fill the spots .
At the same time , NASA has been directed to stop launching astronauts into orbit around the Earth and instead have them ride Russian rockets to and from the International Space Station .
And Greene and other physicists still keenly feel the loss of a large - scale project canceled in 1993 that could have launched exciting discoveries similar to those being made now at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva .
" If the superconducting super collider had been built in Waxahachie , Texas , and the world was coming here to undertake the most powerful collisions of particles that we 've ever been able to achieve , recreating conditions since the Big Bang in Texas as opposed to Geneva , would that be better for America ?
Yeah , I think it would be , " says Greene .
The Large Hadron Collider , which was partially funded by the U.S. , has already made history sending proton beams crashing into each other at unheard of speeds .
And research is speeding ahead elsewhere as well .
China is far outpacing the U.S. in the growth of research and development spending , even though the U.S. is the clear worldwide leader - responsible for one - third of the $ 1.1 trillion spent worldwide in 2007 .
Perhaps if Americans understood why science is vital , interesting and profitable , they would have pressured the government to finance the project here , Greene says .
It is what the festival is , in part , seeking to accomplish now .
The event hopes to make science as much a part of our cultural scene as dance or music .
In one event , choreographer Karole Armitage has created a dance piece illustrating concepts from contemporary physics .
Topics to be addressed in panel discussions include the plausibility of the science of " Star Trek . "
And in an event simulcast from Norway , the $ 1 million Kavli prizes will be awarded in the fields of astrophysics , nanoscience and neuroscience .
The festival 's opening night gala , which will honor British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking , includes the premiere of " Icarus at the Edge of Time , " an orchestral work by Philip Glass based on Greene 's children 's book about a journey to a black hole .
Since authoring the tale , Greene has turned his focus to a book for adults on the possible ways that multiple universes might manifest themselves .
One of the more popular science - fiction scenarios - an alternate universe in which people are transformed to similar but evil or subtly different versions of themselves - is but a remote possibility , he says .
Instead , it 's more likely that multiple universes exist alongside each other like bubbles in a bubble bath .
The extremely fast expansion of the universe in our distant past , combined with elements of string theory , suggest this as a possibility , Greene said .
It is almost as difficult to wrap one 's head around as the possibility that we are all holograms projected over a distance , unable to detect the illusory nature of our 3 - D world - another topic covered by a festival panel .
Greene 's attempt to explain where our consciousness might reside , if we are indeed simply projections , is intriguing and perhaps less than comforting :
" It 's there , too , " he says .
" Consciousness is nothing but the physical processes taking place in the brain .
... Consciousness is just another interaction of particles . "

The Tea Party - backed Republican candidate for governor of New York State sent dozens of sexually explicit and racially insensitive mass emails as a matter of course in recent years , including one featuring bestiality and another that was made popular by a neo -Nazi organization .
An online news source in western New York has uncovered dozens of emails from Carl Paladino , a Buffalo - area land developer who threw his hat into the ring for governor last week .
ADVERTISEMENT
Among the emails Paladino forwarded to numerous people was one of a photo of President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama dressed in pimp and prostitute outfits .
The email subject line read “ White House Ball . ”
Another email featured an embedded clip of a hard - core bestiality video featuring a woman and a horse ; yet another email was entitled “ Miss France 2008 f**king . ”
According to WNYMedia , in December 2008 Paladino sent around a YouTube video under the title “ Obama Inauguration Rehearsal . ”
The video features African tribesmen dancing in a village square .
WNYMedia noted that the video had been posted to the Web site of Stormfront , a neo -Nazi organization .
The “ inauguration ” video elicited at least one angry response from Paladino ’s recipients .
“ You really degrade yourself when you forward this s**t , Geep , ” the unidentified emailer stated .

Paladino wrote back : “ I apologize to you and everyone if that is offensive .
To me it ’s just humor .
I ’m not a racist and have never related Obama ’s color to my political distaste for him . ”
He added that “ the oversensitivity to black / white is wrong and in itself demeaning . ”
Paladino announced his campaign for governor last week with what the New York Times described as a “ Palinesque populist message . ”
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m mad as hell , and IÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢m not going to take it anymore !
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Paladino told a crowd in downtown Buffalo .
That also appears to be the motto of his campaign Web site .

He is the third Republican to join an increasingly contentious race for the Republican nomination .
While Paladino appears to have the backing of many Tea Party organizations , the Times notes that “ securing the Republican nomination will not be easy for Mr. Paladino .
He has decided to forgo the traditional route of seeking a spot on the ballot at the stateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Republican convention in June .
Instead , he will use the petition process , which requires him to collect 15,000 signatures from registered voters in at least 15 of the stateÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Congressional districts . ”
And even before his campaign was officially launched , Paladino found himself the subject of controversy .
One day ahead of his announcement , the New York Daily News reported that Paladino had had a love child during an extramarital affair with a former staffer at one his real estate development business .

Paldino has described himself as “ the only Republican in the race who agrees 100 percent with conservative values . ”
Of his political beliefs , the Times reports :
He calls his campaign Ã¢â‚¬â€ his first run for public office Ã¢â‚¬â€ a Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ crusade .Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
He has excoriated state political leaders as Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ a parasitical ruling classÃ¢â‚¬Â and pledged to send corrupt legislators to the state prison at Attica .
He has railed against the health care legislation passed last month by Congress as an affront to personal liberty …
Mr. Paladino used his outspokenness as a selling point on Monday , telling his supporters : Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ I have a tendency to speak my mind Ã¢â‚¬â€  and in many cases , your mind .
I can be blunt , maybe sometimes too blunt .
But you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll always know where I stand .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
On Monday , Paladino spokesman Michael Caputo told TalkingPointsMemo’s Zachary Roth that Democrats are trying “ to change the subject from substantive issues to ‘ having sex with horses . ' ”

He said Paladino had “ forwarded close friends hundreds of email messages he received .
Many of these emails he received were off color , some were politically incorrect , few represented his own opinion , and almost none of them were worth remembering .

In his first comment since the privacy controversy of recent weeks , Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has admitted that the company " made a bunch of mistakes " and wants to " get this stuff right this time " ( Update : Zuckerberg has posted additional thoughts on privacy ) .
Zuckerberg has been criticized from some corners for a lack of communication on Facebook users ' privacy concerns , and a public comment from the CEO has n't been forthcoming .
Today 's concession is n't a public apology ; rather , Zuckerberg replied to a private e-mail from tech enthusiast Robert Scoble , who then requested permission to reprint Zuckerberg 's response on his blog .
Zuckerberg 's reply has some merit to it : Facebook wants to respond to the dust - up with a product fix .
Rather than simply telling users what he intends to change , he 'd rather go ahead and make that change .
Here 's Zuckerberg 's reply in full :
Hey ,
We ’ve been listening to all the feedback and have been trying to distill it down to the key things we need to improve .
I ’d like to show an improved product rather than just talk about things we might do .
We ’re going to be ready to start talking about some of the new things we ’ve built this week .
I want to make sure we get this stuff right this time .
I know we ’ve made a bunch of mistakes , but my hope at the end of this is that the service ends up in a better place and that people understand that our intentions are in the right place and we respond to the feedback from the people we serve .
I hope we ’ll get a chance to catch up in person sometime this week .
Let me know if you have any thoughts for me before then .
Mark
From a PR perspective , Zuckberg 's approach has not been a good one .
Facebook 's lack of direct response has made it seem that Facebook either does n't know or does n't care about user concerns around privacy .
If Facebook does indeed share user concerns and will soon make changes — as Mark promises — a very early mea culpa and increased communication with the press may have saved Facebook from a great deal of criticism .
In short :
It 's great that Facebook is looking to improve its privacy settings , but explaining these moves earlier and more publicly may have been preferable .
We 'll have to wait and see whether Facebook 's updates calm tensions around the company 's privacy stance .
My take :
As important as the issue may seem right now , the privacy dust - up will eventually blow over and Facebook will continue its relentless march to win the web .
Ashton Kutcher really got into his role as a spy in the upcoming action - packed romantic comedy Killers .
During a press conference , Collider.com reports that Ashton admitted to accidentally knocking out a stuntman and kicking actor Rob Riggle in the face during the fight scenes .
Based on what Ashton says , it sounds like the movie is going to have some pretty fantastic action scenes .
" My stunt guy went to the hospital twice for jumping through glass .
I did jump off a boat and I did most of the fight stuff .
I bought one of those DVDs off the TV — those exercise tapes .
And I put it in and watched it and got in shape .
I did some fight training .
I learned Krav Maga , Muay Thai , and Kali , which is a Filipino knife fighting . "
In case you 're wondering what Ashton works out to at home , it 's the P90X system , which also counts Pink as a fan .
The P90X system is a series of 12 targeted workouts ( including yoga , circuit training , and plyometrics ) and a nutrition program that promises to transform your body in three months .
Ashton 's wife , Demi Moore , first started tweeting that the couple were using P90X last year though she had only done the yoga component of the workout series .
It looks like the idea of filming Killers was big motivation for Ashton to get in shape .
Shortly after getting his P90X system he tweeted , " stepping up the work outs to 2 a days .
time to get serious .
I 'm so paranoid about doing scenes with my shirt off . "
As far as knocking out his stuntman goes , Ashton feels pretty bad : " That was a bad ordeal . . . I hurt a lot of people .
I should have just let the stunt guy do everything , to be honest , and stuck to just making jokes . "
Just weeks ahead of regional elections - which Silvio Berlusconi himself called an " important national test " of his support - the Italian Prime Minister 's People of Freedom ( PDL ) party finds itself in a state of chaos .
After a court confirmed that the PDL had missed a deadline to submit its list for the regional assembly in Lazio , Italy 's third largest region , Berlusconi held a press conference on Wednesday during which he attacked and blamed the opposition for the pre-election fiasco .
" The behavior of the left has been and remains anti-democratic and wretched , while we have behaved in the opposite way , " a pugnacious and visibly fatigued Berlusconi told reporters .
He added that he had " detailed , documented , and certified " proof that opposition supporters purposely prevented PDL candidates from signing up for the Lazio elections by making a " commotion " outside the registration venue that " caused the PDL candidates to go away . "
Berlusconi also cast the blame on Italian judges , who he said " in a violent abuse of power " had cast away PDL candidates for not waiting in registration lines correctly .
Italian sandwich - gate
The pre-election madness all started when the person responsible for registering Berlusconi 's party for the Lazio elections missed the deadline because he was " mangiando un panino , " or eating a sandwich .
When the courts rejected a first appeal , Berlusconi passed a new law that retroactively changed the election registration rules so that his party could be re-admitted - but not without a near brawl in parliament .
Anti-Berlusconi protesters call the leader a ' swindler '
After the Rome court ruled again that the PDL could not participate in the Lazio elections , Berlusconi railed against the judges on Italian television and called on supporters to take to the streets in a huge protest .
Before Berlusconi had even mentioned a date for the protest , his supporters began showing up outside PDL party headquarters with banners reading " Silvio , lead us to the polls ! "
Berlusconi has since called for the protest to be staged on March 20 .
The elections , which are to take place in 13 of Italy 's 20 regions , are scheduled for March 28 - 29 .
According to a poll put together by the newspaper La Repubblica , support for Berlusconi's People of Freedom party has sunk to its lowest level since 2008 when Berlusconi began a third term as prime minister .
According to the survey , only around 44 percent of voters have faith in the billionaire media magnate , a drop of over two percent compared to last month 's poll .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The European debt crisis drew new cries of alarm on Monday as a top White House adviser warned it could slow a global economic recovery , a European Union official sharply critiqued Germany , and investors worried a Spanish bank bailout could signal further distress .
Financial markets were already factoring in European risk for the U.S. recovery when White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers said “ recent events in Europe have introduced uncertainty into the prospects of global growth . ”
Summers listed Europe ’s debt problems as one several potential troubles facing the U.S. economy in a speech at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies .
The euro swooned , U.S. stocks fell and gold climbed 1 percent as some investors worried that Europe ’s troubles could trigger a double - dip U.S. recession .
Investors ’ nagging doubts over whether Europe has a unified commitment to address its debt problems were underscored by comments from the president of the European Commission , Jose Manuel Barroso , who called Germany ’s aim to modify provisions of the European Union treaty governing member states ’ budgets “ naive , ” saying it could prompt other members to propose additional changes .
“ We will not propose treaty modifications even though we are open to good ideas , ” Barroso told the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung .
“ It would also be naive to think one can reform the treaty only in areas Germany considers important , ” he said in comments that highlighted the difficulties Europe faces in enacting reforms while its leaders remain divided .
Europe ’s problems grew over the weekend when the Bank of Spain took over the running of a small savings bank , CajaSur , after its planned merger with another small Spanish lender failed .
It was the first of what could be several rescues before mid-year and contributed to weakness in the euro , which fell more than 1 percent against the U.S. dollar .
The Spanish bailout was “ a sign that sovereign debt risk is spreading from the public to the private sector , ” said Dan Cook , a senior market analyst at IG Markets Inc in Chicago .
“ This move further highlights the risk to , and weakness in , the European banking sector . ”
German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been reluctant to come to the aid of indebted European states such as Greece , Spain , Ireland and Portugal that have undermined confidence in the euro zone economy .
The euro zone is the No. 1 buyer of U.S. exports .
But Merkel relented earlier this month , leading the European Union to announce a $ 1 trillion safety net for euro zone states and a 110 billion euro aid package for Greece .
The measures have yet to restore confidence in Greece , where austerity measures have led to violent street protests .

After months of pressure from investors and EU partners , the Spanish government last week finally announced sweeping austerity measures that would cut civil service pay 5 percent this year , freeze wages in 2011 , and trim 13,000 public sector jobs in a country that already has 20 percent unemployment .
That in turn led the country ’s largest labor union to threaten a general strike , pitting the Socialist government against its traditional base of support .
The International Monetary Fund on Monday said Spain faces severe challenges , citing “ a dysfunctional labor market , the deflating property bubble , a large fiscal deficit , heavy private sector and external indebtedness , anemic productivity growth , weak competitiveness , and a banking sector with pockets of weakness . ” [ nLDE64N14D ]
U.S. stocks ended lower , with the Dow industrials down 1.2 percent to post their lowest close since February 10 .
The broader S&P 500 lost 1.3 percent and the tech - heavy Nasdaq lost 0.7 percent .
“ Europe remains the dominant issue , and people suspect that the issues there will translate into slower growth in the United States , ” said Gary Shilling , president of investment research firm A. Gary Shilling & Co in Springfield , New Jersey .
Gold prices rose more than 1 percent as investors moved into a traditional retreat during uncertain times .
“ People are going into safety .
Things are not going to change overnight , ” said George Goncalves , head of U.S. interest rate strategy with Nomura Securities International in New York .
Working together as a team we have already suppressed debate on many dangerous ideas : that those of us deemed too big to fail are too big and should be broken up , for instance , or that credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations and other financial inventions should simply be banned .
We are now at leisure to address the few remaining threats to our way of life .
To wit :
1. Washington will attempt to limit our ability to exploit the idiocy of institutional investors a k a our “ customers . ”
The Senate appears intent on forcing our most lucrative derivatives business onto open exchanges , where investors can , for the first time , observe the prices we give them .
This measure  which I ’ve come to call the “ Making the World Safe for Germans With Money Act ”  will prove difficult to defeat .
Our public strategy here , as elsewhere , must be to complicate the issue .
To the mere mention of open , public exchanges for derivatives , you should always respond , “ That will destroy liquidity in these fragile and complex markets . ”
Most people do n’t even know what “ liquidity ” means , or what causes it or why they actually need to have more rather than less of it  or what , even , the point is of a market that requires privacy to operate .
They will assume that you must understand it better than they do .
For that reason alone it is useful .
The other point you should make to our elected officials ( privately , please ) is that our profits function as a fixed point in an uncertain universe .
If they curtail our ability to shaft German investors in one way , we will simply find some other way to do it .
Shockingly , the Senate version of the bill more or less would require us to cease to trade derivatives entirely .
This unpleasant idea was introduced by Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas , and it leads me to a point that is worth underscoring :
We do not have a problem with the American people , we have a problem with American women .
Elizabeth Warren , our TARP supervisor , continues to ask questions about what we did with our government money ; Mary Schapiro has used her authority at the S.E.C. to sue Goldman Sachs .
Of the four Republican senators who crossed over to vote with the Democrats , two were women  and one of the guys posed naked for Cosmopolitan magazine .
Going forward , we should discourage women from seeking higher office  or indeed , any position in which they might exert influence over our activities .
More immediately , in your private conversations with Larry Summers , Tim Geithner and male Republican senators , you should simply refer to Blanche Lincoln as “ unhinged . ”
They ’ll get it .
Investigation reveals accident on Gulf of Mexico rig was caused when gas escaped from oil well before exploding
The deadly blast on board the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico was triggered by a bubble of methane gas , an investigation by BP has revealed .
A report into last month 's blast said the gas escaped from the oil well and shot up the drill column , expanding quickly as it burst through several seals and barriers before exploding .
The sequence of events , described in the interviews with rig workers , provides the most detailed account of the blast that killed 11 workers and led to more than 3 m gallons of crude oil pouring into the Gulf .
Segments of the interviews conducted during BP 's internal investigation were described in detail to the Associated Press by Robert Bea , a University of California Berkeley engineering professor who serves on a National Academy of Engineering panel on oil pipeline safety .
He also worked for BP as a risk assessment consultant during the 1990s .
He received the details from industry friends seeking his expert opinion .
The revelations came as a giant funnel was lowered over the oil well in a bid to contain oil leaking from it .
BP said it may take up to 12 hours for the 98 - ton , steel and concrete containment device to settle in place almost a mile ( 1.6 km ) below the surface .
The company added that the operation appeared to be going as planned .
If the procedure is successful , the device will hoover up 85 % of the oil gushing from the ocean floor and pipe it into a tanker .
But BP admits it is unclear whether its efforts will work .
No containment box , or cofferdam , has ever been deployed at such depths and the operation is threatened by frigid ocean temperatures and the immense pressures .
Meanwhile , crews have begun to drill a relief well , but that could take months .
The outcome of the efforts to contain the oil could be critical to the future of offshore drilling in America .
The Obama administration yesterday suspended new drilling in Alaska and Virginia .
BP faces an equally daunting challenge to contain the political and financial fallout from the spill .
Washington has kept up the pressure on the oil giant , a move seen in part as a tactic to divert criticism of its own role in the disaster .
Recent news reports have suggested the interior department exercised lax oversight in approving BP 's operations in the Gulf , accepting too readily the company 's claims that there was little risk of an accident .

All morning , we ’ve been watching The Twitter , desperately waiting for any sign that Steam for Mac was finally live .
A lot of Mac - owning folks in Europe were understandably miffed that despite that announced release date of May 12th , Steam had n’t yet landed by their afternoons .
Even in the U.S. , people have been getting mighty impatient .
Rejoice :
As of 12:45 EST , Steam for Mac is officially available for download .
It is n’t yet live , though .
At this point there does not to be an official statement from Steam , nor has there been any changes to the page where one would normally download the Windows client .
In fact , it still has Mac games under “ coming soon . ”
But , the link we have provided does indeed lead to a file called Steam.dmg , and we can confirm that it installs Steam on your Mac .
At the moment , Mac accounts are locked , so you ca n’t start playing yet , but you can get one step closer by clicking right here .
UPDATE : Last we checked ( about 3:20 PM ) the version of Steam we downloaded is going directly to a Mac- centric version of the interface upon log in .
The Mac library is up with 63 games , and … they are giving Portal away free .
For PC and Mac .
Allow me to repeat that : Go get Portal , for FREE .
Go do it .

HTML5 Forms Are Coming
HTML forms have been , to date , quite simplistic .
We 've had limited options : the text field , the checkbox , the radio button , the textarea and finally the select drop down .
Any complex data like phone numbers , email addresses or dates had to be checked by JavaScript .
( And you should always and I mean always do server - side validation of the data . )
The input element works overtime by being rendered completely differently based on the type it 's given — be that a text field , password , checkbox , radio button , and others .
Considering my readership , this is all terribly old and boring to you now .
I understand .
New Types
Under the HTML5 umbrella , however , forms are getting a makeover .
The new input types are :
search
tel
url
email
datetime , date , month , week , time , and datetime - local
number
range
color
In the example of an email field , validation could be performed by the browser , without JavaScript , to ensure that an email address was correctly entered .
Even more powerful , it could allow autocomplete based on your local address book .
New Attributes
There are also plenty of new attributes , many designed to aid in constraining the limits of a field .
Here is a small subset of new attributes :
list — points to a datalist element containing value suggestions
max and min — constrains valid date / time and number values
pattern — allows a regular expression as a constraint
placeholder — displays a text hint for the field
Fallback
If you try to use these new type now , browsers that do n't recognize the type will fall back to the text type .
Unrecognized attributes will similarly be ignored .
That means that you could start using it now and when browsers begin to recognize them , you 'll be ready .
Client - side validation via JavaScript could be layered on in the meantime .
Where things are unclear is how you can tell whether the browser already supports these features .
For example , inspecting the type in Firefox returns " text " but Safari and Chrome return " email " .
Browser Support
What 's most interesting is that we 're starting to see some of these features get implemented into browsers .
Mobile Safari ( on the iPhone ) was quick out of the gate by adding support for number , email and url .
No validation is performed but special keyboards for each input type are presented to aid in entering a value .
Most recently , Chrome 5 beta has support for the placeholder attribute .
< label for =" email " > Email address </ label > < input id =" email " type = " email " placeholder= " jonathan@example.com " >
What next ?
I have qualms about how browsers will handle the complex input types like date and time and so I appreciate the slow and considered implementations to date .
Yes , this is n't very much just yet but it 's encouraging .
Web Design Trends And Tips
Every year brings some new trends , but there are some basic elements that stay the same .
What is important to make your web design attractive to readers ?
First of all , the layout should not overshadow the content .
The readers should always be given an ideal setting for reading the content with minimum distractions .
The role of web designers has grown immensely in the past decade and they became a crucial element for businesses worldwide as they are the ones who give the final touch to the digital representation of the business .
All of that led to a closer collaboration between web designers and developers who joined forces to create the best outcome .
Since content is king , web designers often focus on emphasizing letters that should be clearly visible in a larger font .
2017 saw the rise of CSS grid and flexbox which support more highlighted layouts .
Since recent on , developers rather use SVGs than GIFS and the JPG format due to the many advantages they offer .
SVGs solved the resolution problem as they look good on any type of screen because they are not based on pixels but vectors .
Many developers love SVGs because they also do not need a HTTP which enables the website to load faster .
Even if the content is still number 1 , colors are still a big deal , and bright and shiny colors will contribute to any website making it look joyful and interesting .
We are looking forward to new trends in the world of technology and computers and what the mesmerizing digital world will offer us in the near future .
Below you can share some scripts , code , projects , news , advice with us .
We 'll be happy to hear from you .
Right now , nothing is more boring than the market .
It seems up , up , up is the only way it can slowly go , but for the April 7 minor blip .
But serious crises loom on the radar , many that could send the markets into chaos as traders try to gauge reaction around the world .
By our judgment , some seem far more likely than others .
Its effect on BP 's liability for the blowout that is blasting hundreds of barrels of oil an hour into the Gulf of Mexico is uncertain , but , according to Sam Stein , three Senators are introducing legislation today that would increase what oil companies have to pay for disasters like that from $ 75 million to $ 10 billion .
Two of the sponsoring Senators - Bob Menendez and Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey - last week called on President Obama to reverse his decision to open up most of the East coat of oil drilling .
As noted by Jed Lewison earlier this morning , as a result of the 1986 Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund , companies are charged 8 cents a barrel that is put aside for damages relating to spills .
The fund does n't cover containment costs .
The Senators want to expand the fund to cover potential costs of future drilling disasters .
Just how big such disasters can be is still becoming known .
Bloomberg is reporting :
The growing oil slick fed by an underwater leak in a BP Plc well in the Gulf of Mexico may threaten production , shipping and refining of oil and natural gas in Mississippi , Alabama , and Louisiana .
Those three states account for 19 percent of U.S. refining capacity as of 2009 , according to data from the U.S. Energy Department ’s Energy Information Administration .
...
If the slick moves east , crude deliveries could be interrupted to Chevron Corp ’s 330,000 - barrel - a- day Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi and to a Shell Chemicals refinery near Mobile , Alabama , said [ Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston ] .
So far , at least one oil drilling rig and two gas platforms have been evacuated .
But ship traffic is still normal , as is tanker offloading at a deepwater port that handles 10 % of the nation 's oil supply from underwater pipelines .
There are no crude oil shortages .
Whether those situations change depends on how quickly BP gets control of its well .
So far , the company is having a hard time getting its CEO Tony " What the hell did we do to deserve this ? "
Hayward to keep from putting his foot in his mouth .
On the " Today " show this morning , he said : " It was n't our accident , but we are absolutely responsible for the oil , for cleaning it up , and that 's what we intend to do . "
As any good messaging guru could have told him , while technically true , the " was n't our accident " portion of that comment will be what resonates around the world .
The rest of what he said very much remains to be seen .
Besides increasing liability , the Big Oil Bailout Prevention
Act would require companies " to spend future revenues on cleanup and containment costs that exceed the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund 's $ 1.6 billion and allow community responders to access the fund for ' preparation and mitigation up front . ' "
Such requirements would make comments like Mr. Hayward 's accepting responsibility unnecessary .
MAY 17 -- Meet Jessica Halter .
The Ohio student , 18 , was arrested Saturday night at her high school prom after she drunkenly assaulted a policeman , tried to kick a paramedic , and spewed a " bloody ball of spit " at one cop .
According to a Lorain Police Department report , an officer working the North Ridgeville High School prom was approached by school administrators who had received several complaints about the " highly intoxicated " Halter .
When told of these complaints , Halter replied , " This is my fucking prom , this is bullshit . "
Halter , her speech slurred , denied drinking alcohol and cursed out the school 's principal and assistant principal .
" You are fucking bitches , this is my prom , I 'm not drunk , " said Halter .
After refusing to take a Breathalyzer test , Halter attempted to swing a chair at cops , and then began " smacking her forehead into the chair handle causing her nose to bleed . "
While being handcuffed , Halter " began kicking , screaming , spitting and thrashing about . "
As she was walked out of DeLuca 's catering hall , Halter -- screaming obscenities - -" let her legs go limp , " so officers had to carry the teen to a patrol car .
That is when Halter " cleared her throat and spit a bloody ball of spit " at Officer Kyle Gelenius , whose name tag was ripped from his uniform by Halter during the confrontation .
Seated in the back of the cruiser , Halter " continued to spit blood on the windows , the divider , and the roof , " and kicked the vehicle 's window .
For her prom night meltdown , Halter was booked into the Lorain County jail ( where she posed for a mug shot ) and charged with assaulting a cop , resisting arrest , disorderly conduct , and underage drinking .

The robotics industry in Southeast Michigan is attempting to turn the automotive slump into an opportunity to branch off into …well , automotive .
But where once the automotive market for robotics meant industrial - strength assembly - line work , the opportunity lies now in robotic systems that can be embedded in military and civilian vehicles .
Such a shift entails a change in thinking .
But it ’s not so big of a change that existing - or , make that , surviving - robotics companies cannot hope to make the transition .
Those who are pushing for this transition say that it simply makes sense for a region that has a great deal of underused talent in engineering and robotics , along with excess manufacturing capabilities that can be adapted to new uses .
Put all the pieces all together and aim them at an opportunity that is growing , such as the automated systems and sensors market , and Southeast Michigan could become a center for world - class automotive robotics innovation .
Leading the charge into this new robotics world is Col. James Braden , director of the Michigan Economic Development Corp . ’s Defense Contract Coordination Center .
He is gathering together representatives from industry , academia , and government , steering them toward a new Michigan Automotive Robotics Cluster ( MARC ) initiative .
But do n’t let the fact that there is already an acronym for it fool you .
The “ cluster ” is really mainly an idea that Braden is trying to turn into reality by pulling together interested companies and going for funding — and that ’s as far as it ’s gone right now .
The germ of this idea came from a July 2009 visit from Karen Mills , an administrator for the U.S. Small Business Administration , which is encouraging regional technology cluster initiatives across the country .
She met with the local chapter of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International ( AUVSI ) , along with area representatives of the automotive tier supply chain .
Historically , Mills told the group , the robotics industry has been being driven chiefly by military needs .
A big opportunity , she said , lay in transferring more of that capability to civilian use .
Braden wants to take Mills ’ idea a bit further , saying that it is important to think about developing both military and civilian applications simultaneously .
Robotics companies should not forego the short - term opportunity to sell to the military , he says , but they should also think about how to apply military technology to much broader commercial opportunities , such as the emergency first - responder and homeland security markets .
For example , Braden says , mobile military robots designed to find roadside bombs … Next Page »

The advertisement will be shown on Channel 4 in May and June An advertisement by an abortion advisory organisation is to be screened for the first time on UK television .
The campaign for unplanned pregnancy and abortion advice at Marie Stopes clinics will raise awareness of sexual health , the organisation said .
The 30 - second film to be shown on Channel 4 will first air at 2210 BST on 24 May and run until the end of June .
Anti-abortion groups said the charity 's move trivialised human life and a legal appeal was being considered .
The advertisement does not mention the word abortion but asks " Are you late ? " and points those facing an unplanned pregnancy to Marie Stopes International 's 24 - hour helpline .
Marie Stopes , which is run on a not - for - profit basis , says callers will be given " non-judgemental support , advice and services " .
Clearly there are hundreds of thousands of women who want and need sexual health information and advice
Dana Hovig , Marie Stopes The Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) said non-commercial providers of post - conception advice services had long been permitted to run advertisements .
In a statement , Marie Stopes said : " In the past it was unclear whether unplanned pregnancy advisory services could advertise on TV ...
Following a consultation we have found that it is allowed under the current guidance because we are a charity and not a commercial organisation . "
Regulator pressure ?
The latest official figures for 2008 show that there were 195,300 abortions in England and Wales and 13,817 in Scotland .
Marie Stopes said about 80 % of the abortions it provided in 2009 were carried out for free on the NHS .
Marie Stopes chief executive Dana Hovig said : " Last year alone we received 350,000 calls to our 24 - hour helpline .
Clearly there are hundreds of thousands of women who want and need sexual health information and advice and access to services .
" We hope the new Are you late ?
campaign will encourage people to talk about their choices , including abortion , more openly and honestly , and empower women to reach confident , informed decisions about their sexual health . "
Michaela Aston , a spokeswoman for anti-abortion charity Life , said : " To allow abortion providers to advertise on TV , as though they were no different from car companies or detergent manufacturers , is grotesque .
Such ads are offensive and will mislead viewers about the reality of abortion
Society for the Protection of Unborn Children " By suggesting that abortion is yet another consumer choice , it trivialises human life and completely contravenes the spirit of the 1967 Abortion Act , which was supposed to allow for a small number of legal abortions in a limited number of hard cases , but has been twisted and distorted to allow for mass abortion on demand . "
The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said it was taking advice on the legality of the advertisement .
It called on the culture secretary to make regulator Ofcom impose restrictions on such broadcasts .
Spokesman Anthony Ozimic said Marie Stopes ' " huge multi-national revenue means it can afford TV advertising , which is hugely expensive .
This creates an unfair playing field , as pro-life groups simply cannot afford any such advertising " .
He added : " Abortion ads will trivialise abortion .
It is an insult to the hundreds of women hurt by abortion every day .
Such ads are offensive and will mislead viewers about the reality of abortion . "
Viewers ' complaints
The first advert for Marie Stopes will be shown during the Million Pound Drop Live game show hosted by Davina McCall .
An ASA spokesman said : " Any ad that airs has to comply with all the relevant rules in the Advertising Code , which aims to ensure that ads are not misleading and socially responsible .
" Ads must adhere to rules that are designed to protect children and vulnerable groups and prevent ads from causing serious or widespread offence .
TV ads are checked against the rules before they are broadcast .
" If viewers have concerns about the content or scheduling of the ad , the ASA is able to consider complaints once the ad has aired . "

The Wall Street Journal reports that Hon Hai Precision ( trade name Foxconn ) has decided to raise all wages by an average of 20 percent .
Discussions have reportedly been going on for a while now and though the decision to raise wages come at a time when the company is under a huge amount of scrutiny for how it treats employees , the company says the decision was not influenced by the current suicide cluster plaguing the factory .
" It is not because of the suicides , " spokesman Edmund Ding said .
" The discussion has been going on for a long time . "
Mr. Ding went on to say that the company has authorized managers in different provinces to determine how much the raise should be .
" It would be an average 20 percent increase , which means some areas will be more than 20 percent , " Mr. Ding said , failing to mention that some of those increases would equally have to be lower than 20 percent to arrive at that average .
Hon Hai has yet to specify a date for the increases but Ding says , " it should be very soon . "
Recent undercover reports into how workers at Foxconn are treated revealed that employees must sign a voluntary affidavit to waive the 36 - hour legal limit on monthly overtime hours .
Employees are willing to sign because without overtime , they can not make a decent wage .

The Rorscach test ( commonly known as the inkblot test ) is used by the psychiatric world to help determine a person ’s mental state .
It is very common but very controversial .
I have managed to obtain copies of all of the inkblots and believe we are the first site to do so – so by reading this list you are part of history in the making !
This list will tell you what the therapist is looking for and it should help you to pass as “ sane ” .
The cards are placed in your hand one by one and always in the sequence shown below .
There are ten cards in total .
The therapist will not give you any help and will generally start by telling that you can do anything with the cards – for example flip them , or rotate them .
As you respond , the therapist will take notes ( either using the special shorthand designed for the test , or in long hand ) .
Often they will tape record the session .
You should hold the cards steady and upright – flipping or rotating will be marked against you ( though in some cases an examiner may mark you down for not doing so ) .
Your responses should not be overly sexual and you should only name positive images – negative images mark against you .
For example , it is better to see two rabbits playing than two vampires fighting .
Butterflies , people holding hands , leaves , mountains , etc are all generally considered to be “ safe ” responses ( although nothing is guaranteed when taking the Rorschach ) .
You will also be marked down for taking too long to answer , or not taking long enough to have studied the card properly .
“ Nobody agrees how to score Rorschach responses objectively .
There is nothing to show what any particular response means to the person who gives it .
And , there is nothing to show what it means if a number of people give the same response .
The ink blots are scientifically useless . ” ( Bartol , 1983 ) .
Here then , are the official full color inkblot cards .
Use the comments to tell us what you see in each one .
1. Plate I
Possible Sexual Imagery : Breasts , primarily the rounded areas at the top of the image .
2. Plate II
Possible Sexual Imagery :
Male sex organ at top center or , in some cases , a vagina ( at the center near the bottom ) .
3. Plate III
Possible Sexual Imagery :
Male sex organs and female breasts , right about where you would expect to find them .
4. Plate IV
Possible Sexual Imagery : A pair of male sex organs , typically seen at the top of the image .
Some subjects may instead visualize a vagina in the upper center of the blot .
This card may also be seen as viewing a person from below or a male figure with an enormous sex organ .
5. Plate V
Possible Sexual Imagery : A pair of male sex organs at the very top of the inkblot .
The vast majority of test subjects will see a bat - or bird - like figure .
This is by far the most common response .
6. Plate VI
Possible Sexual Imagery :
The head of the male sex organ ( the portion at the top of the card ) or alternately , a female sex organ ( middle and bottom part of the card ) .
7. Plate VII
Possible Sexual Imagery :
The female sex organs ( seen at the bottom of the card where the figures join .
8. Plate VIII
Possible Sexual Imagery : Female sex organs , usually seen at the bottom of the card .
9. Plate IX
Possible Sexual Imagery : Female sex organs , usually seen at the bottom of the card .
Most subjects struggle to see anything in this card .
10 . Plate X
Possible Sexual Imagery : Male sex organs at the top center of the card .

Hundreds of flights grounded as new volcanic ash cloud shuts Scottish and Irish airspace ... and it could be heading for England
Irish airspace closed from 7 am to 1pm
Around 20 Heathrow flights cancelled
Ash cloud also affects parts of Scotland
Passengers told to check before travel
Cameron cancels election visit to N.I .
The return of the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud caused travel misery for thousands of air passengers today with hundreds of flights cancelled .
Airlines had to scrap all services to and from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland after no- flight restrictions were introduced until 1 pm .
The ash cloud , borne on north - westerly winds , also prevented flights to and from Tiree , Barra , Benbecula and Islay in the Hebrides , and Campbeltown in Argyll in mainland Scotland .
Forecasters warned the cloud is now coming towards England .
It is being blown south - east from its current position above Ireland and Scotland , the Met Office said .
But they stressed it was too early to say whether the ash that reached England would be concentrated enough to cause air travel restrictions .
Rumbling again : Ash continues to spew from Iceland 's Eyjafjallajokull volcano
' We can see from the charts that it is above Scotland and Ireland and at the moment it is being blown South East , ' a spokesman said .
' As to whether it will affect flights in England , we just do n't know yet . '
Almost 440 flights had been due to depart and fly in to Dublin Airport throughout today , with more scheduled from Shannon , Galway , Sligo , Knock , Donegal , Cork and Kerry .
Budget airline Ryanair cancelled all flights to and from the Republic of Ireland , Belfast and Derry City from 6 am to 2 pm .
Another major no-frills carrier , easyJet , had to axe around 20 flights on services to and from Belfast City and Belfast International airports .
Irish airline Aer Lingus suspended all Irish services to the UK and Europe until 1 pm .
Heathrow said that around 20 flights to and from the west London airport had been cancelled this morning .
' We are asking passengers to check with their airlines before coming to the airport , ' said a Heathrow spokeswoman .
Aer Arann was forced to cancel services to and from Derry and Donegal airports last night while easyJet warned of possible disruptions on services to Northern Ireland and Scotland .
Tory leader David Cameron had to cancel a planned campaigning visit to Northern Ireland today due to the flight restrictions , party officials said .
Chaos : Hundreds of thousands of travellers were left stranded when European airspace was closed for almost a week after eruptions from the Icelandic volcano
Irish Ferries said it had space on its services between Ireland and the UK and Ireland and France .
Virgin Trains has added extra carriages on its West Coast Main Line services from London that connect at Holyhead with ferries to and from Ireland .
Flights from continental Europe were not affected by the ash cloud from Iceland 's volcano Eyjafjallajokull , which caused travel chaos when it forced the closure of much of Europe 's airspace for almost a week last month .
Some services are still returning to normal .
The latest eruption has spewed concentrated ash into the atmosphere between ground level and 20,000 feet .
Most commercial flights fly between 35,000 and 40,000 feet , meaning that services can continue to fly above the cloud .
Transatlantic services passing over Ireland and Northern Ireland are unaffected .
The Irish Aviation Authority ( IAA ) and UK's Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) are monitoring the latest situation .
Eamon Brennan , IAA chief executive , said that , based on the new regime imposed in Europe last week , officials had no choice but to impose a no - fly zone from 7 am to 1 pm .
' The decision is based on the safety risks to crews and passengers as a result of the drift south of the volcanic ash cloud caused by the north easterly winds , " he added .
' The situation will be reviewed again at 9am .
' What 's unusual about this is that we are the country affected in Europe , ' he added .
Elsewhere the CAA said airspace over the Outer Hebrides was closed to all operations from 6 pm last night , with the closure affecting operations from Stornoway , Tyree , Barra and Benbecula .
' The CAA is closely monitoring the situation and will update the advice to operators and passengers as latest updates are produced by the Met Office , ' it added .
Last month hundreds of thousands of Britons were stranded abroad and faced long delays when European airspace was closed after the eruption of Eyjafjallajokull .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
When 17 employees of a dozen or so small and mid-size companies gathered for a cocktail reception last year at Clyde ’s restaurant in Washington , D.C. , they toasted what they thought was the imminent completion of a $ 15 million arms deal to outfit the presidential guard of an African country .
A featured specialty cocktail , the Patron Gold Cosmopolitan , is displayed at a preview of the Governors Ball food and decor for the upcoming 81st annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles January 26 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Phil McCarten
Unbeknownst to them , FBI agents were secretly videotaping the meeting .
To nail down the deal , the employees had allegedly agreed to pay 20 percent “ commissions ” to a sales agent they thought represented the African country ’s defense minister .
The sales agent turned out to be an undercover FBI agent .
The mid- and senior - level managers were among 21 individuals arrested on January 17 at a shooting and hunting trade show in Las Vegas , where they had gathered to meet the mythical defense minister .
Simultaneously , 150 FBI agents fanned out across the country to execute search warrants at the employees ’ companies .
The case underscored the increasing prominence of a law that was rarely enforced in the first 30 years of its existence but now , with attention - grabbing headlines , is front and center in corporate governance considerations .
The 1977 law , the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , or FCPA , makes it a crime to bribe foreign officials to obtain or keep business abroad .
The Las Vegas sting represents the single biggest prosecution of individuals in the history of the FCPA .
And it marks the first use of undercover techniques in an FCPA investigation .
Heralding a more daring and aggressive approach to rooting out corruption , the arrests were intended as a strong signal by the U.S. Justice Department that no one is immune from the increasingly long reach of the statute .
“ It ’s important that we hold individuals responsible , ” Mark Mendelsohn , the Justice Department official who oversees enforcement of FCPA , told Reuters in a recent interview .
“ If not , we would n’t have the deterrent effect we seek . ”
The statute had long lain dormant , but in the last three years the Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission - the criminal and civil enforcers , respectively , of FCPA - have brought more cases under the law than in all previous years combined .
INTERNATIONAL CROSSHAIRS
The stepped - up pace is testament to heightened international cooperation - the City of London Police executed seven search warrants in the undercover case - and to U.S. authorities ’ willingness to use unconventional tactics to bring bribers to heel .
Foreign companies , once virtually immune from prosecution under FCPA , are now settling cases in droves .
And at least 130 additional FCPA cases are in the pipeline , according to Mendelsohn .
In the last two months alone , no fewer than five foreign companies have entered into or announced FCPA - related settlements with U.S. authorities .
For a factbox on the settlements , please see
On Thursday , a federal judge approved a $ 185 million settlement by German luxury Daimler AG to resolve allegations it lavished money and gifts on officials in at least 22 countries in exchange for contracts .
COST OF DOING BUSINESS
Some observers have questioned whether the penalties are sufficient to deter corruption , or are simply a manageable cost to achieve a competitive advantage .
The Daimler penalty , for example , represented a fraction of a percent of the carmaker ’s overall sales .
“ Any time someone settles a case for $ 400 million or $ 180 million , you ’re like ‘ Wow - they really got hammered ! ’ ” said Mike Koehler , a business law professor at Butler University in Indianapolis and a critic of the way FCPA cases are handled .
“ But when you go through the DOJ ’s own allegations and add up the amount of the bribe payments and the amount those bribes caused the companies to get in business , you ’re still in a situation where they come out net positive . ”
Other experts say the penalties represent just a portion of the costs involved in defending and resolving an FCPA case .
Philip Urofsky , a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling and co-author of an exhaustive survey of recent FCPA developments , said he knew of no company “ that approaches FCPA issues as a cost of doing business . ”
The penalties , he said , come atop the costs of internal investigations , developing and implementing compliance programs , legal and accounting fees , disruption of the business , reputational harm , and hiring an independent monitor , a requirement of most FCPA settlements .
“ Further , the government deliberately seeks to reward companies that self - disclose , cooperate , and self - remediate .
The costs of the latter element are often very significant , ” Urofsky said .
In fact , few companies take the law lightly anymore .
Wendy Wysong , an FCPA attorney with the Clifford Chance law firm , said that at virtually every conference she attends , three or four compliance officers from Siemens AG invariably show up .
There ’s a reason for that .
In late 2008 , Siemens agreed to pay a groundbreaking $ 1.6 billion in U.S. and German penalties and to retain a compliance monitor for violating the FCPA provision requiring companies to keep accurate books and records and to maintain adequate systems of internal controls .
Although it was not charged with bribery as such , the case stemmed from payments Siemens had made to officials in Argentina , Bangladesh , Greece , Iraq , Italy , Nigeria and Venezuela .
“ It takes a lot of money to repair your reputation , ” Wysong said .
It appears HD Netflix Watch Instantly streams are n't just for living room set - top boxes anymore now that Netflix is streaming more than half of its 720 p - encoded titles to Macs and PCs ( through the Silverlight web player , no word on the Media Center add - on . )
According to , you can tell which ones are ready to go by checking the mouseover box for the ( HD Available ) tag as seen above .
Our experience matches several other reports that not everyone is seeing the tag on all the same titles , so until it 's rolled out fully , YMMV .
It 's not the new release flicks or surround sound add - ons that many are waiting for , but it could slide PQ up another notch for HTPC owners and everyone who just has to watchat work -- but you 'd never do that .

( CNN ) -- Danish cuisine reigns supreme , according to some of the planet 's most prominent eaters .
S. Pellegrino 's annual " World 's 50 Best Restaurants " list was released on Monday at a celebrity - chef - studded event in London , England , marking the ninth edition of the much buzzed - about ( and hotly debated ) catalogue of the international culinary landscape .
The No. 1 spot goes to Noma in Copenhagen , Denmark .
The restaurant , helmed by chef René Redzepi , ranked No. 3 in 2009 .
The Guardian newspaper 's restaurant critic Jay Rayner -- better known to U.S. food fans as a judge on " Top Chef Masters " -- agrees with the judges ' decision .
Writes Rayner on The Guardian 's food blog , " Is that the right result ?
Allowing for the fact that I think the rankings are far less interesting than the list itself , I would say , yes . "
" Redzepi , the 32 - year - old chef at Noma , pursues a regional , seasonal agenda that is right on the cutting edge : if it is n't available in the Nordic region , he wo n't cook with it , " he continued .
" The result is a very idiosyncratic style of food that speaks to concerns about the way a global food culture turns our eating experiences a uniform beige . "
Noma 's ascension to the top slot ends the reign of a culinary titan .
After four consecutive years ranked as the World 's Best Restaurant , Spanish restaurant El Bulli takes a seat at No. 2 . However , that wo n't make it any easier to snag a table .
Only 8,000 reservations are accepted every year , out of a reported million requests .
The dethroning of Catalonia 's culinary king , Ferran Adrià , comes after his announcement of plans to close the Mecca of molecular gastronomy for two years in December 2011 .
In 2014 , the restaurant will reopen as a nonprofit foundation -- " a think tank of gastronomic creativity " for 20 to 25 young chefs .
Despite the second - place finish , Adrià was still awarded Restaurant Magazine 's Chef of the Decade honor .
The illustrious list is compiled by The World 's 50 Best Restaurants Academy -- an 806 - member panel of the globe 's most venerated chefs , food critics , restaurateurs and gourmands .
" The list creates tremendous debate -- and it's meant to , " according to the World 's 50 Best release .
Eight of the restaurants crowned this year -- Alinea in Chicago , Illinois ; Daniel , Per Se , Le Bernardin , Momofuku Ssäm Bar , wd ~50 and Eleven Madison Park in New York ; and The French Laundry in Yountville , California -- are in the United States , this year 's most honored country .

In the old days - which , in this case , you might define as " two years ago " - getting your book published would entail finding an agent , sending it off to publishing houses like Random House or , when that failed , paying a vanity press to put the thing in print .
All of that has changed , thanks to radical shifts in the publishing industry and , oh yeah , the Internet .
Here are some examples of how a few Bay Area authors recently got into print :
Retired occupational therapist turned writer Francine Howard of El Cerrito had a short stack of unpublished manuscripts collecting dust while agents kept rejecting her queries .
Then in January 2009 , she entered her novel of interracial love in the Jim Crow South , " Page From a Tennessee Journal , " in Amazon.com 's Breakthrough Novel Award contest , whose top prize was a contract with Penguin Books .
She did n't win , but for making it to the second round , in a field of 6,500 hopefuls , her prize was two Amazon Vine ( customer ) reviews of a 5,000 - word excerpt of her book .
They were both raves , and that May , an editor from the Web site 's then - week - old imprint called AmazonEncore called with an offer to publish her book .
It came out last month .
Berkeley author Seth Harwood , who teaches writing and literature at Stanford University and City College of San Francisco , wrote his first book , the gritty crime novel " Jack Wakes Up , " in 2005 .
He began posting 50 - minute podcast episodes from it on Podiobooks.com in 2006 , establishing a marketing platform for his work .
He made a print - on - demand deal with Breakneck Books in March 2008 , and then Three Rivers Press , an imprint of Random House , scooped him up and published the book in May 2009 .
Petaluma author Ransom Stephens offered his first novel , a mix of particle physics , metaphysics and single parenthood titled " The God Patent , " as an e-novel on the Web site Scribd , known as the YouTube of documents .
It spent 15 weeks in the site 's Top 10 , and got picked up by boutique publisher Numina Press of San Rafael , which published the book in December .
On his Web site , Ransom 's Notes ( www.ran somstephens.com ) , Stephens declares his book " the first debut bestseller to emerge from the new paradigm of publishing . "
These are just three examples of alternative strategies that aspiring authors , aided by Internet technology , are devising to get their work to the public .
In the process , they are creating publishing models to circumvent the traditional - some say broken - one .
" The model of agents and publishers as gatekeepers just is n't working anymore , " says Harwood , who with fellow podcasting author Scott Sigler has taught Author Boot Camp seminars at Stanford , in which they show writers how to create a publishing platform the way they did .
" I had to do something because just writing letters to agents was n't working .
So I give people my work for free .
After they 've listened to my book , they know they 'll like it .
I 've given away six books in audio form . "
Harwood posted serialized podcasts of his second book , " Young Junius , " which will be released in autumn by independent crime fiction publisher Tyrus Books .
He devised an innovative marketing scheme for this title as well .
In the first week of May , he announced on his Web site that he was offering a $ 35 special edition , and he says the orders came flooding in .
A week later , he had earned enough to cover a third of the cost of the print run for the hardcover , paperback and special editions .
Other writers give their work a test ride on the free online literary magazine Narrative ( www.narrativemagazine.com), which holds a monthly story contest , or set up their own fan page on Facebook to post and publicize their unpublished or self - published books .
Narrative is the brainchild of author Carol Edgarian and her husband , editor Tom Jenks .
" The old model was you had to go through an agent , then the editor and publisher , then the bookstore to get to fans , " notes Harwood .
" Now you can bypass all those gatekeepers and go straight to the fans online . "
Naysayers insist that the problem with self - published books is that they are not subject to the same standards of quality that conventional publishing houses maintain when they weed out less qualified contenders and put manuscripts through a rigorous vetting and editing process .
" A weeding - out process has to happen , " Harwood grants , " but you can let the fans do the weeding instead of the agents and publishers . "
That 's exactly what AmazonEncore has done , using its sophisticated tracking technology to identify self - published books that had good customer reviews but low sales , and finding promising unpublished works through its contest .
Jeff Belle , vice president of worldwide media for Amazon.com , sees it as a winning formula .
" We 've been very happy with the sales levels across the board so far , " he says , declining to give sales figures for AmazonEncore books .
" It helps , obviously , to have books that have already been very well received but have n't gotten the level of recognition that they deserve .
One of the things we can help them do is reach that larger audience .
I think it 's great to start with content that 's already been well vetted by our customers . "
Belle says the company does not give authors an advance , " but we pay very competitive royalties . "
Further savings come with less editing and streamlined distribution .
While the company distributes to brick - and - mortar bookstores in addition to selling on Amazon , it has print - on - demand capability and does not have the storage costs and volume of returns that eat into profit at conventional publishing houses .
" When you have set pricing and returns of 25 to 40 percent on some books , that 's not a sustainable model , " says Hut Landon , executive director of the Northern California Independent Booksellers Association .
" The big publishers in New York are looking at all the new things people are trying and paying attention to them .
But we still have to figure out the distribution piece of it . "
Meanwhile , authors benefiting from new models are delighted .
" I think the publicity Amazon is giving to its authors far exceeds anything a debut author is going to get from a traditional publisher these days , " says Howard .
" That 's why I 'm so grateful there 's a whole new mechanism for writers to get their work out there .
I feel very fortunate . "
Valley Malls Advisory Committee Chairman Phillip Di Bella .
" The barrier to activating the Valley is its hygiene and its safety , " Mr Di Bella said .
" We can't bring in schools to play music on a Monday to a Friday if it is not a clean or safe area . "
Mr Di Bella is no newcomer to business operations in malls .
He is chairman of the Queen Street Mall Advisory Committee and , before Christmas , was appointed chairman of the Valley Malls Advisory Committee .
Since taking charge in the Valley , three committee members have been sacked .
Mr Di Bella is frank and blunt , telling brisbanetimes.com.au that improving local business was the first step in restoring some pride in the Valley .
" The buildings look like a disgrace .
The owners of property in the Valley need to pull their fingers out and say they are going to fix their properties and make them look appropriate , " he said .
" We do n't want them to spend a fortune , we just want them to repaint if it needs repainting .
They leave food on the tables for half an hour at a time so pigeons breed and dump droppings everywhere
" We want them to take some pride in it . "
He took aim at several Brunswick Street Mall businesses , describing one well - known business as " shocking " .
" The awning is broken , the awning is dirty and has never been cleaned , they leave food on the tables for half an hour at a time so pigeons breed and dump droppings everywhere , " he said .
Valley businesses have started to receive letters from Mr Di Bella asking them to lift their games .
And he is also putting council 's cleaners on notice .
" I can walk down Queen Street Mall - which is one of the number one places in Australia - at any time and see rubbish , " Mr Di Bella said .
" What I am interested in is the response time of council of getting that rubbish fixed ?
" We know it is going to be dirty at 11 pm because people are going to be drunk , buy the food , and throw it on the ground .
" But is it still dirty at midnight , or has it been cleaned up by 11.30 pm ?
And then by midnight , is it a mess again ? "
Research had been launched into how frequently the mall was cleaned , if extra bins were needed , or if it was people 's behaviour that needed to change first , he said .
Mr Di Bella said he was unsure whether more bins would resolve the issues .
" We have a photograph in the mall , where there is a wheelie bin in the middle where four people are sitting - the wheelie bin is less than two metres away from them , " he said .
" Yet all the rubbish is on the floor around them .
More bins is not the answer . "
However , he said he would be open to trialling local councillor David Hinchliffe 's idea of extra bins .
" I am going instruct council to put an extra 10 bins on the mall on a Friday and Saturday night , " he said .
" Put covers on them , make [ patrons ] look again . "
If the rubbish remained on the ground , Mr Di Bella said the answer was to change people 's behaviour .
The need to upgrade the Valley 's public toilets was more complex , and Mr Di Bella said he was impressed by what has happened in Melbourne .
" In Melbourne , you are not allowed to open a cafe or a restaurant unless you have your own toilets , " he said .
" Why is it the responsibility of the precinct to provide public toilets ?
" Is it not the responsibility of all the traders who benefit from the direct trade of all the people in their area ? "
Cr Newman said he would await recommendations from VMAC before he took further action .
However , he said 200 people had been fined for littering in the Brunswick Street Mall since January and that the cleaning budget for the Valley Mall had been increased by 37 per cent this year .

" We have already put on more teams to patrol and clean up rubbish as well as provided more bins , " Cr Newman said .
" The CBD is much cleaner as a result but there is always more that could be done and we have concerns about the Valley . "

The Effects of Visual Embellishment on Comprehension and Memorability of Charts
Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‗ chart junk ' - visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data .
In contrast , some popular chart designers wrap the presented data in detailed and elaborate imagery , raising the questions of whether this imagery is really as detrimental to understanding as has been proposed , and whether the visual embellishment may have other benefits .
To investigate these issues , we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones , and measured both interpretation accuracy and long - term recall .
We found that people 's accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts , and that their recall after a two - to - three - week gap was significantly better .
Although we are cautious about recommending that all charts be produced in this style , our results question some of the premises of the minimalist approach to chart design .

Follows relationships are 2 - tuples of ( username , username ) with fields separated by whitespace .
Our second source of data is " action " data which is also stored in text format :
nathan status=good 1273094927000
nathan birthday 1273026922000
david newjob 1273096922000
david travelling 1273094927000
bob status=tired 1273026922000
dan basketball - captain 1273029922000
Actions are 3 - tuples of ( username , action , time ) separated by whitespace .
To rank the actions in someone 's network , we will use a simple scoring function that produces a higher score for people with more followers and a lower score for an older action .
Our query will produce a list of the five highest scored events in each person 's network , like so :
mike ( ( " alice " " status=good " 1273091927000 ) ( " alice " " rock - climbing " 1273084927000 ) ( " bob " " status=tired " 1273026922000 ) ( " bob " " engaged " 1272029922000 ) )
jai ( ( " danielle " " married " 1273095924348 ) ( " danielle " " cooking - a- storm " 1273094927000 ) ( " mike " " tennis " 1273084927000 ) ( " mike " " hacking " 1273084827000 ) )
david ( ( " nathan " " status=great " 1273096922000 ) ( " nathan " " status=good " 1273094927000 ) ( " vijay " " inventing " 1273099927000 ) ( " vijay " " dancing " 1273094927000 ) ( " alice " " status=good " 1273091927000 ) )
Parsing the input files
Let 's start by writing subqueries to read and parse our data sources .
Let 's start with " follows " :
( defn follows - data [ dir ]
( let [ source ( hfs - textline dir ) ]
(<- [ ?p ? p2 ] ( source ? line ) ( re-parse [ # " [ ^\s ] + " ]
? line :> ?p ? p2 )
( : distinct false ) ) ) )
" follows - data " is a function that takes the path to a directory as input and returns a subquery that emits the parsed tuples .
First , the function binds the variable " source " to the result of " ( hfs - textline dir ) " .
" hfs - textline " returns a Tap that reads text data from HDFS and emits each line of text as a 1 - tuple .
Next , we define our subquery that will parse the line of text into its constituent fields .
The subquery reads " ? line " from " source " and then parses ?
line into fields using the " re-parse " function .
" re-parse " is a parameterized function that takes in a regular expression as an argument .
In this case , we match on any continuous string of non-whitespace with the regular expression # " [ ^\s ] + " .
Finally , we use " ( : distinct false ) " to tell the query not to eliminate duplicates from the results .
In this case eliminating duplicates is unnecessary so we can save a reduce step by eliminating it from the computation .
Next , lets write the subquery that will read and parse the action data :
( defn to - long [ num ] ( Long / parseLong num ) )
( defn action - data [ dir ]
( let [ source ( hfs - textline dir ) ]
(<- [ ? p ?a ?t ] ( source ? line ) ( re-parse [ # " [ ^\s ] + " ]
? line :> ?p ?a ? time - str )
( to - long ?time - str :> ?t ) ( : distinct false ) ) ) )
This function is very similar to the " follows - data " function , except it produces three fields and not two .
We also define a custom function " to - long " in order to convert the timestamp from its string representation to the proper type .
" action - data " and " follows - data " are similar in that they both parse a text file into fields .
Let 's factor out the parsing logic and simplify the code by making a helper function " textline - parsed " that will take in arguments [ dir num - fields ] and parse the text files at " dir " into " num - fields " fields :
( defn textline - parsed [ dir num - fields ]
( let [ outargs ( v/gen-nullable - vars num - fields )
source ( hfs - textline dir ) ]
( <- outargs ( source ? line ) ( c/ re- parse [ # " [ ^\s ] + " ] ? line :>> outargs )
( : distinct false ) ) ) )
" textline - parsed " is our first example of a dynamic query and requires some explanation .
Since the output fields of the subquery are dynamic according to " num - fields " , we have to generate those variable names dynamically .
" cascalog.vars " , here referred as " v " , provides a function " gen-nullable - vars " for producing a vector of some number of unique variables .
Variables can be represented as strings in Cascalog as long as they are prefixed with a " ? " or " ! " .
We generate a vector of variables using " gen-nullable - vars " and bind the vector to the local " outargs " .
Now that we have generated our variables , we just need to use them within the query .
Using them as output fields is easy - we just put the generated vector where we normally specify our output fields .
To use the generated variables as the output of the re-parse function , we make use of the " : >> " keyword .
The standard " : > " keyword requires variables to be spliced into the predicate , but in this case we want to provide a vector of variables without splicing them . " :>> " allows you to do exactly this .
Using our new " textline - parsed " helper function , we can rewrite " follows - data " and " action - data " like so :
( defn follows - data [ dir ] ( textline - parsed dir 2 ) )
( defn action - data [ dir ]
( let [ source ( textline - parsed dir 3 ) ]
(<- [? person ?action ? time ] ( source ?person ?action ?time-str )
( to - long ? time - str :> ? time ) ( : distinct false ) ) ) )
All in all , the parsing logic comes out to 12 lines of code .
News feed query
Next is the logic for the query that will produce the news feed .
We start with a custom aggregator to produce a JSON - like string out of the ranked actions from someone 's network :
( defbufferop mk - feed [ tuples ]
[ ( pr-str ( take 5 tuples ) ) ] )
" defbufferop " defines a " buffer aggregator " .
A buffer takes in all the tuples for a group as one argument , and returns a sequence of tuples as results .
In this case , our query will have scored and sorted the tuples beforehand , so we simply take the first five tuples and serialize them using " pr-str " .
Next , we define our scoring function for a particular action :
( defn action - score [ now - ms folls time - ms ]
( let [ days - delta ( div (- now - ms time - ms ) 86400000 ) ]
( div folls (+ days - delta 1 ) ) ) )
" action - score " takes in as input the current time , the number of followers of the person responsible for the action , and the time of the action .
Finally , we have the function that builds and runs our news feed query :
( defn compute - news - feed [ output - tap follows - dir action - dir ]
( let [ follows ( follows - data follows - dir )
action ( action - data action - dir )
follower - count ( <- [ ? p ?c ] ( follows ? p2 ?p ) ( c/ count ? c ) ) ]
(?<- output - tap [ ?p ? feed ] ( follows ?p ? p2 ) ( action ?p2 ?action ? time )
( follower - count ? p2 ? folls )
( action - score ( System/ currentTimeMillis ) ? folls ? time :> ? score )
( : sort ? score ) ( : reverse true )
( mk - feed ?p2 ?action ? time :> ? feed ) ) ) )
In our let binding , we use our " follows - data " and " action - data " functions to get a hold of the parsed tuples .
We then define a subquery " follower - count " to give us the number of followers for each person .
In the news feed query , for each person ? p2 followed by ?p , we retrieve ?
p2's follower count and actions .
We then run our " action - score " function to produce a score for each action .
Finally , we use the predicates " ( : sort ? score ) ( : reverse true ) " so that the " mk- feed " aggregator receives the actions in order of most interesting to least interesting .
The news feed query comprises 15 lines of code .
Running on a production cluster
The cascalog - demo project has sample data in the " data / " subdirectory .
Copy the sample data onto your cluster to " / tmp / follows " and " / tmp/action " .
Next , run " lein uberjar " to create a jar containing the program with all its dependencies .
Since the demo code specifies : gen-class and has a main method , we can run it just like any other hadoop program .
To run the query on a cluster and output the results in text format to " / tmp/ results " , run :
hadoop jar cascalog - demo- standalone.jar cascalog_demo.demo /tmp/follows /tmp/action /tmp/results
Since the uberjar has Clojure within it , you can also run the code from the REPL with the following commands :
hadoop jar cascalog - demo-standalone.jar clojure.lang .
Repl
user= > ( use ' cascalog-demo.demo ) ( use ' cascalog.api )
user= > ( compute - news - feed ( hfs - textline " /tmp/results " ) " /tmp/follows " " / tmp/action " )
You can replace the output tap of " hfs - textline " with " hfs- seqfile " to output in sequence file format , stdout to print to standard output , or another tap to output in some other format or to some other destination .
All custom operations must be compiled into the uberjar in order to use them on a cluster , which means you wo n't be able to use custom operations defined in the REPL in production queries .
However , this restriction goes away when Hadoop is run in local mode , which means the REPL is still great for development of custom operations .
Optimizations
It 's worth noting that there are a number of optimizations that can be done to speed up the news feed query .
The join between the " follows " and " action " data is a very large join and much can be done to minimize the blowup in tuples .
For starters , very old actions can be filtered outright before the join .
Other , more complex optimizations are also possible .
Conclusion
With the material from this tutorial , you should now have the ability to write and run non-trivial queries in a production environment .
You can download the code for this tutorial from Github .

Die Serie von Brandstiftungen , bei denen kaum Schaden entstand , hatte der Polizei einige Rätsel aufgegeben , berichtet die Zeitung „ Le Parisien “ vom Samstag .
Als der Pfarrer am 19 .
Mai während des Katechismus - Unterrichts für Kinder aus der Gemeinde erneut ein Feuer entdeckte , wurden die Ermittler stutzig .
Der Abdruck einer Kinderhand in dem Kerzenwachs , das zur Entzündung des Feuers benutzt worden war , führte sie zu der jungen Täterin .
Das Mädchen gestand daraufhin sein Motiv :
Ihre kleine Schwester sei im vergangenen Sommer bei einem Unfall ums Leben gekommen , und Gott habe sie nicht gerettet .
Die Polizei redete der Kleinen ins Gewissen und verordnete erzieherische Maßnahmen .
Der Pfarrer habe ihr verziehen , meldete die Zeitung .
The Nevada GOP is trying to defend Sue Lowden ’s ChickenCare proposal .
Their argument is that the Dems are focusing on chickens because they can’t deal with her argument on the merits which they , somewhat creatively , interpret as getting rid of the health insurance model in favor direct cash negotiations between patients and doctors .
Says the Nevada GOP ’s Ciara Turns : “ They can make this about chickens and about goats , and using one word instead of another word – maybe she should have said ‘ negotiation ’ instead of ‘ barter . ' ”
This kind of blew me away .
NuFormer is a company in the Netherlands that specializes in outdoor advertising of a very peculiar sort -- done on the faces of buildings .
Real buildings are mapped and modeled in 3D , and then animations are created using those models and projected back onto the building .
The result is incredibly lifelike -- it nearly fools the eye -- and whoever designs these animations does an amazing job of taking advantage the buildings ' nooks and crannies to make things look like they 're really happening in 3D space .
I guess this has been around for the better part of a year , but I 'm just hearing about it now -- so I 'll bet it 's new to some of you as well .
Cool , right ?

If they can do this now , what 's next ?
It makes me think Star Trek : TNG 's Holodeck can't be far away .
Cultures that do not recognize that human life and the natural world have a sacred dimension , an intrinsic value beyond monetary value , cannibalize themselves until they die .
They ruthlessly exploit the natural world and the members of their society in the name of progress until exhaustion or collapse , blind to the fury of their own self - destruction .
The oil pouring into the Gulf of Mexico , estimated to be perhaps as much as 100,000 barrels a day , is part of our foolish death march .
It is one more blow delivered by the corporate state , the trade of life for gold .
But this time collapse , when it comes , will not be confined to the geography of a decayed civilization .
It will be global .
Those who carry out this global genocide — men like BP ’s Chief Executive Tony Hayward , who assures us that “ The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean .
The amount of oil and dispersant we are putting into it is tiny in relation to the total water volume ’’ — are , to steal a line from Ward Churchill , “ little Eichmanns . ”
They serve Thanatos , the forces of death , the dark instinct Sigmund Freud identified within human beings that propels us to annihilate all living things , including ourselves .
These deformed individuals lack the capacity for empathy .
They are at once banal and dangerous .
They possess the peculiar ability to organize vast , destructive bureaucracies and yet remain blind to the ramifications .
The death they dispense , whether in the pollutants and carcinogens that have made cancer an epidemic , the dead zone rapidly being created in the Gulf of Mexico , the melting polar ice caps or the deaths last year of 45,000 Americans who could not afford proper medical care , is part of the cold and rational exchange of life for money .
The corporations , and those who run them , consume , pollute , oppress and kill .
The little Eichmanns who manage them reside in a parallel universe of staggering wealth , luxury and splendid isolation that rivals that of the closed court of Versailles .
The elite , sheltered and enriched , continue to prosper even as the rest of us and the natural world start to die .
They are numb .
They will drain the last drop of profit from us until there is nothing left .
And our business schools and elite universities churn out tens of thousands of these deaf , dumb and blind systems managers who are endowed with sophisticated skills of management and the incapacity for common sense , compassion or remorse .
These technocrats mistake the art of manipulation with knowledge .
“ The longer one listened to him , the more obvious it became that his inability to speak was closely connected with an inability to think , namely , to think from the standpoint of somebody else , ” Hannah Arendt wrote of “ Eichmann in Jerusalem . ”
“ No communication was possible with him , not because he lied but because he was surrounded by the most reliable of all safeguards against words and the presence of others , and hence against reality as such . ”
Our ruling class of technocrats , as John Ralston Saul points out , is effectively illiterate .
“ One of the reasons that he is unable to recognize the necessary relationship between power and morality is that moral traditions are the product of civilization and he has little knowledge of his own civilization , ” Saul writes of the technocrat .
Saul calls these technocrats “ hedonists of power , ” and warns that their “ obsession with structures and their inability or unwillingness to link these to the public good make this power an abstract force — a force that works , more often than not , at cross-purposes to the real needs of a painfully real world . ”
BP , which made $ 6.1 billion in profits in the first quarter of this year , never obtained permits from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
The protection of the ecosystem did not matter .
But BP is hardly alone .
Drilling with utter disregard to the ecosystem is common practice among oil companies , according to a report in The New York Times .
Our corporate state has gutted environmental regulation as tenaciously as it has gutted financial regulation and habeas corpus .
Corporations make no distinction between our personal impoverishment and the impoverishment of the ecosystem that sustains the human species .
And the abuse , of us and the natural world , is as rampant under Barack Obama as it was under George W. Bush .
The branded figure who sits in the White House is a puppet , a face used to mask an insidious system under which we as citizens have been disempowered and under which we become , along with the natural world , collateral damage .
As Karl Marx understood , unfettered capitalism is a revolutionary force .
And this force is consuming us .
Karl Polanyi in his book “ The Great Transformation , ” written in 1944 , laid out the devastating consequences — the depressions , wars and totalitarianism — that grow out of a so - called self - regulated free market .
He grasped that “ fascism , like socialism , was rooted in a market society that refused to function . ”
He warned that a financial system always devolved , without heavy government control , into a Mafia capitalism — and a Mafia political system — which is a good description of our corporate government .
Polanyi warned that when nature and human beings are objects whose worth is determined by the market , then human beings and nature are destroyed .
Speculative excesses and growing inequality , he wrote , always dynamite the foundation for a continued prosperity and ensure “ the demolition of society .
”
“ In disposing of a man ’s labor power the system would , incidentally , dispose of the physical , psychological , and moral entity ‘ man ’ attached to that tag , ” Polanyi wrote .
“ Robbed of the protective covering of cultural institutions , human beings would perish from the effects of social exposure ; they would die as victims of acute social dislocation through vice , perversion , crime , and starvation .
Nature would be reduced to its elements , neighborhoods and landscapes defiled , rivers polluted , military safety jeopardized , the power to produce food and raw materials destroyed .
Finally , the market administration of purchasing power would periodically liquidate business enterprise , for shortages and surfeits of money would prove as disastrous to business as floods and droughts in primitive society .
Undoubtedly , labor , land , and money markets are essential to a market economy .
But no society could stand the effects of such a system of crude fictions even for the shortest stretch of time unless its human and natural substance as well as its business organizations was protected against the ravages of this satanic mill . ”
The corporate state is a runaway freight train .
It shreds the Kyoto Accords in Copenhagen .
It plunders the U.S. Treasury so speculators can continue to gamble with billions in taxpayer subsidies in our perverted system of casino capitalism .
It disenfranchises our working class , decimates our manufacturing sector and denies us funds to sustain our infrastructure , our public schools and our social services .
It poisons the planet .
We are losing , every year across the globe , an area of farmland greater than Scotland to erosion and urban sprawl .
There are an estimated 25,000 people who die every day somewhere in the world because of contaminated water .
And some 20 million children are mentally impaired each year by malnourishment .
America is dying in the manner in which all imperial projects die .
Joseph Tainter , in his book “ The Collapse of Complex Societies , ” argues that the costs of running and defending an empire eventually become so burdensome , and the elite becomes so calcified , that it becomes more efficient to dismantle the imperial superstructures and return to local forms of organization .
At that point the great monuments to empire , from the Sumer and Mayan temples to the Roman bath complexes , are abandoned , fall into disuse and are overgrown .
But this time around , Tainter warns , because we have nowhere left to migrate and expand , “ world civilization will disintegrate as a whole . ”
This time around we will take the planet down with us .
“ We in the lucky countries of the West now regard our two - century bubble of freedom and affluence as normal and inevitable ; it has even been called the ‘ end ’ of history , in both a temporal and teleological sense , ” writes Ronald Wright in “ A Short History of Progress . ”
“ Yet this new order is an anomaly : the opposite of what usually happens as civilizations grow .
Our age was bankrolled by the seizing of half the planet , extended by taking over most of the remaining half , and has been sustained by spending down new forms of natural capital , especially fossil fuels .
In the New World , the West hit the biggest bonanza of all time .
And there wo n’t be another like it — not unless we find the civilized Martians of H.G. Wells , complete with the vulnerability to our germs that undid them in his War of the Worlds . ”
The moral and physical contamination is matched by a cultural contamination .
Our political and civil discourse has become gibberish .
It is dominated by elaborate spectacles , celebrity gossip , the lies of advertising and scandal .
The tawdry and the salacious occupy our time and energy .
We do not see the walls falling around us .
We invest our intellectual and emotional energy in the inane and the absurd , the empty amusements that preoccupy a degenerate culture , so that when the final collapse arrives we can be herded , uncomprehending and fearful , into the inferno .
Two Afghan women wearing burkas purchase gold in a jewelry shop on February 27 , 2010 in Herat , Afghanistan .

PARIS , May 12 ( UPI ) -- France 's Parliament is taking the first step toward banning Muslim women from wearing a burqa or full - body niqab in public , lawmakers say .
The legislative body has approved a non-binding resolution that states " wearing of the full veil is contrary to the values of the republic " and " violates the dignity and equality between men and women , " The Daily Telegraph reports .

Next week , France 's Cabinet will examine a full draft bill imposing fines on women who wear the full veil and jail sentences of up to a year for men convicted of forcing them to cover up .
The law will also apply to tourists from the Middle East and Gulf states who visit France .
France 's Council of the Muslim Faith has warned the ban risks making French Muslims feel like outcasts .
Statistics indicate fewer than 2,000 of the 2 million Muslim women in France wear the full veil .

Made namespace ensemble .
jdc 27 - may - 2010 Converted into a TEA package .
jdc 21 - may - 2010
To learn LLVM
I made a wrapper for LLVM's C API .
This wrapper is available at : http://github.com/jdc8/llvmtcl
Requirements
Tcl 8.6
LLVM 3.5 , get it from http://llvm.org/releases/
Building the wrapper
The package is a TEA package , build it like this :
$ cd llvmtcl $ export CC=g ++ $ export CFLAGS= - std=c++11 $ ./ configure -- with-tcl= ... -- with-llvm-config= ... $ make $ make test $ make install
Using the LLVM API
The package makes a llvmtcl ensemble command .
The subcommands are the LLVM C API functions with LLVM trimmed from the front .
Functions taking a pointer argument followed by an unsigned argument to specified the number of elements the pointer is pointing to are converted to ensemble commands where the pointer and the unsigned argument are replaced by a Tcl list .
All supported types , enumerators and functions can be found in http://github.com/jdc8/llvmtcl/blob/master/llvmtcl-gen.inp
An example using the package can be found at : http://github.com/jdc8/llvmtcl/blob/master/examples/test2.tcl .
It first builds and verifies a LLVM module and function :
lappend auto_path .
package require llvmtcl # Initialize the JIT llvmtcl LinkInJIT llvmtcl InitializeNativeTarget # Create a module and builder set m [ llvmtcl ModuleCreateWithName " testmodule " ] set bld [ llvmtcl CreateBuilder ] # Create a plus10 function , taking one argument and adding 6 and 4 to it set ft [ llvmtcl FunctionType [ llvmtcl Int32 Type ] [ list [ llvmtcl Int32 Type ] ]
0 ] set plus10 [ llvmtcl AddFunction $m " plus10 " $ ft ] # Create constants set c6 [ llvmtcl ConstInt [ llvmtcl Int32Type ] 6 0 ] set c4 [ llvmtcl ConstInt [ llvmtcl Int32Type ] 4 0 ] # Create the basic blocks set entry [ llvmtcl AppendBasicBlock $ plus10 entry ] #
Put arguments on the stack to avoid having to write select and / or phi nodes llvmtcl PositionBuilderAtEnd $ bld $ entry set arg0_1 [ llvmtcl GetParam $ plus10 0 ] set arg0 _2 [ llvmtcl BuildAlloca $ bld [ llvmtcl Int32 Type ] arg0 ] set arg0_3 [ llvmtcl BuildStore $ bld $ arg0_1 $ arg0 _2 ] #
Do add 10 in two steps to see the optimizer @ work #
Add 6 set arg0 _4 [ llvmtcl BuildLoad $ bld $ arg0 _2 " arg0 " ] set add6 [ llvmtcl BuildAdd $ bld $ arg0 _4 $ c6 " add6 " ] #
Add 4 set add4 [ llvmtcl BuildAdd $ bld $ add6 $ c4 " add4 " ] #
Set return llvmtcl BuildRet $ bld $ add4 # Show input puts " ----- Input --------------------------------------------------" puts [ llvmtcl DumpModule $ m ] # Verify the module lassign [ llvmtcl VerifyModule $m LLVMReturnStatusAction ] rt msg if {$rt} { error $ msg }
This results in the following LLVM bit code :
define i32 @plus10 ( i32 ) { entry : %arg0 = alloca i32 ; <i32*> [ #uses=2 ] store i32 %0 , i32 * %arg0 %arg01 = load i32 * %arg0 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ] %add6 = add i32 %arg01 , 6 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ] %add4 = add i32 %add6 , 4 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ] ret i32 %add4 }
Now execute it :
# Execute lassign [ llvmtcl CreateJITCompilerForModule $m 0 ] rt EE msg set i [ llvmtcl CreateGenericValueOfInt [ llvmtcl Int32Type ] 4 0 ] set res [ llvmtcl RunFunction $ EE $ plus10 $ i ] puts " plus10 ( 4 ) = [ llvmtcl GenericValueToInt $res 0 ]
"
Now optimize the LLVM module :
# Optimize llvmtcl Optimize $m $ plus10
Result of optimization :
define i32 @plus10 ( i32 ) readnone { entry : %add4 = add i32 %0 , 10 ; < i32 > [ #uses=1 ] ret i32 %add4 }
Transforming
Tcl into LLVM bit code
The LLVM wrapper has limited support for converting Tcl into LLVM bit code and is based on the output of tcl : : unsupported : : disassemble .
Current ( stringent ) limitation are :
all variables are 32 - bit integers ( no strings , floats , lists , arrays , dicts , ...)
all proc 's return a single 32 - bit integer
all proc 's must be known at convert time
Simple example
Take this simple Tcl procedure as input :
proc test2 {a b c d e} { return [ expr { 4 +$ a+6} ] }
The tcl : : unsupported : : disassemble output of this example looks like this :
ByteCode 0x0x9b4ffe8 , refCt 1 , epoch 4 , interp 0x0x9a9f3b0 ( epoch 4 ) Source "
return [ expr { 4+$ a+6} ]
" Cmds 2 , src 28 , inst 10 , litObjs 2 , aux 0 , stkDepth 2 , code / src 0.00 Proc 0x0x9b44b38 , refCt 1 , args 5 , compiled locals 5 slot 0 , scalar , arg , " a " slot 1 , scalar , arg , " b " slot 2 , scalar , arg , " c " slot 3 , scalar , arg , " d " slot 4 , scalar , arg , " e " Commands 2 : 1 : pc 0 - 8 , src 5 - 26 2 : pc 0 - 7 , src 13 - 25 Command 1 : " return [ expr { 4+$ a+6} ] " Command 2 : " expr { 4 +$ a+6} " ( 0 ) push1 0 # " 4 " ( 2 ) loadScalar1 % v0 # var " a " ( 4 ) add ( 5 ) push1 1 # " 6 " ( 7 ) add ( 8 ) done ( 9 ) done
Translating it to llvm with the llvmtcl Tcl2LLVM command results in :
define i32 @test2( i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 ) { block0 : %5 = alloca [ 100 x i 8 * ] ; <[ 100 x i8 * ]*> [ #uses=10 ] %6 = alloca i 32 ; <i32*> [ #uses=20 ] store i32 0 , i32 * %6 %7 = alloca i 32 ; <i32*> [ #uses=2 ] store i32 %0 , i32 * % 7 %8 = alloca i32 ; <i32*> [ #uses=1 ] store i32 %1 , i32 * %8 %9 = alloca i32 ; <i32*> [ #uses=1 ] store i32 % 2 , i32* %9 %10 = alloca i32 ; <i32*> [ #uses=1 ] store i32 %3 , i32* %10 %11 = alloca i32 ; <i32*> [ #uses=1 ] store i32 % 4 , i32* %11 % push = alloca i 32 ; <i32*> [ #uses=2 ] store i32 4 , i32 * % push % push1 = load i32 * %6 ; <i32 > [ #uses=2 ] % push2 = getelementptr [ 100 x i 8 * ] *
%5 , i32 0 , i32 % push1 ; <i8**> [ #uses=1 ] % 12 = bitcast i32 * % push to i8 * ; < i8*> [ #uses=1 ] store i8 *

Note the 100 location stack being allocated at the beginning , the stack pushes and the stack pops .
Running all this through the llvm optimizer results in :
define i32 @test2( i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 ) readonly { block0 : %5 = add i32 %0 , 10 ; < i32 > [ #uses=1 ] ret i32 %5 }
IIR Filter example
Now consider an IIR filter implemented in Tcl :
proc low_pass {x x1 x2 y1 y2 C0 C1 C2 C3 C4} { return [ expr { $x *$ C0 + $ x1*$ C1 + $ x2 *$ C2 + $ y1*$ C3 + $ y2*$ C4} ] }
Converting and optimizing it with llvmtcl gives the following result :
define i32 @low_pass ( i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 , i32 ) readnone { block0 : %10 = mul i32 % 5 , %0 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ]
%11 = mul i32 %6 , %1 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ]
% 12 = mul i32 % 7 , %2 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ]
%13 = mul i32 %8 , %3 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ] % 14 = mul i32 % 9 , %4 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ]
%15 = add i32 % 11 , %10 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ]
%16 = add i32 % 15 , %12 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ]
%17 = add i32 % 16 , %13 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ]
%18 = add i32 % 17 , %14 ; <i32 > [ #uses=1 ] ret i32 %18 }
Now also convert a driver function :
proc filter { } { set y 0 set x1 0 set x2 0 set y1 0 set y2 0 for { set i 0} { $i < 1000} {incr i} { set y [ low_pass $ i $ x1 $ x2 $ y1 $ y2 1 3 - 2 4 - 5 ]
# Messing with the result to stay within 32 bit if {$y > 1000 || $y < - 1000 } { set y 1 } else { set y1 $y } set y2 $ y1 set y1 $y set x2 $ x1 set x1 [ expr { $ i} ] } return $y }
The result of low_pass is modified so the results stay well within 32 - bit boundaries .
The optimized result becomes :
define i32 @filter ( ) readnone { bb.nph : %0 = alloca [ 100 x i 8 * ] , align 8 ; <[ 100 x i8 * ]*> [ #uses=2 ] % push2 = getelementptr [ 100 x i 8 * ] * %0 , i64 0 , i64 0 ; <i8**> [ #uses=1 ] % push410 = getelementptr [ 100 x i 8 * ] * %0 , i64 0 , i64 1 ; <i8**> [ #uses=1 ] %push408474 = alloca i32 , align 4 ; < i32*> [ #uses=2 ] store i32 1000 , i32* % push408474 %1 = bitcast i32* % push408474 to i8 * ; < i8*> [ #uses=1 ] store i8 *

Playing Ffidl
You can also use LLVM to invoke shared library functions :
# Example showing how to call library function lappend auto_path .

Looking at the optimized code , note how LLVM could avoid the call to pow :
define double @wrapped_sin( double ) { entry : % call = tail call double @sin( double %0 ) ; < double > [ #uses=1 ] ret double % call } declare double @sin( double ) define double @pyth ( double , double ) { entry : % pow2 = fmul double %0 , %0 ; < double > [ #uses=1 ] % pow21 = fmul double % 1 , %1 ; < double > [ #uses=1 ] % c2 = fadd double % pow2 , % pow21 ; < double > [ #uses=1 ] %c = tail call double @sqrt( double % c2 ) ; < double > [ #uses=1 ] ret double %c }

Impressive .
You may want to look at the Hindley - Milner algorithm for type inference :

Another option is trace tree compiling à la TraceMonkey , using the bytecode stream as input :

I did n't like all the namespace imports and the long names so I defined a little namespace ensemble like this ; maybe you think it 's a good idea to use that too ?
proc create_llvm_ensemble {} { set map {} foreach cmd [ info commands :: llvmtcl : : LLVM * ] { lappend map [ string range $ cmd 15 end ] $ cmd } namespace ensemble create - command :: llvm - map [ dict create { * }$map ] }
Usage like this :
package require llvmtcl create_llvm_ensemble llvm LinkInJIT llvm InitializeNativeTarget ...

Good proposal .
I converted the package to make the commands an ensemble .
Netstat is a very powerful utility that will list all of the TCP and UDP connections , as well as unix socket connections currently listening for connections as well as currently connected .
While many home users may not necessarily need to worry about this , online gamers , or anyone who intends to host any sort of server in the future , will surely at some point need to deal with ports .
Netstat is also useful for security and privacy , for example , to find out which programs " talk " to the Internet .
Using netstat can be an extremely simple process , or it can get very complicated and heavy , depending on usage ; so today we will look at some of the more common uses for Netstat .
As promised ( in my article " How do I find my network information in Linux ? " )
I am going to introduce you to the netstat command .
This command is a very useful tool for discovering networking information such as routing tables , network connections , interface statistics , masquerade connections , and multicast memberships .
But it 's not quite as simple to use as some of of the other " discovery " tools ( such as ifconfig ) .
With netstat you really do need to know what you 're looking for and how to find it .
This article will help you to understand just that .
Installation ?
Fortunately your distribution should come with the netstat command pre-installed .
To check this , open up a terminal window ( that 's where you will use netstat anyway ) and issue the command which netstat .
This command should return something like / bin / netstat .
That will tell you that the tool is installed and where the executable is .
Netstat Basics
The basic netstat command looks like :
netstat ARGUMENT OPTIONS
Where ARGUMENT is the type of address family you want information about and OPTIONS is the optional option (s ) that will specify the type of information you get returned .
Because netstat offers such a variety of options , it might be best if I first list some of the more useful options .
a : Shows the state of all sockets and routing table entries .
: Shows the state of all sockets and routing table entries .
c : Display information continuously .
: Display information continuously .
d :
Show the state of all interfaces that use DHCP .
: Show the state of all interfaces that use DHCP .
e : Show extended information .
: Show extended information .
g : Show the multicast group membership information for both IP v4 and IPv6 .
: Show the multicast group membership information for both IP v4 and IPv6 .
i : Display a table of all network inferfaces .
: Display a table of all network inferfaces .
l : Limit statistics to a defined interface .
: Limit statistics to a defined interface .
M : Show multicast routing tables .
: Show multicast routing tables .
n : Shows network addresses as numbers instead of the default symbols .
: Shows network addresses as numbers instead of the default symbols .
p : Show address resolution tables .
: Show address resolution tables .
P : Limit statistics to a defined protocol .
: Limit statistics to a defined protocol .
r : Show all routing tables .
: Show all routing tables .
t : Show TCP connections .
: Show TCP connections .
u : Show UDP connections .
: Show UDP connections .
v : Use verbose mode for output .
So let 's take a look and see how these can be used together .
netstat
By itself ( no options ) this command prints out generic statistics of the host you are currently connected to .
netstat -an
This command will display all connections to the host , including source and destination addresses and ports , and displays them as numbers .
netstat -rn
This command will display the routing table for the host in numeric form .
netstat -r
This command will display your routing table for your host .
netstat - natp
This command will display active TCP connections in numerical form .
netstat -t -- listening
This will show you all tcp ports you host is listening on .
netstat -- statistics
This command will display various statistics for your host 's interfaces .
Note that this command will display a LOT of statistics .
As you can see , this command will display quite a bit of information .
On top of that you might need to pipe this command through the less command in order to see it more easily .
That full command would look like netstat -- statistics | less .
Using it that way would allow you to use your arrow keys to scroll up and down through the ouput .
Usage Tips for Netstat
One of the most basic and common ways to use netstat is to check for which ports are listening
netstat -l
Which gives something like this on my freshly installed Antergos system
Or , if you are looking to focus your search a little bit more , you can add another option to sort specificly for different types of connections
netstat -lt # for TCP
netstat -lu # for UDP
netstat - lx # for Unix
Or , you can go on the complete opposite end of the spectrum , and list all connections
netstat -a
If you prefer , another option that can be useful to keep in mind , is using the ‘ n ’ option .
When using netstat -n or netstat - ltn for example , all hostnames will no longer try to be resolved , and only IP addresses will be shown , like in the example below .
As you can see , localhost in name , was resolved to its numerical value after using the ‘ n ’ option
Another way to use netstat is netstat - ie , the ‘ i ’ for interfaces , and the ‘ e ’ for ‘ extended ’ which will help give us a more human readable output .
netstat - ie #
This will show us a list of network interfaces , and information about each device .
Advanced Netstat tips
What we want to do is tell netstat to give us output for specific applications that are listening for tcp connections .
To do this we issue the command :
netstat -- tcp -- listening -- programs
The output for this command would look something like :
Proto Recv - Q Send - Q Local Address Foreign Address Stat PID / Program
tcp 0 0 *:ssh *:* LISTEN 25469/sshd
tcp 0 0 *: httpd *:* LISTEN 26754/httpd
tcp 0 0 localhost : ipp *:* LISTEN -
Now you can actually see some useful information .
In the above output you can see that both sshd and httpd are listening for incoming connections .
The above is just a snippet of what the output can look like .
What is very handy about this command is it will show you if there is a command or local address listening for incoming connections that should n't be listening .
If you find an application that should n't be listening , kill it to be safe .
Route
Netstat is able to quickly print your machines ' kernel routing table with the command :
netstat -r
The output of this command will look like :
Kernel IP routing table
Destination Gateway Genmask Flags MSS Window irtt Iface 192.168.1.0 * 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth0
default 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.0 UG
0 0 0 eth0
Statistics
This is one of the handier of the netstat tools .
With this you can find out exactly the statics for each protocol .
The basic command structure is :
netstat -- statistics
which will give you far more information than you want .
Say , you only want to see statistics on the TCP protocol .
For this you can issue the command :
netstat -t -- statistics
The output to the above command will include information such as :
Tcp :
4343 active connections openings
8 passive connection openings
5 failed connection attempts
178 connection resets received
6 connections established
59075 segments received
60033 segments send out
76 segments retransmited
0 bad segments received .
303 resets sent
Or you could get information on UDP as well with the command :
netstat -u -- statistics
Which would give you similar output for the UDP protocol .
Get creative
What if you wanted to see all unique IP addresses connected to a server ?
You can do that with netstat ( and the help of a few other tools ) like so :
netstat - nat | awk '{ print $ 5} ' | cut -d : - f1 | sed -e '/ ^$ /d ' | uniq
The output of the above command would depend upon how much traffic your machine / server is getting .
But it will include all unique IP addresses attempting to connect to your server .
What about checking to see if your server is under a DOS attack ?
You can do that with netstat like this :
netstat - anp | grep ' tcp\|udp ' | awk '{print $ 5} ' | cut -d : - f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
The above command will list out the IP addresses requesting the highest amount of connections to your server .
If you see a number that is far higher than it should be , you most likely are under a Denial of Service attack .
Final thoughts
Netstat is one of those tools that you ’ll never really think you ’ll need , until suddenly you do ; and its always good to know how to use it incase the need ever arises at least on some basic level .
For more information about how to use the netstat command and its options , check out the man pages by typing man netstat .
Now you :
What ’s your preferred utility for checking network information , and why ?

Pope - Church Must Face Terrifying Truth of Sex Abuse
The Catholic Church must finally face the “ terrifying ” truth of clerical sex abuse , says Pope Benedict in what Reuters notes are perhaps his most frank comments since the scandal broke two months ago .
Catholicism ’s greatest threat , he told reporters aboard a flight to Lisbon , is no longer enemies from the outside but “ sin within , ” and the church has “ a very deep need ” to do penitence and “ accept purification . ”
The pontiff ’s trip to Portugal will focus on a different spiritual crisis : the decline of Catholicism in Europe .
In Portugal , notes the BBC , 90 % of people say they ’re Catholics , but only about 20 % regularly attend Mass .
Benedict plans to speak about “ the joy of faith and hope ” during his four - day tour , a rep says .
Be careful out there in Town & Country , MO … that there is ninja country .
There are now two reports of ninja attacks in the quiet St. Louis suburb … maybe it ’s a little too quiet … like “ Did you just hear something ?
… hm.
No. ” nina - star - to - the - head quiet .
Now , unless you are 13 years old , you should be fine .
This ninja appears to like the easy game .
A man wearing a ninja mask and all white clothing accosted a 13 - year - old boy Thursday at the Town & Country Crossings shopping center , grabbing him off his bike and throwing the boy to the ground .
He also approached a 13 - year - old girl on Peacock Farm Road at Featherstone Drive near the park on Thursday , acting strangely .
Normally you would n’t dream of thinking that a ninja victim might actually get enough of a look for a description , but that ’s if you are talking about a real ninja … not some fat retarded kid attacking 13 year olds .
The same man , described by police as a short , stocky 18 - year - old Asian man with spiked hair , has recently been seen playing with swords in Queeny County Park .
The white ninja of Town & Country sure sounds like one hell of a bad ass .
There seems to be little choice left other than us having to don our ninja gear and defeat this monster ourselves .
It seems so long ago that we promised we would never again use our fists and the powerful weapons that they are .
We can still see the tattered remains of Spongebob t- shirts and smell the horribly sweet smell of Capri - Sun packets in our nightmares .
… We should have never lost our temper , but that buss of 3rd graders should n’t have laughed at a grown man leaping over a puddle with his arms out .
We at Punching Kitty challenge you White Ninja of Town & Country , the great battler or 13 year olds !
… nothing in the face though .
That ’s how we make our money .

Authorities have seized a gun made of matches and charged an inmate over the find at Mobilong prison in South Australia .
Jail staff made the discovery after they noticed an inmate behaving suspiciously .
Authorities say the 13cm replica was made out of matchsticks and had been painted black .
They described it as highly realistic .
Correctional Services Minister Tom Koutsantonis said it could have appeared threatening if used against prison staff .
" There is no doubt that if confronted with such an object staff would have felt threatened , " he said .
" Our fear is that it could have been used for an escape attempt or to threaten other inmates .
" The gun has a position for a rubber band so it can be moved to seem it 's being cocked like a real gun , at its tip are the ends of two pencils which have a metal casing for a rubber or eraser which were removed so if pressed against someone 's neck or body from behind would feel as if it was cold , hard metal . "
Mr Koutsantonis said the inmate had been moved from Mobilong prison , near Murray Bridge , to the high - security Yatala prison in Adelaide .
He said the prisoner had been banned from any type of craft activity .
Charges have been laid under the Correctional Services Act .

Brazil will be without some of its top stars at the World Cup , with coach Dunga betting on players that are not too well known but who achieved successful results with the team .
Ronaldinho , Adriano and Neymar have been left out of Brazil ’s preliminary World Cup squad on Tuesday , along with three - time FIFA world player of the year Ronaldo and veteran left back Roberto Carlos .
Kaka , Robinho , Maicon and Julio Cesar were picked in the squad , but the list also has players such as Elano , Julio Baptista , Ramires , Josue , Nilmar and Gilberto — who are lesser known but have been regulars since Dunga took over the team .
" I was asked to revamp the national team after the 2006 World Cup , " Dunga said .
" We closed a cycle of players in the national team , bringing players with attitude , commitment and passion for the national team . "
Dunga is sticking to most of the players who helped Brazil win last year ’s Confederations Cup and finish top of South American World Cup qualifying .
His players also won the bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics , and earned victories in high - profile friendlies against Argentina , Italy , England and Portugal .
" These players are winners , " Dunga said .
" There is no doubt that they are prepared to help Brazil reach its goal .
They are ready to give their best for the country . "
One of the biggest surprises was the absence of Adriano , who had been constantly called up by Dunga in recent matches .
But there had been doubts because of recent off - the - field problems that caused him to miss several training sessions with Flamengo .
" We gave Adriano numerous chances , " Dunga said .
" But it came to a time when we had to make a decision . "
Young sensations
Wolfsburg 's Grafite was called up to take Adriano 's place .
Ronaldinho , a two - time FIFA world player of the year , had n't been called up for the national team since April 2009 , but had been playing reasonably well this season with AC Milan and many wanted him to be included in the squad .
" Ronaldinho ’s quality and capacity as a player is indisputable , " Dunga said .
" But my decision has to be made based on reason .
I have to make a decision based on what happens on the field . "
Brazilian fans and local media had also been pushing for Dunga to summon Santos young sensations Neymar and Paulo Henrique Ganso , who have been among the hottest players in Brazilian football this year .
The 18 - year - old striker Neymar has dazzled fans with his speed and balls skills , being called by many as the new Robinho .
The 20 - year - old Ganso , or " Goose " in Portuguese , attracted attention for his maturity and ability as a playmaker .
Along with Robinho , they led Santos to more than 100 goals in some 30 matches this year .
" Some players are extremely talented , but we have to test them before taking them to a World Cup , " Dunga said .
" Maybe they are ready to play in a World Cup now , but maybe they are not . "
None have been called up to the senior team so far .
Dunga ’s list was basically the same as the one for Brazil ’s latest friendly against Ireland in March , with the exception of goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes , who was replaced by Victor at the time .
Only three players are currently in Brazilian football — Kleberson , Gilberto and Robinho , who is on loan from Manchester City .
" Those who took advantage of their chance have made the team , " Dunga said .
Brazil will practise for about a week in the southern Brazilian city of Curitiba before heading to South Africa on May 26 .
The five - time world champions will play against North Korea , Ivory Coast and Portugal in Group G .
More than 500 Brazilian and international journalists were accredited for the announcement of Dunga 's list in Rio de Janeiro .

You know it 's not going to be your day when you get back to your car to find it buried under a rock .
This Toyota owner returned to her vehicle and found the beloved motor a mangled wreck .
She had parked her Yaris on a verge in the village of Hayfield in the Derbyshire Peak District yesterday .
A lorry loaded with rocks came by and the biggest - weighing eight tons - tumbled off .
A photographer said : " The driver said he looked in his mirror and saw the rock slipping but it was on the car before he could do anything .
If anyone had been in it , they would not have stood a chance . "
Foucault and His Panopticon
by Moya K. Mason
Michel Foucault
Above all else , Michel Foucault believed in the freedom of people .
He also realized that as individuals , we react to situations in different ways .
His used his books as a vehicle to show the various factors that interact and collide in his analyzation of change and its effects .
As a philosophical historian and an observer of human relations , his work focused on the dominant genealogical and archaeological knowledge systems and practices , tracking them through different historical eras , including the social contexts that were in place that permitted change - the nature of power in society .
He wrote that power " reaches into the very grain of individuals , touches their bodies and inserts itself into their actions and attitudes , their discourses , learning processes and everyday lives " ( Foucault 1980,30 ) .
Along with other social theorists , Foucault believed that knowledge is always a form of power , but he took it a step further and told us that knowledge can be gained from power ; producing it , not preventing it .
Through observation , new knowledge is produced .
In his view , knowledge is forever connected to power , and often wrote them in this way : power / knowledge .
Foucault 's theory states that knowledge is power :
Knowledge linked to power , not only assumes the authority of ' the truth ' but has the power to make itself true .
All knowledge , once applied in the real world , has effects , and in that sense at least , ' becomes true . '
Knowledge , once used to regulate the conduct of others , entails constraint , regulation and the disciplining of practice .
Thus , ' there is no power relation without the correlative constitution of a field of knowledge , nor any knowledge that does not presuppose and constitute at the same time , power relations ( Foucault 1977,27 ) .
For him , power exists everywhere and comes from everywhere ; it was a key concept because it acts as a type of relation between people , a complex form of strategy , with the ability to secretly shape another 's behaviour .
Foucault did not view the effects of power negatively .
For him , power did n't exclude , repress , censor , mask , and conceal .
Foucault saw it as a producer of reality : " it produces domains of objects and rituals of truth " ( Foucault 1977,194 ) .
The importance for him always lay in the effect that power has on entire networks , practices , the world around us , and how our behaviour can be affected , not power itself .
One of the techniques / regulatory modes of power / knowledge that Foucault cited was the Panopticon , an architectural design put forth by Jeremy Bentham in the mid-19th Century for prisons , insane asylums , schools , hospitals , and factories .
Instead of using violent methods , such as torture , and placing prisoners in dungeons that were used for centuries in monarchial states around the world , the progressive modern democratic state needed a different sort of system to regulate its citizens .
The Panopticon offered a powerful and sophisticated internalized coercion , which was achieved through the constant observation of prisoners , each separated from the other , allowing no interaction , no communication .
This modern structure would allow guards to continually see inside each cell from their vantage point in a high central tower , unseen by the prisoners .
Constant observation acted as a control mechanism ; a consciousness of constant surveillance is internalized .
Foucault 's Panopticon
The Panopticon was a metaphor that allowed Foucault to explore the relationship between 1 . ) systems of social control and people in a disciplinary situation and , 2 . ) the power - knowledge concept .
In his view , power and knowledge comes from observing others .
It marked the transition to a disciplinary power , with every movement supervised and all events recorded .
The result of this surveillance is acceptance of regulations and docility - a normalization of sorts , stemming from the threat of discipline .
Suitable behaviour is achieved not through total surveillance , but by panoptic discipline and inducing a population to conform by the internalization of this reality .
The actions of the observer are based upon this monitoring and the behaviours he sees exhibited ; the more one observes , the more powerful one becomes .
The power comes from the knowledge the observer has accumulated from his observations of actions in a circular fashion , with knowledge and power reinforcing each other .
Foucault says that " by being combined and generalized , they attained a level at which the formation of knowledge and the increase in power regularly reinforce one another in a circular process " ( Foucault 1977 ) .
For Foucault , the real danger was not necessarily that individuals are repressed by the social order but that they are " carefully fabricated in it " ( Foucault , 1977 ) , and because there is a penetration of power into the behaviour of individuals .
Power becomes more efficient through the mechanisms of observation , with knowledge following suit , always in search of " new objects of knowledge over all the surfaces on which power is exercised " ( Foucault 1977 ) .
When only certain people or groups of people control knowledge , oppression is a possibility .
We need to find out who is recording our actions .
At least then we will know who has power and who does n't .
But what happens to all the knowledge that is collected through mechanisms of power ?
Is n't that the most important question ?
Foucault painted us a picture but left it up to us to create a process for resistance , and to figure out how to resolve conflicts ourselves .
He gave us instruments of analysis , but offered no weapons .
Where can we draw the line between security and freedom , especially when modern surveillance technology is increasingly used in urban public spaces to control or modify behaviour , tracking people who are n't incarcerated , but mobile and innocently going about their business ?
Who determines what our rights are ?
Can we make the rules together ?
Can we mobilize counter - power to form a resistance against the pervasiveness of an increasingly intrusive electronic society that is trying to manage the information it is tracking and collecting ?
Can we wage our own battles and develop some strategies to help us retain a semblance of individual anonymity and privacy ?
Can we develop our own system of power / knowledge as a form of resistance ?
Or should we just surrender to it ?
Surrender to the unseen power that endeavours to control us from afar ?
Or should we continue to adapt and submissively , quietly accept the prevailing philosophy of an increasingly monitored society ?
Or should we try to overcome ?
If power systems are already immersed in society , does smart mob technology offer any real opportunities for significant counter - power ?
Should we even bother to hope that we can change the world ?
Who or what should we develop a resistance against , if we want to see real change ?
Foucault says it is better to forget the State in our struggle against power , and instead , concentrate on local struggles .
Are recent street protests against globalization a good point of departure ?
Can we really expect that the right thing will be done just because ?
Can local cooperation and resistance make a difference globally ?
Can smart mobs help by allowing us to organize even more appropriate and more mobilized counter - power protests , and offer a more sophisticated avenue for defending democratic liberties and personal rights ?
It may be possible that coordination and cooperation , brought about by smart mob technologies , will help us to acquire new forms of social power by organizing just in time and just in place .
Perhaps the real power of smart mob technologies lies in their ability to act as agents of change ; one group at a time , one place at a time .

Adam Tavss , a former Miami Beach Police Department officer under investigation for gunning down two men in four days last summer , was arrested last night after police found a " fully operational " marijuana grow lab in his house with dozens of plants .
Acting on a tip , Miami Dade police raided Tavss ' house in West Kendal around 4:30 p.m. yesterday .
Inside the suburban home , cops found a " clandestine " lab with 47 plants , worth about $ 50,000 on the street .
Tavss ' arrest is just the latest head - snapping turn in a case that began last June 14 when the cop shot to death a tourist from Virginia on Washington Ave. , and then four days later killed another man on the MacArthur Freeway .
Both shootings were extremely questionable -- you can read our full feature on the unanswered questions in the case here .
And they looked even worse for the Miami Beach PD when Tavss resigned in November after getting caught with pot in his system .
Tavss , a 36 - year - old former teacher , had just three years on the force when he first killed on June 14 .
That night , he gunned down Husien Shehada , a 28 - year - old cab driver from just outside Washington , D.C .
Tavss and the police claimed that Shehada and his brother , an engineer named Samer , were armed and looking for trouble on Washington Ave. , but no weapons were found on the scene .
What 's more , a surveillance video outside the nightclub
Twist showed both brothers turning toward Tavss and raising their arms peacefully before Husien collapsed to the ground .
Four days later , Tavss blasted to death Lawrence McCoy Jr. , a 29 - year - old drifter accused of stealing a cab .
McCoy was riddled with bullets and although Tavss again claimed he was armed , no weapon was found at the scene .
News soon emerged that Tavss had been accused in 2007 by another officer of snorting cocaine at a department holiday party .
Still , he stayed on desk duty until resigning in November .
When he left , he earned $ 17,242.46 in unused sick leave and pension payouts .
Miami Beach detectives , the State Attorney 's Office and Internal Affairs each have investigations open into Tavss ' shootings .
There 's no word yet on what charges he 'll now face over his marijuana grow house .

Tequila Reviews :
1800 Silver Tequila
This tequila has a very sweet and thick nose with notes of vanilla , candied pear , and roasted agave .
On the taste it ’s cinnamon and vanilla , mixed with white pepper and huge roasted agave notes .
There are some subtle chalky and earthy notes which round it out .
The finish is long , cool and sweet .
Simply put , 1800 Silver is , a well priced , sweet and affable tequila .
1800 Milenio Extra Anejo Tequila –
The entry for 1800 Milenio Tequila is very oak forward with many of the oak notes from the nose present on the palate , including cigar box , old oak , and sawdust .
These oak notes are well supported by some underlining sweet notes including caramel , vanilla , and spiced cake .
As things head towards the midpalate , the tequila ’s vegetal character becomes more apparent with dill , white pepper , and roasted agave added to the mix .
In the midpalate 1800 Milenio ’s spicy character emerges with an increase in the pepper kick , cinnamon , clove , allspice , and dash of hot peppers .
It ’s here in the midpalate where the Milenio also starts to really dry out .
The balance of oak and spice with the sweeter notes that was established in the opening is completely lost , and Milenio becomes just dry spice
The finish for 1800 Milenio is the most disappointing part of the taste experience .
Things dry out so much in the midpalate that the finish is just too short and too dry .
It ’s a shame because this tequila establishes some really nice flavor notes at the entry , but is n’t able to maintain them through to the finish .
Alderete Tequila –
The nose on the Alderete is light and slightly spicy .
There ’s an etherial quality to the nose that is incredibly inviting .
The entry is silky soft and smooth with just a slight sweet quality to it .
The core of the Alderete Tequila unfolds in the midpalate with a unique herbal quality that ’s absolutely seductive .
It grabs a little heat towards the finish , enough to leave your palate tingling .
Alderente is an exceptional and unique tequila .
Ambhar Platinum Tequila – Ambar is a distinctively different tequila .
Made from a blend of agave plants from both the highlands and the lowlands , Ambhar Platiunm Tequila is distilled five times ( vs the tradition 2x ) to create a tequila which leans closer to being more crisp and subtle than most tequilas .
Ambhar Platinum Tequila has a nice light peppery nose .
The entry is very crisp and slightly sweet with a nice soft peppery spice .
There ’s a slight herbaciousness under the pepper and it maintains a lot of its flavor through a fairly long finish .
Once the Abhar finishes it leaves a nice cool and pleasant feeling on the palate .
Arrogante Blanco Tequila – Impulsora Rombo made its name as the original producer of Sammy Hagar ’s Cobo Wabo Tequila , but the brand was sold to Sky Spirits it moved production to another facility .
This gave the Impulsora team an opportunity to regroup and look at making their own tequila .
Arrogante has big ripe fresh agave on the nose with a slight undercurrent of white pepper .
The entry is soft with a nice mouthfeel and strong fresh agave flavor .
It quickly opens up with a wide range of spice flavors including pepper , allspice and even some woodsy cinnamon notes .
Arrogante picks up just a slight amount of heat at the end of the mid palate and has a long slightly salty finish .
Tequila ArteNOM
Seleccion de 1580 Blanco Tequila –
The nose of ArteNOM 1580 Blanco is reflective of the high altitude grown agave , with rich roasted agave notes in the nose along with ripe pineapple , salt , light cinnamon , subtle green jalapeño pepper , and dill .
The entry captures the roasted agave from the nose which integrates rich roasted agave flavor , ripe pineapple , and banana with spicy white pepper and a touch of jalapeño .
It ’s a good amount of flavor and complexity right out of the gate and the flavors are balanced very well .
In the midpalate , some of the sweetness from the entry subsides and we see an increase in the white pepper spice as well as a boost in jalapeno and the introduction of cinnamon spice .
The banana note from the entry is still very much there , but in the midpalate it ’s much more of a supporting flavor .
Things also start to really dry out in the midpalate and we get a little lime added to the mix as we head toward the finish .
The finish is fairly dry and slightly spicy .
It flirts with being overly dry but it feels more like a stylistic choice rather than a flaw .
ArteNom 1580 Blanco Tequila does a nice job of balancing the rich , sweet fruit notes you often see in higher elevation grown agave with some of the spicier and slightly vegetal tones .
Tequila ArteNOM
Seleccion de 1414 Reposado Tequila –
Even though it only spent a few months in casks , the wood notes from the cask are apparent on the nose with roasted agave mixing with strong cinnamon , light oak , and an undercurrent of vanilla .
Also in the nose is some nice agave related spice , white pepper , dill , and touch of habanero .
The entry for ArteNom 1414 Reposado is slightly spicy , with cinnamon and white pepper leading the charge .
Tequila ArteNOM ’s blanco was all about balancing the sweet and fruity notes with spice , whereas with the reposado it ’s all about balancing out the spice with lightly sweet notes , with the cinnamon and white pepper supported with roasted agave and vanilla .
In the midpalate we get the addition of some nice citrus with lime added to the mix .
The midpalate continues to be a showcase for the warm spices in this reposado , especially the cinnamon which is now backed by clove , white pepper , and hot peppers .
The finish is long and spicy with white pepper , cinnamon , hot pepper , and clove lingering on the palate .
As with the blanco , ArteNOM ’s 1414 reposado is a tequila that ’s all about balance , with a presentation of barrel impact that serves to support and enhance the base tequila , not to cover it up .
There ’s some nice restraint at work here , too – it would have been easy to ramp the spice to make this a bolder tequila , but the commitment to balance really pays off with a reposado tequila that is excellent .
Tequila ArteNOM
Seleccion de 1146 Anejo Tequila – Dark gold in color , the ArteNOM 1146 Anejo Tequila has picked up a great deal of color from its time in barrel .
Given its color you ’d expect the nose to be much oakier than it is , but this is ArteNOM and everything they bottle is about balance .
Rather than dominate the nose , the solid oak is the supporting platform for the other aromas in the mix which include roasted agave .
cinnamon , caramel , almond , and raisin .
The entry for the ArteNOM 1146 Anejo Tequila is delicious , bringing together many of the elements from the nose in balance with the roasted agave , caramel , and raisin supported by toasted oak , cinnamon , almond , and white pepper .
Some of the richer notes from the entry subside a bit in the midpalate to make way for a bit of herbaceousness including oregano , jalapeño pepper , and salt .
Here we also get a touch of ginger and a boost in the white pepper and oak .
The finish is long and captures the nice spiciness of this anejo tequila with oak and pepper lingering for quite some time .
As with their reposado , ArteNOM shows immense reverence for the value of balance in tequila and does a superb job of presenting an anejo tequila that captures the impact of tequila ’s time in barrel without letting that barrel completely dominate the spirit .
Tequila Avion Silver – has clear aromas of fresh agave with an undercurrent of black pepper and a hint of hot pepper .
The entry is soft and slightly sweet with a superb mouthfeel which is neither too thick nor too thin .
Instead of a pepper kick in the mid palate , Avion has a pepper ramp with intensifying black and hot pepper .
Things get a little spicy at the end of the mid palate with a hint of grapefruit rind .
The finish is nice , long , and super clean .
Tequila Avion Reposado – is aged six months in Jack Daniel ’s Barrels which helps give it a sweet nose , and adds vanilla and caramel to the mix along with fresh agave and clear soft oak .
The entry takes on a subtle influence from the bourbon barrel with vanilla and caramel right off the bat .
These notes mix extremely well with the fresh agave .
Things ramp up in the mid palate , and the pepper and oak come together in perfect union .
The finish is wonderfully spicy and much longer than the silver .
It also has a superb cool quality to the finish .
This is an exceptional reposado .
Tequila Avion Anejo – is aged two years in ex-bourbon barrels .
Oak spice dominates the nose but it ’s balanced out with fantastic agave and caramel notes .
The entry shows off the oak well but not intensely .
The oak is immediately balanced by agave , vanilla , and caramel .
The pepper starts off soft and builds sublimely .
Black pepper , agave , vanilla , caramel , and oak are joined toward the end of the mid palate by cinnamon and maple .
No heat , no bite , and a long , soft , peppery but cool finish .
This is not an aggressive anejo .
The goal here is clearly balance and it achieves it superbly .
Tequila Avion Reserva 44 Extra Anejo Tequila – dark gold in color , Tequila Avion Reserva 44 has an enticingly rich and complex nose .
Deep caramel notes intermingle with black and green pepper , cinnamon , clove , fresh cut oak , aged oak , pickled jalapeño , milk chocolate , and mint .
It ’s pretty amazing the number of different aromas in Tequila Avion ’s Reserva 44′s nose and how well these aromas are integrated .
That symphony of aroma becomes a symphony of flavor on the palate .
In the entry Reserva 44′s sweet notes of caramel and cooked agave quickly make way for the oak and pepper spice .
In the midpalate Avion Reserva 44 is everything we ’ve come to know and love about Tequila Avion , with spicy black and green pepper extremely well complemented with oak and cinnamon .
The sweeter elements from the entry are still there in the midpalate giving the solid spice some nice balance and support .
The finish is long , slightly spicy , a little dry , and very flavorful – the kind of finish that makes you want to take another sip .
Tequila Cabeza –
While we love to sip tequila neat , one of the great things about tequila is how well it mixes .
What better option to use in your margaritas , daisies , and palomas than a tequila built from the ground up by a group of world renowned bartenders ?
Tequila Cabeza comes from the 86 company and is the love child of Dushan Zaric , who is best known for his time behind the bar at Employees Only in New York , and Simon Ford , one of the most notable spirit brand ambassadors who worked with such iconic brands as Plymouth Gin , Beefeaters , and Absolut Vodka .
Tequila Cabeza is all about balance – the soft , sweet agave notes there on the entry are perfectly balanced by pepper spice .
We really love the Tequila Cabeza ’s finish , which is one of the more flavorful and enjoyable tequila finishes we ’ve tasted .
As you ’d imagine , Tequila Cabeza makes a killer margarita and the liter bottle it ’s sold in is perfect for a big Cinco de Mayo party , and is well priced at $ 34.99 .
This is great tequila and one we reach for when making tequila cocktails .
Casamigos Reposado Tequila – bright gold in color with a nose that features caramel , fresh agave , and a slight vegetal note along with a very soft and subtle white pepper and oak .
The entry is soft , lightly sweet , and delicate with caramel , agave , and light white pepper .
The soft white pepper spice really emerges in the midpalate but is well balanced out with the agave and caramel .
This spice builds to a slight peak at the end of the midpalate where it ’s joined by a very light tough of oak spice .
It ’s hard to call the spike in pepper a true “ pepper kick ” – although it intensifies , it ’s never very aggressive or overly spicy .
The pepper and oak spice linger along with the caramel and agave for a slightly sweet and lightly spicy finish .
Casamigos Reposado finish is really nice , something to really sit with and enjoy .
Like George Clooney , Casamigos Reposado Tequila is understated and refined .
It ’s slightly delicate quality makes it a tequila that should be sipped neat or over the rocks , but it ’s really too subtle and delicate to mix with .
We ’ve been a fan of the spirits coming out of Productos Finos de Agave .
They seem to have a really great sense on how to produce a cleaner , lighter , and more delicate tequila .
Casamigos Tequila exists in a very similar space as Tequila Avion , but as a much softer and far less spicy alternative .
It ’s nice to see that Clooney and company decided to keep the price more inline with Avion and resisted the urge to go the super premium pricing route that Clase Azule did .
Casamigos Reposado Tequila succeeds at its mission to be an exceptional sipping tequila , and it ’s ideal for people who want to be able to sip tequila neat and not be hammered by a pepper kick or feel the burn from more agressive tequilas .
Casamigos Reposado Tequila is currently beginning a 33 state rollout beginning in California and Arizona where BevMo ! has it exclusively ( as well as on BevMo.com ) as well as in Nevada and Texas .
Casamigos Anejo Tequila – as soft and understated on the nose as the Casamigos Blanco and Reposado .
Here , the anejo has roasted agave combined with caramel , cocoa powder , salt , white pepper , bell pepper , and a touch of oak .
The aromas are n’t effusive , and so you really have to dig to get them .
The impact from the oak is very light given it ’s an anejo , and it ’s nicely balanced with the other aromas .
As with the other Casamigos tequilas , the entry for the Casamigos Anejo is light and delicate with soft , sweet roasted agave combined with light white pepper .
The midpalate adds toffee , chocolate , salt , and a touch of oak to the mix .
As with the nose , the oak here is fairly restrained and it adds more of a tannic , drying quality to this tequila over spice .
Towards the end of the midpalate the white pepper increases in intensity , but it never gets too spicy or aggressive .
The white pepper spice drives the finish which is medium , light , and ends clean .
Dangerously drinkable , Casamigos Anejo Tequila is very much a gateway tequila , a perfect spot for folks who many never have considered sipping their tequila straight to start .
Casa Dragones Tequila – Setting to define the top end of the ultra - premium tequila market , Casa Dragones is a unique joven tequila that brings together a delicately refined platinum tequail with just a touch of extra - anjeo tequila .
The color from the extra - anejo is taken out using an ultra-modern filtration process .
Casa Dragones
Tequila ’s subtle floral and citrus aroma with notes of sweet agave is fresh and inviting .
Swirling a glass reveals its rich , silky body and long , pronounced legs , which leave a sleek texture on the palate .
One sip releases hints of vanilla and spiced undertones balanced with notes of pear for a uniquely smooth taste .
Casa Noble Tequila –
While we tend to fall more for highland tequilas , Casa Noble is a lowland tequila that really brings many of the elements together about tequila that we love .
Casa Noble Blanco balances sweet agave tones along with softer pepper and adds a beautiful floral note .
Casa Noble blanco also captures some of the greener , more vegetal qualities from the fresh , unroasted pinas and brings them into a tequila with superb balance .
Moving up to the Casa Noble Reposado , the tequila transforms considerably and picks up a deep chocolate note along with light cinnamon and caramel .
It ’s a lot different from the blanco but still delicious .
Casa Noble
Anejo is less sweet than the reposado and much more spice forward .
The chocolate tones from the reposado subside and make way for spicy oak and the return of the soft pepper notes .
Casa Noble Blanco retails for around $ 36 , Reposado $ 45 , and Anejo is $ 50 .
Clase Azul Plata – The Clase Azul Blanco tequila has a very soft and sweet nose with just a hint of pepper .
The sweetness of the nose and the undercurrent of spice come together into a nose that is downright seductive .
The nose has no bite or vapor whatsoever .
The entry for the Clase Azul Blanco matches the nose perfectly .
Lightly sweet , fresh agave leads right into a pepper spice which builds to a moderate level , peaks , and then finishes all without losing a step .
The balance between sweet and spice here is sublime , and the finish leaves both the sweet agave and pepper spice in a clear invitation for another sip .
A great spirit in a great package is a rare combination , but Clase Azul manages to deliver something really special , and for the tequila connoisseur , something to seek out .
DeLeón Platinum Tequila – the nose is very representative of a highland ( Los Altos ) tequila , with soft pepper and roasted agave .
In the center of this is light lime peel .
The entry for DeLeón Platinum is soft and lightly sweet with vanilla and roasted agave combined with some nice black pepper to really balance things out .
The black pepper spice ramps up into the midpalate where it ’s joined by cinnamon and lime peel .
For the most part , the midpalate does a nice job of presenting this intensified spice while still maintaining the undercurrent of the sweet roasted agave .
Unfortunately , towards the end of the midpalate things take an unpleasant turn .
All the sweet and affable notes established from the opening completely drop off , and the the pepper spice is considerably dialed back .
What we ’re left with is an overly dry and fairly acidic finish with lime and eucalyptus , absent of many of the enjoyable flavor notes established in this tequila .
When you put it in context , the finish is n’t a complete surprise .
DeLeón Platinum has clearly been crafted to lure premium vodka drinkers over to the premium tequila space .
It ’s a smart move as an increasing number of premium vodka drinkers have become disenfranchised as they ’ve seen the equity in calling out premium vodka brands really erode .
DeLeón Reposado Tequila – Pale gold in color , DeLeón ’s reposado tequila is aged conventionally in American Oak and then finished in French Oak casks .
On the nose the presence of the French Oak cask aging is unmistakable , with strong sawdust combining with light dill , caramel , roasted agave , oak , and black pepper .
The wood from the nose is immediately presented on the palate in the entry with sawdust and oak combined with roasted agave and black pepper .
The sawdust note subsides , giving way to a nice mix of cinnamon , caramel , roasted agave , black pepper , and oak .
As with DeLeón Platinum , the reposado does a good job of balancing and integrating the sweet and spicy flavors .
Also like Platinum , the reposado takes the same sharp left turn at the end of the midpalate .
All the nice established flavors get the boot and all we are left with is a puckeringly dry and fairly vacuous finish .
It ’s a real shame , since combining both French and American Oak does net some really nice flavors for DeLeón ’s reposado , but again , they are mortgaged for a finish that ’s just too dry , too neutral , and too discordant with the rest of the tequila ’s taste experience .
Don Julio Blanco Tequila –
As you nose the Don Julio Blanco Tequila , there ’s no mistaking that you ’re smelling a highlands tequila .
With a bright sweet agave nose and light floral hints backed with light citrus / lime , this blanco tequila is extremely inviting .
The entry is very soft and easy with sweet floral notes and light pepper .
The fresh agave from the nose is very apparent on the palate and comes together beautifully with the floral and peppery notes .
The finish is very nice with a light sweet pepper which tapers out into a nice cool clean mouth .
Don Julio Blanco Tequila is a quintessential highland blanco tequila that highlights all the notes that define this terroir .
Light , clean and sweet , this is an eminently drinkable blanco tequila .
Gran Dovejo Tequila – Many tequilas are singular when it comes to delivering their peppery spice , but not Gran Dovejo .
This highland tequila is packed with flavor and blends spicy green pepper notes with more classic pepper tones with just a dash of habenaro spice .
Gran Dovejo Blanco has so much complexity and flavor , it ’s hard not to dive right back in for another sip moments after you ’ve finished your last one .
There ’s an ethereal quality in spirits called “ deliciousness ” and Gran Dovejo has it in spades .
The Gran Dovejo Reposado adds some lovely oak notes to the mix and enhance a subtle chocolately quality that ’s ever so faint in the blanco without losing the beautiful peppery spice .
Gran Dovejo
Anejo takes everything to the next level with lush cinnamon spice along with deep solid oak .
Gran Dovejo never goes too far off in any one direction and manages to maintain both the superb flavors from the blanco and balance them with the strong spice and oak .
Gran Dovejo Tequila is priced competitively for a super premium tequila , with the Blanco at $ 45 , Reposado at $ 50 , and Anejo at $ 55 .
Tequila Ocho Agaves De Rancho Las Pomez ( Single Estate ) –
This tequila starts with a very nice and delicate nose with soft notes of mint and vanilla .
It ’s cool on the mouth at first and then moves through pepper to sweet .
It ’s a very focused spirit that plays its notes well .
Tequila Ocho Agaves De Rancho Corrales ( Single Estate ) –
This tequila has a nice platinum tint to it with a thick nose that ’s quite vegetal with notes of asparagus , cut grass , vanilla and some hints of leather .
The taste is strong white pepper combined with lush sweet undertones .
It delivers a very solid mix of sweet and peppery with a finish that lasts a long time .
Gran Patron Piedra Extra Anejo Tequila – medium amber in color , the nose on Piedra clearly shows off its time in barrel with a fair amount of oak , cigar box , and clove spice combined with black pepper , clove , and spicy jalapeño pepper .
The integration between the oak spice notes and pepper from the tequila is very solid and the two different kinds of spice work very well together .
There is also a nice undercurrent of sweet caramel that helps bring it all together .
The entry for Patron ’s Piedra is a lot less spicy than the nose would suggest , with the sweeter caramel and butterscotch leading things off .
It ’s not until the midpalate that we really get the spice from the nose with black pepper , clove , and jalapeño pepper joined by cinnamon and light oak .
As with the nose , the combination of the different kinds of spices is nice , but here the old cigar box and deeper oak notes really are n’t in play .
It ’s a combination of sweet caramel and both oak and pepper spice which defines the finish which is medium length , slightly dry , and fairly pleasant .
The mouthfeel on Patron Piedra is nice , a little more dry than lush , but well balanced with the taste .
There ’s no question that Patron Piedra is an expertly crafted tequila which manages to maintain the core character of the Patron flavor experience while coming at it with a lot more balance and finesse .
Patron 7 Anos Extra Anejo
Deep amber in color , this extra anejo clearly shows off its extended time in barrel .
On the nose you get a hint of agave before the oak grabs the focus .
It ’s French oak with sawdust along with black pepper , clove , and vanilla .
The entry on the palate is surprisingly light given the amount of oak on the nose .
The oak from the nose is there , but it ’s far softer and more balanced than expected .
Accompanying the oak is roasted agave , dried fruit , and black pepper .
The mouthfeel is much lighter and delicate than you ’d expect from a tequila sitting in barrels , in Mexico , for seven years .
The midpalate is a showcase for soft spice including black pepper , clove , ginger , and oak , but , as with the entry , it ’s a lot more restrained and understated than we would expect .
There ’s nice balance and integration of flavors , especially with the oak , but it ’s lacking intensity and character .
The finish for Patron ’s 7
Anos is light and peppery , but not really a pepper kick – more like a long , slow , subtle spice .
The finish is pretty dry and finishes fairly clean .
Roca Patron Silver Tequila – Roca Patron
Silver is primarily a showcase for agave , with both fresh and cooked agave with a slight earthy undertone .
There ’s a light pepper but it ’s a lot softer and lighter than traditional silver .
Patron ’s signature citrus is n’t there on the nose , which is overall lighter and more delicate .
The entry for Roca Silver is also significantly different from the traditional Patron .
While there are sweet notes at the opening , including cooked agave and subtle vanilla , they are lighter and presented drier in Roca .
In the midpalate , things continue to dry out with the addition of a light pepper spice and the slight earthy tone that was on the nose .
A notable absence in the midpalate is Patron ’s signature pepper kick – it ’s simply not there .
The finish for Roca Patron Silver is medium length and dry , with light pepper spice and fresh agave .
Roca Silver is ultimately a fairly subtle and understated tequila .
While it ’s not very complex , it does n’t seem to be designed to be .
Roca Silver Tequila is all about presenting agave in a way that ’s decidedly light , dry , and delicate .
It ’s a radical departure from Patron ’s classic Silver , but that ’s not a bad thing .
With Roca Silver , Patron has produced something that is clearly designed to be sipped neat or over ice and exist in a similar space as Casamigos and perhaps even Casa Dragones Tequila .
Roca Patron Reposado Tequila –
The nose on Roca Reposado has a similar restrained quality as the Roca Silver , and while there ’s definite impact from the ex-bourbon barrel with caramel , vanilla , and oak , it ’s much more subdued than the traditional Patron Reposado .
In addition to barrel impact , there ’s the cooked agave note which we saw with Roca Silver as well as a very slight peppery spice .
There ’s also a distinct Milk Dud note that we get from the nose which comes from a slight milk chocolate mingling with the caramel and agave .
The entry for Roca Patron Reposado is much lighter than the traditional Reposado and less complex .
The opening has the sweet caramel , vanilla , and agave mixed with light pepper and oak spice .
In the midpalate there ’s a slight ramping up of the spice along with an increase in pepper .
Things never get very spicy and there ’s an overall light , delicate quality to the Roca Reposado .
The finish for Roca Reposado is medium length and dry with light oak and pepper lingering on the palate .
We get what Patron is trying to do with Roca Reposado and the result is quite affable , but the lack of complexity which worked in Roca Silver just does n’t seem to have the same impact with the Reposado .
While we enjoyed the taste of Roca Reposado , it left us wanting more .
Roca Patron Anejo Tequila – of all the Roca releases , the Anejo is perhaps the closest cousin to Patron ’s Gran Piedra release , although Roca Anejo was aged for only 14 months ( versus 3 years for Piedra ) and only in ex-bourbon barrels ( Piedra added French oak to the mix ) .
With Roca
Anejo the time in barrel is clear with oak spice as one of the leading top notes in the nose .
Other barrel notes including caramel , vanilla , and a touch of cinnamon are here on the nose and they are well integrated with the fresh and roasted agave notes which are a signature part of the Roca line .
There ’s a touch of pepper spice in the mix , but it ’s the oak that ’s much more dominant .
The entry of Roca Anejo follows the other entries in the Roca line with light , sweet notes of caramel , vanilla , and roasted agave but here the oak spice is strong enough to get some nice complexity right out of the gate .
Things intensify in the midpalate where the oak spice is joined by cinnamon , ginger , and pepper .
The finish is superb and brings the oak , pepper , and agave notes through to a long , enjoyable conclusion .
Siete Leguas Blanco Tequila –
With a nice sweet nose the includes vanilla , white sugar , white pepper and mint , this tequila is pleasing from the start .
The taste is a nice union of sweet , sour and spicy with white sugar notes , salt and white pepper .
The finish is slow and long with a nice combination of white pepper and white sugar .
This is a pretty straight forward tequila which is spicy and sweet and would be perfect for mixing in margaritas .
It does n’t quite have the depth for a sipping tequila but its mixing potential is solid .
Siete Leguas Repasado Tequila – A sweet nose with solid agave notes , wet paper and pine nuts , the taste is a nice subtle soft and sweet white pepper with just a hint of parmesan cheese .
There ’s lots of spice on the tongue without being too fiery .
The finish is extremely impressive and it takes a very long time to fade – one of the longest finishes we ’ve seen in this category .
Expertly crafted with great delivery of flavor and finish .
Siete Leguas Anejo Tequila – A very thin gold / pale yellow color , this anejo is one of the lighter ones we ’ve seen .
A thick sweet nose with salted caramel , sherry and a small amount of rubber give this anejo a pleasing and interesting start .
The taste is white pepper , salt , pear and caramel with lots of heat on the tongue .
As with the Siete Leguas Repasado , this Anejo has a terrific long soft peppery finish .
Even tasting blind , our panel connected the Siete Leguas Anejo and Repasado as playing the same flavor notes .
Yeyo Ultra Premium Silver Tequila –
The nice clean , soft , peppery , sweet nose with some mineral undertones is a lot softer than you ’d expect for an 80 - proof spirit and it held its nice soft properties even when I swirled it around in my glass ( no real strong alcohol vapors ) .
The taste follows the nose pretty closely with sweet peppery tones ; it does have some hints of fire but they are extremely well balanced with the sweet and pepper notes .
I found it to be fairly buttery and creamy with a very nicely balanced mouthfeel .
The finish is long and gradual with nice sweet pepper and some very light spice .
Z Blanco Tequila – A delightfully peppery nose with a mix of white and black pepper backed by slightly spicy bell and jalapeno pepper notes .
There ’s just a suggestion of briny pickle which brings everything together in a wonderfully complex and inviting nose .
The entry has some real finesse with a soft mouthfeel that has an elegance to it .
The flavors unfold in the midpalate with the pepper notes up front , and the vegetal green pepper and spicy jalapeno right behind , along with a slightly sweet , fresh agave note .
The spice comes to a peak at the end of the midplate and then gently fades out for a long finish that ultimately finishes clean .
It ’s hard to capture just how delightful Z Blanco Tequila is .
With its inviting nose , delivery of flavor , mouth feel , and finish , it ’s one of the best blanco tequilas we ’ve tried .
Mezcal Reviews :
Del Maguey Crema de Mezcal – Very pale yellow color with a nose of funk , rubber , petrol and walnut , the taste of Crema is unexpectedly heavy and sweet with notes of pure agave , honey , funk and smoke .
There ’a little heat on the back of the throat that rounds out the experience .
The finish is rich , sweet and smokey .
Some of our tasters found this to be too sweet while others raved about its taste .
It ’s a softer and more affordable way to get your feet wet with mezcal but expect to outgrow it in favor of things like the Chichicapa and San Luis del Rio .
Del Maguey San Domingo al Albarradas -
If you did n’t know you were drinking mezcal , you would n’t know it from nosing this one .
An extremely vegetal nose with bright green notes of green onion , bok choy , grapes and vanilla , this mezcal is hot and sweet on the tongue with strong white pepper notes .
There are some unique whiskey - like notes along with the heat and it has a very dry and very long finish .
The San Domingo al Albarradas is a unique and intriguing entry into the mezcal space – one worth seeking out .
Del Maguey Mezcal Vida – Mezcal Vida has good funk on the nose combined with sweet dark fruits like dates and raisins .
The taste is very funky with nice pepper on the tongue combined with sweet and smokey goodness .
There ’s a floral undertone and some sour tones which result in a symphony of sweet , smokey , sour and spicy .
The finish is very long and strong .
Beautifully crafted and wonderfully complex , it ’s hard not to fall for the Mezcal Vida .
Del Maguey Tobala – A very funky and sweet butterscotch nose makes this mezcal one that you ’ll want to spend time sniffing .
Its nose is elusive but delicious .
The taste is extremely flavorful with excellent funk , pepper , smoke and wood .
The finish is extraordinarily long .
With an extreme depth and flavor , the Tobala is something to be savored .
Made from uncultivable agave plants , this is one of the rarest and most expensive mezcals on the market .
El Silencio Joven Mezcal – is made from a blend of three different agave species from San Baltazar ( Espadin , Mexicano , Tobaciche ) and then double distilled .
Most of the mezcals on the market right now are made from a single variety of agave , so El Silencio ’s choice to do a blend of three different kinds is an interesting departure .
Mezcal ’s signature smokiness is here on the nose of El Silencio but it ’s much more restrained than with most of the other mezcals we ’ve had , and reads a little more like mesquite BBQ .
Along with the smoke is a nice roasted agave note , black pepper , and vanilla .
The entry starts out nice and buttery with light smoke , sweet agave , and vanilla , but by the time we get to the midpalate a lot of what ’s established with the entry begins to fade .
In the midpalate El Silencio gets fairly singular with a tequila - like pepper kick backed by a diesel gasoline note .
Towards the finish everything begins to dry out and disappear .
The finish is medium long , driven by pepper and a slight amount of smoke , a stark dry counterpoint to the lush opening .
While there are some nice flavors in the El Silencio Mezcal , it ’s been too stripped down , especially in the midpalate .
Fidencio Mezcal Joven – Strong notes of banana dominate the nose along with vanilla notes , combining to make a nice sweet tropical nose .
There are some rubbery tones that also can be picked up on the nose .
The taste is white pepper with smoke underneath , sugar , caramel , and pear .
The banana note from the nose is also well represented in the taste .
The finish is medium sweet and sour that ends pretty dry .
The nose on this mezcal is fantastic but the taste does n’t quite live up to the promise .
It ’s a unique mezcal that is much less funky than many of the other jovens we ’ve tried .
It is a nice mix of tropical and spice , but falls just short of wow .
Illegal Mezcal Joven – Strong vegetal and savory notes dominate the nose for this mezcal , including fresh asparagus , nutty cheese and smoked bacon .
The taste is intensely smokey with notes of white pepper , bacon , beef jerky and unripe green apple .
On the mouth it feels a little thin and the finish is very dry , sour and smokey .
While there are some nice things going in with this mezcal , it does n’t fully deliver .
Illegal Mezcal Reposado – Pale gold in color , the nose on this mezcal is notably funky with butterscotch , rubber and chipotle spice .
The taste has strong notes of rubber with monster black pepper combined with white pepper , caramel and smoked cedar .
The finish is also extremely long with smoke , pepper and caramel clearly lingering on long after the last sip .
There ’s some fantastic complexity here , although we did n’t love the rubber notes in it .
Still a delish mezcal that we give
Illegal Mezcal Anejo – Golden yellow in color , this mezcal has very pronounced notes of pineapple on the nose combined with caramel , oak , and even distinct notes of gorgonzola .
The taste is beautiful with sweet caramel , butterscotch , pepper , pineapple , smoke and wood .
The finish is a nice balanced smokey , sweet and buttery finish that leaves you wanting more .
A clear standout , this Illegal Mezcal is head and shoulders above their Joven and beautifully crafted .
We fell in love with this Mezcal and heartily recommend it .
Los Nahuales Mezcal Blanco ( Joven ) - A funky ( in a good way ) nose with notes of smoke , cheese rind and salami .
The taste is smokey and savory with notes of white pepper , habanero , honey , and funky , cheesey salami .
It has a very nice full mouthfeel with a strong flavorful finish .
There is some nice depth here in this likable mezcal .
Los Nahuales Mezcal Reposado – Pale yellow in color , this mezcal has a very pasty nose with vanilla and chalk notes .
The nose smells a lot like Elmer ’s glue with a little smoke .
The taste is strong wood , smoke and pepper that dances on the tip of your tongue .
It has a nice slow smokey finish .
There ’s enough going on here to make this a mezcal worth trying .
Los Nahuales Mezcal Anejo –
This mezcal has a light golden caramel color , and a very sweet nose with buttery sugary notes that remind you of chocolate chip cookie dough , with deeper notes of caramel , honey , cardboard and even a dusty old box .
The taste has heavy notes of smoke with some more muted white pepper and caramel companion notes .
Underneath is a nice tone of dried fruit especially dried cherries .
This mezcal has a noticeably cool mouthfeel , almost minty .
The finish is long and smokey , nice and dry .
This is a well distilled and crafted spirit , but its flavor profile may not be for everyone .
Mijes Joven Mezcal – With a blue - grey platinum color , this mezcal has a very nice sweet , thick nose with pear , vanilla and strong notes of butterscotch .
The nose also has some nice funky notes to it .
The taste is very rubbery with pepper , cedar and paper notes .
It ’s also a little dusty on the palate .
The experience of drinking this is extremely unpleasant with the rubbery notes dominating the longer it sits .
The Mijes Joven is overly hot ( chokingly so ) and the finish is all fire and rubber .
How can a spirit with such a promising nose taste so off ?
Taste this one and you ’ll see .
Montelobos Mezcal Joven – the nose is smoky with burnt rubber tire , roasted agave , roasted jalapeño , and oyster shells .
While the smoke is strong , it ’s not overwhelming , and the burnt rubber note is n’t unpleasant , as strange as a pleasant burning tire can sound .
The nose has a strong character to it , but it stops short of being assaultive , and it ’s not harsh or vapory at all .
The entry has a nice sweet roasted agave note which is quickly joined by the smoke from the nose .
The smoke here is quite pleasant , in very much the same way that the peat smoke on an Islay Scotch Whisky is enjoyable .
Also there on the entry is a nice spicy white pepper note which is accompanied by a noticeable amount of salinity .
All this serves to create a balance which is maintained throughout the flavor experience .
In the midpalate the flavors from the entry are joined by a nice vegetal roasted jalapeño note , and the burnt tire from the nose .
As with the smoke note , the smoky , rubbery note in the midpalate is n’t unpleasant in the slightest , which may be an odd and slightly disorienting experience for those who are unfamiliar with the category .
Although the flavors of the Montelobos are strong , they come together quite well in a unified fashion , with all the pieces fitting together well , even though you would n’t expect them to .
The finish is very long and slightly dry with a core of white pepper lingering on the palate along with nice exhale of smoke and rubber .
Oro de Oaxaca Mezcal -
Pale yellow in color , this mezcal has a very funky , smokey and oily nose with undertones of cork , plastic and rubber .
It enters the palate very , very , very hot with notes of smoke and pepper , walnut and rubber .
It feels thin on the mouth and is extremely hit and run – it ’s a blast of heat and then quickly vanishes .
Ultimately too thin and fleeting to really like , it is so out of balance that it feels like something went awry in its distillation .
Scorpion Silver Mezcal – A sweet nose with light floral notes combined with rubber , wet pavement and roasted nuts , there ’s something about it that does n’t quite work and is n’t altogether pleasing .
The taste is pepper , nutmeg , cardamom , and sugar cookie with very subtle notes of smoke underneath .
The finish is pretty clean and dry but we did get some burning on the roof of our mouths ( not a good thing ) .
Tasting blind it gets a 2 1 / 2 stars , but then there ’s the bomb drop : the bottle has a scorpion IN it .
Many of the people on our panel were mortified and said they ’d NEVER buy this spirit because of it .
If it were an amazing mezcal I think we ’d have an argument , but it is n’t .
Scorpion Reposado Mezcal –
White gold in color , almost like a chardonnay , this mezcal has a very thick nose with vanilla , deep caramel , honey , funk and currant .
The taste is a nice mix of white pepper , cherry , caramel , green apple and smoke .
The finish is dry , slightly sour and smokey .
As with the Scorpion Silver , this mezcal has a dead scorpion in the bottle .
This is a huge issue for several members on our tasting panel who would never buy it because of the scorpion .
With the silver it ’s hard to argue against that , but there ’s more case with the reposado .
Scorpion Anejo Mezcal – With a very dark gold color , this mezcal has a strong sweet nose with caramel , honey , butterscotch , pepper and honey .
The nose is notably thick and creamy .
The taste is strong with heavy smoke , bacon notes , charred burnt wood ( maybe cherry ) and an artificially sweet undertone like Splenda .
This mezcal is very heavy and syrupy on the palate and finishes with a charred pepper finish .
As with other Scorpion Mezcal we ’ve reviewed , the fact that there ’s a dead scorpion in the bottle was a huge deal breaker for most people on our tasting panel .
Tasted blind this mezcal scored low , not nearly enough to overcome the issue of the dead scorpion .

WINCHESTER , Ind . —
Like many of his neighbors , farmer Tony Goltstein has to deal with the aftermath of the dairy bubble .
But besides his mounting financial troubles , Mr. Goltstein also must contend with bubbles the size of small houses that have sprouted from the pool of manure at his Union Go Dairy Farm .
Some are 20 feet tall , inflated with the gas released by 21 million gallons of decomposing cow manure .
But he has a plan .
It requires a gas mask , a small boat and a Swiss Army knife .
The saga of Mr. Goltstein 's bubbles , which are big enough to be seen in satellite photos , began about seven years ago and traces the recent boom and bust of U.S. dairy farmers .
Mr. Goltstein , 43 years old , had moved his wife and their three children from the Netherlands to Winchester , population 4,600 , about 90 miles east of Indianapolis .
They planned to build a dairy farm with 1,650 cows on 180 acres .
This year marks the 40th anniversary of Boston Pride , the organization that presents the annual parade held in the city in recognition of Boston 's Lesbian , Gay , Bisexual and Transgender community .

The Federal Government has announced it will launch legal action against Japan 's whaling program in the International Court of Justice next week , but Foreign Affairs Minister Stephen Smith says he does not think the move will hurt the relationship between the two countries .
Formal proceedings against Japan 's Southern Ocean whale hunt will be lodged in The Hague ahead of an International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) meeting in Morocco in June .
Mr Smith informed Japan of the decision last night , after it was approved by Federal Cabinet yesterday afternoon .
He says he is confident the legal action will not affect Australia 's bilateral relationship with its major trading partner .
" The agreement between Australia and Japan is that we will treat this matter in a calm , responsible and mature way , " he said .
Federal Environment Protection Minister Peter Garrett joined Mr Smith for the announcement and said Japan 's so - called scientific whaling program must end .
" We want to see an end to whales being killed in the name of science in the Southern Ocean , " Mr Garrett said .
Mr Garrett was also confident the legal action would not affect Australia 's bilateral relationship with Japan .
" It 's a disagreement between friends , but it is a disagreement which we now believe needs to be properly resolved in the appropriate forum , " he said .
" In the run-up to the IWC my expectation is that that will be an extremely intense and difficult negotiation , but it 's clear to us that this was the appropriate time to lodge that action . "
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's pledge to take Japan to the international court was a key plank of Labor 's federal election platform in 2007 .
Hidenobu Sobashima from Japan 's foreign ministry has told the ABC that Tokyo is disappointed by the decision .
Japan describes the legal action as " " regrettable " but says it is confident the legal action will not harm relations between the two close allies .
But it says it is prepared to argue its case inside the court .
' Having the guts '
Jeff Hansen from the anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd says the Government 's decision is a step in the right direction .
" Sea Shepherd commends the Australian Government for finally having the guts to stand up to the Japanese whalers , " he said .
" But make no mistake - if the Japanese whaling fleet make their way down to the Southern Ocean whaling sanctuary this summer , Sea Shepherd will be there to stop them . "
Mr Hansen has offered to help the Government collate evidence for its case .
" We 're always open to share any information or documentation we have , " he said .
" We have our log books and details where the Japanese whaling fleet is operating in and you can see clearly the whales are being hunted .
" They 're operating deep within the Southern Ocean whale sanctuary and deep within the Australian economic exclusion zone . "
Greens leader Bob Brown is pleased the Government is taking Japan to court but says it is too late to stop the whale hunt this summer .
" It 's welcome but it 's not enough .
And a legal challenge now in the international court by the Rudd Government they know is not going to see any finality before the election , " Senator Brown said .
" It is very careful election engineering rather than any sort of stay of the harpoons . "
Opposition Leader Tony Abbott would not say if he supports the move because he has not seen the Government 's legal advice , but he has a theory on the Government 's motive for announcing the step today .
" Plainly , it is a smokescreen against the Government 's latest attempt to brainwash the Australian people with a dishonest advertising campaign , " he said .
" The Coalition strongly opposes so - called scientific whaling .
We support appropriate and effective action in international tribunals . "

Kanellos , the Greek Dog of Justice , has protested at every public demonstration in Greece for the past two years .
Can we get a little less fiscal reporting ( boring ) and a little more Riot Dog reporting .

Can we get some goddamn facts on this , major news outlets ?
Anyone that 's dreamed of owning an F - 150 SVT Raptor or any other serious off - road truck has probably also dreamed about running in rallies like the Baja 1000 or the Dakar Rally .
But as much fun as it is to run full - tilt across untamed terrain , it comes at a price .
A price of about $ 570,000 , according to Chile 's archaeological sites council .
Chile 's National Monuments Council has issued a report that the 2010 Dakar Rally caused over $ 566,000 ( 300 million Chilean pesos ) in damage to the archaeological sites along the race route -- and they 're seeking to be compensated for the damage by the rally 's co-host , Chile 's National Sports Institute .
The NMC says the rally damaged 56 of the 111 heritage sites the route passed through , with 13 sites suffering " serious loss of archeological data , " according to the report .
It 's a sobering counterpoint to the excitement of the Dakar Rally .
Environmental and potentially historical or cultural impact is something any off - road enthusiast should be cognizant of when choosing to drive their vehicle through the wilderness , lest the activity be deemed too damaging to be allowed to continue .
And we certainly do n't want to see that happen .

Millions of American workers could discover that they no longer have employer - provided health insurance as ObamaCare is phased in .
That 's because employers are quickly discovering that it may be cheaper to pay fines to the government than to insure workers .
AT&T , Caterpillar , John Deere and Verizon have all made internal calculations , according the House Energy and Commerce Committee , to determine how much could be saved by a ) dropping their employer - provided insurance , b ) paying a fine of $ 2,000 per employee , and c ) leaving ...

CNN host Campbell Brown is leaving the network , saying she 's unwilling to " inhabit the kind of persona " who can compete against opinion - mongers Fox News ' Bill O'Reilly and MSNBC's Keith Olbermann in the 8 p.m. slot .
Who might be better suited ?
Rumors are circulating that former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer , whose political career was destroyed in 2008 by a vice girl scandal , is being considered .
Though he 's denied it , Spitzer is reportedly in the frame to present a " Crossfire " - type show .
Could it work ?
CNN would have to compromise its brand : CNN has to do something about its " abysmal ratings , " says Barry Silverstein in Brand Channel , and a partisan , infamous figure like Spitzer could " ratchet up " viewership .
CNN is founded on " hardcore journalism , " however , not stunt casting " disgraced " politicians .
That said , at this point , it may just want a ratings quick - fix " and worry about the brand impact after . "
" CNN continues to boil as Brown leaves "
Tainted or not , Spitzer would shake things up : Appearing on CNN could be a " good way for Spitzer to improve his reputation , " says Olivia Allin in The Frisky , and bring the " awesome things " he did as governor to a cable news audience — namely , " supporting gay marriage , " reforming immigration , and cracking down on white collar crime .
His particular passions could be an interesting addition to the mix .
" Campbell Brown leaves CNN and Eliot Spitzer steps up . "
Spitzer 's particular bias is more suited for MSNBC : Though Spitzer 's destined for TV , reports Jason Horowitz in The Washington Post , sources close to the " lantern - jawed ex- pol " say he would only take a media gig " if the venue allowed him to be as partisan as he wanted . "
And while it 's true that CNN has hired " the conservative firebrand Erick Erickson and the centrist former Rudy Giuliani speechwriter John Avalon , " it 's more likely Spitzer 's " left - of - center politics " will land him on MSNBC .
" Will Eliot Spitzer land at CNN or host for another news outlet ? "
Back in April we reported that AutoCAD was probably coming soon to the Mac , considering all the OS X references that were spotted in the SDK .
Today we ’ve received the first screenshots of an actual beta , running at 64 - bit on Mac OS X .
The app is names “ Sledgehammer Beta 1 ” , does n’t seem very polished yet ( it ’s coming from Windows ) but at least there ’s already support for Magic Mouse gestures .
Check out the screenshots after the break .
Jeremy Jackson is the Ritter Professor of Oceanography and Director of the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography .
In this talk , Professor Jackson lays out the shocking state of the ocean today : overfished , overheated , polluted , with indicators that things will get much worse .
The film is from TED Talks .
The movie is 18 minutes long and offers subtitles as an option .
I 've also copied in the transcript below the fold .
We have been hearing a lot about what the oil spill is doing to the ocean .
But something else which is also concerning is the condition the ocean was in , even prior to the spill .
We live in a finite world .
Our continued mistreatment of the ocean , the reduced fish population , and the disappearance of large fish in the last 50 years are all serious concerns .
I 'm an ecologist , mostly a coral reef ecologist .
I started out in Chesapeake Bay and went diving in the winter and became a tropical ecologist over night .
And it was really a lot of fun for about 10 years .
I mean , somebody pays you to go around and travel and look at some of the most beautiful places on the planet .
And that was what I did .
And I ended up in Jamaica , in the West Indies , where the coral reefs were really among the most extraordinary , structurally , that I ever saw in my life .
And this picture here , it 's really interesting , it shows two things .
First of all , it 's in black and white because the water was so clear and you could see so far and film was so slow in the 1960s and the early 70s , you took pictures in black and white .
The other thing it shows you is that , although there 's this beautiful forest of coral , there are no fish in that picture .
Those reefs at Discovery Bay Jamaica were the most studied coral reefs in the world , for 20 years .
We were the best and the brightest .
People came to study our reefs from Australia , which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs .
And the view of scientists about how coral reefs work , how they ought to be , was based on these reefs without any fish .
Then , in 1980 , there was a hurricane , Hurricane Allen .
I put half the lab up in my house .
The wind blew very strong .
The waves were 25 to 50 feet high .
And the reefs disappeared , and new islands formed .
And we thought , " Well , we 're real smart .
We know that hurricanes have always happened in the past . "
And we publish a paper in Science , the first time that anybody ever described the destruction on a coral reef by a major hurricane .
And we predicted what would happen .
And we got it all wrong .
And the reason was because of overfishing , and the fact that a last common - grazer , a sea urchin , died .
And within a few months after that sea urchin dying , the seaweed started to grow .
And that is the same reef .
That 's the same reef 15 years ago .
That 's the same reef today .
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica have a few percent live coral cover and a lot of seaweed and slime .
And that 's more or less the story of the coral reefs of the Caribbean , and increasingly , tragically , the coral reefs worldwide .
Now , that 's my little , depressing story .
All of us in our 60s and 70s have comparable depressing stories .
There are tens of thousands of those stories out there .
And it 's really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well - being , because it just keeps getting worse .
And the reason it keeps getting worse is that , after a natural catastrophe , like a hurricane , it used to be that there was some kind of successional sequence of recovery , but what 's going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that .
And so I 'm going to sort of go through and talk about those three kinds of things .
We hear a lot about the collapse of cod .
It 's difficult to imagine that two , or some historians would say three , world wars were fought during the colonial era for the control of cod .
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe .
It fed the slaves brought to the Antilles .
The song " Jamaica Farewell " -- " Aki rice salt fish are nice " -- is an emblem of the importance of salt cod from northeastern Canada .
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s. 35,000 people lost their jobs .
And that was the beginning of a kind of serial depletion from bigger and tastier species to smaller and not - so - tasty species , from species that were near to home , to species that were all around the world , and what have you .
It 's a little hard to understand that , because you can go to a Costco in the United States and buy cheap fish .
You ought to read the label to find out where it came from , but it 's still cheap , and everybody thinks it 's okay .
And it 's hard to communicate this .
And so , one way that I think is really interesting , is to talk about sport fish , because people like to go out and catch fish .
It 's one of those things .
This picture here shows the trophy fish , the biggest fish caught by people who pay a lot of money to get on a boat , go to a place off of Key West in Florida , drink a lot of beer , throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water , come back with the biggest and the best fish , and the champion trophy fish are put on this board , where people take a picture , and this guy is obviously really excited about that fish .
Well , that 's what it 's like now , but this is what it was like in the 1950s , from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same dock .
And the trophy fish were so big , that you could n't put any of those small fish up on it .
And the average size trophy fish weighed 250 to 300 lbs. , goliath groper .
And if you wanted to go out and kill something , you could pretty much count on being able to catch one of those fish .
And they tasted really good .
And people paid less in 1950 dollars to catch that than what people pay now to catch those little , tiny fish .
And that 's everywhere .
It 's not just the fish though that are disappearing .
Industrial fishing uses big stuff , big machinery .
We use nets that are 20 miles long .
We use long lines that have one million or two million hooks .
And we trawl , which means to take something the size of a tractor trailer truck that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds , put it on a big chain , and drag it across the sea floor to stir up the bottom and catch the fish .
And think of it as being kind of the bulldozing of a city or of a forest , because it clears it away .
And the habitat destruction is unbelievable .
This is photograph , a typical photograph of what the continental shelves of the world look like .
You can see the rows in the bottom , the way you can see the rows in a field that has just been plowed to plant corn .
What that was , was a forest of sponges and coral , which is a critical habitat for the development of fish .
What it is now is mud .
And the area of the ocean floor that has been transformed from forest to level mud , to parking lot , is equivalent to the entire area of all the forests that have ever been cut down on all of the earth in the history of humanity .
And we 've managed to do that in the last 100 to 150 years .
We tend to think of oil spills and mercury , and we hear a lot about plastic these days .
And all of that stuff is really disgusting , but what 's really insidious is the biological pollution that happens because of the magnitude of the shifts that it causes to entire ecosystems .
And I 'm going to just talk very briefly about two kinds of biological pollution .
One is introduced species , and the other is what comes from nutrients .
So this is the infamous caulerpa taxifolia , the so - called killer algae .
A book was written about it .
It 's a bit of an embarrassment .
It was accidentally released from the aquarium in Monaco .
It was bred to be cold tolerant , to have in peoples aquaria .
It 's very pretty , and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once - very - rich biodiversity of the northwestern Mediterranean .
I do n't know how many of you remember the movie " The Little Shop of Horrors , " but this is the plant of " The Little Shop of Horrors . "
But , instead of devouring the people in the shop , what it 's doing is overgrowing and smothering virtually all of the bottom - dwelling life of the entire northwestern Mediterranean Sea .
We do n't know anything that eats it .
We 're trying to do all sorts of genetics and figure out something that could be done , but , as it stands , it 's the monster from hell , about which nobody knows what to do .
Now another form of pollution that 's biological pollution is what happens from excess nutrients .
The green revolution , all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer , we used too much of it .
It 's subsidized , which is one of the reasons we used too much of it .
It runs down the rivers , and it feeds the plankton , the little microscopic plant cells in the coastal water .
But since we ate all the oysters , and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton , there 's nothing to eat the plankton .
And there 's more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is unheard of for plankton .
And when it dies , it falls to the bottom and then it rots , which means that bacteria break it down .
And in the process , they use up all the oxygen .
And in using up all the oxygen , they make the environment utterly lethal for anything that can't swim away .
And so what we end up with , is a microbial zoo , dominated by bacteria and jellyfish , as you see on the left in front of you .
And the only fishery left , and it is a commercial fishery , is the jellyfish fishery you see on the right , where there used to be prawns .
Even in Newfoundland , where we used to catch cod , we now have a jellyfish fishery .
And another version of this sort of thing is what is often called red tides or toxic blooms .
That picture is just staggering to me .
I have talked about it a million times , but it 's unbelievable .
In the upper right of that picture on the left is almost the Mississippi Delta , and the lower left of that picture is the Texas , Mexico border .
You 're looking at the entire northwestern Gulf of Mexico .
Your looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish , made by that beautiful , little creature on the lower right .
And in the upper right you see this black sort of cloud moving to shore .
That 's the same species .
And as it comes to shore , and the wind blows , and little droplets of the water get into the air , the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up with people with acute respiratory distress .
And that 's retirement homes on the west coast of Florida .
A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood we called Hollywood ocean night .
And I was trying to figure out how to explain to actors what 's going .
And I said , " So , imagine you 're in a movie called ' Escape from Malibu ' because all the beautiful people have moved to North Dakota , where it 's clean and safe .
And the only people who are left there are the people who can't afford to move away from the coast , because the coast , instead of being paradise , is harmful to your health . "
And then this is amazing .
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France .
This is from the coast of Brittany , which is being enveloped in this green , algal slime .
The reason that it attracted so much attention , besides the fact that it 's disgusting , is that sea birds flying over it are asphyxiated by the smell and die , and a farmer died of it , and you can imagine the scandal that happened .
And so there 's this war between the farmers and the fishermen about it all .
And the net result is that the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff on a regular basis .
And then of course there 's climate change , and we all know about climate change .
And I guess the iconic figure of it is the melting of the ice in the arctic sea .
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died trying to find the Northwest Passage .
Well , the Northwest is already there .
I think it 's sort of funny , it 's on the Siberian coast .
Maybe the Russians will charge tolls .
The governments of the world are taking this really seriously .
The military of the arctic nations is taking it really seriously .
For all the denial of climate change by government leaders , the C.I.A. and the navies of Norway and the U.S. and Canada , whatever are busily thinking about how they will secure their territory in this inevitability from their point of view .
And , of course , arctic communities are toast .
The other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral bleaching .
It 's a beautiful picture , right .
All that white coral .
Except it 's supposed to be brown .
And what happens is that the corals are a symbiosis , and they have these little algal cells that live inside them .
And the algae give the corals sugar , and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection .
But when it gets too hot , the algae can't make the sugar .
The corals say , " You cheated .
You did n't pay your rent . "
They kick them out , and then they die .
Not all of them die ; some of them survive .
Some more are surviving , but it 's really bad news .
To try and give you a sense of this , imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America , and you wake up the next morning , and you look around you , and you see that 80 percent of the trees , as far as you can see , have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked .
And you come home , and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves .
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later , oh , by the way , a quarter of those died .
Well , that 's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino , an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe , when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died .
And then the really scary thing about all of this , the overfishing , the pollution and the climate change , is that each thing does n't happen in a vacuum , but there are these , what we call , positive feedbacks .
The synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts .
And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this , is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again ?
I mean , because we , at this point , we can protect it .
But what does that mean ?
We really do n't know .
So what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years ?
Well , there wo n't be any fish except for minnows , and the water will be pretty dirty , and all those kinds of things , and full of mercury , etc. , etc .
And dead - zones will get bigger and bigger , and they 'll start to merge .
And we can imagine something like the dead - zonification of the global , coastal ocean .
Then you sure wo n't want to eat fish that were raised in it , because would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette .
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom ; sometimes you do n't .
That does n't sell .
The really scary things though are the physical , chemical , oceanographic things that are happening .
As the surface of the ocean gets warmer , the water is lighter when it 's warmer , it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over .
We say , it becomes more strongly stratified .
The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries , of the sardines of California , or in Peru , or whatever , those slow down , and those fisheries collapse .
And , at the same time , water from the surface , which is rich in oxygen , does n't make it down , and the ocean turns into a desert .
So the question is : How are we all going to respond to this ?
And we can do all sorts of things to fix it , but in the final analysis , the thing we really need to fix is ourselves .
It 's not about the fish ; it 's not about the pollution ; it 's not about the climate change .
It 's about us , and our greed and our need for growth and our inability to imagine a world which is different from the selfish world we live in today .
So the question is : Will we respond to this or not ?
I would say that the future of life and the dignity of human beings depends on our doing that .
Thank you .
Will my lawyer judge me for my situation ?
Will my attorney respect me ?
Will they take advantage of me ?
We believe it ’s just plain wrong to feel judged by your legal counsel .
You ’ll have enough of that in a court room without doubting your own lawyer ’s dedication and support .
You deserve more from your legal representation than a firm that treats you like yet another legal folder :
To be pulled out when it ’s convenient and stacked on a pile when it ’s not .
In the spirit of the Humble Indie Bundle , we have decided to release the source code to Lugaru !
Our community has already made some great mods by editing the levels and graphics , but source code access will allow for much deeper modifications .
The coding style is what you might expect from a self - taught high school student , so it could be a challenge to understand , but feel free to give it a shot !
The Mercurial repository is hosted at icculus.org -- if you 'd rather just have a simple download , we have a snapshot of the initial source code release here .
We are releasing the source code under the General Public License ( GPL ) , which means you can distribute modified versions of the Lugaru code , but they must also be open - source under the GPL .
The game assets are included in the snapshot , and can be redistributed for free , but can not be resold without our permission .
Details from Ryan Gordon
The source code is based on Ryan C. Gordon 's branch , which took David Rosen 's original Windows and Carbonized Mac OS code and ported it to Linux and Mac OS X , using SDL and OpenAL .
It should compile as - is on those platforms from the command - line .
On Mac you can type " sh makemac.sh " to build ( or use the Xcode project ! ) , and on Linux you can just type " make " .
The code is compatible with Windows , but the included Visual Studio project is not completely up - to - date .
We should have that sorted out soon , especially with your help !
We have included enough of the game data to run the demo version .
Please note that the game data is not under the GPL , and forbids commercial redistribution .
The code is licensed under the GPL2 .
Please see COPYING .
txt for details .
Getting the source :
The source code for Lugaru is stored in a Mercurial repository .
This might be a little different than other revision control systems you 've used .
There is a place where you can download the source code , and pull in the latest , bleeding edge changes , like you 'd expect , but there is n't an authoritative source .
Everyone gets a complete copy of the repository , and can pass changes around between each other without having to get permission to commit from Wolfire .
This brings lots of benefits you never knew you needed before you had them .
Everything you need to know about Mercurial can be found at mercurial.selenic.com .
The Lugaru source code can be browsed online here , and you can use this command to grab it with Mercurial :
hg clone http://hg.icculus.org/icculus/lugaru
How to contribute :
Clone the repository and work on it .
Optionally , publish your repository somewhere ( bitbucket.org and Google Code will both provide free hosting ) .
This will let others pull your changes directly and see your work .
You can also just email patches like you 've always done ( use " hg export " ) .
You do n't need to have write access to someone 's repository , because you own the repository .
If they import your patch , it 'll still have your name on it .
Some things you can do :
Get the game building on Windows again .
Some Linux dork came along and broke it !
Mostly the project files need to be updated to use the new dependencies ( OpenAL , zlib , png , jpeg ) and not the old ones ( fmod , DevIL ) .
Improve the Xcode project .
Right now , it builds the game , but is n't as nicely automated as it could be .
Restore Mac OS X 10.2 support ( we 're linking against the 10.6 SDK for all CPUs at the moment ) .
Add new combat moves , bad guys , weapons .
Port it to a new platform .
Why stop at Linux , Windows , and Mac OS X ?
Write a software renderer , a Direct3D renderer , or an OpenGL ES renderer .
Make it more Linux - friendly ( use system zlib , etc ) .
Make it run in a web browser .
Restore FMOD support .
Do something cool .
You imagination is the limit .
Scratch your itch .
Dream big .
Also , we 'll remind you that if you need more Wolfire Open Source Action , Black Shades is also available !
Two years ago at DrupalCon Boston , I declared that we should embrace the semantic web , and that , as a first step , we should add RDFa support to Drupal core .
Since then , I 've written extensively about the importance of semantic technologies in Drupal , and how I believe Drupal can play an important role in helping to bootstrap the semantic web .
Drupal 7 , the next major release of Drupal , will ship with RDFa support directly " out of the box . "
To help people understand what is possible with RDFa support and how it enables us to do cool new things , take a look at the video below .
I showed this video in my DrupalCon San Francisco keynote , two years after my initial RDFa challenge at DrupalCon Boston .
There are many other things we can build on top of this core support , but this is a start .
I 'm personally very excited to see this vision being realized , and I 'm very thankful to all the people that helped make this possible .
Kudos to Lin Clark from DERI , NUI Galway for her work on building the demo and recording the screencast , and to Stéphane Corlosquet from MIND Informatics at Mass General for leading the RDF in Drupal 7 efforts .
The newly launched Semantic Drupal website contains articles , video tutorials and news on building Linked Data sites with Drupal 7 .
Image caption Mr Gou said the company was trying hard to prevent further deaths
Another suspected suicide has occurred at a factory in China , the latest in a string of deaths at the plant this year , state media reports .
Xinhua said the male employee jumped to his death hours after a media tour at the plant owned by Taiwan firm Foxconn .
The firm manufactures mobile phones and electronic equipment for top brands including Dell computers and Apple .
The death would be the 10th suicide at the plant this year - two other people have survived similar falls .
One man was also reported to have killed himself at another Foxconn plant in Hebei province earlier this year .
On Thursday , another employee in Shenzhen attempted to kill himself by cutting his wrists but survived after medical attention , said Xinhua .
The Foxconn plant in Shenzhen employs more than 400,000 people .
' Determined '
Police officials said the man who died on Wednesday was a 23 - year - old from Gansu province , who had been working at the plant for about a year .
Witnesses said he had jumped from the seventh floor of a dormitory building , Xinhua reported .
Image caption Critics say Foxconn employees work under military conditions Chinese media call for change
The death came just hours after the chairman of Foxconn , Terry Gou , one of Taiwan 's most famous businessmen , took reporters around the vast Shenzhen plant .
Mr Gou apologised repeatedly , and said he had trouble sleeping but would not stop trying to solve the problem .
" We need some time , " he said .
" But we are confident .
We are extremely determined . "
The company is training counsellors and has provided leisure facilities for the workers .
It has also put up nets around the buildings .
" Although this seems like a dumb measure , at least it could save a life should anyone else fall , " said Mr Gou .
Labour activists in nearby Hong Kong have criticised alleged poor conditions at the factory and called for a symbolic boycott of iPhones in protest .
The activists claim shifts at the plant are long , the assembly line moves too fast and that managers enforce military - style discipline on the workforce .
Foxconn points out that despite the bad publicity , each day around 8,000 people still apply to work at the factory .
Companies which commission work from the plant have said they are concerned by the reports .
Sharon Zhang , a spokeswoman for Dell , told the AFP news agency the company was investigating the reports .
" Any reports of poor working conditions in Dell 's supply chain are investigated and , if warranted , appropriate action is taken .
We expect our suppliers to employ the same high standards we do in our own facilities , " she said .
Hewlett Packard said it was " investigating the Foxconn practices that may be associated with these tragic events " .
Apple , whose iPhones are made at the plant , said it was " deeply committed to ensuring that conditions throughout our supply chain are safe and workers are treated with respect and dignity " .
Apple has said it will evaluate what Foxconn is doing to address the problems and continue ongoing inspections of the facilities where its products are made .

At a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the publication in 1969 of his first political book , American Power and the New Mandarins , Noam Chomsky spoke about current events around the world .
He was introduced by Amy Goodman .
Topics included the settlement of a lawsuit against the Shell oil company in Nigeria , the global economic crisis and other crises , social and political movements , military power , and U.S. political policies .
Noam Chomsky , professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , is the author of dozens of books , including Hegemony or Survival ; Failed States ; and the forthcoming Hopes and Prospects .
This benefit event called “ Crisis and Hope : Theirs and Ours ” was held by the Brecht Forum at Riverside Church in New York City .
Co-sponsors were The Education Ministry of The Riverside Church , Mission and Social Justice Commission of The Riverside Church , Theatre of the Oppressed at The Riverside Church , The Theater of the Oppressed Laboratory , and Bluestockings Books .

At a time when they surely have bigger things to think about , the Vatican 's official newspaper has published a glowing appraisal of the Beatles , calling their music " beautiful " and dismissing their years of drug use and excessive living .
On the front page of the L'Osservatore Romano , the paper admits that the band once " said they were bigger than Jesus and put out mysterious messages , that were possibly even Satanic " , but also asks : " what would pop music have been like without the Beatles ? "
The article comes four decades after John Lennon enraged the Catholic church by saying the Beatles were " more popular than Jesus " and suggesting that Christianity was a dying institution .
The newspaper eventually offered its forgiveness for these comments in a 2008 article , when it ascribed Lennon 's remarks to " showing off , bragging by a young English working - class musician who had grown up in the age of Elvis Presley and rock and roll and had enjoyed unexpected success " .
The 2008 piece , which praised the White Album for remaining a " magical musical anthology " , came shortly after the appointment of Giovanni Maria Vian as new editor .
The paper has since taken to publishing articles on entertainment and the arts , as well as traditional news about the Pope 's activities .
The timing of its latest effusive piece on the Beatles coincides with mounting focus on the Vatican 's response to claims of institutional sexual abuse within the Catholic church .
The latest edition of L'Osservatore Romano acknowledged the controversy by saying there was international " support for the Pope " .
PARIS — NATO must be willing to fight and operate far from its borders to defend its members in a new world of terrorism , piracy and cyberattacks , according to a proposed strategy for the alliance released Monday .
The proposal , “ NATO 2020 , ” also urges the alliance to restore credibility to its pledge of collective security , which it said was a prerequisite for efforts farther afield .
“ NATO must be versatile and efficient enough to operate far from home , ” former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright , who led a team of experts in writing the report , said at a news conference in Brussels .
“ In order to sustain the political will for operations outside its area , NATO must see that all its members are reassured about the security of their home territories . ”
One of the main purposes of the new strategy , NATO officials said , is to recommit the alliance to its core mission of collective self - defense , known as Article 5 of its original charter .

HE’S down , but Andrew Wakefield , the doctor who made the now discredited link between autism and the measles , mumps and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine , is not giving up .
On 24 May , the UK’s General Medical Council ( GMC ) ruled that Wakefield be struck off the UK medical register for “ serious professional misconduct ” in the course of his research at the Royal Free Hospital in London .
The reasons listed by the GMC include dishonesty in a paper published in The Lancet in 1998 that first suggested the autism - MMR link , undeclared conflicts of interest , and ethical flaws in the way children were recruited …
Image caption Tesla has ambitious plans to grow the company
Toyota is to invest $ 50 m ( £ 35 m ) in US electric car company Tesla Motors , as the two firms announced a joint partnership to build electric vehicles .
The deal will give the Japanese giant a stake of about 2.5 % in Tesla , which will build its new saloon model at a Toyota factory near San Francisco .
Analysts said Tesla , which was only formed in 2003 , will benefit from Toyota 's mass production skills .
In turn , Toyota will be able to access Tesla 's electric battery expertise .
The deal could also boost Toyota 's reputation in the US , which has been badly hit by a number of mass recalls over problems with faulty accelerator pedals and braking systems .
' Powerful stimulus '
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk described the announcement as a " gesture of support " from the Japanese company .
Toyota chief executive Akio Toyoda said : " Working with Tesla will provide us with a powerful stimulus . "
While Toyota is the world 's largest carmaker , Tesla has only 500 employees and makes just 15 cars per week .
However , Tesla has ambitious plans to expand the company , hoping that electric cars will eventually move into the mainstream .

Churches of Scientology around the world celebrate the original release of the religion ’s first book this weekend .
Published May 9 , 1950 , “ Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health ” became an overnight success and has been a continuing bestseller for 60 years .
The work is the anatomy and full description of a portion of the mind that is the source of nightmares , unreasonable fears , upsets and insecurities .
More than 20 million copies have been sold .
Based on author L. Ron Hubbard ’s researches into the mind and human behavior prior to 1950 , its release brought on the spontaneous formation of 750 Dianetics groups around the U.S. and establishment of the Hubbard Dianetics Foundation in Elizabeth , New Jersey .
Mr. Hubbard lectured , instructed and otherwise met a staggering demand , while continuing research into the fundamental nature of man culminating in the founding of the Scientology religion in 1952 .
Today , Dianetics remains a key substudy of the greater body of Scientology Scripture , its perennial popularity sustained by its workability .
Before Dianetics , prevailing scientific thought held that Man 's mind was his brain , nothing more than a collection of cells and neurons , and IQ and personality were considered fixed and unchanging .
With Dianetics , IQ and personality improved , its effectiveness documented in a multitude of case histories over more than half a century of application .
In 2009 , Mr. David Miscavige , Chairman of the Board of Religious Technology Center , announced the completion of translation in 50 languages of Dianetics and seven other basic Scientology books .
Mr. Miscavige also released 32 new films of visual instruction in Dianetics procedures on DVD , part of a special Hubbard Dianetics Seminar now offered at Churches of Scientology , which include turnabout application of Dianetics procedure .
“ Dianetics : The Modern Science of Mental Health ” is published by Bridge Publications and is available in 125,000 libraries in over 180 countries as well as public bookstores and Churches of Scientology .
Dianetics Anniversary celebrations are open to the public .

Toyota to partner with electric carmaker Tesla Motors
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Toyota Motors will invest $ 50 million in electric car maker Tesla , the companies announced Thursday , and form a partnership aimed at developing new technology .
Tesla also announced plans to purchase a plant owned by Toyota in Fremont California , which had been operated as a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota .
Toyota said it has agreed to purchase $ 50 million of Tesla 's common stock issued in a private placement .
The deal will close immediately after the completion of Tesla 's currently planned initial public offering .
" By partnering with Tesla , my hope is that all Toyota employees will recall that ' venture business spirit , ' and take on the challenges of the future , " Akio Toyoda , the company 's president , said at a press conference in California .
In addition , Toyota said it plans to work with Tesla to develop electric cars and parts .
The companies will also collaborate on production systems and engineering support for electric vehicles , according to a joint statement .
" It is an honor and a powerful endorsement of our technology that Toyota would choose to invest in and partner with Tesla , " said Tesla chief executive and cofounder Elon Musk .
The Fremont plant , called the New United Motor Manufacturing , or NUMI , is where GM made the Pontiac Vibe , while Toyota built Corollas and Tacoma trucks .
Elon said Tesla will only purchase " a small portion " of the NUMI plant .
But he added that the company hopes to expand in the future .
Toyota stopped all production at the plant in April , eliminating 4,700 workers .
GM killed off the Pontiac brand as part of its reorganization last year , ending production of the Vibe .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said the partnership will create 1,000 new jobs in California , which currently suffers one of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
Tesla Motors had been searching for a location at which to produce its planned Model S electric sedan , which is slated to go into production in late 2011 .
The Model S is designed to seat up to seven people and is expected to cost about $ 58,000 .
It is supposed to be a more accessible , less expensive car than Tesla 's current offering , the Tesla Roadster , a two - seat sports car with prices starting at over $ 100,000 .
Tesla Motors , based in Palo Alto , Calif. , received $ 465 million in loan guarantees from the federal government last year as part of a program designed to assist with the development of advanced technology vehicles .
The money was to be used to assist with the development of the Model S.

BEIJING , China —
As Apple released the iPad today across Europe and Japan , a key supplier in China continued fortifying factory buildings with anti-suicide nets and bracing against a growing tide of public criticism about working conditions after 10 apparent employee suicides this year — including one this week hours after the company chief visited .
While tentative calls have emerged in China for boycotts of Apple products and other items made by electronics giant Foxconn , what remains entirely unclear is the impact this will have on the electronics manufacturing industry at large .
The massive Foxconn plant , possibly the largest factory in the world , has been under the microscope for years over poor working conditions .
In the past six months , renewed concerns have hit other electronics suppliers as well .
More than 60 workers making Apple touch screens at a Taiwanese - owned factory in Suzhou suffered nerve damage from on - the - job exposure to an illegally used chemical , but the story was not widely reported outside of China .
In an investigation last fall , GlobalPost found widespread abuse of worker rights and labor laws across the heavily fragmented consumer electronics supply chain .
Yet there is no indication that the recent spate of news about devastating working conditions for factory employees who make trendy gadgets has dampened consumer enthusiasm for those products .
Labor groups have repeatedly called for reforms , but as yet , the situation has n’t changed .
Now , with an apparent suicide cluster well underway at a key Apple supplier , labor activists have begun to wonder if that tide might be about to turn in the same way it did for international apparel and shoe companies in the 1980s and 1990s .
“ I think there is a tendency for consumers of iconic products like iPhones to stick their head in the sand when it comes abusive labor practices , ” said Geoffrey Crothall of the Hong Kong - based China Labour Bulletin .
“ Their iPhone reflects who they are , or rather the image of themselves they wish to present to the world , and they do n't want that image tarnished . ”
“ However , I think with the all the publicity that Foxconn is getting and Apple publicly stating it will investigate the problems there , the message might be starting to get through , ” he added .
On the Chinese web , censors have started deleting calls for Apple boycotts , but many keep emerging .
“ After today , I wo n’t buy Apple products anymore .
They are covered in the blood of Foxconn workers , ” wrote a user called Beimo Xiaobing " I call for netizens to boycott these products and kick Foxconn out of China . ”
Even China ’s best - known blogger , heartthrob former racecar driver Han Han , joined the fray .
On his blog , Han Han called low - wage factory workers “ China ’s bargaining chip , hostages to GDP . ”
( Read the English translation of his blog post . )
A tide of anti-Apple public opinion comes when the company is making a big push here in China for customers .
But Apple ’s real consumer base lies in the United States and elsewhere , thousands of miles from the factories and workers who make electronic gadgets .
Ultimately , labor groups say , the responsibility for factory conditions lies in the hands of consumers who buy the products .
Chinese factories have taken over the consumer electronics production industry not because of special know - how or technology , but because there is a huge supply of cheap labor .
The Hong Kong - based Students & Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior ( SACOM ) today started a petition drive calling for a month - long consumer boycott of all Foxconn - made products , including fourth - generation iPhones .
Debby Chan , SACOM ’s project manager , said she realizes that many factors influence consumer decisions about what products to buy and changing minds will be challenging .
“ SACOM can only show the reality of the working conditions of workers who produce the electronic products to the consumers through our investigations and reports , ” said Chan .
“ We believe that some customers will respond to our calls . ”
Apple did not respond to requests for comment .
The company told AFP on Thursday : “ Apple is deeply committed to ensuring that conditions throughout our supply chain are safe and workers are treated with respect and dignity . ”

Lewis Hamilton is now sure that racing on track against Michael Schumacher is going to be different to going up against any other driver in the field .
The former world champion got his first taste of wheel - to - wheel action with Schumacher during last week 's Barcelona test - when the pair lapped close together during race distance simulation work on the final day .
And on the back of that experience , Hamilton says that it definitely feels more ' special ' being there with Schumacher .
" I had really good fun , " Hamilton told AUTOSPORT .
" I was on my long run , on my last stint , and I caught Michael up .
" Rather than backing off , I thought , ' let 's have some fun and see if we can get close to him ! '
It was really , really hard work and good to experience what the new car is like when behind people .
So I was challenging , I was learning new things and thinking I need to get past him really quick .
" I managed to get up in the inside of him on one of the corners , and I think he had fun as well - but we were clearly seconds of difference in time [ pace - wise ] because he was heavier with fuel and I was lighter .
But it was really cool . "
He added : " It was a unique and special feeling to see Michael Schumacher ahead of me - and know it was him !
It feels different compared to coming up against any other driver , because he is a seven - time world champion .
He is a legend !
" You are a legend if you have got seven world championships !
One or two [ titles ] ?
Respect .
But seven , it 's legendary !
You look at it , and think , ' wow , that 's cool . ' "
Hamilton has been left upbeat about the progress that McLaren has made over the winter - especially with the new aerodynamic package that was fitted to the car for the final two days of Barcelona .
Speaking about how ready he feels the team is for the start of the season , Hamilton said : " I did n't really know what I wanted to come out with from Barcelona .
I did want to know I had a good package and felt comfortable going into the first race , which I have come away .
" I was n't expecting to be quickest that day - and we did n't even go out and think , ' boom , boom , we need to do practice and qualifying runs ' .
We did a couple of runs on different tyres and I just got that time - rather than trying to nail a better time .
So , there is definitely more time to come - which is positive .
It is nice to come away from it on the right foot . "
A Washington State man was arrested Tuesday on charges that he repeatedly threatened to kill US Sen .
Patty Murray because of her support of the recently passed healthcare reform law .
Charles Alan Wilson of Selah , Wash. , left at least 13 expletive - laced messages on an answering machine at Senator Murray ’s Seattle office in recent weeks .
Staffers notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Although the caller had been blocking his telephone number , an agent traced the calls through telephone company records to Mr. Wilson ’s home telephone .
An undercover agent then telephoned Wilson , posing as a political opponent of the healthcare law .
Wilson used several of the same phrases recorded on the answering machine , and agents concluded both voices belonged to the same person .
' There 's a target on your back now '
“ I hope you realize there ’s a target on your back now , ” Wilson told Murray in a message recorded on the morning of March 22 , according to an FBI affidavit .
“ There are many people out there that want you dead .
Just remember that as you are politicing [ sic ] for your reelection .
It only takes one piece of lead …
Kill the … senator !
Kill the … senator !
I ’ll donate the lead .
Now that you ’ve passed your healthcare bill , let the violence begin . ”
The next day , Wilson called again – five times .
“ I hope somebody kills you , and I hope somebody kills [ the president ] , ” he said .
“ You are signing my death warrant , so I want to sign yours . ”
The case illustrates the dangerous and sordid underbelly of the current angry mood in the country .
And it underscores the risk that can arise from supercharged rhetoric used by some leaders that seems designed to feed the anger .
Prosecutors note that it is a federal crime to threaten a US government official .
Such threats are punishable by 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine .
“ Free speech is the cornerstone of our democratic process , and we are a country of vigorous debate , ” said Assistant US Attorney Todd Greenberg .
“ However , threats of violence have no place in that debate .
The threats here crossed the line and violate the law . ”
According to a 10 - page FBI affidavit , Wilson said the senator would be a target for the rest of her life .
Undercover FBI agent recorded detailed threats
“ How long do you think you can hide ?...
It could be a senior citizen , could be a veteran , could be a mad momma , an upset momma , ” Wilson is quoted as saying .
“ By your attempts to overtake this country with socialism , somebody ’s gonna get to you one way or another and blow your … brains out , and I hope it does happen .
If I have the chance , I would do it . ”
Wilson added : “ You low - life , backstabbing , lying , cheating politicians are going to be held accountable .
And hopefully it is with your life . ”
Wilson said he was a political independent , neither Republican nor Democrat .
“ I ’m not a tea party bagger , ” he said in one message .
“ There are a lot more of us .
There are a lot of crazy people out there , and your security [ guards ] may stay with you for a long time , but somebody will get through , ” he warned .
Wilson even recorded a message on Easter Sunday .
He noted that the senator had given a speech recently in Yakima .
“ We were outside waiting for you , ” Wilson said in the message .
During his conversation with the undercover FBI agent , Wilson admitted that he carries a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver .
He said he will not “ blink ” when confronted .
“ It ’s not a threat , it ’s a guarantee . ”
Wilson also allegedly told the undercover agent that both Senator Murray and Sen. Maria Cantwell ( D ) , also of Washington , “ need to be strung up . ”
“ I will take no prisoners , ” he said .
“ And I do n’t care what they think .
They want to come throw me in jail , they can go ahead and do that .
That ’s fine . ”
It was a pretty good prediction .
That ’s exactly what happened Tuesday .

I ’m pleased to report progress against two of the GOP most hateful initiatives , Arizona profiling and Texas textbook distortion .
Justice Department officials told Arizona ’s attorney general and aides to the governor Friday that the federal government has serious reservations about the state ’s new immigration law .
They responded that a lawsuit against the state is n’t the answer .
" I told them we need solutions from Washington , not more lawsuits , " said Attorney General Terry Goddard , a Democrat .
The Justice Department initiated separate meetings by phone and face - to - face in Phoenix with Goddard and aides to Republican Gov. Jan Brewer to reach out to Arizona ’s leaders and elicit information from state officials regarding the Obama administration ’s concerns about the new law .
The strong message that the Justice Department representatives delivered at the private meetings – first with Goddard , then with Brewer ’s staff – left little doubt that the Obama administration is prepared to go to court if necessary in a bid to block the new law , which takes effect July 29 .
Goddard said he noted that five privately filed lawsuits already are pending in federal court to challenge the law .
" Every possible argument is being briefed , " said Goddard , who is running unopposed for his party ’s nomination for the governor ’s race .
Brewer , who is seeking re-election , later said in a statement that her legal team told the Justice Department officials that the law would be " vigorously defended all the way to the United States Supreme Court if necessary . " …

In Terry Goddard ’s defense , as attorney general , his job is to defend Arizona ’s statutes , whether or not he personally agrees with it .
I do not have the slightest doubt that this bill is a direct violation of the Fourteenth Amendment , which guarantees equality under the law to all citizens , not the GOP vision of white - only rights .
However , given the record of the current Extreme Court , that ideology takes precedent over the Constitution , I fear they may well ratify this abomination .
The California Senate on Friday approved legislation that sends a clear message to Texas and textbook publishers : do n’t mess with our kids ’ minds .
" My bill begins the process of ensuring that California students will not end up being taught with Texas standards , " State Senator Leland Yee ( D - San Francisco ) , who authored and sponsored the legislation , said in an interview .
Texas standards had better not " creep into our textbooks , " he said .
The S.B. 1451 measure – approved on a bipartisan vote of 25 - 5 – requires California ’s Board of Education to examine and report any discrepancies between the new Texas standards and California ’s standards .
" At that point , " Yee told Raw Story , " we will make it very , very clear that we wo n’t accept textbooks that minimize the contributions of minorities and propagate the close connection between church and state . "
California , also a critical client for textbook companies , can counteract Texas ’s influence on how books are written for schools across the country .
" It ’s a warning to the textbooks writers and companies , " said Yee , who served on the San Francisco Board of Education earlier in his career and is currently the second highest ranking Democrat in California ’s upper house .
The Texas modifications – approved last Friday – include elevating the significance of Christianity in the nation ’s founding , minimizing the importance of Thomas Jefferson and his framework for separation of church and state , emphasizing " the conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s , " diminishing the scope of Latino history , and redefining slavery in more pleasant terms .
Yee called the changes " pretty disturbing , " accusing the Texas board of seeking to " wipe away history " and " rewrite history . "
School curriculum , especially social studies and history , he said , should be " devoid of politics . "
America " came into existence because the founding fathers wanted to flee the tyranny of the church over a government , " added Yee , who immigrated from China at age three .
" That part of the pride and joy of living here – that you ’re not dictated by religion . " …

IN its decade on the market , the Spanx line of modern girdles has become both a must - have undergarment and an easy punch line .
Celebrities like Tyra Banks , Janeane Garofalo and Wanda Sykes declare their allegiance to Spanx , even as they joke about it .
“ It sucks all that stuff in , ” Ms. Sykes said recently .
“ It ’s so funny that when you take them off you just become a blob .
You look in the mirror , and it ’s like , hey , now I ’m an amoeba . ”
The snickering rose a decibel level in February , when Spanx introduced its first products for men .
On “ Jimmy Kimmel Live , ” the host was nearly ejected from his own Handsome Men ’s Club after Rob Lowe accused him of wearing Spanx .
Cue giggles from the audience and a horrified look from another club member , Matthew McConaughey , his tight abs unexposed for once .
Steve Carell , who received an early sample of a men ’s T - shirt , said in a deadpan interview at the Golden Globes , “ I have no unsightly bulges but an excellent product I ’m sure . ”
Wink - wink .
David Beckham ’s announcement Monday that he will not be fit to play again before November because of his left Achilles ’ tendon injury could lead to some intriguing possibilities for the Galaxy and its owner , AEG .
First , Major League Soccer has to be convinced that Beckham ’s likely unavailability for the entire 2010 season should allow the Galaxy to acquire another designated player in his absence .
That scenario is quite possible .
If so , it would open the door for such stars as AC Milan ’s Ronaldinho or Real Madrid ’s Raul to come to Los Angeles this summer .
They are the most high - profile and attractive of several possibilities .
Beckham was a teammate of Raul ’s at Real Madrid between 2003 and 2007 , and the 32 - year - old Spanish striker , no longer a first choice at Real , has hinted that he might be interested in a move to MLS .
He is Spain ’s all - time leading goal scorer and has spent 16 seasons with Real Madrid .
Similarly , Ronaldinho and Beckham played together at AC Milan before Beckham ’s injury in mid-March , while he was on his second loan spell with the Italian club .
If the Brazilian star is not included on Brazil ’s 2010 World Cup team , as appears likely , Ronaldinho , too , could be heading to MLS .
Ronaldinho , 30 , has been mentioned by AEG in the past as a potential future Galaxy player not only because of his on - field ability but because his style and charisma make him a fan favorite .
He has attracted massive crowds during summer tours of the U.S. with Barcelona and AC Milan .
The Galaxy could keep Beckham and either Raul or Ronaldinho in 2011 and still stay under the MLS salary cap if it sold Landon Donovan to Everton after the 2010 season .
Donovan , who impressed during his loan spell this year with the English Premier League team , has said that he would not be averse to returning one day .
The transfer fee he could fetch would be enough to allow the Galaxy to add Ronaldinho or Raul .
Beckham , who turns 35 on Sunday , is under contract to the Galaxy through 2011 .
Even if the Galaxy reaches the MLS playoffs this season , it is unlikely that he would play any role .
He is also expected to return to AC Milan for a third season .
The English midfielder is still on crutches and said in an interview on the MLS website on Monday that he “ wo n’t be running for another three months ” at the earliest .
“ This is an injury that is going to take time to heal , ” Beckham said .
“ I ’m only six weeks after the surgery .
I started therapy 10 days ago , and I ’m just doing that every day .
“ I kind of want to push it , but with this kind of injury , you can ’t , you just have to wait for it to heal and then move on . ”
Beckham is scheduled to go to the World Cup in South Africa in June as an ambassador for England ’s bid to stage the tournament in 2018 or 2022 .
He is expected to take part in the June 11 opening ceremony in Johannesburg .
Galaxy fans should be paying more attention to where Raul or Ronaldinho will be on that day .
A tech blog that paid five grand to the finder of a prototype iPhone is under police investigation , as it seems buying found property is against the law .
Gizmodo paid $ 5,000 to the chap who found a next - generation iPhone in a bar , and the blog made merry with the device before returning it to Apple - after forcing Cupertino to admit that the prototype was genuine , in writing .
But it seems that paying for found property is illegal in California , and now CNET reports that the police are taking an interest .
The prototype iPhone was left in a bar by an engineer who was field - testing it ; with the launch scheduled for June it makes sense that Apple would do some field testing .
An unknown person picked it up and played with it briefly before Apple remotely pulled the plug .
That person apparently tried to return the handset to Apple , but the support desk staff ( who do n't have access to the goings on in the R&D department ) told him it was just Chinese knock - off and not to bother them with it .
So he sold it to Gizmodo , who spent a week taking it apart and then posted the details , causing their servers to melt down as everyone scrambled to get sight of the device ( sight only , the software was long gone ) .
The details are hardly in dispute - extracting every possible value from its purchase Gizmodo has waxed lyrical over every aspect of the iPhone , Apple 's reaction , and the career of the poor engineer who left it in the pub , but whether the law was broken is another question entirely .
CNET quotes a California law that requires a person who finds something , and knows who the owner is , to return it or face a charge of theft .
Of course , our man tried to return it , but Apple did n't want to know .
Freedom of the press is guaranteed in the US , and Gizmodo counts as " press " in this context , so trade secrets can be published - but this is a physical thing , an actual item for which money was paid , and that changes the situation considerably .
If the police do take action then lawyers on both sides will no doubt explore that in detail - though not Apple 's lawyers as criminal offences are n't their remit .
What we want to know is if Gizmodo will be invited to the launch of the handset in June , or if the blog will joining El Reg with the rest of the Apple - offending personae non grata outside . ®
BP 's " top kill " plan for fixing the Gulf of Mexico oil spill involves enormous ships , a mile of undersea piping , and a 30,000 - hp mud pump .
How does it work ?
Let 's find out .
UPDATE : Live footage of the process !

The above graphic is a few weeks old — drilling on the two relief wells shown began on May 2 and is n't expected to be finished until August — but it gives the best sense of the scale and scope of the project .
Judging by the latest version of this image , released on Monday ( it provides the same basic information but does n't look as cool ) , there has n't been a lot of progress on the secondary wells .
According to a recent press release , BP 's efforts to cap the well 's many leak points have centered around a failed component called a blow - out preventer , or BOP .
The BOP 's failure — the name gives a hint as to what it was supposed to do — is directly related to the spill , and extensive testing to determine how and why it failed is currently underway .
All told , the site is host to several undersea operations , more than 2000 people , 16 ships , and 16 remote - operated vehicles .
This is what it looks like :

What 's it all mean ?
The testing involves pumping drilling fluids into the BOP to measure pressures and validate flow paths , the better to understand the size and severity of the primary leak .
That information will then be used to determine whether or not something called a " top - kill " can be implemented .
The top kill is a pretty amazing thing .
It was devised over the past month by BP , the U.S. Geological Survey , the Energy Department , and the Minerals Management Service .
It centers around the Helix Q4000 surface platform and encompasses three ships full of mud , one of which is the 381 - foot HOS Centerline , one of the largest supply ships in the world .
The process is somewhat involved , but it comes down to this :
The Centerline uses 30,000 - hp pump to shove between 40 to 50 barrels of mud per minute over to the Q4000 , which then diverts it down to the leaking BOP through a mile - long pipe .
The mud is stuffed into the well at such a rate that it overcomes the gushing oil , forcing the leak to taper and the well to become static .
A concrete cap is then applied , sealing the leak permanently .

The whole mess is also known as " outrunning the well " and could take up to two days .
It may start this week .

Will it work ?
Probably , but there 's no guarantee .
Top - killing has been used to cap wells in the past , but never at this depth .
As the Washington Post reports ,
The danger is that the top kill could worsen the situation .
The powerful injection of mud might destabilize the blowout preventer , or punch a bigger hole in the sharp kink in the riser just a few feet above the blowout preventer .
If the mud does n't beat back the spill , that could mean a mess of mud mixed with a larger flow of oil and gas .
Greg McCormack , director of the Petroleum Extension Service at the University of Texas at Austin , said he 's cautiously optimistic that the top kill will work , saying : " There 's always a trade - off between making it better and making it worse .
This probably has the least amount of risk of making it worse . "

If the top kill does n't work , the backup plan involves a mechanical cap known as a lower marine riser package , or LMRP , seen above .
First , robotic submarines sever the top of the damaged BOP , increasing oil flow into the Gulf by as much as 15 percent .
The LMRP is a sealing device with a very large grommet that is lowered onto the well and connected to a riser leading to a drillship .
The drillship then captures most — the key word here is most — of the oil and gas flowing from the well .
There are other options , but this is the most practical .
If the top kill does n't work , the LMRP could be implemented within a few days .

A study by American and Australian researchers has found that high fat foods cause inflammation of the airways and reduce the function of the lungs .
It is already known that fatty foods are bad for the heart , and now you can add the lungs to the list .
The two researchers of the study are Dr. Lisa Wood ( lecturer in biomedical sciences and pharmacy , Hunter Medical Research Institute , University of Newcastle , New Lambton , Australia ) and Dr. Thomas M. Leath ( assistant professor of pediatrics , department of allergy and immunology , Texas A&M Health Science Center , College Station , Texas , and division director , allergy and immunology , Scott & White Healthcare , Round Rock , Texas ) .
Dr. Wood presented the results of the study on Sunday , May 16 , 2010 , at the American Thoracic Society International Conference ( ATS 2010 International Conference ) , which was held in New Orleans , Louisiana .
Wood stated in the May 16 , 2010 Bloomberg / Business Week article High - Fat Meal May Trigger Asthma that : " This is the first study to look at the effects of a high - fat challenge on airway inflammation . '
And , ' Our preliminary results demonstrate that at four hours after the consumption of the food challenges , subjects who consumed the high - fat meal had an increase in airway inflammation .
They also had an impaired response to [ asthma medication ] .
" The researchers studied 46 adults with asthma .
Thirty of them were not obese , and sixteen of them were obese .
The non - obese participants were randomly given either a high - fat meal or a low - fat meal .
The obese participants were each given a high - fat meal .
Page two continues .
The high - fat meal consisted of hamburgers and hash browns from a fast - food joint .
The Bloomberg / Business
Week article reports that the high - fat meal consisted of about 1,000 calories and 60 grams of fat .
One gram of fat contains nine calories ( statistics ) .
So , the meal had 540 calories consisting of fat , just over 50 % of the meal was fat .
According to the American Heart Association , as reported by the article , an average meal should contain no more than 25 % to 35 % of its calories from fat .
So , this meal is classified as a high - fat meal .
On the other hand , the low - fat meal contained low - fat yogurt , which had 200 calories and had 13 % fat .
The scientists found that the high - fat meal increased inflammation of the airways and reduced the function of the lungs .
Dr. Wood adds , " If these results can be confirmed by further research , this suggests that strategies aimed at reducing dietary fat intake may be useful in managing asthma .'
[ Bloomberg / Business Week ]
Page three concludes .
The Bloomberg / Business
Week article states , ' The researchers found that markers of airway inflammation increased significantly among those who ate the high - fat meal . ' And , ' They also found that lung function was affected as well .
And people who were given the high - fat meal who then used their asthma inhaler medication saw just a 1 percent improvement in their lung function .
Those on the low - fat meal saw a 4.5 percent increase in their lung function after using their medication . '
In addition , ' Wood said the researchers do n't know exactly why the body seems to respond to a high - fat meal this way , but said the immune system might be recognizing saturated fat as an invading pathogen , which prompts inflammation . ' Please read the Bloomberg / Business
Week article in more detail to learn more about this research in fat and its effect on the lungs .
The environment minister has given the green light to build the Eglinton LRT line , a 33 - kilometre stretch of track that will run from Kennedy Station in the east to Pearson International Airport in the west .
TTC spokesman Ryan Bissonnette said Thursday that the environmental assessment on the project was given unobstructed approval , which is " unprecedented for a project this size in a major metropolis . "
The central portion of the line will run underneath Eglinton Avenue and will travel at the same speed as the TTC 's subway , said Bissonnette .
The underground section will stretch 10.5 km , from Black Creek Drive in the west to Brentcliffe Road in the east .
Bissonnette said that it is n't known when construction on the line will begin .
Workers have already broken ground on the Sheppard LRT , which is also part of the Transit City initiative .
Mayor David Miller unveiled Transit City last year to much fanfare , with a stated goal that would build 120 km of new track around the city .
The plan hopes to increase rider ship by 175 million by 2021 .
However , Miller said in March that the plan was in danger of going off the rails because of provincial cutbacks , which were unveiled in the Liberals ' budget .
However , Bissonnette said that the provincial cuts simply changed the timeline of the project , with the project finishing up in 10 years rather than the previous goal of eight years .
He added that the Eglinton LRT was always scheduled to be completed in 2020 .
" It was my own fault , " she said .
" I did write the message .
But I had no idea that something that , to me is very small , could result in my losing my job … I lost my job because of a Facebook status . "

Would you let the government take your car and give it to someone else ?
How about your computer , television set , house , or business ?
What if the government said you would be compensated , yet gave you no other choice ?
That 's the dilemma in Auburn , New York , where the city is threatening to invoke eminent domain to force the sale of private property for a commercial hotel conference center , saying the public good outweighs the private property rights of some citizens .
And it 's legal .
" This is abuse , it ’s one case of eminent domain abuse , " says Renee Smith - Ward , owner of a dog grooming salon , Wag 'In Tail that could be plowed down for the hotel 's parking lot .
" I do n't believe it ’s right to take someone 's property away from them for a hotel , for a private developer , " says Smith - Ward .
" These people just want to come in and steal it from you , " says property owner Michael Kazanivsky , who says he has dreams to build a family amusement center on what is now a grass and rubble filled lot .
" They 're trying to take it from me , " he says bitterly , " it 's not right . "
Kazanivsky told Fox News that he put his " heart and soul into it , " and now " someone just comes and says ' I want that , give it to me or that 's it !’
It ’s hell . "
The plan would put an $ 11 million , 88 - room - hotel on what is now a mixture of an abandoned building and two businesses .
The city says the center would be the site of an annual music festival planned for 2012 , and that eminent domain would be used only if the developer and property owners cannot agree on a deal .
" Eminent domain , no one likes it , " concedes Auburn Mayor Michael Quill , a no-nonsense former Marine and long - time former fire chief of the city , who has a photograph on this desk with former Governor Sarah Palin and her husband Todd .
The Palins visited Auburn last summer during the commemoration of the 1867 purchase of the Alaska territory by U.S. Secretary of State William Seward , whose house is across the street from City Hall .
But it is Auburn 's current land dispute that has caused so much controversy here , as Mayor Quill and other officials contend the benefits of the hotel project simply outweigh the concerns of the property owners .
" We have a responsibility to the entire community , " Mayor Quill explains , saying " we do not want to hurt an individual property owner or business owner , but we have to look at the long range for the entire community . "
The prospect of the government forcing the sale of someone 's land against their will has touched a nerve here .
There have been protests and calls against the plan .
Click here to watch video .
Two property owners reportedly have reached an agreement , including a Chinese restaurant whose owners emigrated from Communist China and said in public hearings that they never knew there was a law on the books in America that permitted the state to seize their land for private , commercial purposes .
" Do you want to use eminent domain to get those properties ? " asks Jim Dacey , the head of the Auburn Industrial Development Agency – the group that will use eminent domain on behalf of Pioneer Companies , the private developer .
" I do n't think anybody wants to use eminent domain . "
But that is the exact threat , the landowners say if they do n't cower under the pressure from big business , in partnership with the city .
A hearing has been set for May 5th , to determine if Auburn will resort to using eminent domain .
Dacey told Fox News that " there has to be a good reason " for eminent domain to be used , " and in this case there is . "
He says the property owners are " being offered more than a fair price for their property , " noting the guidelines call not just for a current appraisal , but a second independent one , and that the offers have been " generous , above current appraisals . "
But Smith - Ward blasts the offers as a " very insulting price for our property , " and said she was stunned to learn that the city was considering seizing the business she and her husband Doug had sunk their life savings into only to hand their land over to someone else .
She told Fox News she always thought eminent domain was " for power lines , roads , schools , hospitals and not for a private developer . "
Five years ago the United States Supreme Court ruled that communities could use the power of eminent domain to help private interests , if the result was for the public good .
The case centered on New London , Connecticut , where a neighborhood was razed to make way for a private development that never came .
The main plaintiff was resident Susette Kelo , who ’s little , pink house was moved to another part of town and now stands as a symbol of regular citizens fighting the government 's use of eminent domain .
The city 's plans fell through and the blocks that were torn down remain largely empty to this day , save for the overgrown weeds and wild cats that roam the desolate area .
" In the wake of Kelo , we have learned about this abuse of power , " notes Christina Walsh of the Institute for Justice in Washington , D.C. , which has advised the Wards .
" There is nothing that Americans cherish more than property rights .
We cannot allow local governments like Auburn to think they can take what you 've worked so hard to own -- your family home , your small business -- simply to give it to someone else who promises to build something bigger and newer . "
Smith - Ward never thought this could happen in America , so she and her husband suddenly were thrust into negotiations with Pioneer Companies , which did not respond to our request for an interview .
They hope to keep their business even if the new hotel is built , but their fellow property owner Kazanivfsky remains adamant .
" I do n't want to sell , " he says defiantly .
" It 's mine , I bought it , " he insisted to Fox News .
Standing on the grass of his property , Kazanivfsky started to quietly weep .
Through his tears , he also said he did not think that in America , the power of the government could be used against citizens to take what is not theirs .
" I 'm going to fight all the way to the end , " he vows .

Spot the difference :
The leopard and the golden retriever who are the best of friends
It 's a role reversal not commonly seen , but then the cat chasing this dog is a little larger than most .
Salati , a ten - month - old leopard , and her best friend , golden retriever Tommy , like nothing more than to run amok before settling down for a friendly cuddle .
The odd couple were reared together at Glen Afric Country Lodge near Pretoria in South Africa .
Close : Salati , a ten - month - old leopard , leans in for a cuddle with her best friend , Golden Retriever Tommy Animal wrangler Richard Brooker , 23 , raised Salati and takes her and family dog Tommy for their daily exercise together .
Each morning , he walks them on his family 's 1,850 - acre estate and then lets them run free to their hearts ' content .
He said : ' Wherever you see one the other is right behind .
They are inseparable and both have lots of energy so they get the exercise they both need together .
No secrets :
The pair take daily walks together at the Glen Afric Country Lodge near Pretoria in South Africa
' When we first received Salati she was tiny and Tommy could chase her around .
But now with Salati matching him for weight the tables have turned .
' It 's all fun and games and they love playing together .
' But dogs are n't used to being chased by cats almost the same size as them .
I think it was a shock for him when she started doing the chasing but it 's fun to see them exploring together . '
Playmates : Tommy and Salati enjoy a bit of rough and tumble in the South African bush
As a cub Salati was much smaller than friendly Tommy , who weighs 18lb .
But the fast - growing predator now packs a bigger punch at a hefty 40 lb , more than twice the weight of her excitable dog friend .
Mr Brooker added : ' Dogs need to walk and going out with Tommy for a ramble in the bushes means Salati develops properly into a fit adult leopard .
Travelling companions :
The pair lie contentedly together in the boot of the four - wheel drive
' I take them out in the truck so they can have a good run-around together in lots of space . '
Rescued as an orphaned cub , Salati was donated by a local vet to the family - run country retreat , which helps to rehabilitate injured and destitute animals .
Breeding programmes at the spectacular venue also ensure that some of their animals who will never be able to survive in the wild enjoy the good life within huge enclosures .
The Brookers ' hard work has helped boost wildlife numbers in the area .
They have over 200 animals across 32 species on the grounds .
The stunning getaway is visited by resident guests staying at the lodge and day visitors who want to see Africa 's amazing creatures including lions , elephants and giraffes .
Did Rand Paul watch the news before he became the news ?
He has only existed — if we ’re going to use the metric of mass consciousness — for like two weeks , and already , there have been so many amateur missteps .
Following this week ’s ace decision toproblematize the Civil Rights Act , the Kentucky Republican senatorial candidate went on Good Morning America today to discuss how “ un- American ” this President Obama was for blaming B.P. for the oil spill .
Accidents happen !
It says so in the Constitution , probably .
He tells George Stephanopoulos , “ What I do n’t like from the president ’s administration is this sort of ‘ I ’ll put my boot heel on the throat of B.P. ’
I think that sounds really un-American in his criticism of business . ”
He adds later , “ It ’s always part of this blame - game society where it ’s always gotta be someone ’s fault instead of the fact that maybe sometimes accidents happen . ”
Stephanopoulos responds by asking Paul if he thinks B.P. is regulated enough , to which Paul replies that he does n’t know , although there are “ hundreds of pages of regulation of drilling in the ocean and I think most of that ’s justified . ”
Hundreds of pages !
That sounds pretty regulated , what with all those pages .
Happy 5th Birthday , Sunny and Angel !
San Diego residents are invited to attend Sunny and Angel 's fifth birthday party on Saturday , March 28 , Noon to 2 p.m. , at Helen Woodward Animal Center 's Equine Hospital , 6525 Helen Woodward Way Rancho Santa Fe , California .
Call 858-756-4117 , ext. 4 , for more information !
Sunny and Angel may look normal , but these horses and their mother , a 9 - year - old mare named , “ Lena ” , overcame unbelievable odds !
In March , 2010 , Lena , a Quarterhorse , was preparing to give birth .
Her owner did n’t know Lena was expecting twins until they were being born on Sunday , March 28 .
2010 .
The colt was named , “ Sunny ” and the filly was called , “ Angel . ”
Twin birth for horses is so rare that it ’s hard to find accurate statistics .
It is believed that the chance of a mare and both foals surviving birth is around 1 in 10,000 but in most cases there is a 1 in 15,000 chance of twin foals surviving the first two weeks .
Sunny and Angel are now five - years - old and are thriving !
We 're so excited to celebrate their fifth birthday on Saturday , March 28 .
Sunny and Angel 's arabian sire is Alada Baskin I .

A thought ...
It seems to me that most Pro-Life people I know really are n't Pro-Life at all .
They are , rather , Anti-Sex .
That is , the abortion debate is often just a cover to wage war on the sexual revolution and the Dawn of the Pill .
What many Pro-Life people are angry about is the casual sexuality of our age , an era of " abortion on demand . "
Pro-Life advocacy , then , is often ( consciously or unconsciously ) really a way to get sexually promiscuous people to face the " consequences " of sexual activity .
The focus on life is often cover for Puritanical worries about sexuality in modern America .
Why do I draw this conclusion ?
Because most Pro-Life people I know are only Pro-Life in this one area , and only in this one area .
They are not , generally speaking , consistently Pro-Life .
For example , most Pro-Life people are ...
... not Pro-Life when it comes to gun control .
... not Pro-Life when it comes to preemptive war .
... not Pro-Life when it comes to capital punishment .
... not Pro-Life when it comes to global malnourishment .
... not Pro-Life when it comes to universal health care .
... not Pro-Life when it comes to entitlement programs for the women and children of the working poor ( to remove the economic incentives for abortion ) .
... not Pro-Life in promoting condom usage to prevent teenage pregnancy or AIDS in developing nations .
In short , the on ly thing many conservatives are Pro-Life about is , well , abortion .
Which , incidentally , is the only thing on the list that 's about regulating sexual behavior .
Which kind of makes you wonder ...

Virus !!
The most common problem that we are facing today with our Windows based systems .
Despite of the virus attacks from cyberzone , we are facing threats from local hardware like USB , Pen drives and so onn ..
We have been concentrating on eliminating the viruses that entered because of those infected hardware devices Say for example USB .
So what we have to do in - order to eliminate the virus attacking our System ?
[ ad # Google Adsense 728 ]
We have to buy any good antivirus software available from markets and we have to update it regularly and we have to scan and maintain it from time to time .
It ’s a really a headache for us to maintain this stuff .
Is there any alternative solution for this problem ??
One thing we could actually do apart from the antivirus software is .
What if we make changes to the USB itself ??
It ’s the right time to safeguard your hardware devices in a effective way .
And one of the great solutions was put by a Chinese designer “ Wu Jiang ” who developed a design that which scans the flash drives to ensure that there is no virus before you connect them to the computers .
The name of his Project is “ U+USB Hub and Disk scanner “ , and it will work in as an association with the popular virus protecting softwares to ensure that the virus infection does n’t spread .
The background of this concept is to collaborate hardware changes with software to ensure maximum protection for the local hardware .

But at present its still just a simple thought and we have to wait for while to see the creative gadget in the market .
The government faces being hauled before the European court of human rights unless it gives prisoners the right to vote as a matter of urgency .
The revelation comes as several law firms seek to launch claims on behalf of thousands of UK prisoners who are demanding compensation – estimated to be as much as £ 750 each – on the grounds they were illegally denied the right to vote at the last general election .
The contentious issue threatens to become another test of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition .
The Lib Dems were strongly critical of the previous government 's refusal to enfranchise the prison population while the Conservatives have consistently avoided addressing the issue .
In March 2004 , the ECHR ruled in Hirst v UK that the government 's blanket ban barring sentenced prisoners from voting was unlawful .
But despite the ruling , the previous government continued to consult on the issue and failed to make it law .
The committee of ministers , the body that oversees European member states ' compliance with ECHR judgments , is to meet this week to discuss the UK 's failure to enfranchise prisoners following the ruling .
The committee will then issue a stark public reminder to the government that it must comply with the ruling immediately .
If it refuses , the committee has the power to refer the question of whether the government has failed in its obligations to the ECHR , a move that would put Westminster on a collision course with the Strasbourg - based Council of Europe .
The clash would represent the culmination of months of mounting frustration on the part of the committee .
In March it warned the UK must " rapidly adopt measures , of even an interim nature , to ensure the execution of the court 's judgment before the forthcoming general election " , otherwise the nationwide vote would be illegal .
The Prison Reform Trust , which campaigns for prisoners to be given the vote , said the government now has no choice but to introduce measures that will enfranchise inmates .
" We understand from their statements that the committee of ministers at the Council of Europe takes this matter of protracted non-compliance very seriously indeed and we hope that the new coalition government will seek to put matters right without further delay , " said Juliet Lyon , director of the trust .
Penal reformers say giving prisoners the vote is about restoring a fundamental human right that will confer a sense of responsibility and aid their rehabilitation .
They point out that the UK is out of step with many other countries .
Eighteen European countries have no restrictions on prisoners voting while in France and Germany a decision to disenfranchise a prisoner is left to the courts .
In Australia and New Zealand the length of a prisoner 's sentence determines their right to vote .
Other countries where prisoners have the right to vote include South Africa , Poland , and Canada .
But any move that recognises the ECHR ruling on prisoner voting is likely to spark an angry reaction from Eurosceptics .
In the House of Lords last year Lord Tebbit attacked the measure as a form of " judicial imperialism " effectively foisted on the UK by a foreign court .
Enfranchising prisoners is supported by the Prison Governors Association and Lord Hurd , the former Conservative home secretary , has claimed that " if prisoners had the vote then the MPs would take a good deal more interest in conditions in prisons " .
However , the previous government , aware that some sections of the media and the public are opposed to allowing prisoners the vote , claimed there were problems with implementing the legislation .
The concerns have been assuaged by the Electoral Commission which has established a mechanism by which prisoners can be enfranchised though a system of postal or proxy voting .
The government also said it was unclear which categories of prisoner should be allowed to vote .
In April in the case of Frodl v Austria , the ECHR ruled that it is unlawful to disenfranchise all prisoners serving a sentence of more than one year in jail .
The court emphasised that a decision to deny a prisoner the vote should instead " be taken by a judge , taking into account the particular circumstances " .
A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said : " The government is considering the best way forward on the issue of prisoner voting rights .
Until the approach is settled , it would not be appropriate to make further comments . "
• This article was amended on Sunday 30 May 2010 to remove part of the quote attributed to the Ministry of Justice spokeswoman .

The Second Wave of Mortgage Defaults
Our economy is about to relapse into the disease that sent us into the Great Depression : Part Deux .
Subprime loans caused the initial illness .
Option - ARMs will cause the relapse .
In the first half of the past decade , subprime loans were king .
They were cheap and easy to get approved .
Along with the subprime boom came subprime adjustable - rate mortgages ( ARMs ) , which were equally easy to afford … for a while .
Of course , the “ A ” and the “ R ” in ARM meant that the interest rate borrowers pay changes , or resets .
The majority of these resets occurred between the summer of 2007 and the summer of 2008 .
This period saw a massive amount of mortgage interest rate hikes , which caused millions of foreclosures .
Things spiraled down from there , eventually freezing nearly all credit and causing the panic of 2008 .
Of course , that ’s the 50 - cent version of recent history .
There were plenty of other financial calamities that went along with this , including the bundling of mortgage - backed securities and risky derivative products .
If you believe the Obama White House and the glass - half - full press corps , you ’d think this mess is now behind us .
We are , after all , in a recovery … right ?
Unfortunately , no one is talking about the second wave of ARM resets and foreclosures …
You see , this second wave will come crashing even harder than the first .
It ’s made up of a type of mortgage called “ Option ARMs . ”
These give borrowers the option of how much they want to pay during the first five or 10 years of repayment :
1 ) The full amortized rate , including interest and principal .
2 ) Interest only , or …
3 ) A token payment , well below the amount needed to cover the interest on the loan .
This third option causes the mortgage balance to INCREASE instead of decrease .
And usually , the borrower can continue to make minimum payments until the mortgage balance increases to 125 % of the original amount .
That ’s when the trouble begins …especially if the interest rate increases at the same time .
This is the exact situation in which many homeowners now find themselves .
Obviously , these option ARMs were supposed to be reserved for customers with better credit than those who took out subprime mortgages .
But apparently , they were handed out to almost anyone who wanted them .
According to Whitney Tilson and Glenn Tongue of T2 Partners , who are experts on this subject , about 80 % of option ARMs are negatively amortizing .
Meaning these so - called top - tier borrowers are heading further into the hole .
Once their rates reset , they could be in serious trouble .
And that could be happening very soon :
The chart above shows the two peaks in the mortgage - reset wave .
The first peak is comprised of subprime ARM resets .
And the second is mostly constructed of option ARM resets .
We appear to be in the eye of the storm .
That fact alone shook our nerves when we first discovered it .
But it was a different chart in Tilson and Tongue ’s most recent presentation that really got us startled …
It ’s also the reason I ’m predicting the dollar spike in 2010 .
Instead of resetting as expected after the first five years , many option ARMs are so negatively amortized that they are hitting their automatic reset cap .
That means they are resetting early … like right now .
As you can see from the second chart , the expected reset peak was to occur in 2011 .
But the real peak is happening now .
You can also see that the amount of mortgages resetting is spread over a longer period of time than originally thought , but is peaking much earlier .
Unfortunately , it ’s not the peaks that matter .
You see , those are just resets .
But with unemployment reaching quarter - century highs every month , and the massive number of homeowners about to receive mortgage bills for two to three times what they are used to paying , we find ourselves in an even scarier environment than this time last year .
It takes anywhere between 3 - 12 months for most homeowners to actually go into foreclosure .
Therefore , the wave of Option - ARMs that are now resetting could cause a major wave of foreclosures over the next 6 to 18 months .
It ’s tough to say exactly when the storm will come .
But my guess is the second half of 2010 .
This second wave of foreclosures will not be good news for the economy or the stock market …
At least that ’s my guess .

17 Most Awkward TV Hugs
Hugs happen in all kinds of relationships on screen , and most of them enhance the connection between the people in it .
But then there are those hugs that are just awkward and that you can't even look at .
Despite his boastful claims of startling originality , in reality Mark Millar 's greatest strength as a writer is his ability to make a familiar concept seem novel .
The idea of an evil Batman is not a new one .
In Millar 's hands , however , it is a fun little exercise to behold .
Just not as fun as you 'd expect from the team that delivered a Venom T - Rex and a family of inbred Hulks .
Nemesis is strangely subdued for a Mark Millar comic .
Do n't get me wrong , it has plenty of cursing and killing – so much so that it almost feels like Millar is using both to cover up for the blandness of his core concept .
That or Millar really believes the idea of an evil Batman is strong and fresh enough to prop up the rest of the underwhelming scenes he tries to build on top of it .
Either way , Nemesis # 1 does n't spring to fully - formed , depraved life quite like Millar 's previous projects have .
The spectacles just are n't as spectacular , the perversions not quite as perverse .
Even more surprisingly , McNiven does n't make up for the shortcomings of Millar 's script ; in places , he even accentuates them .
McNiven 's work here is n't nearly as impressive as it was in Old Man Logan or even Civil War , in large part due to a minimalist approach on his part that , while most likely a stylistic choice , still feels like a shortcut .
Many panels lack backgrounds , and none of the settings – not even shots of entire cities – feel like vibrant places .
There 's a Frank Quitely - esque distortion to many of his figures , but that deliberate ugliness does n't work nearly as well or as naturally for McNiven as it does for Quitely .
On the other hand , his storytelling is topnotch as always , and when Air Force One crashes through the streets of Washington DC , you can follow its destructive path effortlessly from start to finish .
My biggest problem with this first issue is that Millar never really adds any depth to either of his two main characters .
We 're told the villain is a deranged , evil mastermind because he derails trains , crashes planes and kills cops .
So what ?
We 're told his hero is the best cop on the damn planet because he executes a bunch of robbers , and because , well , he just is .
In both cases , neither character comes across as more than a bare - bones idea .
Millar has made a name for himself as the master of spectacle driven , in - your - face comics , and his past work has entertained me enough to convince me Nemesis deserves the benefit of the doubt .
At times , when Millar is riffing on a few age old Joker tropes , you can almost sense the story about to spring to life .
Sadly , though , it never does in this first issue .
The ideas just kind of sit there while Millar and McNiven wave their hands and try to grab our attention with violence and potty language .
It 's kind of a bad sign when you derive more entertainment out of a comic 's text afterward than you do the comic itself .
Microsoft 's decision to abandon Windows XP with its next browser is a business move meant to push people off the aged operating system , an analyst said today .
It also gives rivals like Mozilla an opportunity to make further inroads into Internet Explorer 's market share , said Sheri McLeish of Forrester Research .
" XP is in that same world as Office 2003 and IE6 , " said McLeish .
" Microsoft does n't want to prolong the life of those products . "
McLeish was reacting to Microsoft 's stated plans not to support its next - generation browser , Internet Explorer 9 ( IE9 ) , in Windows XP .
Google , which creates Chrome , criticized that decision yesterday during a panel discussion at Web 2.0 on the future of browsers .
" It 's not in [ Microsoft 's ] interest to support XP , " McLeish added .
" They have a vision of moving people ahead on operating systems .
That 's their business intent . "
Microsoft will not craft a version of IE9 for XP because it 's adding graphics processor - based acceleration to the browser .
That acceleration relies on APIs ( applications programming interfaces ) that are built into Windows 7 and were added to Vista in October 2009 , but that are not available in the older OS .
Noting that Microsoft will meet , and in fact exceed , its usual 10 - year support policy for XP -- the operating system is slated for final retirement in April 2014 , nearly 13 years after its release -- McLeish said IE9 's non-support for the old OS was a business decision by Microsoft .
" As time goes on , XP will get less attention paid to it by Microsoft , " she said .
She also thought that the noise about XP 's inability to run IE9 is a moot point for enterprises .
" There are few large customers that do n't have an upgrade plan [ from XP ] in place , " she said .
" Most firms now running XP are planning to upgrade to Windows 7 . " IE9 runs on Windows 7 .
But a window of opportunity exists for browser rivals , particularly Mozilla , over the next several years as small businesses and consumers continue to run Windows XP .
Both Google and Mozilla are working on boosting their Chrome and Firefox browsers ' by tapping into hardware acceleration , even on XP .

The " How to Write a Screenplay " Workbook - A Free Gift .
Introduction
If you are new to screenwriting , planning to write a screenplay or script of any kind , the good news is that writing in screenplay format is easier and more intuitive today than at any time since first Lanier Word Processing Machine .
Advances in screenwriting software now save the hours you would previously have spent learning how to write a screenplay in professional Hollywood format can now be allocated to polishing your plot , honing your dialogue , or learning screenplay structure .
Some think screenplay writing is eclipsing the pursuit of the Great American Novel but it certainly is n't any easier .
At any rate the making of movies is a collaborative process which demands that those in screenwriting produce a document in particular format , notation , and length called a ' script . '
This overview will begin acquaint you with the screenplay format writing rules and screenwriting etiquette you 'll need to know about , and as you browse the following material you may notice the words ' do n't ' , ' avoid ' and '...' unless you are directing the movie . '
Take that advice to heart .
As you become more familiar with the world of screenwriting you 'll understand why but for now the scope of this document prohibits a deeper explanation .
Learning how to write a screenplay involves many facets but I hope this basic information will give you a head start on your endeavors , including practical information to help you get your scripts read .
And hopefully turned into movies .

After more than a century of popular sci- fi fantasies that feature deadly energy weapons , including War of the Worlds , Flash Gordon , Buck Rogers , Star Trek and Star Wars , it looks like the ray gun has finally arrived in the real world .
And even if the first ray guns out of the lab can barely fit on the bed of a 30 - ton off - road truck rather than in a soldier ’s palm , the novel , " speed - of - light " capabilities that lasers could bring to the battlefield has drawn the keen interest of the Pentagon brass , which spends about $ 400 million a year on directed - energy beam weapons .
At the end of this year , which marks a half - century of amazing progress in lasers , defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Boeing plan to test - fire a prototype mobile laser weapon against examples of the lethal ordnance — rockets , artillery , mortars — that insurgents in Afghanistan and elsewhere shoot at U.S. troops every day , says Mark Neice , director of the Department of Defense 's High Energy Laser Joint Technology Office in Albuquerque , N.M .
As long as such an area - defense system is fed electrical power ( from the grid or battery packs ) , its 100 - kilowatt , solid - state , or electric , laser should be able to use its “ unlimited magazine ” of low - cost shots and ultra-precision tracking / targeting system to zap out of the air multiple inbound munitions from several kilometers away , he explains .
Weapons engineers will use the live - fire tests of the one - micron - wavelength ( infrared ) beam , which will take place at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico , " to validate our notional models of beam propagation , " Neice says .
These results , “ will allow us to determine what targets we can take on , at what power levels , what ranges and so forth . ”
The U.S. Army hopes that laser cannons can shield its bases from insurgent attacks while minimizing the risk of collateral damage to the civilian populations among which guerrillas often hide .
A cannon ’s powerful beam will be able reach out to incoming weaponry , and either detonate , disable or knock them off - course , whereas its ultra-precision aiming capability would presumably enable troops to pick off ground targets without hitting nearby non-combatants .
The U.S. Air Force has in the meantime taken the lead in a project sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) to develop even more powerful and compact solid - state lasers that could fit on combat aircraft .
Such systems could provide the nation ’s air arm with what Michael W. Zmuda , manager of the Air Force Research Lab ’s Electric Laser on Large Aircraft ( ELLA ) program , calls the “ game - changing capability ” to carry out beyond - the - horizon , air - to - air engagements and precisely targeted , air - to - ground strikes .
“ It would open up a raft of new tactical and defensive roles , such as defeating targets that are close to our own troops while avoiding collateral damage to civilians and property , as well as a range [ of ] rapid - response missions against a whole new set of targets , ” he says .
The Air Force plans to fit a B1 - B bomber with a new 150 - kilowatt solid - state laser that will be built by the winner of a contract competition between General Atomics Aeronautical ( GAA ) and Textron Defense .
The original DARPA effort arose when “ we realized that a laser beam propagates much more efficiently 1,000 meters off the ground , where atmospheric distortion and scattering effects are much less pronounced , ” according to Michael Perry , vice president at GAA .
To fit in a fighter jet , one of the chief Pentagon goals , the airborne laser weapon will need to generate around five kilowatts per kilogram which means the technology “ has to be reduced in size and weight by a factor of 10 over the current ground - based system , ” Perry notes .
Meanwhile , U.S. Navy researchers are learning to cope with the extra difficulties of running a finely tuned electro - optical device in the harsh maritime conditions near the sea surface , where water vapor in the air tends to scatter and attenuate directed - energy beams .
Navy planners are interested in using lasers in a “ counter - materiel role ” to help naval vessels fend off harassing attacks by squadrons of small armed boats such as occurred in early 2008 in the Strait of Hormuz , says Dan Wildt , vice president of directed energy systems at Northrop Grumman .
Though the Navy is not saying specifically , it is thought that a relatively low - power laser beam could set alight wood or glass - fiber hulls , fuel or vulnerable weapons from stand - off distances of a kilometer or more .
Wildt ’s company is supplying a 15 - kilowatt solid - state laser for Navy tests at a Pacific range later this year .
Northrop Grumman and others are also working on switchable free - electron lasers that can fire beams of two or more different wavelengths of light . *
These weapons could provide ship defenses with more flexible means to better penetrate the sea haze and protect against supersonic cruise missiles and other aerial threats .
Free -electron lasers employ an array of electromagnets called a wiggler or undulator to force a beam of electrons to travel in a sinusoidal path that makes them release energetic , in - phase photons that form a powerful laser beam .
Changes to the electron beam or the wiggler ’s magnetic field alters the wavelength of the resulting laser beam .
Much of the recent interest in military laser technology stems from recent progress in solid - state , or electric , laser technology .
These sources generate powerful , coherent light beams when arrays of semiconductor laser diodes pump light into the faces of “ slabs ” or rods — special ceramic lasing media that amplify the light greatly .
The slabs are ganged into chains that progressively boost the output beam power .
Over the past few years , contractors have demonstrated solid - state lasers capable of producing over 100 kilowatts of power , which specialists consider the minimum weapons - grade power rating .
Weapons - grade electric lasers have an Achilles heel , however .
Their energy conversion efficiencies are only 20 to 30 percent , which means most of the input power is lost to heat .
To dissipate the waste heat that would otherwise cause thermal distortions in the internal light path and reduce optical transmission , electric lasers require bulky , power - hungry liquid - cooling systems , says Mike Rinn , vice president at Boeing .
Future mobile lasers will have to operate much more efficiently , to avoid the need both for huge , energy - sapping coolers and perhaps for batteries altogether if they could run directly off of a vehicle ’s engine power .
Two laser technologies that could fit the requirement , Rinn says , are the fiber laser , where the lasing material is a fiber - optic material , and the so - called hybrid laser , in which laser diodes pump a gas - phase lasing media .
* Correction ( 5/17/10 ) :
This article originally stated that Northrop Grumman and others are working on " free- energy " lasers .
Canon EOS 5D Mark II – Camera from Hell
Ever since I wrote some posts about the Canon EOS 5D Mark II DSLR on my blog last year , I ’ve continued to get comments from many users around the world who ’ve used the camera and had issues with it .
Most of the time these users went online after experiencing issues to search for a solution and then found my blog only to wish they had read it before they bought their 5D Mark II .
Just yesterday I got the following two comments from two different people :
From Troy :
Being a Canon user makes me feel cheated .
The autofocus is terrible , owning a $ 3000 camera and having so many shots out of focus is unacceptable .
Shooting landscapes is most of the time fine ( even there AF hunts at times ) but anything moving and easy to lose over 75 % of your shots .
Slow frame rate and many out of focus shots , bad news .
I have tried every AF combination and get the same results .
I have some great photos but have lost too many .
I hate to switch but selling my Canon gear and moving to Nikon .
I would love to stay with Canon but AF issues are too much , and they do n’t seem wanting to fix it anytime soon .
From Mark H :
Hi Karel , I have n’t read all the responses but I can’t believe some of the assessments of the camera based on limited shooting situations .
I ’m a wedding photographer , shoot 2000 - 3000 images per wedding in all kinds of lighting and all situations , and yes , low light shooting with the MK2 sucks compared to even prosumer cameras like the 40D .
IMO it ’s the outer autofocus points …. focus dead - on with the center point ( to hell with the rule of thirds or any sort of off center composition ) and you ’ll do ok in low light ( in most situations ) , but try “ getting ready ” shots with a window behind the bride ’s head ( bright backlight ) , or low light church shots and good luck getting 30 % of them in focus with the off - center focus points .
I shoot a lot wide open at 1.4 , so I know when it ’s on and when it ’s off .
It ’ll focus fine in bright light ( so it ’s not needing microadjustments or a lens problem ) , it ’ll focus fine with off center points in bright light most of the time , but go indoors and be careful .
Get trigger happy if you want some images to choose from .
I love the resolution , love most of everything about the camera , can live with the speed of the autofocus , but a “ low - light ” camera that only has 1 “ usable ” autofocus point in low light is kinda disappointing .
And there ’s a lot more where those came from .
If you ’ve read my previous posts about the 5D Mark II , you know that the issues these users are describing are exactly the issues I mentioned in my posts .
From the moment the 5D Mark II was announced I saw based on the specifications alone that Canon had seriously crippled the camera with an old autofocus system that would n’t be able to let people really take advantage of the other features the camera had to offer .
Many users who ’ve bought the camera for professional use have had no choice but to sell it again and move to something that worked much better and offered A LOT more , such as the Nikon D700 .
Here are just two cases :
Case 1 : Sold Canon gear and switched to Nikon :
Canon was good to me , especially back in the day when I rocked a cropped sensor and a 35 mm lens for 90 % of my shoots .
It was simple , reliable and dependable .
Then I got a 5d .
The 5d offered great high ISO features , a full frame , a nice big LCD and the worst focusing system money could buy .
🙁
Let me preface this next part by saying that I am a hard - core stickler for sharp images ; “ A little soft , ” or “ a little back - focused ” is not ok by me .
It ’s tack sharp or it get ’s the hose .
So , as you can imagine , the 5d became quite a handicap for me .
But , nonetheless , I figured out that if I only shot on One Shot and kept my aperture up , I could make in - focus photos .
Despite my near - constant frustration with Canon , I held out for the mythical 5d Mark II – a camera that promised even better ISO , an even bigger sensor , an even fancier LCD and ( you guessed it ) , the same crappy focusing system .
At that point , Canon had me by the you - know - whats ( I do n’t actually have you - know - whats … it ’s a euphemism , silly ) – I had * thousands * invested in lenses ( see below ) .
So I shot my 5d Mark II for the entire 2009 wedding season …. on One - Shot …. using a high aperture … constantly cussing under my breath .
Case 2 : Sold Canon gear and switched to Nikon :
So , my 5DII came back from Canon ’s repair center AGAIN on Tuesday .
I took it out for a 45 minute stroll and took pictures of cats , leaves , berries , trees , the water .. etc. I used both the center focal point and the outer focal points .
I spent the entire 45 minutes cursing after each shot as it became more and more apparent that it was just the same ( if not worse ) as it had been when I sent it in .
…
So , I sniffled a little , I paced back and forth , I thought .
Then I typed up all the Canon gear I own on a forum and titled it ‘ For sale ’ .
I sniffled some more and grit my teeth and clicked the ‘ post ’ button .
There .
I said it .
It ’s for sale .
I ’ve been a Canon girl for eight years .
I busted my ass to buy that 5D , and I love it .
If I could afford to keep it and the 50 mm lens that ’s been with me for four years , I would do it in a heartbeat .
I ’m done .
I ’m switching to Nikon .
In both these cases the users were let down by the bad autofocus performance of the 5D Mark II and had no choice but to switch to the Nikon D700 .
Even the image quality offered by the 5D Mark II is n’t what you would expect from a $ 2700 camera with noise and banding issues even at the low ISO settings .
The reason why the 5D Mark II still appears to be selling well is because of the HD video features that are also built into the camera .
But as a tool for photography , the 5D Mark II has some serious issues and shortcomings that I hope will be addressed sufficiently by Canon in the next version .

There 's also the attitude of a chunk of Labour to PR .

" When I heard about it , it reminded me of Nazi Germany .
It reminded me of South African apartheid . "
— Hispanic Federation President Lillian Rodriguez Lopez on Arizona 's new law to counter illegal immigration .
Racist , Stalinist , Nazi - like ( this last from the creator of Family Guy cartoon show , among others ) .
These are just some of the characterizations of Arizona 's new law criminalizing illegal immigrants .
Large numbers of protestors march in downtown Dallas , and other large U.S. cities with Hispanic populations , on May 1 , 2010 to denouce the controversial Airzona immigration law and urge President Barack Obama to take up a more liberal approach to immigration reform .
( L.M. Otero / Associated Press )
The controversial bill , which comes in the run-up to the U.S. mid-term elections in November and has been condemned by President Barack Obama , requires police to question people about their immigration status if they have " reasonable suspicion " they are in Arizona illegally .
It has sparked a flurry of protests , threats of boycotts and lawsuits since its passage on April 19 .
Indeed , over 50,000 gathered in Los Angeles alone last week to protest against the new law .
Critics claim the bill is an invitation to racial profiling and will encourage police officers to scour the streets and randomly pluck out tanned - skinned individuals who look like they do n't belong .
But are these characterizations of the bill fair ?
Safe neighbourhoods
There are an estimated 450,000 illegal immigrants living in Arizona , most doing the kinds of low - wage jobs that are essential to the American economy , which is the case right across the U.S .
But those local law officials and politicians who sought SB 1070 , which is also known as Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods
Act , say the impetus for the bill was to quell the rise of violent crime that , these officials say , is linked to the illegal immigrant community .
Drug trafficking , kidnappings and human smuggling have become a serious problem in the state , which borders Mexico , despite the fact that statistics show the overall crime rate , including violent crime , has actually gone down in Arizona over the past decade .
Mark Gollom is a senior writer with CBC News .
Still , many residents have been clamouring for the federal government to do something to clamp down on illegal immigration .
With neither the former George W. Bush administration nor the current White House having addressed the issue , Arizona 's Republican legislators decided to act on their own .
Original wording
The controversy over the new act stems in part from these paragraphs in the original version of the bill :
" For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement official … where reasonable suspicion exists that the person is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States , a reasonable attempt shall be made , when practicable , to determine the immigration status of the person . "
" Any person who is arrested shall have the person 's immigration status determined . "
Opponents suggested this gives police licence to start harassing all Hispanic - looking people , whether they are illegal or not .
But many critics seemed to have overlooked the fact that the bill stated that " legal contact " had to be made first on an unrelated matter before questions about immigration status could be investigated .
For example , a police officer might stop someone for speeding or running a red light .
And only after the stop or detention could police inquire about someone 's immigration status .
The key point , which is often overlooked , is that the officer would have needed probable cause , a concept that is well determined in American law , to stop the individual in the first place .
' Lawful contact '
Still , some critics said that the term " lawful contact " was just too vague and that contact could be considered established if someone went up to an officer or some other official to ask for directions .
So , last week , the bill was altered .
Lawful contact was taken out and substituted with the phrase " a lawful stop , detention or arrest , " with the added proviso that that stop " must be in the enforcement of any other law or ordinance of a county , city or town or this state . "
The bill was also changed because the original version stated that complaints can not be investigated if they are based " solely on race , colour or national origin . "
Some legislators felt the word " solely " was too ambiguous , that it might be camouflage for certain types of targeting , so that word has now been cut out as well .
All these changes , however , have done little to cool the overall criticism .
Opponents have slammed a provision in the bill that non-U.S. citizens could be fined and / or jailed if they cannot produce proper documentation .
Obama weighed in on that , saying a Hispanic - American out for an ice cream with his child could be " harassed " if " you do n't have your papers . "
The proper documentation aspect is what gives this bill its Orwellian feel .
But many overlook the fact that the 1940 Alien Registration
Act already makes it a federal crime for non-citizens not to carry proper documentation ( as is the case in many Western countries ) .
The new Arizona law simply makes it a state misdemeanor as well .
In fact , Arizona has gone out of its way to mirror the language in the federal act , to ward off law suits in which a judge would be tempted to find the state law in conflict with the federal one .
Still , the big question remain how one can have a " reasonable suspicion " that someone is an illegal immigrant without the use of racial profiling .
Racial profiling
In an interview with CBC News , Lt. Tammy Villar , a spokeswoman for the Pinal County Sheriff 's Office in Arizona , said there are different types of indicators other than using racial profiling .
While the Arizona immigration law was stirring up harsh views , the Arizona Department of Public Safety and other law enforcement officials , including the U.S. Immigration and Customs , arrested nine suspected illegal immigrants and three suspected smugglers at a drop house in Phoenix on April 29 , 2010 .
( Ross Franklin / Associated Press )
She said that seeing a bunch of people crammed into a small vehicle might raise suspicions .
As would someone hiding in a trunk or people fleeing the vehicle following a traffic stop .
She said police would also be suspicious if someone , after a traffic stop , was unable to provide an explanation why they could n't produce a driver 's licence or have no record of ever having one .
" I 'm not simply going to stop somebody , and I do n't have the authority to stop somebody , just because they appear to be of foreign descent , " she said .
This law " gives us the ability to further investigate if there 's a reason that we might not believe someone is in the country illegally . "
Asked whether officers would be just as suspicious , for example , of a bunch of white guys jammed into car , Villar said skin tone is not necessarily a determining feature of someone 's origins .
" My kids are Hispanic and their skin is lighter than mine , " she pointed out .
Still , it 's difficult to see how racial profiling , consciously or not , would not play some role .
But the reality is that all the controversy could end up being moot on constitutional grounds .
The U.S Constitution clearly states that immigration , and the enforcement of immigration , is the responsibility of the federal government , which suggests that Arizona has overstepped its authority — a situation that has led the Obama administration to consider the unusual step of filing its own suit against the Arizona law ( as opposed to just letting the courts work this out over time ) .
What this means is that opponents and even some supporters of the bill , which is slated to go into effect later this summer , three months following the end of Arizona 's legislative session , have a " reasonable suspicion " it may never get off the ground .
Keith Tkachuk Left Wing - STL GOALS : 538 | ASST : 525 | PTS : 1063
There might be tears during a special ceremony at home in St. Louis on Friday , but Keith Tkachuk did n't shed any on Wednesday night at the United Center after it was announced that he would retire at season 's end .
Tkachuk , who sat out St. Louis ' game against the host Blackhawks with a lower - body injury , made his way through the press box for interviews between periods with a smile on his face and a hand extended to familiar faces there to congratulate him .
After 19 seasons in the National Hockey League , Tkachuk has decided that his body has taken enough of a pounding as one of his era 's toughest power forwards .
" It 's been a tough year with my health , so it 's definitely the right decision to step away after this season , " he said .
" It 's always hard .
I played a lot of years and cherish every moment .
" His proudest accomplishment , he said , is n't any of the impressive statistics that he 's accrued over his career .
It 's not the 1,200 regular season games played , the 1,063 points on 538 goals and 525 assists or the 2,219 minutes spent in the penalty box .
It 's also not the 89 playoff games played , 56 points tallied on 28 goals and 28 assists , or the 176 penalty minutes accrued in the post - season .
"
The thing I 'm most proud of is the fact I 'm retiring as a St. Louis Blue , " said Tkachuk , a four - time Olympian and silver medalist who came into the League with Winnipeg and played for the Blues for nine seasons .
" St. Louis is a great place to play and live .
It 's been a great run playing for the Blues .
" Blackhawks forward Kris Versteeg remembers watching Tkachuk as a youngster .
" He's an amazing player , " Versteeg said .
" He was actually my old man 's favorite power forward when I was growing up .
He 's a guy who really helped solidify that position .
He 's done so much for many organizations in the League .
I send my best to him because he 's been such a great player in the League .
" News of Tkachuk 's retirement spread quickly through the press box , and Tkachuk made his way through interviews on TV , radio and with writers .
He said that after consulting with his family he knew it was time to call it quits .
He has three children whom he'd like to spend more time with , including sons Matthew , 12 , and Brady , 10 , who both play junior hockey in St. Louis .
" My kids are taking it hard , especially my two boys , " Tkachuk said .
" My daughter Tayrn is only 6 , so I do n't think she really understands it all just yet .
But the boys have been around the rink long enough that they 're a little sad .
But now I 'll get some more time to spend with them and help them along the way .
" Tkachuk , who was drafted by Winnipeg in 1990 and broke into the League with the Jets in 1991 , has played in 66 games this season .
He has 13 goals and 17 assists for 30 points .
He 's also spent 56 minutes in the penalty box .
It 's the time spent in the press box because of bumps and bruises that drove him to this decision .
He said that he will still spend a lot of time around hockey , coaching his boys , but , " I just wo n't be getting banged around by 6 - foot - 5 guys anymore .
" Ed Olczyk remembers the days when Tkachuk was a young buck instigating most of the collisions .
Olczyk , now a TV analyst , played with Tkachuk for three full seasons in Winnipeg .
He 's impressed at how far the guy they call " Walt " has come since his rookie season .
"
He came in raw and just evolved into a great player , " Olczyk said .
" He was the prototypical power forward .
He could score .
He could hit .
He was n't afraid to run you into the ditch .
He was a great pro .
He 's one of the greatest American - born players to play the game .
" Tkachuk remembers those days well , and for the past couple of seasons he 's tried to impart his own wisdom on the Blues ' young players like Olczyk did for him .
"
You just try to be the best teammate possible , " said Tkachuk , who will be honored after St. Louis ' final home game of the season on Friday night .
" I was lucky to have some guys who affected me in a positive way , so you just try to help guys be comfortable and learn the right way .
" As for his legacy ?
He has thought about it and in his mind it 's more about things that do n't show up in box scores .
" I just hope I left a positive influence on my teammates and people I 've met along the way , especially with the team we have right now , " Tkachuk said .
" I owe the game of hockey everything .
The game does n't owe me anything .
I 've been lucky to play in the National Hockey League and I 'll never forget it . "
“ It ’s a prominent lead that they ’re following , the international association , ” said a senior official , who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation .
“ But there ’s still a lot of information being gathered . ”
On Monday , prior to the arrest , there was a sweeping response to the attempted attack in the tourist - packed city - within - a- city of Times Square — including an increased police presence , vehicle inspections and a touch of panic from veteran New Yorkers when a manhole fire flared five blocks from the scene of the failed bombing .
Consolidated Edison blamed faulty wiring for the fire .
The recent sale of the Pathfinder began online .
An advertisement that appears to be for the vehicle , which had 141,000 miles on the odometer and was listed for sale at $ 1,300 on at least two Web sites , emphasized that it was in good condition — “ CLEAN inside and out !! ” — with a recently repaired alternator and a new gas pump , distributor and front tires .
“ It does have some rust as you can see in the picture , ” the seller allowed on NothingButCars.net , “ but other than that , it runs great . ”
The other advertisement appeared on Craigslist .
In Bridgeport , the seller refused to answer questions .
“ You ca n’t interview her , ” said an unidentified man at the woman ’s two - story , white clapboard house .
“ She already talked to the F.B.I . ”
The police earlier on Monday continued sifting through footage from 82 city cameras mounted from 34th Street to 51st Street between Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue , and from untold number of business and tourist cameras .

But investigators appeared to have begun to assign less significance to a man who appeared to be in his 40s who was seen on one video , and it may well be because they were close to arresting the Connecticut man .
Interrogator # 1 told the court that he had used a variety of techniques detailed in the Army Field Manual on Interrogations against Omar Khadr , including those called " Love of Freedom " , " Fear Up " and " Fear Up Harsh " .
He said he used " Fear Up Harsh " on several occasions :
" I got in his face , I screamed at him , I cursed because I knew he did n’t like it .
I flipped a bench one time . "
Interrogator # 1 maintained that he had not physically abused Omar Khadr in any way .
It nevertheless emerged in court that the same interrogator had been convicted in a court martial in 2005 of abusing another detainee in Bagram in 2002 .
In this latter case , Interrogator # 1 admitted twisting the bottom of a hood around the detainee ’s neck , pulling the detainee toward him in a rough manner and sticking a water bottle in the detainee ’s face and forcing him to drink from it .
Similar forms of abuse appear in Omar Khadr ’s 2008 affidavit .
For example , he said :
" On some occasions , the interrogators brought barking dogs into the interrogation room while my head was covered with a bag .
The bag was wrapped tightly around my neck , nearly choking me and making it hard to breathe .
This terrified me .
On other occasions , interrogators threw cold water on me . "
The most damning testimony at today ’s hearing came when the defense asked Interrogator # 1 directly if he had ever threatened the 15 - year - old with rape if he did not cooperate .
In his affidavit , Omar Khadr had alleged that
" On several occasions at Bagram , interrogators threatened to have me raped , or sent to other countries like Egypt , Syria , Jordan or Israel to be raped " .
Interrogator # 1 responded that he had told the teenager a " fictitious story " about a young Afghan who had lied and been sent to a US prison where " big black guys and big Nazis " noticed " this little Muslim " and , in their patriotic rage over the 9/11 attacks , the " poor little kid " was raped in the shower and died .
Interrogator # 1 denied that he had ever directly threatened Omar Khadr with rape , and suggested that the story of the Afghan boy was legitimate under the authorized " love of freedom " and " fear up " techniques .
Speaking later at a press conference , lead defense counsel Barry Coburn variously described Interrogator # 1 ’s revelation as " repulsive " , " disturbing " , " racist " , " nauseous " and " offensive . "
He said he regarded it as a death threat levelled at Omar Khadr – " a 15 - year - old boy who had been wounded and was lying on a stretcher " – and that , as far as he was concerned , it amounted to torture .
A defence motion filed in March for this hearing argues for the military judge to rule inadmissible certain statements made by Omar Khadr in custody that the government has said it will use against him .
The motion argues that the statements should be suppressed because " they are the product of torture , involuntary , unreliable , do not serve the interest of justice , and are the fruit of the poisonous tree " .
In the press conference today , defense co-counsel Kobe Flowers added that Interrogator # 1 ’s statement went to the heart of the defense ’s contention that Omar Khadr ’s self - incriminating statements be excluded :
" The well was poisoned in this case back at Bagram – the prosecution ca n’t get away from it .
Interrogator # 1 brought that home to you today in full color . "
There can be little doubt that the prosecution case suffered a major blow today .
In its written filing in March in relation to the defence suppression motion , the government wrote that " the accused was not tortured ; nor subjected to cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment " .
At the hearing today , the prosecution did not contest Interrogator # 1 ’s account .
Post script : Four journalists covering the Khadr are reported to have been banned by the Pentagon from covering future military commission proceedings on the grounds that they had allegedly violated rules by naming Interrogator # 1 in their reporting .
The name of the former US Army Sergeant has long been in the public realm .
US officials , along with their British and French allies , made a very public point of storming out of the UN General Assembly today as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad gave a speech calling for nuclear disarmament and complaining about US threats to launch a nuclear strike against Iran .
Ahmadinejad reiterated his support for a third party enrichment deal , and complained that US threats for a nuclear first strike should be seen as a violation of the non-proliferation treaty ( NPT ) .
He also urged non-signatories to join the NPT .
In her own speech afterwards , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton angrily condemned Ahmadinejad for his “ wild accusations , ” and claimed that Iran status as a member of the NPT was itself putting the whole treaty in jeopardy .
Clinton ’s claims are somewhat ironic , as the US threat to nuke Iran was made very publicly by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and others , while the claims about Iran ’s “ violations ” of the NPT have never included even a shred of publicly released evidence .
Spain is slashing 13,000 public sector jobs and freezing government wages as it rushes to push out austerity measures aimed at bringing its budget deficit under control .
More cuts are coming :
Telegraph :
Mr Zapatero was fleshing out the details of a € 15bn plan announced on Sunday for deeper spending cuts to reduce Spain 's deficit from 11.2 pc of GDP last year to 9.3 pc in 2010 , and eventually to 3 pc in 2013 .
Spain eased out of recession with 0.1 percent growth in first quarter compared to the preceding quarter , the government statistics ' office said in a preliminary report Wednesday .
Regional governments will also be asked to make € 1.2bn in savings from their budgets and the Spanish Cabinet would vote on cuts and 2011 budget spending on Friday , he said .
Spain is teetering on the brink of a double dip , given that it barely even qualifies for having come out of recession .
It just grew 0.1 % after the ugly streak below .
Cutting jobs , financial support for civilians , and freezing wages puts the nation at substantial risk of re-entering ( continuing ? ) recession .
Yet not pushing through real austerity risks a financial crisis due to budget deficits growing the nation 's total debt .
Even if European support allows for cheaper borrowing costs , the budget deficits need to be fixed and absent exceptional GDP growth there 's only one way -- cutting spending and social support , which is unfortunately negative to GDP growth in the near term even if likely positive in the longer - term .
Thus it 's clearly a tricky situation , hopefully they continue with the current path of austerity and solve the nation 's long - term budget problems , rather than simply delay things for fear of a near - term double dip .

In BLONDES and in this post I write about the so - called “ cheating gene . ”
Not long ago , Hasse Walum , a handsome post - graduate at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , decided to study the association between a particular gene for what is called a vasopressin receptor and relationship stability .
He analyzed the responses of over 550 twins and their partners to questions , some of them intrusive , about their relationships :
How often do you kiss your mate ?
“ Have you ever regretted getting married / moving in ? ” “ Have you discussed a divorce or separation with a close friend ? ” “ Rate your degree of happiness in your relationship on a scale of 1 - 7 . ”
Walum then sampled the men ’s DNA .
Getting DNA from the men was simple .
You do n’t need blood to have access to another person ’s genome , just saliva , which the men submitted in a mouth swab .
What Walum discovered was stunning .
Focusing on one particular vasopressin receptor gene variant , allele 334 , he found that the more copies of it a man had , the weaker his bond with his partner .
Men who lacked the gene variant were generally happiest in their relationships — only 15 percent of them had a crisis .
Men with one copy were slightly more likely to have marital problems .
And men with two copies were , on average , twice as likely to have had a relationship crisis in the past year than men who did n’t have the variant — meaning that 34 percent of them , or one in three , were headed toward a break up .
Their partners agreed .
Women whose partners carried one or two copies of the allele 334 variant were generally less satisfied with their men , probably because they generally scored as less affectionate than other guys .
Walum also found that men with two copies of the variant were nearly twice as likely not to marry their partners and mothers of their children as men who had no copies of the variant .
This suggests that there is something slightly different about the vasopressin receptors in the brains of men who struggle in their roles as partners and fathers .
These men may have more difficulty bonding with other people , including their wives and kids .
I imagine that some of you are now scheming to get an allele 334 test for your man .
Of the more than five hundred women who responded to my online poll on this topic , nearly 65 percent said they would test their man if given the option .
And now you can .
Yes , you can order a saliva test for allele 334 of the AVPR1A gene for $ 99 from Genesis Biolabs .
( I ca n’t vouch for the lab .
I ’m reporting for entertainment purposes . )
Ladies , there ’s a caveat here , of course .
Even if there ’s a correlation between this particular gene variant and a man ’s behavior , it does n’t account for all men .
Just as the “ god gene ” and “ gay gene ” are met with skepticism in the scientific community , so is the “ cheating gene . ”
Even within Walum ’s study , there were men with two allele 334 variants who were happy husbands and fathers , and there were men without the variant who were miserable in their relationships .
The statistics apply to populations , not individuals , who are also influenced by a other factors — parental role models , partner choice , opportunity to cheat , past loves , age , life satisfaction , religion , hormone levels , and so on .
A two - allele man may become a number one husband under the right circumstances .
But it ’s your call .
Swab him and then decide ?
Expect more oil for the next 10 weeks
Get ready for more chemicals
A chemical attack on America
( Natural News ) BP officials have announced today that the " top kill " effort to stop the Gulf oil leak has failed .
Unanticipated problems doomed the project , which involved trying to pump tens of thousands of gallons of mud , shredded rubber tires and other " junk " into the hole to try to halt the outflow of oil .
At 6 pm Saturday evening , BP officials announced the " top kill " effort had failed and now they were moving on to another plan ( more below ) .
I am on site at the Gulf Coast right now , and while I have n't reached the areas where oil is washing up on the beaches , I 'm learning some interesting information nonetheless .
In particular , finding a hotel room anywhere near New Orleans has become virtually impossible , as BP has rented out virtually every available hotel room from St. Charles , Louisiana all the way to Pensacola , Florida .
( I am currently staying in a fleabag hotel that miraculously has internet access ... )
But it raises the question :
Where are all these people ?
I have n't seen a single BP person anywhere , and I was out on some beaches today filming editorial segments for NaturalNews .
I did see some small watercraft laying out protective barriers , but I did n't see any BP people anywhere .
I 'll keep you posted on what we find tomorrow as we approach the beaches to the East of New Orleans .
Now that the top kill effort has failed , it means .
That 's when two " pressure release " wells are expected to be completed .
The purpose of these two wells is to siphon off the oil from underneath the ocean bed , thereby releasing the pressure that 's currently pushing crude oil out of the existing hole under the doomedrig .
This " plan C " effort remains extremely risky , of course .
There 's no guarantee it will work at all .
And if it fails , this " volcano of oil " could continue to pollute the Earth 's oceans for .
This could , in fact , be theI warned about in an earlier story about this BP oil spill .
( https://www.naturalnews.com/028805_Gulf_of_Me...
We could be looking at a global - scale environmental catastrophe that destroys virtually all marine life in the Gulf of Mexico and takesto fully recover .
It 's really that bad .
If they can't stop this volcano of oil in the next week , we could be looking at the single most destructive environmental catastrophe ever to strike our planet since the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs .
In the mean time , now that the top kill effort has failed , BP has announcedinto the massive oil plumes that remain deep under the surface of the Gulf of Mexico water .
This meansthat will kill more forms of marine life throughout the Gulf .
But it 's not just aquatic life that 's being threatened by these chemicals : complaining of symptoms like vomiting , dizziness , difficult breathing and others .
The obvious cause of such symptoms is the huge amount of crude oil bubbling up to the surface ( some of which evaporates into the air ) along with the massive injection of chemical dispersants into the waters ( some of which also evaporates ) .
CNN is reporting that BP claims it is monitoring air quality , but so far BP has not gone public with any air quality test results .
None of the cleanup workers have been outfitted with chemical masks that might protect them from the volatile chemicals now present in the Gulf waters .
Yet CNN is reporting that the warning label on the chemical product made by NALCO states : " Avoid breathing vapor .
" The EPA , meanwhile , remains silent on this whole issue .
Remember :
It is the EPA that ordered BP to stop using its selected brand of chemical dispersant , but BP utterly ignored the EPA and continues to dump that very same chemical into the Gulf of Mexico right now .
What we are watching here , folks , is very nearlyon America by BP and the oil industry .
It 's hard to say what 's worse :
The oil or the chemical dispersants .
In fact , the answer to that question , and it can't even be studied by scientists because the disaster keeps growing by the day .
This is one environmental catastrophe that just keeps getting worse , and the cost to the marine ecosystem is .
And that 's not to even mention theto the region and all the people who depend on life in the Gulf of Mexico for their own livelihoods .
Their lives are now beingby this oil drilling catastrophe .
If there 's one lesson that comes from all this , it is a reminder of the Mother Nature provides us each and every day at no charge .
The VALUE of a healthy ocean is incalculable .
And the COST of killing it may be more than what human civilization can bear .
I suppose this resolves the whole question of what 's more important :
The environment or the economy ?
As we 're rudely discovering today ,
The whole world felt the reverberations of China imposing leverage limits on its banks .
Regulators there are clearly freaked out by the heat of its economy .
Meanwhile , Jim Chanos and Thomas Friedman are going back and forth about whether China is a bubble , and whether there 's money to be made shorting it .
So we thought we 'd adjudicate the question .
Our answer is yes , China 's real estate is the most obvious bubble ever .
More obvious than the Dubai bubble in fact .

Designer & Developer , Academia.edu 2008 - 2013 Academia.edu was my first venture into the startup life .
Being the only designer on the very small team , my responsibilities ranged from promotional design ( t - shirts , banners , business cards ) to designing the UX for how academics connect and share their work .
Being a small team and having some technical skills , I was put on the rotating list of on - call engineers .
So if the server went at 3 am in the morning and I happened to be on call , I 'd have to ensure to get some things back up .
During my time at Academia , I helped grow the community from a few thousand academics to well over 1 million .
Also helped work on a job board where we help prospective academics find work within their respective fields .

30/10 Survives the Metro Board of Directors
The Measure R map .
For a full sized version , check out The Transport Politic
Today , the Metro Board of Directors voted to endorse the 30/10 proposal , but for a long - time it did n’t look good .
All of the signs were there for a disaster …a highway sellout of " 30/10 , " the proposal to use federal loans to front - load construction of twelve transit projects funded in Measure R .
The forces of the status quo , AAA , a pair of CoG ’s and various chambers of commerce , were speaking of the needs of including highway projects in Measure R. Heck , even some transit advocates were willing to compromise some highway projects on the list in the name of the " greater good . "
Meanwhile , the Metro Board was n’t talking about pushing the best list of projects it could to get federal funds flowing quickly to L.A .
And while the Mayor was trying to frame 30 /10 debate in environmental terms on twitter , the idea that highways cause pollution was completely absent from the debate put forth by our elected leadership .
Sure , there were plenty of pro-30/10 comments , most notably from other transit advocates and the environmental movement .
NRDC and the Clean Air Coalition published a pair of blog posts and letter to the Metro Board arguing that wasting time and focus on highways undermines the spirit of Measure R. Even the Bus Rider ’s Union spoke up against the amendments , noting that it was " unfortunate the Board was aligning with highways to build more trains . "
A pair of pro-highway amendments were added to the proposal to formally endorse " 30 in 10 . "
One by Supervisor Mark Ridley - Thomas required Metro to also be pushing funds for " public - private partnership " projects in Washington , D.C. Another , by Supervisors Diane DuBois and Pam O’Connor , just flatly requires that highway project acceleration be made equally important to transit project acceleration in Washington , D.C .
Finally , Director Richard Katz , holding one of the Board positions appointed by Mayor Villaraigosa and the author of the resolution calling on Metro to back 30 / 10 spoke .
After accepting these amendments as " friendly , " he took the turn to speak about the proposal .
First , he made clear that he considered these motions to be in addition to 30 / 10 not part of it .
In other words , the project list being touted by the Mayor and other 30 /10 supporters would remain in - tact , and not be polluted by those favored by the highway lobby .
Second , he noted that if they were to be added to 30 /10 list , it would make everything much more difficult and could delay the whole thing .
You see , transit projects are funded differently than highway projects in D.C. , and Katz pointed out that , " the support in Washington is clearly on transit projects . "
If they change horses and add a new list , they could find themselves back at square one .
Despite the concerns by some that the highway projects would get left by the wayside , the Metro Board ultimately voted unanimously , minus the absent Don Knabe , to accept the proposal as amended .
It will be interesting to see how much energy is put into advancing the highway project timeline and how much of today ’s debate was just verbiage .
There were two interesting comments from the debate that deserve a little extra attention .
First , the lobbyist for the Automobile Club of Southern California , aka AAA , actually tried to couch the inclusion of highway projects in environmental terms .
Basically , they argue that L.A. County deserves a multi-modal 30 /10 not just one focused on " transit . "
Of course , a plan that involves light rail , heavy rail , bus and bus rapid transit is multi-modal , but I guess when you ’re the car - culture lobbyist , there are two modes : " cars " and " all that other stuff . "
The second is that one of the best arguments against cluttering 30/10 with highway projects came from one of the Board Members who authored the motion to make certain they were accelerated also : Santa Monica Council Woman Pam O’Connor .
O’Connor noted that " We ’re not building eight projects .
We ’re building a system . "
Why one would want to take projects off the list that would create the system and replace them with highway projects , which is what many people including myself , AAA , and all the pro-highway forces thought her amendment would do , is beyond me .
To hazard a guess : the personally car - free O’Connor was at war with the politician who wants to do what her constituency felt they needed in the South Bay .
But at the end of the day , the Board voted with one voice .
Boar Chair Ara Najarian boasted that when the Board is unified , " when we ’re going to Washington , they ’re scared of us . "
Whether they ’re scared enough to help L.A. County build the transit system it deserves remains to be seen .
KARACHI , Pakistan — American drone aircraft fired 18 missiles at militants in Pakistan ’s North Waziristan tribal region on Tuesday , killing at least 14 fighters and wounding 4 , a security official and a resident of the area said .
The missiles struck a region known as Datta Khel on the Pakistan - Afghanistan border where Taliban and Qaeda fighters prepare for operations against United States and NATO troops in Afghanistan .
The unusually intense drone attack was the third since a failed car bombing in Times Square 10 days ago .
Faisal Shahzad , a Pakistani - American charged in the attempted attack , has told American investigators that he visited North Waziristan to train with the Pakistani Taliban .
There was no indication that the strikes on Tuesday were retaliation for the bombing attempt .
The attack by the American drones , operated by the C.I.A. , appeared to be a continuation of the air campaign to degrade the capabilities of Al Qaeda , the Pakistani Taliban and the Afghan Taliban fighters now working together in North Waziristan .

A lawyer representing Wyatt has claimed the wild mushrooms caused him to act in such a violent way and had not control over his actions " My client was trying to silence the devil , " said James Fallman .
On July 23rd of 1939 , as tensions mounted in Europe following Germany ’s occupation of Czechoslovakia , Mohandas Gandhi , the famously non-violent leader of the Indian independence movement , wrote a letter to the man who was orchestrating what would become World War II : the leader of Nazi Germany , Adolf Hitler .
As it happens , Gandhi ’s letter — a clear and concise plea for Hitler to avoid war “ for the sake of humanity ” — never reached its intended recipient due to an intervention by the British government .
Just over a month later , the world looked on in horror as Germany invaded Poland , thus beginning the largest , most deadly conflict in the history of the world .

But I have resisted their request , because of the feeling that any letter from me would be an impertinence .
Something tells me that I must not calculate and that I must make my appeal for whatever it may be worth .
It is quite clear that you are today the one person in the world who can prevent a war which may reduce humanity to a savage state .
Must you pay that price for an object however worthy it may appear to you to be ?
Will you listen to the appeal of one who has deliberately shunned the method of war not without considerable success ?
Any way I anticipate your forgiveness , if I have erred in writing to you .
I remain , Your sincere friend M. K. Gandhi HERR HITLER

Still , accounting experts say the shadow financial system needs some sunlight .
“ How can anyone — regulators , investors or anyone — understand what ’s in these financial statements if they have to dig 15 layers deep to find these kinds of interlocking relationships and these kinds of transactions ? ” said Francine McKenna , an accounting consultant who has examined the financial crisis on her blog , re : The Auditors .
“ Everybody ’s talking about preventing the next crisis , but they ca n’t prevent the next crisis if they do n’t understand all these incestuous relationships . ”
The story of Lehman and Hudson Castle begins in 2001 , when the housing bubble was just starting to inflate .
That year , Lehman spent $ 7 million to buy into a small financial company , IBEX Capital Markets , which later became Hudson Castle .
From the start , Hudson Castle lived in Lehman ’s shadow .
According to a 2001 memorandum given to The New York Times , as well as interviews with seven former employees at Lehman and Hudson Castle , Lehman exerted an unusual level of control over the firm .
Lehman , the memorandum said , would serve “ as the internal and external ‘ gatekeeper ’ for all business activities conducted by the firm . ”

The deal was proposed by Kyle Miller , who worked at Lehman .
In the memorandum , Mr. Miller wrote that Lehman ’s investment in Hudson Castle would give the bank and its clients access to financing while preventing “ headline risk ” if any of its deals went south .
It would also reduce Lehman ’s “ moral obligation ” to support its off - balance sheet vehicles , he wrote .
The arrangement would maximize Lehman ’s control over Hudson Castle “ without jeopardizing the off - balance sheet accounting treatment . ”
Mr. Miller became president of Hudson Castle and brought several Lehman employees with him .
Through a Hudson Castle spokesman , Mr. Miller declined a request for an interview .
The spokesman did not dispute the 2001 memorandum but said the relationship with Lehman had evolved .
After 2004 , “ all funding decisions at Hudson Castle were solely made by the management team and neither the board of directors nor Lehman Brothers participated in or influenced those decisions in any way , ” he said , adding that Lehman was only a tenth of Hudson ’s revenue .

White had a night even worse than Strikeforce 's on Saturday night back in 2001

KELLER : Dana
White had a night even worse than Strikeforce 's on Saturday night back in 2001 DISCUSS ALL THIS IN OUR NEW MMATORCH FORUM ...OH , ONE MORE THING - PLEASE BOOKMARK US & VISIT DAILY !
Dana
White has been quick with harsh criticism of what a miserable night Strikeforce had on Sunday .
While it 's true it's tough to imagine an MMA promotion having a worse night , Dana White actually did back in September 2001 .
I was there with media credentials covering the event for the Torch .
I saw first - hand Dana White 's mood backstage go from nervous optimism to devastation and despair .
The event included not three , but five time limit draws , each of which was as boring as anything Strikeforce presented on Saturday .
Like Strikeforce 's show on Saturday , this event was as vital to the future of UFC as a viable company .
Like Strikeforce on Saturday , a main event did n't go as planned ( because of Vitor Belfort no -showing against Tito Ortiz at the last second , as opposed to the totally wrong person winning like on Saturday ) .
And just as Strikeforce ran long past it 's allotted timeslot , so did UFC .
However , it was worse for Dana
White because unlike CBS , which stuck with the event to the end , UFC 's main event was cut off by PPV providers before it ended .
While many demanded refunds , it did n't matter to many others , as fans were actually leaving the MGM Grand Arena during the boring main event 's final round .
So Dana can find a way to blame Strikeforce for the debacle on Saturday night , but his worst night may have been an even worse debacle .
The following is my original story on that event , with quotes from my conversations with White after the show .
HEADLINE : UFC 's anticipated return to PPV stage disappoints
By Wade Keller , MMATorch Supervising Editor
After several years off of cable television due to content issues and politics , UFC returned to national PPV penetration hoping to make a huge splash .
In January , the inept and cash - strapped Semaphore Entertainment sold UFC to the much more ambitious and capable Zuffa Entertainment , led by Lorenzo Fertitta .
Thanks in part to Fertitta 's history in Vegas , UFC ended up getting sanction in Vegas in a unanimous vote on July 27 .
UFC quickly booked two events for Vegas this fall .
The sanctioning of UFC by not only the Vegas commission , but also by the New Jersey State Athletic Control board earlier this year , paved the way for UFC to regain cable PPV clearance .
Several years ago , due to a variety of factors , UFC was taken off of cable PPV .
Sen .
John McCain led the charge against UFC and similar Mixed Martial Arts events , claiming the events were barbaric " human cock fights , " not sport .
The image was false , yet UFC 's fault .
Semaphore Entertainment had needlessly and recklessly promoted UFC after its first event in 1993 as a " no holds barred , " blood and guts spectacle , not sport .
Their short - sighted marketing doomed them because politicians and image - conscious cable executives used UFC 's words against them .
Finally , with an established eight - year safety record of no major injuries , a set of rules that commissions could live with , a new ownership group , and a starving PPV industry suffering from the demises of WCW and ECW , UFC was back in the game .
UFC had struggled to survive with a small budget during the lean years when only DirecTV carried their events , meaning less than 10 percent of the PPV universe could order UFC .
Now the new owners were pouring money into the events resulting in much better production values , including ring entrances that rival those of the WWF .
They hoped the cable PPV buys would more than return their investment .
Coming off of a string of several outstanding and entertaining events , UFC hoped they would continue the streak last Friday for their first event in years on cable PPV .
Instead , they were devastated by a string of bad luck events .
All five PPV matches ( for complete results , see pg. 10 ) ended via decision rather than knock out .
That had never happened in UFC history .
What 's worse , the time limit draws were below - average in terms of excitement and intensity .
The sellout crowd in Vegas , paying between $ 30 and $ 300 per seat , booed during the two main events .
There was a steady , embarrassing flow of spectators leaving the arena during the final round of the main event .
The fans knew it'd be a draw ; they knew Tito Ortiz , the charismatic champ , would win via decision .
There was no need to stick around .
UFC reasonably expected to have a much larger audience than at any time in recent years , and they were eager to show off their improved product .
The production values were excellent , but the matches were n't .
Adding to their troubles , because every match went to a draw , the event ran longer than the allotted three hour PPV window .
That meant many , if not most , cable systems cut off the event before the final round of the main event started .
Already stinging from a major boxing PPV event being moved to the night after their event due to the attacks of Sept. 11 and the marketable main event challenger Vitor Belfort suffering an arm injury just days before the event , now many of those who did order the event would be requesting refunds due to missing the finish of the main event .
If there was a minor blessing , it was that the main event was so lackluster that many viewers may not have cared .
UFC targeted 100,000 buys as their break - even number .
With the boxing event competing for PPV dollars that weekend , the chances of reaching that goal were diminished .
" We are devastated , " UFC president Dana White told the TORCH after the post - event press conference .
" We really wanted to impress new viewers .
We had four great events leading up to this event .
We did everything right , or so we thought .
You just can't expect that every fight is going to be a draw .
You can't control it , but you do n't expect it , either . "
White said they were aware of the time problems heading into the final two matches .
" We had a lot of stuff planned that we cut , but it was n't enough .
We still ran eight minutes long , " he said .
White was clearly dejected after the event .
He had lobbied for prominent national sports and boxing writers to cover the event .
He said several of those writers came up to him and told him the event was terrible .
He said he hopes they give UFC another chance .
UFC does get a chance to redeem themselves quickly as they return to PPV in just a few weeks with the Nov. 2 UFC High Voltage event , headlined by Pedro Rizzo getting a title rematch against UFC Heavyweight Champ Randy Couture .
Their last match earlier this year was very close , and very exciting , ending with a judge 's decision in Couture 's favor .
After the fight Rizzo said he thought he deserved the win .
None of the fighters at " UFC : Victory In Vegas " had anything to complain about other than their performances .
Tito Ortiz told fellow fighters just before the post - event press conference began that his main event opponent , Vladimir " The Janitor " Matyushenko , " held on for dear life " during their fight , relegating action to a monotonous stalemate .
" Vlad stopped a lot of things I tried to do , " Ortiz said at the press conference .
" I got cut for the first time .
I saw blood .
This was also the first time I have ever felt tired . "
He said he attempted several times to finish The Janitor , but his defense was too good .
There were big roadside billboards in Vegas promoting Ortiz vs. Belfort .
Matyushenko was moved into the main event against Ortiz just days before the event after his scheduled opponent , Kevin Randleman , also suffered a last - second injury .
" Tito was more prepared than I was , " Matyushenko said .
" He had a lot to lose .
More than me .
I thank Tito for a great fight .
He 's the man . "
Dennis Hallman , whose fight against lightweight champ Jens " Little Evil " Pulver was the most anticipated of the night , acknowledged that his match was a letdown .
" It may not have looked like a fight out there , " he said , " but it was a fight .
He pushed me like I 've never been pushed before .
I hope you were n't disappointed .
There 's not gonna be a mismatch .
If you want to see the real deal , sometimes this is what happens . "
White said afterward that he could book mismatches to ensure knockouts , but he did n't want to compromise the sport .
" This was just a bad night , but those who watch us regularly know we 're better . "
Keller 's Analysis : UFC , like any everyday pro tennis match , hockey game , or even Super Bowl , can be boring .
This UFC illustrated why pro wrestling ended up becoming showbiz rather than legit competition 100 years ago .
Two evenly matched competitors who fear each other can defensively hold position on a mat inevitably .
Even with rounds , and stand - ups at the referee 's discretion , there was n't a satisfactory amount of action .
Give UFC credit , they care about the integrity of what they do .
This was not a crowd - pleasing event , yet the fighters defended what happened .
UFC president Dana
White flat out said he would not intentionally book one or two mismatches in the future just to give the mainstream , uninitiated fans the knockout they expect at a UFC event .
The fighters know wins and losses ultimately mean more than having exciting fights .
They are n't going to take risky chances for the sake of making a match more exciting .
If UFC were consistently as lackluster as this event , they would eventually have to consider manipulating the content of matches just to survive .
Luckily , that is n't necessary , as this UFC was an aberration , an exception to the rule .
Most recent UFC events had been outstanding , with the majority of the matches featuring edge - of - your seat excitement and either decisive or controversial decisions .
This event did n't have either during the PPV broadcast .
That 's too bad , and for those who saw their first UFC in five years , do n't walk away yet .
Try the next one , or get a tape of one of the last four .
UFC is so damn exhilarating when it's good - especially as you become more educated to the strategies and the background of the fighters - that it 's worth an occasional lackluster event ( just as is the case for fans of other pro sports ) .

UFC is so damn exhilarating when it's good - especially as you become more educated to the strategies and the background of the fighters - that it 's worth an occasional lackluster event ( just as is the case for fans of other pro sports ) .

At first glance you might mistake a bell - mouth spillway for a watery vortex into another dimension .
What can only be described as a giant hole in the water is actually a method for controlling the release of flows from a dam or levee into a downstream area .
These spillways help prevent floods from ‘ dam ’ - aging or destroying a dam .

SPILLWAYS
– A spillway is a structure used to provide for the controlled release of flows from a dam or levee into a downstream area , typically being the river that was dammed
– Spillways release floods so that the water does not overtop and damage or even destroy the dam .
Except during flood periods , water does not normally flow over a spillway
– In contrast , an intake is a structure used to release water on a regular basis for water supply , hydroelectricity generation , etc .
– Floodgates and fuse plugs may be designed into spillways to regulate water flow and dam height
– Other uses of the term “ spillway ” include bypasses of dams or outlets of a channels used during highwater , and outlet channels carved through natural dams such as moraines

BELL - MOUTH SPILLWAYS
– Some spillways are designed like an inverted bell so that water can enter all around the perimeter .
These uncontrolled spillway devices are also called : morning glory , plughole , glory hole , or bell - mouth spillways
– In areas where the surface of the reservoir may freeze , bell - mouth spillways are normally fitted with ice - breaking arrangements to prevent the spillway from becoming ice - bound

LADYBOWER RESEVOIR
– The images above are from the spillways located at the Ladybower Resevoir
– The Ladybower Reservoir is a large Y - shaped reservoir , the lowest of three in the Upper Derwent Valley in Derbyshire , England
– The River Ashop flows into the reservoir from the west ; the River Derwent flows south , initially through Howden Reservoir , then Derwent Reservoir , and finally through Ladybower Reservoir
– Its longest dimension is just over 3 miles ( 5 km ) , and at the time of construction it was the largest reservoir in Britain ( 1943 )

MONTICELLO DAM
– The Monticello Dam is a dam in Napa County , California , United States constructed between 1953 and 1957
– It is a medium concrete - arch dam with a structural height of 304 ft ( 93 m ) and a crest length of 1,023 ft ( 312 m )
– It contains 326,000 cubic yards ( 249,000 m³ ) of concrete .
The dam impounded Putah Creek to cover the former town of Monticello and flood Berryessa Valley to create Lake Berryessa , the second - largest lake in California
– The capacity of the reservoir is 1,602,000 acre•ft ( 1,976,000 dam³ ) .
Water from the reservoir is supplied mostly to the North Bay area of San Francisco
– The dam is noted for its classic , uncontrolled spillway with a rate of 48,400 cubic feet per second ( 1370 m³/s ) and a diameter at the lip of 72 ft ( 22 m ) .

[ [ nid:11967 ] ]
On Sunday , President Obama delivered the commencement address at Hampton University .
The President reflected on Hampton ’s history and the importance of education to Hampton ’s first students – escaped slaves – and this year ’s graduating class :
[ W]e meet here today , as graduating classes have met for generations , not far from where it all began , near that old oak tree off Emancipation Drive .
I know my University 101 .
There , beneath its branches , by what was then a Union garrison , about 20 students gathered on September 17th , 1861 .
Taught by a free citizen , in defiance of Virginia law , the students were escaped slaves from nearby plantations , who had fled to the fort seeking asylum .
And after the war ’s end , a retired Union general sought to enshrine that legacy of learning .
So with a collection from church groups , Civil War veterans , and a choir that toured Europe , Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute was founded here , by the Chesapeake –- a home by the sea .
Now , that story is no doubt familiar to many of you .
But it ’s worth reflecting on why it happened ; why so many people went to such trouble to found Hampton and all our Historically Black Colleges and Universities .
The founders of these institutions knew , of course , that inequality would persist long into the future .
They were not naïve .
They recognized that barriers in our laws , and in our hearts , would n’t vanish overnight .
But they also recognized the larger truth ; a distinctly American truth .
They recognized , Class of 2010 , that the right education might allow those barriers to be overcome ; might allow our God - given potential to be fulfilled .
They recognized , as Frederick Douglass once put it , that “ education … means emancipation . ”
They recognized that education is how America and its people might fulfill our promise .
That recognition , that truth – that an education can fortify us to rise above any barrier , to meet any test –is reflected , again and again , throughout our history .
President Barack Obama delivers the commencement speech at Hampton University in Hampton , Virginia , May 9 , 2010 .
May 9 , 2010 .
( Official White House Photo by Pete Souza )
The President noted that “ just as your education can fortify you , it can also fortify our nation , as a whole . ”
In order to compete in the global economy , Americans must close the achievement gaps that leave many African American and Hispanic students and students in poorer communities behind .
What ’s at stake is more than our ability to outcompete other nations .
It ’s our ability to make democracy work in our own nation .
Now , years after he left office , decades after he penned the Declaration of Independence , Thomas Jefferson sat down , a few hours ’ drive from here , in Monticello , and wrote a letter to a longtime legislator , urging him to do more on education .
And Jefferson gave one principal reason –- the one , perhaps , he found most compelling .
“ If a nation expects to be ignorant and free , ” he wrote , “ it expects what never was and never will be . ”
What Jefferson recognized , like the rest of that gifted founding generation , was that in the long run , their improbable experiment –- called America –- would n’t work if its citizens were uninformed , if its citizens were apathetic , if its citizens checked out , and left democracy who those -- to those who did n’t have the best interests of all the people at heart .
It could only work if each of us stayed informed and engaged ; if we held our government accountable ; if we fulfilled the obligations of citizenship .
The President closed with a tribute to civil rights leader Dr. Dorothy Height who passed away recently at the age of 98 .
Dr. Height was accepted to Barnard College in 1929 , but when the school realized she was not white , they refused to allow her to attend .
Undeterred , Dr. Height took her acceptance letter from Barnard to New York University where she was accepted and pursued her education .
Ms. Dorothy Height , a black woman , in 1929 , refusing to be denied her dream of a college education .
Refusing to be denied her rights .
Refusing to be denied her dignity .
Refusing to be denied her place in America , her piece of America ’s promise .
Refusing to let any barriers of injustice or ignorance or inequality or unfairness stand in her way .
That refusal to accept a lesser fate ; that insistence on a better life , that , ultimately , is the secret not only of African American survival and success , it has been the secret of America ’s survival and success .
So , yes , an education can fortify us to meet the tests of our economy , the tests of our citizenship , and the tests of our times .
But what ultimately makes us American , quintessentially American , is something that ca n’t be taught -– a stubborn insistence on pursuing our dreams .
Three Months to Contain Oil Spill ?
Created : May 03 , 2010 14:46 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
So say White House and BP officials , who warned today that it might be July before they ’re able to plug the leak that ’s spewing oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
The Washington Post reports :
BP chief executive Tony Hayward said Monday that “ the worst - case scenario is that we would need to contain this for two to three months whilst a relief well is drilled . ”
There are other , more timely scenarios being considered as well , the Post adds .
Speaking on the “ Today ” show , Hayward said the company is also trying two other ways to deal with the spill : using robotic submarines to seal off the leaks , a process that so far has not succeeded and that he described as “ like conducting heart surgery 5,000 feet beneath the sea ” ; or building containment domes — akin to the hood over a stovetop — that can be lowered onto three separate leaks and allow the oil to be captured and pumped to the surface .
The 74 - ton steel domes are being built and will be in the field within seven to eight days , officials said .
All sides agree that the BP will absorb all the costs of cleaning up the spill .
“ They are the responsible party , ” said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , according to the Post .
“ They are going to end up paying for the federal government ’s cost , for the states ’ and , most importantly , for the individuals and communities that are going to be most directly impacted . ”
Monster of the deep : Shocked oil workers catch TWO - AND - A - HALF - FOOT ' woodlouse '
This deep sea creepy - crawly gave oil workers a fright , after the unexpected visitor hitched a ride on a submarine sent from a rig in the Gulf of Mexico .
The beast normally lives 8,500ft under water and this specimen is thought to be the largest giant isopod ever found at this depth .
Questions were raised over its authenticity because of the release date of pictures - April Fool 's Day .
However experts have been quick to verify the find .
[ caption ]
What you lookin' at ?
The bathynomus giganteus , seen head on
‘ I 've seen the pictures , and they are real , and they really do get that big , ’ said Craig McClain , assistant director of science for the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in North Carolina .
' It 's definitely not an April Fool 's joke .
' It 's an isopod , ' McClain explained .
' It 's like the rolypolys or pillbugs that you find in your garden .
It 's the same group of animals .
' They 're really common in the deep water in the Gulf of Mexico , ' he added .
Called the Bathynomus Giganteus , it is a super - sized cousin of the humble woodlouse .
The one in this picture purports to be 2.5 ft long - an astonishing figure considering the average specimen if half that length .
Its legs are arranged in seven pairs , and its front two are able to manipulate and bring food to its four sets of jaws .
It is a scavenger that feeds on dead whales , fish and shrimp .
The species is abundant in the cold , deep waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and is a good example of deep - sea gigantism .
Many deep - sea crustaceans and invertebrates tend to be larger than their shallow - water counterparts .
It is not yet known whether this is due to the colder temperature , higher pressure or scarcer food resources .

This is no news – but still needs to be told .
NOAA can in many contexts come up with the hottest temperatures available .
Here we take a look at the European Sea Surface Temperatures as of 3 may 2010 .
NOAA vs. UNISYS , SST , Europe .
When I look at this compare , again and again I have to check if these SST are from the very same date , 3 may 2010 .
But they are .
Differences are immense to an extend where it hardly makes sense to look after the European SST ?
NOAA is hotter than UNISYS in for example these waters :
The Baltic Sea , The North Sea , The Caspian Sea ,
And in addition ,
The Black Sea has NOAA Approx .
3,5 K warmer than UNISYS , and
“ The NOAA hotspot area ” North of Scandinavia : NOAA Approx .
4 – 6 K warmer than UNISYS .
Is there a valid sound simple explanation for these great differences ?
In addition NOAA uses a colour scheme that makes Europe look as if surrounded by burning lava .
It ’s quite a difference to the impression you get when looking at the UNISYS graphic .
So which graphic is correct ?
For the Baltic , here ’s what the “ jury ” says , SMHI ( From Sweden ) has an updated SST for the Baltic Sea from exactly 3 may 2010 :
The 3 graphics agree reasonably for the Northern Baltic Sea , but for the rest of the Baltic Sea , SMHI shows in average around – 1,5 degrees Celsius anomaly .
Both UNISYS and NOAA show too warm temperatures , but NOAA far worse than UNISYS .
So , NOAA is around 2 K warmer in this area than SMHI – the best estimate .
Europe is not the only area where NOAA has warmer temperatures than UNISYS .
NOAA appears markedly warmer than UNISYS on the Northern Hemisphere – but a little colder than UNISYS in areas of the Southern Hemisphere :

Most people take precautions to wipe data off their computers ' hard drives before getting rid of them , but take note :
Most copy machines store a digital image of every document scanned or copied .

As explained by a CBS investigation ( see video above ) and highlighted by tech blog Digital Inspiration , the built - in hard drive of most photocopiers contains and stores this information to improve overall performance .
The catch is that it allows anyone access to anything ever scanned if they know how to , which turns into a huge security risk if you decide to get rid of the machine without wiping out the hard drive :
If a fraudster manages to pull out the disk from the photocopier , it can be a real " goldmine , " as he 'll probably find everything there from employee credit card numbers to resumes to faxes and much more .

Fortunately , most manufacturers provide exact instructions on how to clear this data , so check your machine 's manual before you get rid of it .

NORTHAMPTON , Mass .
—The victim has probably forgiven the woman who ran him down in a Northampton crosswalk .
The police have n't .
Police say a Pittsfield woman has been cited for running down Lord Jesus Christ as he crossed the street in Northampton .
Officers responding to Tuesday 's incident checked the 50 - year - old Belchertown man 's ID and discovered that , indeed , Lord Jesus Christ is his legal name .
He was taken to the hospital for treatment of minor facial injuries .
Police say 20 - year - old Brittany Cantarella was cited for failing to yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk .

I do n't see how the president 's position and popularity can survive the oil spill .
This is his third political disaster in his first 18 months in office .
And they were all , as they say , unforced errors , meaning they were shaped by the president 's political judgment and instincts .
There was the tearing and unnecessary war over his health - care proposal and its cost .
There was his day - to - day indifference to the views and hopes of the majority of voters regarding illegal immigration .
And now the past almost 40 days of dodging ...

HB - SIA / Solar Impulse
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A huge airplane using solar cells as its only power source is being tested in Switzerland .
In its first successful test flight last December , the plane flew only 350 meters at a height of just one meter above the ground , but by mid 2010 it is expected to make a non - stop test flight of 36 hours , and to make the first ever night flights by a plane powered only by solar panels .
The single - seater plane , the HB - SIA , was built by Solar Impulse SA of Switzerland after a successful prototype was launched by adventurer Betrand Piccard in 2003 .
The wingspan of the HB - SIA ( 63.4 m ) is almost as wide as a Boeing 747 or Airbus A340 wingspan , and it is 21.85 meters long and 6.4 meters high .
Unlike a Boeing 747 , which has a maximum takeoff weight of over 333 tonne , the HB - SIA tips the scales at only 1.6 tonne .
The construction includes a customized honeycomb sandwich structure made of carbon fiber to keep the weight as low as possible .
This is a December 2009 test .
The plane is powered by four electric engines , with electricity provided by 11,628 SunPower Corporation photovoltaic ( PV ) cells mounted on the wings and horizontal tail area , giving a coverage of 200 square meters .
The cells are 150 micrometers thick and have a conversion efficiency of 22 % .
The average output of the engines is 6 kW ( maximum 7.5 kW , or 10 hp ) , which is around the same as the power used by the Wright Flyer flown by Wilbur and Orville Wright in 1903 .
The average flight speed of the HB - SIA is only 70 kilometers per hour .
To enable the plane to fly at night , the electricity generated by the PV cells is stored in a series of lithium polymer rechargeable batteries , weighing a total of 0.4 tonne .
The energy density of the batteries is around 220 Wh/kg .
Test pilot Markus Scherdel will carry out the first test flights to confirm the plane can be controlled , and to test its behavior in the air .
Risks are being minimized by a team of air controllers , meteorologists and other specialists , but the tests are unavoidably difficult and risky because the behavior in the air of such a lightweight but large plane is completely unknown .
After these tests two of the promoters , André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard , will also fly the plane to familiarize themselves with the aircraft .
Bertrand Piccard was the first to circle the globe non-stop in a balloon , beating Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson in the quest .
A larger plane , the HB - SIB , with a wingspan of 80 meters , is planned for either 2011 or 2012 , and will aim to circumnavigate the globe in 2013 using only solar power .
The trip is expected to take up to 25 days and include five stops .

After Saturday afternoon 's 2 PM game against Nashville , the Detroit Red Wings head to Philadelphia for a 12:30 PM EDT tilt against the Flyers on Sunday .
The Flyers sit tied with Boston for eighth place in The Eastern Conference with 82 points , two ahead of the 9th - place Rangers despite dropping a 1 - 0 decision to the Montreal Canadiens on Friday .
As such , Sunday 's game has serious implications for both the Flyers and Red Wings ( take note : Sunday 's game includes the Red Wings , ' " How many times did the NBC crew say ' Henrik Zetterberg ' " contest ) , and the Courier - Post 's Chuck Gormley summarized the Flyers ' situation bluntly in his game recap -- the Flyers essentially have to win out to make the playoffs :
Chris Pronger told NHL.com 's Adam Kimelman that his team 's 35 - shot effort sufficed , disappointing result included :
Osgood spoke to DetroitRedWings.com 's Michelle Crechiolo ( who received a
from the Monroe News's Niles Kruger today ) about his start :
A tiny doorway next to a BetFair shop in south London is the unassuming headquarters of Solarcentury , a company that arguably stands to gain most on 1 April when the feed - in tariff – or " great green rip - off " as some call it – comes into force .
The company , or at least its founder , is at the heart of the next phase of Britain 's low - carbon revolution by encouraging homeowners to fix panels on their roofs to generate renewable energy .
But while executive chairman Jeremy Leggett should have been devoting 24 hours a day preparing for the busiest period of his commercial life , he has been forced to spend some of his time fighting off an unexpected assault by environmentalists in the Guardian blogosphere .
The irony is that Leggett is an ex-Greenpeace employee and , as a former Imperial College geologist , a powerful and knowledgeable ally to the environment campaigners on a range of issues , including " peak oil " – the point when global demand outstrips supply .
The debate over whether the feed - in tariff costs too much for the expected carbon reductions rumbles on but even this " social entrepreneur " , who has always enjoyed a good tussle with more traditional foes , admits he has had enough of swapping increasingly fraught online words with George Monbiot , Chris Goodall and other notable greens .
" It certainly perplexed me , " he said .
" If I did not know the individuals involved , I 'd have presumed that this is the nuclear industry pushing back at a time of imminent possible success for the renewables industries .
They [ atomic power firms ] have declared a form of war , with EDF and E.ON having this line to government that says ' You can have nuclear or you can have renewables , but you can't have both ' , when previously they argued you could have both .
" But I know the actors [ environmentalists ] so I know it is not possible [ for them to be nuclear lackeys ] , but George and Chris must know how damaging it is at this time .
At the very minimum it is annoying that George has come out with this heady rhetoric , yet as far as I know did not actively engage in the government 's long consultation on the issue . "
A third career
The bruising public blog encounters and equally robust private email exchanges have taken the gloss off what should have been an exciting time for a company such as Solarcentury , which has a 50 % share of the domestic market .
Has public confidence been eroded by the argument ?
" No , the phone lines have been ringing constantly and although the government has tailored the tariff for the domestic sector we are also getting interest from the commercial sector .
The tariffs just about work for commercial companies so we can expect growth in that market as well , I think .
So it 's very encouraging . "
This is in many ways what Leggett has been waiting for since 1999 , when he set up Solarcentury wanting to do something very practical about climate change after six years of campaigning on it for Greenpeace .
He likes to think of it as his third " career " following a period of academia at Imperial College .
From next week homeowners installing typical 2.5 kilowatt solar panels could earn up to £ 1,000 through selling clean power back to their electricity companies or reducing their own electricity bills , government claims .
Leggett disputes Monbiot 's assertions that the whole cost of the scheme to the public will be in the region of £ 8.6bn and represents a tax on the poor , who will end up paying for the tariff in higher bills .
But he gives some ground to critics who worry that the feed - in tariff will become some kind of magnet to unscrupulous businessmen trying to sell poor - quality products to poorly advised homeowners trying to go green .
" We are really careful about who we do business with , and all the products have to be checked through the government 's micro-power certification scheme , as it does elsewhere and which costs us £ 250,000 annually worldwide .
" We are very well aware of what can happen and that the industry is only as strong as its weakest link .
I am optimistic that industry and government can work together to shut out the cowboys in a way that the double - glazing and solar thermal sectors have singularly failed to do historically .
I say that with fingers crossed . "
But he also expects an influx of larger companies from the US and elsewhere that could push down prices for users and give Solarcentury – now partly owned by a large utility , Scottish & Southern Energy – a run for its money .
So how much of the public cash being injected into this new initiative will stay in Britain ?
Solarcentury , which provides builders and others with panels but also undertakes its own projects , says it sources materials all over the world but half the products it uses are assembled at a Sony - owned plant in south Wales .
Leggett has also crossed swords with Monbiot over the latter 's claim that it is an " impossible dream " to build up a proper British renewables products industry given the competition from low - cost areas such as China : " I say that is needless defeatism because the global market is pitifully small .
Seven gigawatts of solar was installed last year , the equivalent of seven nuclear power plants , and to think we cannot catch up and have a fully integrated national industry is needless defeatism . "
And this is an area where Leggett 's scary view about the world running out of oil much faster than anyone expects neatly gels with the need to promote a self - standing renewables sector .
" Security of energy supply is going to be a real issue so should we not be deliberately building a vertically integrated renewables industry on the British Isles ?
I think the world is going to change dramatically and globalisation , of necessity , is going to be massively set back by the unaffordability of oil , so trade routes are going to shrink and there is going to be an incredible explosion of independent thinking .
" Companies and governments are going to think much more than they do now about this .
We need to be making much more stuff at home .
We can't be dependent on markets far overseas . "
Leggett has pushed the peak oil debate on to the political agenda by getting an increasingly broad church of industrialists – such as Sir Richard Branson , Brian Souter of Stagecoach , and Philip Dilley of Arup – to come on board .
The bandwagon seems finally to have made its impact on the UK government , which is softening its former position that peak oil was being over - hyped .
He still enjoys campaigning .
He was in Copenhagen for the climate change talks ( boasting about travelling there by boat , not plane ) and even at the Oxford Literary Festival , arguing the toss on nuclear power .
He has written three books about energy and climate change and you have to wonder if , in his mid-fifties , he has yet another " last career " left in him .
and retreats to the executive chairmanship of the company he founded .
Understandably , if this son of a science teacher from Hastings who now lives off Holland Park in central London has thought about it , he is not going to muse on that to the media .
Leggett admits the only other job he really wanted was a professional golfer – but that was at the age of 17 and today it 's hard to imagine this green on the green .

But this bill , the cap - and - trade bill , was strongly criticized by hardcore environmentalist wackos because it supposedly allowed more offshore drilling and nuclear plants , nuclear plant investment .
So , since they ’re sending SWAT teams down there , folks , since they ’re sending SWAT teams to inspect the other rigs , what better way to head off more oil drilling , nuclear plants , than by blowing up a rig ?
I ’m just noting the timing here .
( Emphasis Corley's )
Today , Faux News follows Limbaugh 's lead , even hinting that the Obama Administration may have been involved .
First , former Bush Spokesidiot Dana Perino asks the question .
Corley :
On Fox and Friends this morning , former Bush Press Secretary Dana Perino said she was " not trying to introduce a conspiracy theory " before asking , " But was this deliberate ? "
" If there was sabotage involved , " wondered Perino .
And here 's the Media Matters video :
Then , Faux Business 's Eric Bolling lets loose .
The quote , again with Corley 's emphasis :
The question is , and I saw Dana Perino earlier on the show saying , you know , what , why the delay in the response .
You guys were pointing out , nine days before it ’s even addressed .
Twelve days before he made a formal comment .
The question is did they let this thing leak ?
I mean , I know BP said 1,000 barrels a day went to 5,000 .
Did they let it leak a little bit and say , " boy I do n’t know . "
I mean , the conspiracy theorists would say , maybe they let it leak for a while and then they address the issue .
The conspiracy theorists would say .
Nudge , nudge , wink , wink .
Notice his facial expression and demeanor .
The Media Matters video :
As Corley points out , BP says it was a faulty piece of equipment , and it was Halliburton that was cementing the well , at the time of the disaster .
But Dana Perino and Faux want you to consider other possibilities .
And as always , with Faux News , the facts be damned .
FBCMD ( R.I.P. )
April 30 , 2015
The FBCMD ( Facebook Command Line Interface ) project is no longer active .
You can still find the lukewarm corpse of the project at the links below .
I stared this project in 2007 , when both facebook and I were very different .
I am now raising a family and have a demanding job .
When I do get precious " free " time , there are other projects I 'd rather spend my time on .
I stopped using FBCMD myself .
I log in to facebook once a week and lurk around for a bit , but I rarely interact or share anything .
myself .
I log in to facebook once a week and lurk around for a bit , but I rarely interact or share anything .
Facebook is moving away from apps that have broad access and permissions .
It was too frustrating to keep up with facebook perpetually depricating features and changing its API .
The straw (s ) that broke the camel 's back were : depricating API 1.0 , removing offline_access and changing the authentication model .
I want to thank the thousands that used FBCMD , the hundreds of people who sent kind words my way , and the dozens of people who contributed .
I have over 300 email messages in a " fbcmd - todo " folder that I will probably never " do " .
My sincerest apologies .

FBCMD Still exists on the internet :
Despite moving at a snail ’s pace on most policy decisions , the Obama Administration was still able to muster surprising alacrity when it came down to providing Israel with additional money .
So exactly one week after President Obama decided that the US should provide Israel with an extra $ 205 million in military aid to pay for its “ Iron Dome ” missile defense system , the House of Representatives passed the measure , with a 410 - 4 margin .
The first phase of development , test runs , and manufacture of the system is expected to cost NIS 800 million , meaning the US funding will pay for materially all of this phase .
The $ 205 million is above and beyond the roughly $ 3 billion in military aid the US sends to Israel annually .
House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman said the vote was vital , citing “ the looming threat of a nuclear - armed Iran . ”
Of course it could be pointed out yet again that America ’s own National Intelligence Estimate shows Iran having no such program , but in this case it does n’t even matter .
The Iron Dome system is intended for “ very short range ” rocket fire , primarily the intermittent rockets from the Gaza Strip that hit open fields in southern Israel , and would be completely useless against any missile from as far away as Iran , nuclear or otherwise .
In fact , this was one of the major reasons Israel was seeking the money , as many questioned the wisdom of spending $ 50,000 per missile to shoot down commodity rockets that cost only a few hundreds dollars apiece , and the Israeli military declined to include the project in its own budget .
The four Representatives voting against the resolution were John Conyers ( D – MI ) , Dennis Kucinich ( D – OH ) , Ron Paul ( R – TX ) , and Pete Stark ( D – CA ) .
There 's a touching scene in " The Dildo Diaries , " a sweet ' n ' slippery little documentary released way back in 2002 , in the very beginnings of the Dark Days of Bush , in which we as viewers are privy to a truly hellish hallucination , a series of images that , should you ever choose to bear witness , will haunt you for the rest of your days .
Even now , I believe it is one of the most frightening scenes ever put to film .
Far more repellant , in its way , than images of thousands of dead birds in the Gulf , than KFC meat - like garbage food , than the slasher porn of " Saw IV . "
We are shown , via actual footage , a typical workday inside the Texas state legislature .
Oh my sweet Jesus with stockroom.com gift card , you have never seen such discomfort , such moral claustrophobia , such unchecked legislative dorkage .
The setting is exactly as you might expect :
An ungainly , horribly dressed room somewhere in Austin , packed like chunky beef tallow with good ol ' boy Texas manhood , a veritable cattle call of mostly older , largely clammy males and a scattershot assortment of nonplussed females , all ambling about with very few qualities resembling intellectual acumen , subtlety , grace .
Does that sound harsh ?
Unsympathetic ?
I do n't mind .
The scene in question focuses on a very weird , amusing little debate on the House floor .
The combatants are trying to decide , awkwardly , laughably , horrifyingly , the issue of whether heterosexual sodomy -- good ol ' anal sex -- should be banned outright , right along with then - illegal homosexual sodomy , which in turn was a fine adjunct to the state 's classic chestnut - of - a - law declaring that it was completely illegal to be gay in Texas .
The scene has become rather justifiably famous for its comedy -- and for the play - by - play commentary supplied by the late , great Molly Ivins -- as we get to watch these Texas lawmakin ' menclods chortle and guffaw , blush and howl , shuffle their feet and punch themselves in the face in confusion as words about anal sex and " even if it slips " fly about the room like exotic birds they all claim to fear but which secretly fantasize about capturing , taking home and cuddling with for as long as possible .
That scene gave me nightmares .
Still does .
Fast forward nearly a decade .
I am right now imagining no less a lurid , brutal scenario taking place over in the Oklahoma state legislature , equally surreal and lacking in grace , but unfortunately not the slightest bit absurd or funny , insofar as it is far more threatening to -- and threatened by -- sex and female power .
To this particular scene , to this roomful of angry , sad , Bible - thumping women and men , I am adding in a large farm animal , various pitchforks , some violent self - flagellation , a burning witch or two , assorted spitting , and a great deal of hatred and pain .
And why should n't I ?
Why not allow such cliché and violent stereotyping ?
For this drama is about nothing as benign as watching Texas dolts blunder on about where man should or should not be allowed to insert a penis .
This is something far uglier .
This is about how the Oklahoma state legislature , as previously mentioned but not nearly sufficiently disgraced in this very column , has forced through three of the most appalling anti-choice , anti-woman , anti-motherhood laws in modern history .
One would require women seeking an abortion to fill out an exhaustive , 20 - page questionnaire about all aspects of her personal life , which would be then given to a government agency for " analysis " and posted online .
Another would force them to get an ultrasound and listen to a detailed description of the fetus before getting the procedure .
Another would encourage doctors to lie to expecting mothers .
Still another would tie women to a pickup truck and drag them screaming through the streets for ever daring to have a vagina in the first place .
I might be exaggerating that last one .
But not by much .
It is not for this space to delineate all the ways these laws are an obvious abomination .
( There were actually eight abortion - related laws slithering through OK 's legislature .
The state 's Democratic governor , Brad Henry , has only vetoed three of them .
Each time , the Oklahoma legislature overrode his vetoes ) .
Here is where we all offer up a collective cringe and recoil .
Here is where we suggest , only barely jokingly , that if you live in Oklahoma , if you have a vagina and like to use it , if you are at any point hoping to expand your horizons and enjoy your body and celebrate feminine godhood in any way whatsoever , you should be packing your bags as soon as possible .
Get the hell out .
Now .
Simple , really .
The question thusly hovers : Should you even care about these laws ?
Do they matter ?
Perhaps not .
Perhaps it really makes no difference .
For one thing , in every civilized , educated city and state in the land , a woman 's right to choose is ironclad and permanent , obvious and guaranteed .
It 's true .
Despite all the hue and cry , the pule and desperation of the fundamentalist right , the hard truth remains :
If Bush and his army of misogynistic darkness could n't destroy
Roe when the ultraconservative right was at its most dominant , it will never happen .
What 's more , Oklahoma 's new laws are already moot : it 's considered a foregone conclusion that they 'll be deemed hotly unconstitutional by the courts , and summarily tossed ( it 's happened before ) .
So why bother ?
What to make of it ?
Perhaps just this : I think Oklahoma is notable mostly in relief , in contrast , as a reminder of how far the rest of the nation -- and much of the developed world -- has come , and just how backwards and archaic are a few lingering hunks of these inelegant Disunited States .
As gay marriage stumbles toward widespread acceptance , as the U.S. military will soon allow gays to openly serve , as women continue to achieve position and respect once only dreamed of , as we just recently came within inches of America 's first female president , so we must acknowledge the weakest links , the dank underbelly , the Jungian dark side with which we all must contend .
We must never forget .
There is no light without dark .
There is no understanding the beauty and inherent divinity of the human animal without understanding its more shameful , malnourished cretins .
And there is no appreciating progress without appreciating the stagnation and spiritual ignorance from whence it escaped .
So I suggest we offer up a moment of gratitude to Oklahoma ( and Arizona , and Kansas , and Nebraska , et al ) for reminding us of exactly that fact : that the grand dance , the eternal struggle of enlightenment over ignorance never really ends .
The Great Work is never finished .
Spiritually incompetent or no , their cries echo even now , and will continue to do so into the future .
But with any luck , as generations fall and new understanding emerges , the wails of ignorance and misogyny will slowly get fainter , until one day they simply fade away completely .

Alabama Attorney General
said tonight that he has told representatives of
. that they should stop circulating settlement agreements among coastal Alabamians .
The agreements , King said , essentially require that people give up the right to sue in exchange for payment of up to $ 5,000 .
King said BP 's efforts were particularly strong in Bayou La Batre .
The attorney general said he is prohibited from giving legal advice to private citizens , but added that " people need to proceed with caution and understand the ramifications before signing something like that .
" They should seek appropriate counsel to make sure their rights are protected , " King said .
By the end of Sunday , BP aimed to sign up 500 fishing boats in Alabama , Mississippi and Florida to deploy boom .
BP had distributed a contract to fishermen it was hiring that waived their right to sue BP and required confidentiality and other items , sparking protests in Louisiana and elsewhere .
Darren Beaudo , a spokesman for BP , said the waiver requirement had been stripped out , and that ones already signed would not be enforced .
" BP will not enforce any waivers that have been signed in connection with this activity , " he wrote in an e-mail .
But King said late Sunday that he was still concerned that people would lose their right to sue by accepting settlements from BP of up to $ 5,000 , as envisioned by the claim process BP has set up .
The attorney general said he is prohibited from giving legal advice to private citizens , but added that " people need to proceed with caution and understand the ramifications before signing something like that . "
" To the best of my knowledge BP did not ask residents of Alabama to waive their legal rights in the way that has been described , " Beaudo said .

Bill Gates is known for many things : he helped kick start the personal computer revolution ; he is a maverick software developer ; he founded one of the biggest companies in the world ; and he is the richest person on planet Earth .
In recent years , however , Gates has rebranded himself from a software and technology tycoon to a humanitarian and philanthropist .
One of his biggest projects in recent years is to raise the educational and living standards of students all across the world .
Whether it be students in his home country of the United States or the students in third - world , developing nations , Bill Gates has a strong belief that education and access to education is the way to better humanity .
Improving Literacy Rates Worldwide
Recent studies show that learning to read even as late as your 30s can significantly improve brain cognition , which shows improving literacy rates is n’t just something we should focus on for children .
Not only do improved literacy rates produce a huge practical benefit to a population , but they also improve the individual ’s brain cognition — for all age groups .
It is no doubt that the Gates Foundation has seen similar studies showing the benefits of such reading skills , which explains why the Foundation is such a supporter of reading and writing skills .
Whether you want to learn basic writing skills , basic reading skills , or advanced usage topics , the Gates Foundation seeks to help students globally .
Efforts in the United States
While the Gates Foundation is active all across the globe , let ’s focus on some of the educational projects it has here in the United States .
Since Bill Gates comes from a business background , it should n’t be surprising that he is results - driven .
What this means in practice is that he and the Foundation do n’t necessarily mind shaking up things in the educational establishment .
This has led those from both sides of the educational debate to criticize him and his efforts .
His support for Common Core has caused outcries from those on the right , and his support of charter schools has caused outcries from those on the left .
In short , he wants to see results and does n’t want to get bogged down in the process .
In order to get kids reading and writing better , they need to learn the basics .
This means instruction of basic grammar , word usage , and the like .
If a high - school senior ca n’t tell the difference between loss and lost , how can they be expected to write a coherent resume ?
This is a serious problem taking place in American schools right now .
One of the most basic things in education , learning to read and write , our schools cannot teach .
In large urban areas , upwards of 90 percent of students are not proficient in reading .
Again if a student can’t read , how can we expect him or her to write ?
Students writing skills have been declining for years .
Forget tricky parts of the language like allude versus elude , these students can’t even write basic sentences .
This is why Bill Gates and his foundation are so passionate about raising literacy rates .
Language helps us communicate , better our lives , and enrich our souls .
Without it , we are destined to fail .
10 unnatural ways to calculate Fibonacci numbers
Posted byon May 30 , 2010
The task of calculating first dozen of Fibonacci numbers has lost its practical value ages ago .
Nowadays it 's used mostly for illustrating some basic programming techniques , recursion and iteration among them .
In this writeup I will use it to show several programming languages , in which it acquires uncommon and sometimes definitely unhealthy look .
So , here goes my rating of ten most unnatural ways to calculate Fibonacci numbers of the ones I used for Progopedia project .
For a more accurate definition , let 's demand that the program outputs first 16 numbers , formatted as
1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 , 89 , 144 , 233 , 377 , 610 , 987 , ...
A visual programming language , in which all language elements are represented as elementary blocks .
The " code " itself , called flowgram , is built from these blocks by connecting them with links .
What placed this language in the rating is :
the size of flowgrams : two dozens of blocks is a maximum that can be used within one flowgram without scrolling it or getting entangled in connections between blocks ;
the complexity of basic language constructs : each loop or conditional statement requires one or more separate flowgrams of description , and their numbers multiply endlessly ;
the fact that the program is not written but drawn , and the keyboard is used only for entering constant values , renaming elementary blocks and adding comments ;
and the way the flowgrams overall look like large bowls of spaghetti - talk about spaghetti code !
Main flowgram
Loop body
The specifics of this language ( up to version 4.4.0 ) are the absence of loops as such .
This is excusable - after all , gnuplot is not a general - purpose language but a graph plotting software .
A loop can be simulated by creating a separate file with loop body , which then should be " read " to start the loop and " reread " for each iteration .
run.gp ( main file )
#!/usr/bin/env gnuplot i = 1 a = 1 b = 1 res = '' load " fibonacci.gp " print res , '...'
fibonacci.gp ( loop body )
res = res .
a . ' , ' c = a a = b b = b+c i = i+1 if ( i <= 16 ) reread
Lazy evaluation along with infinite lists is one of the most widely known Haskell features .
In this case they allow to define ( but not to calculate yet ) Fibonacci numbers in one line of code .
The rest of code requests the required numbers and prints them in required format .
Haskell is nowhere near an esoteric or unpopular language , but still this approach is far from evident or natural for someone who was raised and educated within procedural paradigm .
module Main where import Text .
Printf fibs :: [ Int ] fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+ ) fibs ( tail fibs ) line n = printf " %d , " $ fibs !!
n main = do sequence_ $ map line [ 1 .. 16 ] putStrLn " ... "
SQL itself is not a programming language , and in most implementations it 's accompanied with procedural extension which makes the task trivial .
Let 's try to solve the task without using procedural extensions , in " pure " SQL .
Unfortunately , standard definition of " pure " SQL has nothing that can be used as a loop .
Thus the solutions turn out to depend on concrete implementation and its features .
7.1 . Oracle SQL ( since version 9i )
The innermost query generates numbers indices ( from 1 to 16 ) using level pseudo - column and connect by construct .
Next query calculates Fibonacci numbers themselves from their indices using Binet 's formula .
Two outermost queries order the numbers by their indices ( ascending ) and concatenate them in one string of required format .
SELECT REPLACE ( MAX ( SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH
( fib|| ' , ' , '/' ) ) , '/' , '' ) || '...'
FROM ( SELECT n , fib , ROW_NUMBER () OVER ( ORDER BY n ) r FROM ( select n , round ( ( power ( ( 1 +sqrt ( 5 ) ) * 0.5 , n ) - power (( 1 - sqrt( 5 ) ) * 0.5 , n ) ) / sqrt( 5 ) ) fib from ( select level n from dual connect by level <= 16 ) t1 ) t2 ) START WITH r= 1 CONNECT BY PRIOR r = r- 1 ;
7.2 . Oracle SQL ( since version 10 g )
A convenient but seldom used and thus little - known operator model allows implementing a loop inside of an SQL query .
select max ( s ) || ' , ... ' from ( select s from dual model return all rows dimension by ( 0 d ) measures ( cast ( ' ' as varchar2 ( 200 ) ) s , 0 f ) rules iterate ( 16 ) ( f[iteration_number ] = decode ( iteration_number , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , f[iteration_number - 1 ] + f[iteration_number - 2 ] ) , s[iteration_number ] = decode ( iteration_number , 0 , to_char ( f[iteration_number ] ) , s[iteration_number - 1 ] || ' , ' || to_char ( f[iteration_number ] ) ) ) ) ;
7.3 . MySQL
The means of calculating query results in a loop is implemented more compactly than in Oracle .
select concat ( group_concat ( f separator ' , ' ) , ' , ...' ) from ( select @f := @i + @j as f , @i := @j , @j := @f from information_schema.tables , ( select @i := 1 , @j := 0 ) sel1 limit 16 ) t
7.4 . Microsoft SQL Server ( since version 2005 )
Here comes one more rather compact loop implementation , this time using a recursive query .
with fibonacci( a , b ) as ( select 1 , 1 union all select b , a+b from fibonacci where b < 1000 ) SELECT cast ( a as varchar ) + ' , ' AS [ text ( ) ]
FROM fibonacci FOR XML PATH ( '' )
FP is a prototype of all existing programming languages which use function - level paradigm ( not to be confused with functional ) .
Created in 1977 , it is more of a math model than of a real language : it had no official standard ( except for one article , in which it was actually suggested ) , not to mention working interpreters !
However , nowadays there exists a number of FP interpreters , usually written as a student work .
One of them is Furry Paws , and its cozy name efficiently hides the inconvenience of using it .
Function - level programming states that the program is built from elementary functions , combined with function - to - function operations .
Thus , ~ 1 is an elementary function which always returns 1 ; id returns the value it accepted , and [ ] is a functional form which combines its arguments in a sequence .
one = eq.[id , ~ 1 ] dec = sub . [ id , ~ 1 ] seq = one -> [ ~1 ] ; cat.[seq.dec , [ id ] ] fibonacci = lt.[id , ~3 ] ->
~1 ; add.[fibonacci.sub.[id , ~1 ] , fibonacci.sub.[id , ~ 2 ] ] main = show .( return @fibonacci.( seq.~16 ) )
J is one more function - level language , a worthy successor of FP .
One of features of this language is that nearly every phrase in it can be written using several ways , from " almost traditional " to absolutely unnatural ( and that 's what is needed in this article ) .
Thus , for example , using Binet 's formula can be written quite nicely :
load ' printf ' g = : 0.5 * ( 1 + 5 ^ 0.5 ) fib = : ( 0.2 ^ 0.5 ) * ( g &^ - ( 1 - g ) &^ ) fstr= : '...' , ~ , ~^:4 '%d , ' fstr printf fib 1+i.16
Or you can replace all math operators with their J- specific equivalents :
load ' printf ' g = : -: > : %:5 fib = : ( % :5 ) %~ g&^ - ( 1 - g ) & ^ fstr = : '...' , ~ , ~^:4 ' %d , ' fstr printf fib " 0 >:i.16
And hardly anybody will think it evident that % : is square - rooting , > : is increment , - : is halving , and %~ is division , with dividend and divisor swapped .
Recursion - based calculation :
load ' printf ' fibr= : 1:`( - &2 + & fibr - &1 ) @. ( 2&<) " 0 fstr= : '...' , ~ , ~^:4 '%d , ' fstr printf fibr 1+i.16
A little - known esoteric language , interesting by its minimalism and usage of stack - based memory model .
Unlike next language , the trickiest part of programming is not executing math operations but extracting the contents of the stack elements needed on each step .
Printing results , however , is quite an unpleasant task , so only first six one - digit numbers are calculated and printed .

The classics of esoteric programming - Brainfuck , a language in which even assignment or addition is not an elementary operation , printing three - digit number deserves a separate ode , and using it for solving any practical task is masochist 's dream :-)
In original interpreter ( Muller 's Brainfuck ) memory cells are of type byte , so Fibonacci numbers starting from 14th would cause a memory overflow .
Implementing long arithmetic in Brainfuck is not a symptom but rather a diagnosis , so I assumed that a memory cell can store numbers up to at least 1000 ( a lot of implementations use data types capacious enough ) .

Language description and comments for the given code can be found at the page Brainfuck .
This is the simplest of graphical dialects of Brainfuck , invented by Lode Vandevenne .
The programs are read from PNG images , the commands are written as pixels of different colors , and the set of 8 Brainfuck commands is extended with two more which control the direction of pointer to the current pixel .
This language inherits all the delights of coding in Brainfuck and has some of its own , for example , absolute unreadability of the " code " and impossibility of coding without supplements like code - image converter .
Unfortunately , the original interpreter of the language sank into oblivion , so to generate this " program " I had to write a tool of my own .
The image is given in tenfold magnification .
Can it be worse ?
- the reader will think while scrolling the text with trembling hand .
Yes , it can .
In all mentioned languages the program could be at least viewed and envisioned , and that 's a lot .
Meet the winner of the rating - Unary .
This dialect of Brainfuck ( invented by Lode Vandevenne again ) requires that Brainfuck commands are converted to binary codes and concatenated into a single binary number .
Unary notation of this number is the code in Unary .

RAMALLAH , ( PIC ) -- Hiba Masalha , a Palestinian lawyer who visited child - prisoners at the Majedo and Rimonim prisons said that a number of them were subjected to barbaric torture before being questioned or charged .
Masalha said on Thursday that she met with 17 - year - old Ahmad Farouq Jaara from Nablus who was arrested on 14 January 2010 at the Za'tara roadblock .
He told her that he was subjected to a harsh interrogation at Betah Tekva detention centre where he was tied to a stool with both hands and feet tied .
He was interrogated and tortured for 21 days causing his health to deteriorate .
She also met with 16 - year - old Salama Abdel - Jawad from the Askar refugee camp who was arrested at the Hamra roadblock on 14 February 2010 .
He told her that on his arrest the soldiers kicked and beat him mercilessly using rifle butts bruising him all over and causing him to bleed from the face and legs .
She also said that Mahmoud Yaziji , 16 years , from Beit Hanoun in the Gaza Strip , told her that he was arrested at the Erez crossing by special forces who beat him severely , causing bruises all over his body .
He was detained for one whole night at the crossing before he was taken to Askalan prison .
Meanwhile , 16 - year - old Atef Jaradat , from Sair , in al - Khalil told the lawyer that IOF troops arrested him on 2 February 2010 him to the Keryat Arba settlement where he spent one night .
He was then taken to Atsion detention centre where he was interrogated while tied to a stool in the cold and under the rain , during the interrogation an interrogator going by the name of Imran , beat him on his face , his arms and legs , then gave him electric shock making him fall each time he was subjected to the electric shock .
He is also being denied family visits since his arrest .
Masalha also met with Muhammad Rashid Abu Shahin ( 16 years ) , from the Balata refugee camp , who told her that he was arrested on 3 January 2010 on the Hamra roadblock where he was manhandled and beaten by the occupation soldiers using rifle butts .
He was then taken to the Hawwara detention centre where the interrogater used a plastic pipe to beat him with so that he confesses .
The child is suffering chronic back pain as a result of being hit on the spine .
He has not been provided with any medical attention apart from being given pain killers .
Zakerya Waddah Awada , 16 years , from Nablus told her that he was arrested on 2 March 2010 and that IOF troops beat him up inside the military jeep .
At the Hawwara detention centre soldiers took him out of his cell during the night to the yard where he was forced to strip naked and stand in the cold for the rest of the night .
He was denied visits since his arrest .
An interview with Michael Jenkins , President and CEO of Forest Trends
Over the past 30 years billions of dollars has been committed to global conservation efforts , yet forests continue to fall , largely a consequence of economic drivers , including surging global demand for food and fuel .
With consumption expected to far outstrip population growth due to rising affluence in developing countries , there would seem to be little hope of slowing tropical forest loss .
But some observers see new reason for optimism — chiefly a new push to make forests more valuable as living entities than chopped down for the production of timber , animal feed , biofuels , and meat .
While are innumerable reasons for protecting forests — including aesthetic , cultural , spiritual , and moral — most land use decisions boil down to economics .
Therefore creating economic incentives to maintaining forests is key to saving them .
Leading the effort to develop markets ecosystem services is Forest Trends , a Washington D.C. - based NGO that also organizes the Katoomba group , a forum that brings together a wide variety of forest stakeholders , including the private sector , local communities , indigenous people , policymakers , international development institutions , funders , conservationists , and activists .
One of the programs of Forest Trends is operating three leading information portals on emerging ecosystem services markets , including Ecosystem Marketplace ( ecosystemmarketplace.com ) , the Forest Carbon Portal ( forestcarbonportal.com ) , and Species Banking ( SpeciesBanking.com ) .
Michael Jenkins .
Michael Jenkins is founder and president of Forests Trends .
Jenkins started out as a tropical forester working in Haiti , Paraguay , Brazil , and other parts of Latin America in reforestation and agroforestry as means to sustainably boost rural livelihoods .
But working in the field around the world , Jenkins saw that existing development and management models were n’t doing enough to keep forests standing .
After a decade with MacArthur Foundation , Jenkins founded Forest Trends in 1998 to “ highlight the market value of natural ecosystems to promote their conservation ” .
In the process , Forest Trends and Katoomba have attracted a bright and innovative group of collaborators and partners who share the vision of using payments for ecosystem services as a platform for protecting forests and other ecosystems .
In 2010 Jenkins was recognized for his commitment to innovation in forest conservation with the Skoll Foundation ’s Award for Social Entrepreneurship .
Mongabay spoke with Jenkins about his work during the Skoll World Forum , held at Oxford University from April 14 - 16 .
AN INTERVIEW WITH MICHAEL JENKINS
Mongabay :
What is your background and what inspired you to start Forest Trends ?
Michael Jenkins :
My background is that I am Tropical Forester , or should I say agroforester , by practice and training and I have worked in places like Paraguay , Haiti , and Brazil .
And then after graduate work at Yale I kind of fell into a job at the Macarthur Foundation , where I worked for ten years and took the local experiences that I had in Haiti and in Paraguay and saw how these translated globally .
I got a unique global perspective from Macarthur , as well as a real exposure to lots of different types of institutions from all around the world , including the good , the bad and the ugly .
All of those experiences shaped the path that took me to Forest Trends .
For example , in working with small farmers in rural Paraguay we tried to figure out how to make forest management more productive and more beneficial than the national cotton programs that did n’t make any sense at all and were really hurting them .
Under the cotton program the small farmers and their 1 hectare , 2 hectare plots were n’t making any money and were over applying harmful pesticides .
We looked for approaches that would make these farms more profitable , while engaging in products and crops that were going to be more sustainable .
We started planting trees and raising bees .
When I was in Haiti it was kind of a similar thing , how to get trees on a landscape where the farmers are struggling to get any annual maize or millet crop at all .
In that environment trees take five years if you ’re lucky – ten years probably and the long - term logic was very hard to communicate to these small farmers .
The program started with the standard package of local miracle trees — fast - growing and nitrogen fixing — yet we were surprised Haitians viewed them as weeds .
So that led us to shift to planting native ‘ useful ’ species , as Haitians suggested , that would produce known and tangible products like valuable timber , fruit , or charcoal .

So that was the path .
It all was about this idea of making those tree and agroforestry systems more productive and more valuable in the short - term and longer term , that the farmer recognized .
My experience at MacArthur helped shape the institutional model of Forest Trends .
After seeing so many organizations and efforts around the globe , completely disconnected or working at cross purposes , it was really clear to me that what the world did not need was another NGO with a big staff and its own separate vision .
What we needed was what I like to call the “ connective tissue ” the connected all of the dots , all the organizations scattered around the globe .
The connective tissue also needed to work from the very local up to the regional , national , and international level where global policy is negotiated .
Local innovation needs to inform global policy , and you also need to make sure the local actors are informed about what is happening on a global scale , policies that will undoubtedly have an effect on them .
So that was part of the notion of a new type of organization .
Also at MacArthur we started getting into a lot of unusual alliances , where we would bring in forest companies , financial institutions and businesses , as well as NGOs and communities , to try to figure out new ways to think about forest sustainability .
Many times these groups had been enemies or at least perceived that way .

The design of Forest Trends operates on this idea that everybody has to be at the table when approaching an issue like creating a new environmental market .
You need the producer , you need certifiers and registries , and other groups that represent the infrastructure a market needs ; you need the governments that are going to create the legal framework and boundaries for these markets ; you need the financial institutions that can help translate that value into a financial product ; and you need the buyer ultimately buy the product .
You need to frame the conversation so you can have all the stakeholders sitting around the table together .
That is very hard — they speak really different languages , literally and figuratively — but I think it is the only way to truly succeed .
Mongabay :
Looking at the market issue , what is the landscape under the Copenhagen Accord ?
Michael Jenkins :
Copenhagen was a huge disappointment to a lot of folks in the traditional market sense .
It was a big disappointment for the carbon market and a lot of the big financial institutions , who have since backed away from the table .
A lot of people in these institutions have been laid off and carbon desks have folded .

But one interesting thing to come out of Copenhagen was that forestry became the “ Promised Land ” .
It is especially ironic since three years ago forestry was in the same category as nuclear , you could n’t trade it in the EU , ETS , the European Carbon trading system , effectively kept completely out of the climate negotiations .
And now , coming out of Copenhagen , forests were one bright light that I think will translate into an agreement on forests at the next COP in Mexico this December .
We ’ve since seen the commitment of bilateral donors — like Norway , Britain , Germany , France , Japan , and the U.S. — who have pledged around $ 4 billion since Copenhagen , just last December , for investment in forests and climate .
This public finance will have to become the bridge between action today and sometime down the road when hopefully the climate process comes back together again including significant private sector involvement .
Mongabay :
So if you are a REDD developer in the midst of a project today , is there the potential to become part of an eventual market system ?

Michael Jenkins :
Yes .
I think there is no question that we are in a period of growing investment in forests and climate .
No question that that will happen .
Whether it is going to be a UN multilateral deal that would look like a Kyoto Protocol kind of thing is the question – or whether it will be a set of different instruments that manifest as bilateral agreements between China and the US , or the State of California and states in Brazil .
These ideas are on the table right now and being kicked around .
But I think there is no question that there is going to be very significant new finance for forest and broader land - use activity like sustainable agriculture that can reduce carbon emissions .
It ’s kind of a creative time , so REDD developers should be looking at innovative ways of connection , with public financing , local community initiatives helping to build models of an eventual market system .
Mongabay :
There are lots of concerns with proposed forest carbon approaches , especially around transparency and equity for forest dependent - communities .
What are some ways to address these ?
Michael Jenkins :
One project that we have started to design with a number of local partners in Latin America and Africa is a tool to track public finance commitments for forests .
Transparency and accountability are critical .

We ’ve already developed the Forest Carbon Portal that currently tracks transactions .
It allows users to see all the deals that are being done globally and includes a sort of a “ nutritional label ” – so you can compare projects and understand what is happening .
Our idea would be to track finance in the same way , so you can actually go on a map and see where money is going , for example Norway to Tanzania .
You would be able to see what has happened , whether any communities are benefiting from it , what registries and accounting systems are in place to measure the impacts , and what is being monitored not only in terms of carbon emissions reductions , but also the other environmental and social benefits .
We see this real - time tracking system serving as a safeguard to make sure the money is used well and effectively and produces real climate benefits , real social benefits and real biodiversity benefits .
Mongabay :
What do you see as the best way to ensure that we have real safeguards and do n’t just fall back into the traps of the old system ?
Institutions involved with REDD — like the World Bank — have a checkered history with maintaining safeguards and are n’t really trusted by many of the groups that will be most affected by REDD .
Is there a role for activists to serve as watchdogs ?

Michael Jenkins :
Yes , definitely .
Activists are an important and effective voice to bring attention to real issues and those local voices that many times are not heard .
I also think there is another affirmative side to advocacy , which is then bringing these groups to the table to discuss and work through their concerns .
People can either say , “ Oh my God , here comes REDD ! ” and fear the day – or you can say , “ Let ’s make it the change we want it to be . ”
Part of other work we do at Forest Trends , meant to complement this transparent information platform , is to actually work with projects on the ground , demonstrating how local communities can benefit from these emerging markets like REDD .
For example , we have the project with Surui in the Brazil Amazon , which has established a legal precedent showing that forest communities have rights to the forest carbon in their territories .
It is to demonstrate the process by which this finance can flow in a way so that a local indigenous community can benefit .
So I think there are two sides of advocacy work , a watchdog to keep everyone honest , and demonstration with partners to show how things could work .
Mongabay :
Do you see REDD as the stepping - stone towards valuing ecosystems for other services they provide humanity ?
Michael Jenkins :
Actually , payments for other ecosystem services have been happening for years .
We ’ve been tracking about twenty different emerging environmental markets .
There are public payment schemes for water , voluntary watershed protection schemes , water quality markets , wetland mitigation banks , conservation banks , and certified commodities like timber , coffee , and others .
All of these tools are part of the universe of environmental markets .
Clearly carbon and REDD — the Carbon market before REDD and now REDD — have been the big “ Kahuna ” in terms of scale and attention but that might not always be the case .
For me the failure of Copenhagen was actually an opportunity to go back to a fundamental message , which is “ there is no silver bullet here .
Carbon is not going to save everybody . ”
If you look across the whole array of environmental markets , you might have a silver lining because , regardless of where you sit in the world , one of those markets is going to be relevant to you .
And they will all hopefully be vehicles to invest in healthy and productive ecosystems , with real benefits to the stewards that deliver these public goods of clean water , stable climate , and biodiversity .
Mongabay :
Do you see environmental markets as a way to encourage corporations become better stewards of the environment ?

Michael Jenkins :
Yes .
But I think it happens in a series of stages .
We have seen a lot of corporate social responsibility which I think is ‘ environmental light ’ for the most part .
In some cases we are moving to a second stage that is a deeper commitment where businesses are recognizing investing in natural resources that are important to them , like Coca - Cola recognizing the fundamental need of clean water to produce their drink products .
That step can be a significant challenge because many times these ecosystem services like water have historically been free .
But what is also interesting to think about is once you have put a price on that service — whether it ’s pure water or nitrogen that pollutes water , whether it ’s clean air or carbon emissions — then that becomes a price that is embedded in their business model .
And so if an energy company is thinking about building a coal - fired power plant — and right now the price of that the clean air is free — it has no bearing on that decision .
But once it becomes carbon at $ 28 a ton , that becomes a significant part of your decision in what kind of a facility you are going to build and where .
The price signal becomes even a more systemic driver of company behavior change .
Mongabay :
We are already seeing pressure from companies on governments on some of these issues — do you think this will increase ?
Michael Jenkins :
Yes , this is completely counterintuitive probably to most of us – but I feel like in the last decade our best partner in catalyzing these markets has been the private sector .
Governments — certainly our government — have n’t shown much leadership up until recently .
It has been some high minded businesses , alongside a few intrepid NGOs , that have been driving this shift .
Mongabay :
Would you say you are optimistic about the outlook for forests and other ecosystems ?
Michael Jenkins :
I would say yes , I am optimistic .
Having worked in forestry issues for some thirty years it seems like we finally have a really significant hook where we might able to turn the tide in terms of forests and really change the game .
That has not been the case in the past .
Mongabay :
What do you see as the biggest remaining obstacles to realizing that future ?
Michael Jenkins :
I think there is not one but a range of obstacles that interact together .
We have got to get the policies in place .
Markets and market - like instruments cannot work in isolation .
Market tools are part of an ecosystem that requires regulation , information , and capacity to succeed .
For these markets to reach scale and have strong drivers behind them we need to have a regulatory environment that sets the scene .

Copenhagen not succeeding meant that the potential for carbon markets as a whole suffered a significant setback .
Investments around carbon have been drying up and the price of carbon has been going down .
So you need good policies in place that can serve the regulatory framework in which markets can function .
You need the ‘ architecture ’ in place so that the buyer gets what he paid for and that the payment actually goes to the producer of that service .
You need to make sure that these developing policies and markets include channels through which resources can flow to smallholders .
We need to break that traditional model of markets screwing the poor .
That is the work that we all need to do ; creating a new type of marketplace that invests in maintaining and restoring our natural infrastructure , our rural communities , and rewards innovation and collaborators at all levels .
The historic opportunity of this moment is that we are the builders .
Mongabay :
Do you think there may be a forest agreement by the end of the year ?
Michael Jenkins :
Yes , I do think there will be a Forestry Agreement .
It would be a surprise if we did n’t get one .
The Mexican Government is all ready to do this and the bilaterals are all ready for this , and NGO ’s , business all want some positive step .
And we are close .
Mongabay :
What would that look like ?
Would it be an international deal or would we see bilateral deals ?
Would there be financial incentives to stop deforestation ?
Michael Jenkins :
Well , there again , that is the big question .
My hope is that it would be a multilateral agreement of some sort .
Whether it would be part of the UN - FCCC process or not is not clear ; whether a forest agreement could drive that larger climate negotiation process is not clear .

There will be more finance put on the table to work on slowing deforestation .
The commitments that have been made already represent a significantly bigger investment in forest conservation than we have ever seen before .
Yet while there is a lot of excitement around the potential scale of the market carbon we need to balance that with other important opportunities for environmental markets out there that can help stop deforestation and invest in our natural resources .
These are equally as valuable ; maybe in the longer term , more valuable than the carbon market .
Water markets , for example , are going to be more important than carbon markets over the long term because while the carbon market will eventually move us away from a carbon - based economy , but we ca n’t find a substitute for water .
We are going to need ways or instruments to help us most efficiently and equitably manage our water resource in a time when we are going to be 9 billion people .
Mongabay :
Water will be a big issue for China .
Is that going to be a way to engage it in environmental issues ?
Michael Jenkins :
Water quality is probably the biggest environmental challenge facing China — they are definitely interested in ways to better manage that resource .
Oil palm plantation and logged - over forest in Borneo ( April 2008 ) .
China and India , along with producer countries like Brazil , are fast becoming the central players in global consumption patterns .
Simply we need to engage them as equal partners .
When you think about the commodity roundtables that have formed around soy beans , palm oil , and sugar , we ’re not just talking about influencing business in U.S. and Europe .
The producer may well be in Brazil or Indonesia , while the prime consumers may be in China and India .
Mongabay :
But at present these roundtables are developing standards that are basically driven by Europe and the United States .
Michael Jenkins :
Yes .
The roundtables have leading business corporations that are worried about their image in markets in Europe and US and the long - term sustainability of products .
We need to engage Chinese and Indian corporations if we are to produce a stronger more systemic outcome .
Mongabay :
So the idea is you could engage China by establishing best practices for production or capture products that are manufactured in China but end up in Europe and the U.S. ?
Michael Jenkins :
Right .
You can take from experiences like forestry and certification .
You get the corporate leaders from Europe to provide leadership adopting new , better standards and then China realizes that to sell into major markets they have to meet these standards .
Experience has been the export markets , and particularly those into Europe , are going to be the first adopters .
And then hopefully it develops into an internal market with home grown standards and certifiers .
That has been the case in Brazil with forestry and now we are seeing other early promising initiatives around soy and cattle .
For us that are focused on forests and ecosystem conservation , stabilizing this frontier between forests and agriculture using the mix of advocacy , standards , and market tools will be fundamental to stemming the tide of tropical deforestation .

Ethnographic maps built using cutting - edge technology may help Amazon tribes win forest carbon payments
( 11/29/2009 )
A new handbook lays out the methodology for cultural mapping , providing indigenous groups with a powerful tool for defending their land and culture , while enabling them to benefit from some 21st century advancements .
Cultural mapping may also facilitate indigenous efforts to win recognition and compensation under a proposed scheme to mitigate climate change through forest conservation .
The scheme — known as REDD for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation — will be a central topic of discussion at next month ’s climate talks in Copenhagen , but concerns remain that it could fail to deliver benefits to forest dwellers .

A rainforest tribe fighting to save their territory from loggers owns the carbon - trading rights to their land , according to a legal opinion released today by Baker & McKenzie , one of the world ’s largest law firms .
The opinion , which was commissioned by Forest Trends , a Washington , D.C. - based forest conservation group , could boost the efforts of indigenous groups seeking compensation for preserving forest on their lands , effectively paving the way for large - scale indigenous - led conservation of the Amazon rainforest .
Indigenous people control more than a quarter of the Brazilian Amazon .
REDD in Colombia : using forests to finance conservation and communities in Colombia ’s Choco , a former war zone
( 11/03/2009 ) Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation ( REDD ) , a climate change mechanism proposed by the U.N. , has been widely lauded for its potential to simultaneously deliver a variety of benefits at multiple scales .
But serious questions remain , especially in regard to local communities .
Will they benefit from REDD ?
While much lip - service is paid to community involvement in REDD projects , many developers approach local communities as an afterthought .
Priorities lie in measuring the carbon sequestered in a forest area , lining up financing , and making marketing arrangements , rather than working out what local people — the ones who are often cutting down trees — actually need in order to keep forests standing .
This sets the stage for conflict , which reduces the likelihood that a project will successfully reduce deforestation for the 15 - 30 year life of a forest carbon project .
Brodie Ferguson , a Stanford University - trained anthropologist whose work has focused on forced displacement of rural communities in conflict regions in Colombia , understands this well .
Ferguson is working to establish a REDD project in an unlikely place : Colombia ’s Chocó , a region of diverse coastal ecosystems with some of the highest levels of endemism in the world that until just a few years ago was the domain of anti-government guerillas and right - wing death squads .
Are we on the brink of saving rainforests ?
( 07/22/2009 ) Until now saving rainforests seemed like an impossible mission .
But the world is now warming to the idea that a proposed solution to help address climate change could offer a new way to unlock the value of forest without cutting it down .
Deep in the Brazilian Amazon , members of the Surui tribe are developing a scheme that will reward them for protecting their rainforest home from encroachment by ranchers and illegal loggers .
The project , initiated by the Surui themselves , will bring jobs as park guards and deliver health clinics , computers , and schools that will help youths retain traditional knowledge and cultural ties to the forest .
Surprisingly , the states of California , Wisconsin and Illinois may finance the endeavor as part of their climate change mitigation programs .
Markets could save rainforests : an interview with Andrew Mitchell
( 08/17/2008 ) Markets may soon value rainforests as living entities rather than for just the commodities produced when they are cut down , said a tropical forest researcher speaking in June at a conservation biology conference in the South American country of Suriname .
Andrew Mitchell , founder and director of the London - based Global Canopy Program ( GCP ) , said he is encouraged by signs that investors are beginning to look at the value of services afforded by healthy forests .
Investing to save rainforests
( 04/02/2008 ) Last week London - based Canopy Capital , a private equity firm , announced a historic deal to preserve the rainforest of Iwokrama , a 371,000 - hectare reserve in the South American country of Guyana .
In exchange for funding a “ significant ” part of Iwokrama ’s $ 1.2 million research and conservation program on an ongoing basis , Canopy Capital secured the right to develop value for environmental services provided by the reserve .
Essentially the financial firm has bet that the services generated by a living rainforest — including rainfall generation , climate regulation , biodiversity maintenance and carbon storage — will eventually be valuable in international markets .
Hylton Murray - Philipson , director of Canopy Capital , says the agreement — which returns 80 percent of the proceeds to the people of Guyana — could set the stage for an era where forest conservation is driven by the pursuit of profit rather than overt altruistic concerns .
NIH Study Finds That Overweight Girls Who Lose Weight Reduce Adult Diabetes Risk
Overweight girls who lose weight before they reach adulthood greatly reduced their risk for developing type 2 diabetes , according to researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Harvard University , who analyzed 16 years of data on nearly 110,000 women .
Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease .
It is marked by high blood sugar levels and difficulties in the body 's production or use of insulin .
Being overweight , exercising infrequently and having a family history of diabetes are known to contribute to the risk of developing the disease .
The findings were published online in Diabetes Care and will appear in the June issue .
The study was conducted by researchers at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ( NICHD ) .
Along with the NICHD , two other NIH institutes , the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases provided funding for the analysis .
The study followed 109,172 female nurses from 1989 to 2005 , noting how many developed diabetes during that time .
An initial survey collected information about the women ’s health , history and lifestyle habits .
One question asked them to pick which of a series of diagrams best matched their body shape at ages 5 , 10 and 20 .
The series of nine line drawings depicted female silhouettes of different sizes , ranging from gaunt ( size 1 ) to obese ( size 9 ) .
The nurses were also asked to provide their height and current weight and to estimate their weight when they were 18 .
Every two years after the initial survey , the women submitted follow - up information including whether they developed diabetes .
The researchers recorded a total of 3,307 cases of type 2 diabetes over the course of the study and found that the nurses who were overweight as girls were more likely to become diabetic as adults .
Women who indicated that their size at age 5 matched or exceeded the size 6 figure were more than twice as likely to develop diabetes as those who recalled matching the size 2 figure .
The women indicating the size 6 or above at age 10 were 2.57 times as likely to develop diabetes as adults .
Those who reported a body mass index of more than 30 ( considered obese ) at age 18 were almost nine times more likely to develop diabetes than their normal - weight counterparts ( BMI of 18 – 19 ) .
BMI , or body mass index , is a standard measure of a person 's build based on their height and weight .
A BMI between 18 and 24 reflects a healthy weight .
BMI calculators and additional information about maintaining a healthy weight are available at : http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/Obesity.cfm.
In the study , the researchers also examined the combined effect of extra weight at various ages .
Compared with women who were not overweight at key ages in childhood , adolescence and adulthood , those who indicated they were overweight at all three ages were 15 times more likely to develop diabetes .
Conversely , women who recalled being overweight at age 10 but not overweight as adults were no more likely to become diabetic than their peers who had been normal - weight children .
" These findings suggest that ensuring that overweight kids reverse their weight gain is critical to limiting their future risk of diabetes as adults , " said study author Edwina Yeung , Ph.D. , of the NICHD Division of Epidemiology , Statistics and Prevention Research .
When the women entered the study , they averaged 34 years old .
At that time , they were asked to recall their weight at age 18 .
The researchers found that women who gained weight after age 18 also increased their diabetes risk .
Those who gained more than 25 pounds increased their diabetes risk more than 20 times .
On the other hand , women who recalled being overweight or obese at age 18 and subsequently lost 10 pounds or more decreased their risk by more than half , compared with overweight or obese women who maintained that weight as an adult .

NIH … Turning Discovery Into Health®
In his famous 1908 essay , ‘ Ornament and Crime , ’ modern architect Adolf Loos wrote : “ The evolution of culture marches with the elimination of ornament from useful objects . ”
This pronouncement banished many of the frilly , decorative fonts of centuries past from the realm of High Design .
Fast forward to the present day : Web 3.0 is awash in enough sleek sans serif and classic roman typefaces to make designers long for the typographic indulgences of yesteryear .
Harness the power of the antique and make your graphics pop with one of these vintage - inspired fonts , which have returned to the spotlight both in print and online .
From the Wild West and Victoriana to the Avant Garde and Calligraphy , there are plenty of styles to choose from .
Fonts have been grouped informally , with contemporary interpretations alongside ( almost ) original prototypes .
All are available free for personal use , but please make sure to read the license agreements carefully .
Wood Type and Display Fonts
This distressed , wood - type - inspired font has the shabby charm of an old sideshow banner .
Equal parts macabre and cheeky , it is appropriate for graphics ranging from the irreverent to the horrific .
Dieter Steffmann ’s Circus Ornate captures the spirit of classic circus graphics , but still stands on its own as an ornamental , boisterous display font .
Coffee Tin ( similar to the Rosewood font )
Inspired by fonts like Rosewood and Ponderosa , which are modeled after the display fonts of the late 18th century , Coffee Tin reinterprets old - fashioned advertising graphics with contemporary clarity .
This is another beautiful distressed font that draws inspiration from 19th century display types .
The Typeology foundry based this font and its name on an 1884 typeface by D.T. Ames .
Another antique beauty by Dieter Steffmann , Egyptienne Zierinitialen turns two - dimensional letters into florid three - dimensional sculptures .
A vintage beauty by Jester Font Studio .
Shareware designer , David Rakowski , designed this font in 1991 .
17 years later , its balance of monumentality and delicacy makes it a blast from the past that looks memorable in the present .
Rick Mueller ’s Tuscan is one of his many vintage - inspired fonts , though its combination of sinuous contours and ample weight makes it memorable .
This font has the flair of an antique display face without the fuss .
Inspired by Sideshow , from Harold ’s Fonts , Fusty Saddle is a hand - drawn , Wild West - inspired font made digital .
Bittbox not only provides you with a font but a definition : “ fusty , ” according to their site , means “ old - fashioned in attitude and style . ”
This digital adaptation of wood - type , with a Wild West twang , was designed by Matthew Austin Petty of Disturbed Type .
Like a cowboy ’s stubble , rough edges and scruffy surfaces make this font a more masculine antique .
From the independent digital type foundry , Fountain , Azteak combines traces of the past with dreams from the future .
Underneath this font ’s embellishments are mechanical footprints , adding a hint of steampunk .
The name of this font is derived from the French for “ guardian angel , ” and its capital letters are indeed guarded by winged figures .
AngeGardien ’s combination of daintiness and strength , shared with other great vintage typefaces , might be what makes it worthy of protection .
Antique and Renaissance Fonts
Caslon Antique is what an original , 18th century Caslon type might look like now : a little worn around the edges , but no less steadfast .
This interpretation of the classic Caslon serif adds age and wisdom to a text without sacrificing legibility .
Another decayed antique face with loads of personality , Dominican is inspired by the time - battered beauty of antiquarian books .
An unusual all - caps font , Old Dog New Tricks dips below the baseline to add interest to an otherwise classic serif .
Its combination of Deco and antiquarian influence may make its pedigree murky , but remix culture dictates that the offspring of unexpected unions can create truly singular forms .
Designed by David J. Perry in 2003 , Cardo was created for scholarly use in classical and medieval languages .
The slight angularity of this font recalls manuscripts and stone inscriptions alike .
Blackletter and Calligraphic Fonts
The shaky baseline and faded letters might make it seem disorderly , but this font is strong enough to support any layout that is incorrigible enough to merit it .
Based on the title typeface for P.T. Anderson ’s 2007 film , this font demonstrates the effect that the Wild West can have on a traditional blackletter .
The Olde English typeface is an interesting example of how a typeface , despite its associations in one time and place , can easily become affiliated with another .
Though its forms are inspired by medieval German blackletter types , Olde English is actually named for the Old English language — which was printed in Insular script .
The Schwabacher typeface got its name from the German village of Schwabach , and its appearance from manuscript calligraphy .
Though it was used only occasionally in Germany after the 16th century , its legacy is central to the history of the printed book .
Fraktur was used extensively in German printing up through the 20th century , and comes in many variations .
Fette Fraktur is a heavy , relaxed version that manages to be legible to the Antiqua - trained eye without losing its distinctive appearance .
This font was designed to induce nostalgia for the early years of baseball , when stadiums were still named after neighborhoods and people .
In the spirit of vintage baseball jerseys , this script is as jaunty as it is rugged .
Wrexham Script is a more condensed and angular sports - inspired font with a vintage flair .
With the abundance of handwriting fonts available on the web , it can be easy to forget that the simple script typeface has its precedents in centuries of practiced and often professional penmanship .
ALS Script , with its balance and elegance , is a font worthy of this heritage : its forms recall the official handwriting of the 18th and 19th centuries .
Despite Loos ’ warnings against ornament , the decorative curlicues of Adine Kirnberg do not disrupt its readability or its effectiveness .
This well - designed cursive , with its delicate hint of the antique , is not mere wedding - invitation fare .
This upright cursive is as architectural as it is ornate .
The Deco-tinged contours of Ecolier seem to draw their inspiration from the delicate curves of calligraphy as well as the towering forms of modern engineering .
According to designer Billy Argel , Olho de Boi is a font inspired by the first Brazilian postage stamp released on August 1 , 1843 .
The idiosyncratic scratches and loops make this script seem to come straight out of old letters .
There may only be one International Talk Like A Pirate Day , but why not write like a pirate every other day ?
This font is aptly named : the pirate - inspired scrawl resembles the waterlogged italics of a lost treasure map .
Nouveau and Deco Fonts
From Casady & Greene , Fletcher Gothic is an Art Nouveau font with clean lines and striking details : use it to bring turn - of the - century style to this century ’s graphics .
The curvilinear forms of this font recall the plant - like contours of Art Nouveau .
Hadley brings an organic quality to text that allows it to refer to the past without losing its contemporary relevance .
If Alphonse Mucha had designed a font , Secesja might be it .
Sinuous serifs and spiraling ornaments make the letterforms burst with life .
In the early 1900s , Charles Dana Gibson ’s pen and ink drawings of corseted women with bouffant hairstyles came to be known as “ Gibson Girls . ”
Trinigan , with its undulating arms and hourglass stems , revives this classic figure in typographic form .
George Williams ’ Parisian font at once evokes a sidewalk café , a theater marquee , and the hushed crackle of a phonograph .
The geometric winding of this all - caps font almost resembles musical notation .
Still , Michelle ’s typographic potential is clearly not limited to ragtime and jazz .
Though there are many modern revivals of Bodoni ’s original typeface that align it more readily with Times New Roman than times past , Bodoni Ultra is a striking exception .
The dramatic alternation between thick and thin strokes echoes Chauncey H. Griffith ’s 1929 Bodoni Poster typeface , used widely in popular print media .
Jugend magazine , the publication that helped launch the German Art Nouveau movement ( “ Jugendstil ” ) , was a trendsetter when it came to the graphic and decorative arts of the late 19th century .
Sesame is a font in the spirit of a Jugend cover : lavish , distinctive , and eccentric .
Betty Boop meets Broadway in a Conga Line : the 1930s charm of this font comes from its blend of cartoonish bounce and cinematic monumentality .
Another architectural font , Tall Deco suggests the glass and ironwork of modern skyscrapers .
Modern and Avant Garde Fonts
Enigmatic and Waukegan echo the softened rectangular shapes of Bell Gothic , a typeface commissioned by AT&T in the 1930s for use in telephone directories .
Bell Gothic was and is a highly recognizable typeface that has been used for avant garde as well as popular graphics .
akaChen ( in the spirit of Clarendon )
This font bears a marked resemblance to the Clarendon typeface , which was first designed in the mid-19th century and has been used frequently in display work .
Pardoes ( echoes De Stijl typefaces )
Reminiscent of De Stijl artwork of the 1920s , such as the paintings of Piet Mondrain , Pardoes is abstract and geometric without being illegible .
A font in the spirit of Soviet Constructivism , Agit Prop is intended to convey the graphic essence of Bolshevist agitation and propaganda .
Whether or not you agree with the politics behind the design , it ’s difficult to deny this font ’s stark and monumental beauty .

If you attend a scientific talk on a controversial subject , you may be entertained or discomfited by the sometimes spirited discussion it can engender .
Scientists love to pick apart new ideas , try to find their strengths and weaknesses .
That 's because they know that for an idea to survive scientifically , it must be attacked by scientifically experienced minds ; any faults must be aired out .
That which survives is stronger for the effort , and more likely to closely model reality .
The key phrase there is " scientifically experienced " .
When this happens with people inexperienced with the methodologies of science -- or worse , those who actively oppose them -- then the situation is very different .
It changes from a way to strengthen our ideas on the Universe into a witch hunt .
Instead of warming up people to discovery , it produces a chilling effect .
We 're seeing this play out in spades in the field of climate science .
To be clear : the climate is changing .
There is zero doubt about that .
None .
Anyone telling you differently has an agenda to ram , and it's one that is decidedly not realistic .
And some of those people ramming through this agenda are using -- I would say abusing -- their power to do so .
For example , über - conservative Virginia State Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli -- the same guy who was so offended by the artwork of a naked breast he had it covered up on lapel pins -- is investigating climate scientist Michael Mann .
Cuccinelli is claiming that Mann may have defrauded taxpayers while trying to get grants to fund his research .
Mind you , Mann has survived such attacks before as fallout from the nonsensical climategate " scandal " ( which was a completely manufactured controversy with no substance at all ) .
The fact that someone , let alone a state attorney general , would start up something like this after an investigation already cleared Mann smacks of a very transparent political attack .
This has all the marks of an attempt to chill academic research when it goes against someone 's antireality stance .
" Hey , maybe I can stop global warming by creating a chilling effect ! "
And Cuccinelli is n't alone .
Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe -- a man so firmly entrapped in denialism that he has called climate change " the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people " -- is looking for ways to prosecute and criminalize more than a dozen leading climate scientists , again under the mantra of defrauding the taxpayers .
Again , let me be clear : this is utter garbage .
The scientists involved have been cleared of all wrong - doing ( accusations which were politically motivated in the first place , and a colossal waste of time ) .
Stunts like this from Inhofe and Cuccinelli are nothing more than government officials using their power to throw roadblocks into scientific inquiry they disagree with .
The media , of course , are buying right into this ; " climategate " got far more attention than it deserved .
However , in some good news , one climate scientist is fighting back : Andrew Weaver , a climate scientist and member of the IPCC ( which put out the report on climate change that made so many denialists ' heads explode ) is suing the Canadian paper National Post .
He is saying they cast him in a false light , and he also says ,
Who has two thumbs and no grasp on reality ?
This guy !
... that the National Post articles suggest he 's a corrupt scientist who promotes global warming theories so he can obtain government research grants .
Sound familiar ?
This attack on the reputations of scientists is nefarious ; reputation is extremely important when it comes to a scientist 's career .
Getting grants , invitations to talks , even being taken seriously , all can rest on the respect they get by other scientists and the public .
I 'm glad Weaver is fighting back .
These attacks on science , on reality , are appalling .
It is one thing for scientists to argue over the factual basis of claims in their field , trying to establish what reflects reality and what does n't .
But it 's quite another for politicians blinded by their bias to suppress ideas they do n't like .
Sheril and Chris have more on this as well .
Tip o' the thermometer to Jay Dee Archer for the article on Weaver .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Nobody wants to be average , so we are told , but scientists at the University of Glasgow have found that when it comes to vocal attractiveness , sounding average attracts more admirers .
Researchers in the Department of Psychology studied vocal attractiveness to find out how much voices influence our perception of what is beautiful .
The researchers used a series of voice recordings from 32 men and 32 women , and then created voice composites by merging an increasing number of voices - two , four , eight , 16 and 32 - and then asked 25 listeners to rate the voices ’ attractiveness .
The results , published in the latest edition of the journal Current Biology , showed that , in most cases , listeners found the composite voices more attractive than the original voices , and this attractiveness increased with the number of voices merged to create the composite .
One reason for this , the scientists believe , is because the composite voices had higher harmonics - to - noise ratios - that is to say , they were smoother with fewer irregularities .
Lead author Professor Pascal Belin , who is from Paris , said : “ Smoother , more regular voices may signal younger , healthier speakers . ”
Another , less intuitive , reason for their findings is that voice composites sounded more like the average voice and voices which were closer in pitch and timbre to the average population were also perceived as more attractive .
This conclusion was checked by manipulating the original voice recordings to create a smoother version , but of the same pitch , and when both were played to the listeners they rated the smoother version as more attractive .
The same outcome resulted when the researchers altered voices to make them closer to the average pitch and further away from it , with the most average voices being deemed most attractive .
Prof Belin added : “ The human voice , in addition to its role as the carrier of speech , reveals valuable information regarding the speaker ’s biological characteristics .
The attractiveness of a voice partly reflects that biological information : health , reproductive fitness , etc .
“ Voices with pronounced sexually dimorphic features - for example a deep voice in males - are preferred by the other gender because it may signal better reproductive potential .
However our results are the first to highlight effects of vocal attractiveness that apply irrespective of speaker ’s or listener ’s gender ”
“ Listeners also attribute more positive personality characteristics to people with attractive voices - a bias known as the ‘ what sounds beautiful is good ’ stereotype . ”
Previous observations made a century ago show that the same increase in attractiveness can be achieved by averaging faces to create composite images which are judged to be more attractive .
Professor Belin cautioned : “ It ’s worth noting that these findings were obtained using brief vowels , so they cannot be easily generalised to realistic speaking situations in which a number of additional cues are present , including intonation , speaking rate , etc .
“ Nonetheless , these findings have important implications for voice - based technologies , suggesting simple ways of enhancing the attractiveness of synthetic voices at a time when automated voice systems are becoming increasingly prevalent .
“ To individuals , they suggest adjusting the average pitch of one ’s voice to the mean of the same gender population ( a deep B for males and an A for women ) as a simple but effective means of ‘ vocal make - up ’ . ”

( Thanks , Daan , for the tip ! )
While we 're still on the subject of artificial weather , the Mercedes - Benz Museum in Stuttgart , Germany , designed by UNStudio , can repurpose its internal ventilation system to form an artificial tornado .
"
The twister takes around seven minutes to materialize , " Autoblog explains , " and is generated by 144 jets and 28 tons of air .
The low pressure area at the center of the tornado works to create a jet stream that draws smoke out of the building 's corridors and funnels it upwards and out an exhaust vent on the roof . "
It is also more than 100 feet tall — making it the official world - record holder for the World 's Largest Artificial Tornado .
Watch the video of how it forms :
A reader , Daan Koch , pointed this internal atmospheric feature out to me — the tornado as ornament — adding that this " dramatic way of ventilating an atrium ... could be nice for the Guggenheim in New York , as well . "
I could n't agree more .

Potential buyers of the Old Forge pub in Scotland , accessible only by boat or 18 - mile hike , include a family from California
Faced with relentless sunshine , overwhelming natural beauty and a perma - tanned population , it is little wonder that one adventurous Californian family wanted to escape to remotest Scotland .
The family sailed off on a 10,000 - mile round trip to view mainland Britain 's remotest pub , which has been put up for sale , according to agents selling the business .
The Old Forge on the Knoydart peninsula in northern Scotland is not your average local .
Reachable only by boat , or an 18 - mile hike over 1,000 - metre hills , the pub has won accolades for being one of the most beautiful – if out - of - the - way – drinking establishments in the country .
The pub , in the village of Inverie , is 45 minutes away by ferry from Mallaig or 20 minutes by a daily water taxi , but since being put on the market by its owners – who , one suspects , may be looking for a quieter life – it has received no shortage of offers from would - be publicans willing to pay the £ 790,000 asking price .
Agents Knight Frank , said that there are five " serious " potential bidders including from a family in Montreal , Canada , and others from Edinburgh , Oban , London , and New Zealand .
Apparently tired of California 's non -stop sunshine , the family , who are originally from the UK , are looking to return to Britain to start a business that offers both profit and " lifestyle choice " , he added .
" What has attracted them to The Old Forge is their love of sailing .
They have looked at the business as customers and also looked at the surrounding area of Mallaig and Oban to get a feel for the yachting that the area offers . "
Despite the obvious scarcity of customers – the pub serves a community of around 115 – the Old Forge is an attractive business proposition , with six - figure profits , according to agents .
The pub and restaurant is on the main sailing route to Skye , the Outer Hebrides and the Small Isles and attracts yachtsmen , hillwalkers and tourists throughout the year .
" The first serious , secure offer over the asking price is likely to be accepted , " said David Reid at Knight Frank .
" No formal offers have yet been made but we have serious interest from five parties at the moment , including the family from California .
We also have a family from Canada who want to come and view as well as those in Europe .
We have also had inquiries from all over the UK . "
The Old Forge 's location has posed some problems for the those helping to sell the property and , like many things in the Highlands , the pace of the sale is likely to be rather slow .
" Given its remoteness – and the time it takes to carry out viewings – we do n't expect a sale to be reached for a couple of months yet , " said Reid .
A new study reports that the top of thegigantic conveyor belt of plasma moving inside the sun has been running atrecord - high speeds for the past five years .
The phenomenon might be the reason why thesun has continued to have so few sunspots recently when it should be ramping upthe production of these surface - blotching storms .?
" Ibelieve this could explain the unusually deep solar minimum we 've beenexperiencing , " said David Hathaway , a solar physicist at NASA andco - author of a new study describing the findings , in a NASA statement .
" The high speed of theconveyor belt challenges existing models of the solar cycle and it has forcedus back to the drawing board for new ideas . "
The so - called Great Conveyor
Belt is amassive circulating current of hot plasma within the sun .
It has two branches , north and south , each taking about 40 years to complete one circuit .
Researchers believe the turning of the belt controls the sunspot cycle .
Hathaway has been monitoring the conveyorbelt using data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) .
The top of the belt skims the surface ofthe sun , sweeping up knots of solar magnetism and carrying them toward thepoles .
SOHO is able to track those knots —
Hathawaycalled them " magnetic elements " — and thus reveal the speed of theunderlying flow .
" It 's a little like measuring the speedof a river on Earth by clocking the leaves and twigs floating downstream , " Hathaway explained .
SOHO 's dataset extends all the way back to1996 and spans a complete solar cycle .
Last year , Lisa Rightmire , a student of Hathaway from the University of Memphis , spent the entire summer measuringmagnetic elements .
When she plotted their speeds versus time , she noticed howfast the conveyor belt has been going .
A note about " fast " : The GreatConveyor Belt is one of the biggest things in the whole solar system and byhuman standards it moves with massive slowness .
" Fast " in thiscontext means 20 to 30 miles per hour .
A good bicyclist could easily keep up .
Shocking speed
The speed - up was surprising on two levels .
First , it coincided with the deepest solarminimum in nearly 100 years , contradicting models that say a fast - moving beltshould boost sunspot production .
The basic idea is that the belt sweeps upmagnetic fields from the sun 's surface and drags them down to the sun 's innerdynamo .
There the fields are amplified to form the underpinnings of newsunspots .
A fast - moving belt should accelerate this process .
So where have all the sunspots been ?
Thesolar minimum of 2008 - 2009 was unusually deep and now the sun appears to be onthe verge of a weak solar cycle .
Instead of boosting sunspots , Hathawaybelieves that a fast - moving Conveyor Belt can instead suppress them " bycounteracting magnetic diffusion at the sun 's equator . "
The second surprise has to do with the bottomof the Conveyor Belt .
SOHO can only clock the motions of thevisible top layer .
The bottom is hidden by about 200,000 kilometers ofoverlying plasma .
Nevertheless , an estimate of its speed can be made bytracking sunspots .
" Sunspotsare supposedly rooted to the bottom of the belt , " said Hathaway .
" Sothe motion of sunspots tells us how fast the belt is moving down there . "
He 's done that — plotted sunspot speeds versustime since 1996 — and the results do n't make sense .
" While the top of theconveyor belt has been moving at record - high speed , the bottom seems to bemoving at record - low speed .
Another contradiction . "
Could it be that sunspots are notrooted to the bottom of the Conveyor Belt , after all ?
" That 's onepossibility " he noted .
" Sunspots could be moving because of dynamowaves or some other phenomenon not directly linked to the belt . "
Let 's go deeper
What researchers really need is a good lookdeep inside the sun .
NASA 's Solar Dynamics Observatory , launched in February2010 , will provide that when its instruments come online later this year .
SDO is able to map the sun 's interior using atechnique called helioseismology .
SOHO can do the same thing , but not wellenough to trace the Great Conveyor Belt all the way around .
SDO 's advancedsensors might reveal the complete circuit , which " could be the missingpiece we need to forecast the whole solar cycle , " said Hathaway .
The research was published in today 's issueof Science .
Just when the " curvy " debate with regards to female models is heating up , New York magazine reports that display mannequin manufacturer Rootstein has debuted a new item , the " Homme Nouveau . "
This " new man " has a 27 - inch waist .

The " classic " male mannequin has a 33 " waist ; the average waist size of an American man in 2006 was 39 inches .
But apparently , for men , skinny is " in " and " now . "
But what is the cost of declaring a downsized and slender mannequin as more fashionable ?
What happens when you send the message that to be stylish is to be skinny ?
Women have been struggling with this for years , and some of us are pissed .
Instead of being abandoned , is this ideal just getting traction ?
Consider this statement , included in the New York piece by David Colman : " All the mannequins out there are these beefcakes , and we can't even fit our largest size on them , " says American Apparel 's Dov Charney , who is a size 29 .
AA 's denim Slim Slack only goes up to waist size 33 inches .
And Leigh Cohn , author of Making Weight says : " The prevalence rates for women with eating disorders have not significantly changed over the years , but they have risen for men . "
Body - shame and lowered self confidence : Now for everyone .
So damaging , making physical characteristics — often dictated by genetics — " cool " or " not cool . "
So sad .

With these bullshit hands we 're dealt
We have to take these cards ourselves
And flip them , do n't expect no help Now I could have either just Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
But take this situation in which I 'm placed in And get up and get my own Eminem — Beautiful
The housing bubble and the kool aid mindset it spawned has been very disruptive to American life .
Large segments of our population are addicted to Ponzi finance , and the prudent are being robbed to pay for the mistakes of the Ponzis .
I find the IHB is an outlet for the frustrations with the insanity being inflicted upon us all .
The sad part is how little has been done to correct the mistakes .
We will do this again .
Charles Hugh Smith ( May 27 , 2010 )
The fundamental root of the housing bubble –the collusion of the Central State and banks to extend home ownership to millions of citizens who did not qualify for that burden– remains firmly in place .
The Federal government continues to pour tens of billions of dollars into … subsidies to Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and FHA .
Mortgage lenders have been delighted to write mortgages in our completely nationalized market in which the government backs literally 99 % of all mortgages and the Federal Reserve bought $ 1.2 trillion in mortgages that no sane private investor would touch .
Fannie Mae seeks $ 8.4 billion from government after loss : Fannie Mae , the largest U.S. residential mortgage funds provider , on Monday asked the government for an additional $ 8.4 billion after the company lost $ 13.1 billion in the first quarter .
Because of current trends in housing and financial markets , Fannie Mae expects to continue having a net worth deficit in future periods and to need to tap more funding from the Treasury .
" Promoting sustainable homeownership and maintaining ready access to liquidity are our guiding principles in serving the residential markets , " said Michael Williams , the firm 's chief executive .
The government has relied heavily on both companies , which buy mortgages from lenders to stimulate more lending , to stabilize the housing market .
In other words , the housing market would collapse without this massive Federal support , and there is no end to the losses this subsidy will require .
Propping up the nation 's fundamnetally insolvent housing market is truly a financial black hole .
The props to the housing market provided by the GSEs and FHA are a direct transfer of losses from banks to the Federal Government just like loan modification programs .
Whether it stablizes the market or not is yet to be seen .
The fact that lenders are being bailed out of future losses is certain .
Losses from 2009 and 2010 vintage loans will all be covered by the US Taxpayer .
Meanwhile , the default rate on low - down - payment FHA loans is a staggering 20 % on loans written in 2008 – after the housing bust had already unfolded and the risk was undeniable : F.H.A. Problems Raising Concern of Policy Makers : F.H.A. commissioner , David H. Stevens , acknowledged that some 20 percent of F.H.A. loans insured last year — and as many as 24 percent of those from 2007 — faced serious problems including foreclosure .
The Federal government has thus shown that it is so committed to propping up an unsustainable policy and housing market that it is ready to write off 1 in every 4 mortgages within a year of origination .
The problem with that willingness to absorb risk for the sake of incentivizing borrowing for home ownership is that next year another 20 % will default , and then the following year another 20 % will default , and by year Five the vast majority of those loans backed by FHA will be in default .
The theory is that the FHA buying will become the support the market needs to put in a durable bottom and prevent the 20 % default year after year .
It might work — if kool aid intoxication can form a durable bottom .
I have always stated it takes cashflow investors with a genuine reason to buy ( outside of kool aid intoxication ) to bring enough buyers to the market to stabilize pricing .
The government has changed the dynamics of the trade .
Instead of waiting for cashflow valuations to prompt buyers , the government is handing out 3.5 % down payment mortgages and allowing people to take speculative option positions for little cost .
The program does not entice cashflow buyers who will withstand a decline in price , it seduces the kool aid intoxicated who will bail if their position moves against them .
FHA Facing " Cataclysmic " Default Rates : The Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) has guaranteed about 25 % of all new U.S. mortgages written in 2009 , up from just 2 % in 2005 .
The key phrase here is " borrowing , " not " home ownership . "
The key feature of State support of housing is not legitimate " home ownership , " it is the enabling of massive new sources of income and transactional churn for lenders and Wall Street loan and derivatives packagers .
Home " ownership " when there is no equity in the purchase and no equity being built via principal payments is a simulacrum of ownership .
I wrote about this phenomenon in Money Rentership : Housing and the New American Dream .
" Since lenders behave like owners of a borrower 's real estate , and since lenders have right to force sale if a borrower defaults , lenders are owners , and owners are money renters . "
A property with no equity position is renting ; it is either renting money or renting property .
Renting money feels better because at least their is hope of free money later through appreciation .
If a buyer puts almost no money into the purchase–even now , FHA and VA loans can be had with a mere 3 % down payment–and the loan is of the interest - only or adustable - rate ( ARM ) variety favored during the housing bubble 's heyday , then there is no principal payment being made and thus no equity being built .
These " buyers " do n't " own " anything ; all they 're doing is renting the money in the hopes that rising home prices will create equity for them out of thin air .
What they " own " is essentially an option on a property which they " rent " monthly .
If the government manages to reinflate the housing bubble ( it wo n't , but hope and greed spring eternal ) , then the option will pay off handsomely .
The " owner " put no money into the speculative bet , but they can then sell their option for a huge profit .
If housing plummets , then the " bet " was lost .
But since " renting " the mortgage did n't cost much more than renting a real house , and there was no capital at risk , then the downside is modest indeed .
The author is aptly describing Mortgages as Options .
" Mortgages took on the characteristics of options contracts in the Great Housing Bubble .
Speculators utilized 100 % financing and Option ARMs with low teaser rates to minimize the acquisition and holding costs of a particular property .
The small amount they were paying was the “ call premium ” they were providing the lender .
If prices went up , the speculator got to keep all the gains from appreciation , and if prices went down , the speculator could simply walk away from the mortgage and only lose the cost of the payments made , particularly when this debt was a non-recourse , purchase - money mortgage .
Another method speculators and homeowners alike used was the “ put ” option refinance .
Late in the bubble when prices were near their peak , many homeowners refinanced their properties and took out 100 % of the equity in their homes .
In the process , they were buying a “ put ” from the lender : if prices went down ( which they did , ) they already had the sales proceeds as if they had actually sold the property at the peak ; if prices went up , they got to keep those profits as well .
The only price for this “ put ” option was the small increase in monthly payments they had to make on the large sum they refinanced .
If fact , on a relative cost basis , the premium charged to these speculators and homeowners was a small fraction of the premiums similar options cost on stocks . "
In other words , heavily subsidized mortgages at low rates with little money down incentivizes not home " ownership " but speculation in credit - based bubbles .
In the " old days " ( circa 1994 ) , the expectation was that equity would be built by paying off the mortgage principal over time .
Equity was a result of reducing the mortgage due , not the result of speculative gambling on future asset bubbles .
I wrote about the Ponzis all week .
The defining characteristic of housing bubble Ponzis is their belief that income and wealth come with no sacrifice or effort .
Free money is showered upon those who speculate by purchasing residential real estate .
They do n't need to save or be frugal ; they obtain all their entitlements through borrowed money rather than industrious contribution to society .
… The key feature of middle class wealth is thrift , not massive leveraged debt .
What Washington and its financial Power Elite partners presented as " the road to middle class wealth " was in fact a mere chimera , a simulacrum of the road to middle class wealth .
That road is fiscal prudence and thrift .
Immigrants have prospered in the U.S. for generations because they were thrifty and sacrificed for their children by sweating blood to save money for college educations and for 20 % down payments on homes .
They did not prosper by snagging Central State supported mortgages with no down payment on homes they could not afford under any prudent calculation of risk .
From this point of view , the entire " home ownership is for everyone " policy was a gigantic fraud , a con job sold to an American public greedy for a short - cut to middle class wealth .
The bankers and the Central State government both profited immensely , as the bankers and Wall Street minted tens of billions in profits off the mortgage machine and its derivative spin-offs , and the government ( at all levels , Federal , state and local ) gorged on billions of dollars in transfer fees , capital gains taxes and the sales taxes on all the gewgaws home " owners " bought to fill up their new McMansions .
The California Economy Is Dependent Upon Ponzi Borrowers .
The transition from a Ponzi economy to a thrift economy will be painful , and the economic malaise will drag on for quite some time .
Today 's featured owner spent $ 360,000 of his middle class wealth
Today 's featured property was purchased on 6/27/2000 for $ 610,000 .
The owners used a $ 610,000 loan according to my records .
It is unusual to see a 100 % first mortgage , particularly in 2000 .
Kool aid did not seduce them until late .
On 1/27/2005 they refinanced with a $ 595,000 first mortgage and a $ 100,000 HELOC .
To this point , the owners were still paying down their mortgage .
Apparently , that HELOC got them going .
On 9/13/2005 they opened a HELOC for $ 200,000 .
On 12/21/2005 the wife borrows $ 250,000 in a stand - alone second .
On 6/29/2006 , the couple refinanced with a $ 900,000 Option ARM with a 2.5 % teaser rate .
On 8/3/2006 , they obtained a $ 70,000 HELOC .
Total property debt is $ 970,000 plus negative amortization .
Total mortgage equity withdrawal is $ 360,000 .
They have been squatting since late last year .

Debt destruction or wage inflation are the answers
I believe only two reasonable solutions to this problem exist ; either the debt gets destroyed through bank write - offs and debt destruction , or workers see massive wage inflation to make the debt affordable .
I have seen many articles suggesting that inflation is the cure , but that is n't accurate .
Price inflation in the absence of wage inflation merely lowers everyone 's standard of living and would cause widespread debt destruction as the over - burdened are crushed .
Wage inflation without price inflation would be a miraculous panacea ; house prices could get pushed back up to peak levels , and borrowers would still have disposible income without HELOC borrowing .
With massive unemployment , wage inflation does not look iminent , and without it , debt destruction becomes the only viable option .
Short term , expect to see a great deal of squatting while the lenders remain in denial .

SKATTEN MÅ OPP : Det mener SVs nestleder Bård Vegar Solhjell .
Foto : TROND SOLBERG
SV har hastverk med å øke skatten
Eldrebølgen som vil slå inn over oss gjør at det er nødvendig å øke skattenivået i god tid for å sikre velferdssystemet også i framtiden , mener nestleder Bård Vegar Solhjell i Sosialistisk Venstreparti .
Oppdatert 28 . mai 2010
Artikkelen er over ti år gammel
- Når eldrebølgen slår inn må vi ha så gode offentlige velferdsordninger at folk fortsatt vil ha dem , sier Solhjell til Klassekampen .
Eldrebølgen vil ramme Norge i løpet av ti år .
Samtidig øker levealderen slik at offentlige utgifter til pleie og omsorg vil skyte i været .
Solhjell tror ikke dette betyr at det må kuttes i velferdstilbudet .
Tvert om mener han at velferdsstaten må rustes opp for å møte de nye utfordringene .
- Jeg er villig til å vedde et halvt statsbudsjett på at folk vil ha bedre helse - og omsorgstjenester i framtiden :
Dette handler ikke bare om finansiering , vi må også ha en politisk velferdsmobilisering , sier Solhjell .
Den rødgrønne regjeringen har gjennom skatteløftet fryst skattenivået i Norge .
Men etter at stortingsperioden utløper mener Solhjell det haster å øke skattene .
- Skattenivået må opp .
Det trenger ikke skje akkurat nå , men i tiårsperioden som kommer må skattene øke .
Når eldrebølgen slår inn , må folk være villige til å betale for velferden .
Da må vi ruste opp de offentlige helse - og omsorgstjenestene nå , sier han .
- Vi må gå åpent ut og si til folk at de blir nødt til å betale mer .
Samtidig må vi vise folk hva de får igjen for skatten .
Vi må ha en tettere kobling mellom innbetalingen og helsesektoren , forklarer han videre .

For all of the shouts and cries from conservatives about " bailouts " , GM has just proven the wisdom of Congress ' decision to lend Federal funds to keep GM afloat until they could get back on their feet .
Today the company paid off their loans from the Canadian and US governments in full , five years early .
The company is paying back the loans “ in full , with interest , years ahead of schedule , ” Whitacre said in an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal .
The two governments hold a majority of the automaker ’s equity , he said .
The repayment shows “ our plan for building a new GM is working , ” Whitacre said .
GM is “ leaner , stronger ” and building new vehicles whose sales have allowed the company to invest more than $ 1.5 billion at 20 plants in the U.S. and Canada , he said .
The GM loans have been a real talking point for conservatives .
In exchange for the loans , the US and Canadian governments took an equity stake in the company as security for the loan .
In any other world , this would be the prudent choice , but in our hysterical 24/7 tea and whine culture , that decision led to cries of " Socialism ! Socialism ! "
In conservative - land , it was somehow better to allow one of our core industries to fail , to more or less end any competition between US companies , and throw 2 million people out of work , not to mention the support industries around GM 's manufacturing and sales business .
I 'd say it was an investment worth making .
By getting GM the cash they needed to stay afloat and restructure , they 've emerged stronger , more competitive , and poised to compete .
Anyone who follows me on Twitter knows I 'm a huge fan of the Chevy Volt and am still jonesing for the opportunity to take it for a test spin .
I gave up my Honda a year ago and walk everywhere right now .
I 'm not planning to buy another car until I can buy the Volt or something as cool as the Volt .
Cheers , GM , and congratulations !
It 's good to see you roaring back .
Oklahoma Sets a Renewable Energy Standard !
May 17th , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
Oklahoma , the state that gave the world Senator James “ global warming is a hoax ” Inhofe ( R - Big Oil ) , has just passed a proposed 15 % by 2015 Renewable Energy Standard , in the House .
The Oklahoma Energy Security
Act would have to pass its Senate too , to be the law .
Or , as Senator Inhofe has described clean energy legislation ; be “ a job - killing agenda . ”
If it does pass the state Senate , this would make Oklahoma a trailblazer among most Southern states , in passing legislation to add clean renewable power , albeit as a “ goal . ”
The bill is unusual in that it encourages the development of natural gas , not normally considered a “ renewable ” source , but still one that has about half the global warming properties of coal .
[ social_buttons ]
In the 35 states that now have a Renewable Energy Standard ( RES ) , greenhouse gases have been lowered , compared with states that have no legislation , and green jobs created by adding more renewable power .
Four of the RES states have actually achieved ambitious European - scale greenhouse gas reductions below 1990 levels – while growing their economies an average of 65 % .
The measure by House Speaker Chris Benge of Tulsa seeks to reduce dependence on foreign oil and increase domestic energy and renewable energy production in Oklahoma and elsewhere .
The state is blessed with wind potential that was understood even back in the pioneering days .
The legislation calls for 15 percent of all electricity generated in Oklahoma by 2015 be produced from renewable energy like wind , solar and geothermal sources , all of which the state has in abundance .
The DOE supplied $ 3 million in geothermal exploration to Oklahoma in the Recovery Act stimulus , to help jump - start a geothermal industry in the state .
Inhofe has more funding from the fossil industry than any other Senator , at $ 2,182,631 .
But back at home , the Oklahoma Oklahoma Energy Security Act passed the House 91 - 2 Monday and will now go to the state Senate .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
The Songwriters Guild of America has a message for the government : start prosecuting file - sharers , both criminally and civilly , because file - sharing is much worse than bank robbery .
" There are numerous economic crimes of much lesser magnitude ( such as bank robbery ) that are routinely and fully investigated , for which law enforcement agencies such as the FBI have significant resources , " complains the Guild ( PDF ) .
" By contrast , online copyright piracy dwarfs bank robbery in causing economic losses , yet the FBI has limited criminal investigative interest and no civil mandate whatsoever to pursue this devastating economic harm .
This inequity must change . "
The Guild demands that the Department of Justice make criminal prosecutions of " willful copyright infringement " a higher priority ; right now , the issue is not classed as a " serious " crime .
" Unfortunately , this misguided attitude allows domestic and foreign pirates to decimate an industry — intellectual property — where the United States enjoys a true global competitive advantage , " says the group .
In addition , the federal government should do whatever it takes to start bringing civil copyright lawsuits against online offenders , something that is currently up to the private sector .
This would require a change to the law ; something along these lines was considered in the PRO - IP Act , but was ultimately scrapped before passage .
The Guild contends that its members simply are n't able to " sue thousands of infringers in the Federal Courts " — but the government could .
( And should . )
The suggestions were all directed at the new Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator in the White House , Victoria Espinel , whose position was created by the PRO - IP Act .
Espinel is currently working on her legally mandated Joint Strategic Plan to bring all the forces of government to bear on counterfeiters , pirates , and trade secret thieves .
She asked for public comment — and wow , is she getting it .
Still , the Songwriters Guild had nothing on the MPAA , RIAA , and other " creative community organizations , " all of whom suggested to Espinel ( PDF ) that good ways to deal with online piracy include using :

CATHERINE TALESE rides her bicycle everywhere — to work , to the theater , out to dinner — and always has a helmet on her head .
“ There was a time when I did n’t wear a helmet ; I thought I looked like a dork , ” Ms. Talese , a freelance photography director who lives in Manhattan , told me recently .
“ But I ’ve realized it ’s not negotiable .
Helmets are really your only safety gear in a city where pedestrians and drivers are still learning to share the road with bikers . ”
Whether you ride on hectic city streets or bucolic back roads , helmets are essential armor .
Bicycle helmets have been shown to reduce the risk of head injuries by up to 88 percent and facial injuries by 65 percent , according to a Cochrane Database Systemic Review published in 2000 .
Bike riders who play against those odds do not fare well in accidents .
More than 90 percent of the 714 bicyclists killed in 2008 were not wearing helmets , according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety .
Even a light blow to the head can be serious .
“ You do n’t have to be going fast to hurt your brain , ” said Dr. Angela F. Gardner , president of the American College of Emergency Physicians .
A simple concussion can be debilitating , keeping you off the job or operating at half speed for weeks .
“ And every concussion increases the likelihood that you will have an injury to the brain if another concussion occurs , ” Dr. Gardner said .
The National became popular in a very traditional way : by releasing some really good albums , then touring the hell out of them .
They 're boilerplate indie , free of hot new genre tags or feature - ready backstories , which is something their detractors derive great joy from pointing out .
If the National are important , rather than merely good , it 's for writing about the type of lived - in moments that rock bands usually do n't write about that well .
The characters in National songs have real jobs , have uninteresting sex , get drunk , and lie to one another .
They do so during the regular course of a workaday week , on Tuesdays and Wednesdays .
The National are n't " dad - rock " so much as " men 's magazine rock " : music chiefly interested in the complications of being a stable person expected to own certain things and dress certain ways .
On the National 's fifth album , High Violet , those constraints are starting to wear on them , which makes a lot of sense : they wear on most people .
In between patches of obtuse imagery , singer Matt Berninger sounds increasingly self - destructive .
The record 's upbeat numbers do n't cheer him up so much as commiserate with him .
All of this makes High Violet a dark affair , even for a band with a reputation for sad - bastard melodrama .
The National have never sounded triumphant , but they can still be reassuring , with Berninger 's lyrics acting as salves for our own neuroses .
Six drinks in , tired of your coworkers , wishing you could just go home and laugh at sitcoms with someone ?
Maybe get laid ?
The National 's got your back .
With an ever rising profile and plenty of indie - famous friends -- Sufjan Stevens and Bon Iver 's Justin Vernon guest here -- the National were afforded the opportunity to obsess over High Violet .
They could 've holed up and recorded an idiosyncratic , expectation - defying mess .
Instead they produced an ornate , fussed - over record that sounds like no one other than themselves .
Given the amount of flack they take for being a no - frills bore , simply refining their sound was arguably the braver option .
They miss , occasionally -- the string - drenched closer , " Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks " , is too decadent for its own good -- but mostly , they construct gorgeous , structurally sound vignettes .
There are few bands that could craft a song like " Sorrow " -- in which emotion acts as a character and the band turns Berninger 's balladry into a well paced jog -- without stumbling over their own ambitions .
The guitars on " Afraid of Everyone " actually sound nervous ; " England " speaks of cathedrals over properly magisterial drums .
These are triumphs of form .
Berninger is still , for the most part , a socially obsessed claustrophobe .
He has upper - class guilt on " Lemonworld " ( " Cousins and cousins somewhere overseas / But it 'll take a better war to kill a college man like me , " " This pricey stuff makes me dizzy " ) .
" Bloodbuzz Ohio " 's magnificent chorus ( " I still owe money / To the money / To the money I owe " ) addresses the familiar , harrowing financial burdens of adulthood .
He 's best when he tones down the angst in favor of reflection or confusion .
High Violet seems less likely to engender the personal connections of Boxer , but it's also bigger and more engaging -- a possibly offputting combination for a band following the footsteps of Echo and the Bunnymen , Wilco , and Arcade Fire .
After all , eagerness often trumps execution , and the National are n't immune :
For his part , Berninger looks increasingly like Dos Equis ' Most Interesting Man in the World , and his cryptic lyrics seem like an application for the title .
But the National rarely miss ; when they aim for powerful or poetic , they get there .
High Violet is the sound of a band taking a mandate to be a meaningful rock band seriously , and they play the part so fully that , to some , it may be off - putting .
But these are n't mawkish , empty gestures ; they 're anxious , personal songs projected onto wide screens .
Even if you do n't consider yourself an upwardly mobile stiff with minor social anxiety , the National make it sound grand , confusing , and relatable .
Storm were recently asked to create a local office finder for franchised business VoIP provider , Datasharp .
The client requested that the user should be able to enter their postcode or town / city and be informed where their nearest branch was .
To make this possible we would need the latitude and longitude co-ordinates for each office and the customer , but how do you get the co-ordinates from the address ?
Using the Google Maps API
Note :
To make use of the example in the post you will need to sign - up for a free Google Maps API Key .
The following example is written in C# , but it can be converted to any language fairly trivially as we are actually only making an HTTP request and parsing the result .
We use a little helper class to hold a latitude / longitude co-ordinate .
public class LatLng { public double Latitude { get ; set ; } public double Longitude { get ; set ; public LatLng ( ) { } public LatLng ( double lat , double lng ) { this .
Latitude = lat ; this .
Longitude = lng ; } }
We ’ve packaged the function to get the co-ordinates in a helper class so that we can add extra Google Maps functionality if required .
It also allows us to reuse the code across multiple projects as the API key is not hard coded .
using System ; using System .IO ; using System .
Net ; using System .
Web ; using Storm.Common .
Utils .
Extensions ; public class GoogleMaps { private string API_KEY = string .
Empty ; public GoogleMaps ( string api_key ) { this .
API_KEY = api_key ; } public void SetApiKey ( string key ) { if ( key.IsNullOrEmpty ( ) ) { throw new ArgumentException ( " API Key is invalid " ) ; } this .
API_KEY = key ; } /// < summary > ///
Perform a geocode lookup of an address /// </ summary > /// < param name = " addr " >
The address in CSV form line1 , line2 , postcode </ param > /// < param name= " output " >CSV or XML </ param > /// < returns > LatLng object</returns > public LatLng GetLatLng ( string addr ) { var url = " http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/geo?output=csv&key= " + this .
API_KEY + " &q= " + HttpContext.Current.Server.UrlEncode( addr ) ; var request = WebRequest . Create ( url ) ; var response = ( HttpWebResponse) request.
GetResponse( ) ; if ( response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.OK ) { var ms = new Memory Stream ( ) ; var responseStream = response.
GetResponseStream ( ) ; var buffer = new Byte [ 2048 ] ; int count = responseStream .
Read ( buffer , 0 , buffer .
Length ) ; while ( count > 0 ) { ms .
Write ( buffer , 0 , count ) ; count = responseStream .
Read ( buffer , 0 , buffer .
Length ) ; } responseStream .
Close ( ) ; ms. Close ( ) ; var responseBytes = ms. ToArray ( ) ; var encoding = new System .
Text . ASCIIEncoding ( ) ; var coords = encoding .
GetString( responseBytes ) ; var parts = coords .
Split ( " , " ) ; return new LatLng ( Convert. ToDouble ( parts [ 2 ] ) , Convert. ToDouble ( parts [ 3 ] ) ) ; } return null ; } }
Let ’s talk through whats going on .
First up , the boring bit :
private string API_KEY = string .
Empty ; public GoogleMaps ( string api_key ) { this .
API_KEY = api_key ; } public void SetApiKey ( string key ) { if ( key.IsNullOrEmpty ( ) ) { throw new ArgumentException ( " API Key is invalid " ) ; } this .
API_KEY = key ; }
Here we have a private field to store the Maps API key required to issue a request .
The key can be set either through the constructor or by using the SetApiKey ( ) function .
Now lets see how we use this in the lookup function .
var url = " http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/geo?output=csv&key= " + this .
API_KEY + " &q= " + HttpContext.Current.Server.UrlEncode( addr ) ; var request = WebRequest . Create ( url ) ; var response = ( HttpWebResponse) request.
GetResponse( ) ;
First , we build the a URL which represents the request we want to make .
The output param sets the format Google will return the results , here we have chosen CSV but you can also get JSON if you wish .
Next we include our API key to identify ourselves .
Finally , we pass the address we are searching for .
Using this URL we create a WebRequest and call GetResponse to fetch the page contents .
Before we go any further we check that the result was returned successfully :
if ( response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode .OK )
Now we have another boring bit which reads the result of the web request into a byte array and converts the result into an ASCII encoded string
var ms = new MemoryStream ( ) ; var responseStream = response .
GetResponseStream ( ) ; var buffer = new Byte [ 2048 ] ; int count = responseStream .
Read ( buffer , 0 , buffer .
Length ) ; while ( count > 0 ) { ms .
Write ( buffer , 0 , count ) ; count = responseStream .
Read ( buffer , 0 , buffer .
Length ) ; } responseStream .
Close ( ) ; ms. Close ( ) ; var responseBytes = ms. ToArray ( ) ; var encoding = new System .
Text. ASCIIEncoding ( ) ; var coords = encoding .
GetString( responseBytes ) ;
This string should look something like :
200,5,51.2268219,-2.4646913
We are interested in the 3rd and 4th values – the latitude and longitude .
So , we split the string at the comma separator , create a new LatLng object and return the result :
var parts = coords .

In a truly David and Goliath battle , the people of El Salvador are fighting against a Canadian mining giant that was lawfully denied permits for a gold and silver mine that would devastate the local environment and threaten the health and livelihoods of native residents .
Next week , the World Bank will decide if the mining giant can pursue its greedy demands for payment under an industry - friendly trade rule that would force El Salvador to pay a huge penalty for blocking the project .
Vancouver - based Pacific Rim Mining Corp. has been exploring for gold and silver in the El Dorado region of El Salvador since 2002 .
That year , corporate gold diggers hit the jackpot when Dayton Mining discovered a gold and silver deposit at El Dorado , which lies 40 miles east of El Salvador ’s capital city San Salvador .
Pacific Rim immediately merged with Dayton Mining and forged ahead with further exploration drilling .
But the people of El Salvador soon rose up against this destructive project when word spread about its potential impact on local communities : water contamination from cyanide and other toxic mining chemicals , heavy industrial activity in an area sacred to native residents , and other red flags associated with allowing a foreign company to extract profits by exploiting the land and people of El Salvador .
In 2008 , the El Salvadoran government refused to grant Pacific Rim permits to continue mining at El Dorado , after an intense campaign by regional authorities , church leaders , and local grassroots organizations like the National Coalition Against Metals Mining .
The impacts of mining on local water sources and the health of locals had been apparent since exploration got under way , and the public no longer stayed silent about the risks of further exploitation of El Salvador ’s resources .
Opposition to the mining project received a boost with the election of President Mauricio Funes , who vowed not to approve any such permits .
Funes , who assumed office in June 2009 , has said , “ It ’s very simple : my government will not authorize any extractive mining project . ”
This was very bad news for mining companies who have filed permit applications on 25 projects seeking to extract 12 million ounces of gold and 78 million ounces of silver , a process that would require an estimated 22 million liters of water and 950 tons of cyanide .
President Funes ’ resolve sent a strong message that El Salvador is no longer interested in supporting the destruction of its own environment to benefit the bottom line of foreign corporations .
That stance was hardly pleasing to Pacific Rim , and the situation deteriorated into mayhem when three anti-mining activists were murdered between June and December 2009 , allegedly at the behest of Pacific Rim managers .
Local anti-mining activist Marcelo Rivera was apparently tortured prior to being killed .
Ramiro Rivera , the vice president of the Environmental Committee of Cabanas , was assassinated in front of his daughter , along with Environmental Committee member Dora Alicia Sorto Recinos , who was eight months pregnant and carrying her 2 - year - old child when she was struck down .
President Funes has promised to investigate and “ clear up ” the gruesome murders .
While the murders remain unsolved officially , the stakes have risen higher in recent months .
In a show of its dedication to screw the people of El Salvador , Pacific Rim Mining Corp. hired D.C. - based white - shoe law firm Crowell & Morring LLP to help file a lawsuit against the Republic of El Salvador seeking $ 700 million in compensation for lost investment , under provisions in the Central America Free Trade Agreement ( CAFTA ) with the U.S .
On May 31 , in a World Bank courtroom in Washington D.C. , Pacific Rim will unleash its lawyers to fight against the wishes of the people of El Salvador in search of a huge payout for “ profit infringement . ”
The World Bank ’s International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes ( ICSID ) will decide whether to let Pacific Rim ’s case move forward .
So -called “ free trade ” agreements like NAFTA and CAFTA provide protection for U.S. and Canadian extractive companies who seek to exploit the wealth buried beneath the soil of poorer Latin American countries .
Despite the lofty rhetoric about the intentions behind these trade agreements , in practice these skewed mechanisms have hurt instead of helped El Salvador and other nations , whose control over local resource - management decisions has been hijacked by the World Bank .
Yesterday , May 27 , was the International Day of Action Against Mining and Free Trade in El Salvador .
Salvadorans and allies in this fight from around the world are standing up against corporate extortion , colonialism , and environmental destruction in Latin America .
Will the voice of the El Salvadoran people be heard in Washington ?
Or will the greed of Canadian mining company Pacific Rim Mining Corp.
prevail yet again in the battle of extractive multinationals against the will of democratic society ?
This headline is not from The Onion :
US appoints first cyber warfare general : Pentagon creates specialist online unit to counter cyber attack amid growing fears of militarisation of the internet .
On Friday , newly - created U.S. Cyber Command — that 's USCYBERCOM to those in the know — got itself a general .
One small problem :
It 's not clear that anyone , even four - star general and National Security Agency head Keith Alexander , knows what U.S. Cyber Command is supposed to do now that it exists .
The commerical Internet has been around since about 1995 , but in recent years folks at the Pentagon and White House seem to have been struck with a similar thought : " Hey , we should do something about those Internets , huh ? "
The longing for a cyber command of some kind dates back at least to President George W. Bush , and the project continued merrily along under President Barack Obama with the inexorable force of a government program that nobody really wants , but no one wants to be the one to kill .
The lack of clarity on Cyber Command 's mission has dogged the enterprise from the beginning , and it's a condition that does n't seem to have been resolved in advance of the appointment of a general to run the operation and an official launch last week .
An ad campaign in February 2008 announced the Air Force 's plans to " dominate air , space , and cyberspace , " explaining that the " Cold War has given way to cyber war . "
( The page promoting that cyber dominance campaign now — fittingly — generates a 404 error . )
The service even changed its mission statement to read , " As Airmen , it is our calling to dominate Air , Space , and Cyberspace . "
These days , the mission statement available on snazzy , slow - loading airforce.com is " The mission of the United States Air Force is to fly , fight and win … in air , space and cyberspace . "
The ad campaign and mission statement change seem to have been an overly hasty land grab by the Air Force , and by August 2008 Wired 's Noah Shactman was reporting that at a crucial June conference " the command 's emerging leaders could n't agree on what exactly the new unit would do . "
Possibilities included " protection and defense of the Air Force 's command and control abilities . "
Or perhaps the " mission is to control cyberspace both for attacks and defense . "
The scope was also open for debate : " Some believed the Cyber Command would only be responsible for computer networks , " wrote Shactman .
" Others thought it'd be responsible for every system that had anything to do with the electromagnetic spectrum — up to and including laser weapons . "
The confusion seemed so impenetrable that Shactman ( or his editors , at any rate ) declared that the program had been suspended .
But Cyber Command was back to life soon enough , mission or no mission .
And on Friday , along with the appointment of a head of operations , 30,000 airmen have been reassigned to the Air Force Cyber Command .
Cyber Command is set to be fully operational in October .
Alexander says he has only modest goals for Cyber Command for now .
The glasses - wearing commander - in - geek seems to be content with the role of The World 's Most Powerful IT Guy for the moment .
But that 's no bulwark against excesses by his successors — or his superiors , for that matter .
" This is not about efforts to militarize cyberspace , " he said in April .
" Rather it 's about safeguarding the integrity of our military system .
My goal if confirmed will be to significantly improve the way we defend ourselves in this domain . "
But according to a Pentagon " fact sheet , " Alexander is authorized to use deadly force : Cyber Command will " direct the operations and defence of specified Department of Defense information networks [ involving some 90,000 military personnel ] and prepare to , when directed , conduct full - spectrum military cyberspace operations in order to enable actions in all domains , [ to ] ensure US allied freedom of action in cyberspace and deny the same to our adversaries . "
Some major players support even more aggressive measures : " The United States is fighting a cyber - war today , and we are losing , " former National Security Agency chief Mike McConnell wrote in The Washington Post on February 28 this year .
" It 's that simple . "
But the reality is far from simple .
If the government wants to thoroughly track online activity , McConnell admits , " we need to re-engineer the Internet to make attribution , geo-location , intelligence analysis and impact assessment — who did it , from where , why and what was the result — more manageable " [ emphasis added ] .
That 's right : Re-engineer one of the most popular and revolutionary new technologies of our time , to allow the government to get in on the business of data security .
During the Bush administration , McConnell prompted Bush to sign a secret order to erect firewalls and build malware into military gear .
Under Obama he's at it again , lobbying for cyber - war from a private sector perch .
Last month , The Washington Independent asked Dennis Blair , the nation 's top intelligence officer until his resignation becomes effective on Friday , if U.S. Cyber Command and the intelligence community had established clear divisions of legal and policy authority or responsibility .
" It 's a really dynamic area , " Blair replied .
" Technology has developed far faster than [ the ] legal or policy framework … .
We 'll do what we have to to get it done . "
In other words , conflict between the Pentagon and the intelligence services is likely .
Striking the we have no idea what 's going on gong once more , former CIA director Michael V. Hayden told The Washington Post : " Cyber was moving so fast that we were always in danger of building up precedent before we built up policy . "
Wondering what a concrete example of cyber warfighting might look like ?
In early 2008 , right around the time that the Air Force was making a bold move for the Cyber Command account , a Fort Meade - based team called the Joint Functional Component Command - Network Warfare which operates under a program called Countering Adversary Use of the Internet decided it was time to take out a " honeypot " site put up by the U.S. to draw in potential terrorists and gather intelligence , and in doing so — over the CIA 's objections — inadvertently took out 300 servers in Saudi Arabia , Germany , and Texas .
Even this modest operation wound up breeding institutional conflict , technical failure , and may have harmed national security more than it helped .
Alexander has a big job on his hands .
And as preparations for the coming amorphous cyber war ramp up , we 'd better hope the worst of the collateral damage is some interrupted Netflix streaming in Texas .

* Areva signs deal to help build at least 4 EPR plants
* Signs co-operation agreement with Techint Group
( Adds detail )
PARIS , April 9 ( Reuters ) - French nuclear power group Areva CEPFi .
PA signed a deal with Ansaldo Energia on Friday to work on an Enel - EDF project to build at least four EPR reactors to help revive Italy 's nuclear power industry .
The Italian government , which pulled out of nuclear energy after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine , now aims to get 25 percent of its electricity from nuclear power .
The four nuclear plants would cover about half of the country ’s needs .
Friday ’s agreement coincided with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ’s visit to Paris .
EDF EDF .
PA and Enel ENEI .
MI will act as investors and architect engineers for the Italian project and use Areva 's technology .
Areva said it had also agreed to co-operate on future nuclear projects worldwide with the Techint Group , a conglomerate of international companies that help design and build large industrial facilities .
With its 58 nuclear power reactors , France is the world ’s second - largest producer of nuclear energy after the United States .
Italy gave final approval in February to a decree paving the way to start work on new plants in 2013 and nuclear production by 2020 .
Areva said it had also signed an agreement with the CIRTEN Italian inter-university consortium for nuclear research and technology to promote exchanges and student visits .

Arrest warrants for 3 cops over torture case By Wang Jingqiong and Shi Baoyin ( China Daily )
Updated : 2010-05-13 06:51
ZHENGZHOU - Authorities in Henan province have issued arrest warrants for three police officers suspected of torturing Zhao Zuohai , a man who was wrongfully convicted of murder and jailed about 10 years .
Two of the officers , Guo Shouhai and Zhou Minghan , have been detained while the third cop , Li Deling , is still at large .
They are suspected of torturing Zhao , 57 , into confessing to a murder 10 years ago .
Wang Jianmin , Party chief of the political and legislative aff airs committee of Shangqiu city , shakes hands with Zhao Zuohai ( front left ) on May 11 , 2010 .
Wang apologized to Zhao for a wrongful conviction that jailed him for the past decade .
[ China Daily ]
Authorities have also started a probe into the wrongful imprisonment on Wednesday , said Song Guoqiang , an official with the people 's procuratorate in Shangqiu city .
Song said the procuratorate has questioned everyone else involved in Zhao 's conviction at the local public security bureau , procuratorate and court .
The Henan Provincial Higher People 's Court has also promised to penalize the judges responsible for the wrongful conviction .
Authorities apologized to Zhao Zuohai on Tuesday and gave him 10,000 yuan ( $ 1,464 ) in compensation .
He is expected to receive further compensation in accordance with the State compensation law .
The amount will work out to be about 450,000 yuan ( $ 65,904 ) .
In October 1997 , Zhao Zuohai and his neighbor Zhao Zhenshang had a fight in their home county of Zhecheng , after which Zhao Zhenshang went missing , a court statement showed .
A year later , in May 1999 , a headless and highly decomposed body was found in the village .
Zhao Zuohai was arrested and convicted in 2002 of murdering Zhao Zhenshang .
He was sentenced to death with a two - year reprieve .
The sentence was later commuted to a 29 - year imprisonment .
Zhao Zhenshang returned to the village on April 30 this year .
The Higher People 's Court in Henan confirmed Zhao Zhenshang 's identity on May 7 and acquitted Zhao Zuohai .
Zhao Zuohai said on Tuesday he was tortured to confess the murder , saying that police beat him with a long stick , set off fireworks over his head , handcuffed him on a stool and would not let him sleep for about a month .
" They taught me how to plead guilty .
They told me to repeat what they said , and I had to , or I would be beaten " , Zhao said .
" They wrote down what I repeated and said it was my confession . "
Zhao said he did not appeal because he was afraid of getting beaten .
" In jail , others treated me better because I 'm an old man .
At least nobody beat me there . "
Zhao 's case has triggered heated discussion among legal analysts on preventing torture in interrogation and the necessity of improving supervision in the legal system .
" Although the case occurred 10 years ago , it is a reminder of the legal environment and its mechanism " , said Zhao Binzhi , director of the law school of Beijing Normal University .
" Torture in interrogation still exists today .
It is not rare . "
Fan Chongyi , a law professor from the China University of Political Science and Law , said videos and recordings should be made and suspects ' lawyers should be present during interrogation .
Courts should also refuse evidence gained through violent and illegal means .
" We hope some amendment will be made to the Criminal Procedural Law to establish a functional system to prevent the use of torture in interrogation . "

Emerging from a human toilet
Two - toed sloths have been recorded descending from the trees to feed out of a human toilet .
The extraordinary behaviour , recorded on at least 25 occasions in the Amazon rainforest of Peru , has stumped the biologists who witnessed it .
The sloths either crawl into the latrine to feed from it or scoop out the excrement and waste within .
The feeding habit is even more bizarre as wild sloths are plant eaters not known to feed on animal matter .
Details of the behaviour are published in the journal Mammalian Biology .
MORE ABOUT SLOTHS
See extraordinary pictures of sloths swimming underwater Keep up to date with the latest videos , facts and news about two and three - toed sloths Researchers speculate the sloths must derive some nutritional benefit from their bizarre feeding habit , though it is unclear exactly what that might be .
The behaviour was recorded over a number of years by biologists working at the Estacion Biologica Quebrada Blanco field research site located in the Amazon rainforest in northeastern Peru .
The biologists based there usually study the behaviour and ecology of New World monkeys , including moustached tamarins , saddle - back tamarins and red titi monkeys .
Their camp is a traditionally built hut , with latrines located 20 to 40 m away in the forest .
On the first occasion , a researcher using the latrine saw a two - toed sloth ( Choloepus didactylus ) hanging upside down from the wooden bars that enclose the toilet .
A grounded sloth is a rare sight
It was using one hand to scoop out handfuls of semi-liquid manure , comprising human faeces , urine and toilet paper , and then eating from the hand .
Since that occasion , the scientists have since recorded sloths visiting the latrine on at least 25 other occasions .
Sometimes the sloths entered the pit that formed the latrine , to feed directly from the waste inside , emerging covered in the liquid held within .
Professor Eckhard Heymann of the German Primate Centre based in Gottingen , Germany , who led the team of researchers , told the BBC that they were surprised and astonished by the behaviour .
" The sequence of events was always more or less then same : someone arriving at the latrine , seeing the sloth inside and the sloth feeling disturbed and coming out and moving away , " says Prof Heymann .
SOURCES
Visit Mammalian Biology to access the research paper about sloths using latrines Find out more about Professor Eckhard Heymann 's research
The researchers suspect many individual sloths visited the latrines : on one occasion a mother and baby visited .
Why the sloths decided to visit and feed from the latrines remains a mystery .
Sloths hardly ever come down from the trees in which they live .
Usually they only descend to the forest floor to change trees or once every three to seven days to defecate .
One idea put forward by Prof Heymann 's team is that the human faeces may provide a direct source of nutrients , as faeces can contain variable amounts of fibre and energy in the form of proteins , sugars and fatty acids .
Another is that the sloths visit to acquire sodium or other minerals in the waste , in the same way that some animals visit salt licks .
Heading for the trees after visiting the toilet
The third proposal is that the sloths may be eating insect larvae that grow among the waste .
While wild sloths are plant eaters , captive sloths have been known to accept meat and fish in their food , suggesting the animals may seek out larvae as an additional source of protein .
The odd behaviour may also come at a cost to the sloths , however .
" While at first glance our observations may simply represent a bizarre contribution to the natural history of sloths , they also bear implications for the transmission of disease from humans to wildlife , " the researchers write in the journal .
Two - toed sloths can survive in secondary or disturbed forest close to human settlements .
If other sloths have developed similar tastes for human waste , it could increase the possibility of them acquiring human diseases and parasites .

BBC News , Jerusalem
Shoes and clothes have recently been allowed into Gaza BBC News has seen documents , submitted to an Israeli Court , which give more detail than ever before about how and why Israel maintains its Gaza blockade .
In one document , Israel describes the import curbs as " a central pillar in the armed conflict with Hamas " .
It also confirms estimates were made of how many calories Gazans need , but says these were not used for policy - making .
Israel says the blockade is to pressure Hamas , which does not recognise Israel and backs attacks on its citizens .
Three years ago , after the Islamist Hamas movement seized power , Israel and Egypt tightened their closure of Gaza 's borders , leaving the territory 's 1.5 million inhabitants facing acute shortages .
But Israel has never published a list of banned items , saying it approves requests on a case - by - case basis .
Items allowed have changed over time , which has left humanitarian organisations and commercial importers constantly attempting to guess what will be approved .
The court case has been brought by the Israeli human rights group , Gisha .
The group has been trying , for more than a year , using freedom of information legislation , to squeeze information from the state about what exactly is allowed for import to Gaza , and why .
GOODS ALLOWED INTO GAZA Canned meat and tuna , but not canned fruit Mineral water , but not fruit juice Sesame paste ( tahini ) but not jam Tea and coffee but not chocolate Download the full list [ 89.9 KB ]
Most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here
Guide : Gaza under blockade
In January , Gisha , took the Israeli authorities to court , to try to force them to provide the information .
Gisha 's director , Sari Bashi , says she is no security expert , " but preventing children from receiving toys , preventing manufacturers from getting raw materials - I do n't see how that 's responsive to Israeli security needs . "
And she says that some of the prohibitions appear to be absurdly arbitrary : " I certainly do n't understand why cinnamon is permitted , but coriander is forbidden .
Is there something more dangerous about coriander ?
Is coriander more critical to Gaza 's economy than cinnamon ?
This is a policy that appears to make no sense . "
She argues that if there is a logic behind such decisions , the military should reveal what it is .
' Conflict against Hamas ' Now , after several months ' waiting , the state has given its response to the court , in a written submission , seen by the BBC .
It throws a small pool of light on the process behind the blockade .
The overall rationale is set out , in bold type : " The limitation on the transfer of goods is a central pillar in the means at the disposal of the State of Israel in the armed conflict between it and Hamas . "
The Israeli authorities also confirm the existence of four documents related to how the blockade works : how they process requests for imports into Gaza , how they monitor the shortages within Gaza , their approved list of what is allowed in , and a document entitled " Food Consumption in the Gaza Strip - Red Lines " which sets out the minimum calorie intake needed by Gaza 's million and a half inhabitants , according to their age and sex .
This paper was however , the state insists , just a draft power - point presentation , used for " internal planning work " , which " never served as a basis for the policy of the authority " .
But while the first three documents promise a great deal of detail , that detail is not delivered .
In each case , the state argues that disclosure of what is allowed in and why would , in their words , " damage national security and harm foreign relations " .
It offers , instead , to reveal the contents of the documents to the court in a private session with the judge .
' Collective punishment '
The lack of clarity causes immense frustration not just among Gazans , but among aid groups , diplomats , and the United Nations - which has described Israel 's blockade as " collective punishment "
The problem , they say , is not just the shortages themselves , but the unpredictability and changing nature of what is permitted for import .
Israeli officials have said , in the past , that they are concerned that building materials in particular could be misappropriated by Hamas for military ends .
But some Israeli commentators - even those who advocate a tough stance against Hamas - say that the strategy behind the much wider blockade is ill - defined , and harmful to Israel 's international standing .
The BBC has received information from reliable sources that there are currently 81 items that are approved for import - from kidney beans to tinned meat - and as of March , shoes .
Among the large range of goods currently forbidden are jam , chocolate , wood for furniture , fruit juice , textiles , and plastic toys .
The 13 - page submission by the Israeli authorities to the Tel Aviv District Court raises more questions than it answers .
It does set the context for the blockade : in what Israel considers to be its existential conflict with Hamas .
But it will not satisfy those calling for Israel to be more open about one of its most contentious policies .

History has witnessed that for millions of years humans have spent their entire lives barefoot .
Runners have competed in marathons and have broken the 4 - minute mile barrier , wearing only leather slippers .
Our feet are the creation of nature and a marvel that help in undertaking huge journeys and challenges .
To protect the foot , sometime in 1960s the modern running shoe was invented .
Following the invention of the shoe , the foot became deficient that could not function without arch support and heel cushioning .
As per the experts , though the shoes are great for protecting the feet against rocks , broken glass , and other dangers , however , the shoes have considerably altered the way the feet operate .
While running the heel is built up in the back and is raised several centimeters above the forefoot , this observation was first made by Bill Bowerman , one of the founders of Nike .
He reasoned that a thick bit of rubber underneath the heel would force the runner to land on the heel and shift the weight forward , thereby improving efficiency .
His invention was very important that led to the growth of the modern shoe industry .
With the invention of the modern running shoes , most people assume that landing on the heel must be the natural way of running .
But the latest information suggests that the sophisticated , expensive running shoes might actually be the problem and not the solution .
By implementing more and more barefoot activities , the problems in the foot can be completely cleared up .
Reports also highlight that for populations that habitually walk barefoot ; the problems of the foot of the modern societies are unheard of .
BOSTON —
We begin with a simple truism :
All bombers are losers .
Now consider our list of the top - 10 " loser bombers " — well , nine of them would - be bombers whose equipment , strategy , conviction or brains failed them when it mattered most , and one ( very ) amateur Kamikaze pilot .
What all 10 have in common is beyond question — they failed to achieve much more than either getting arrested or getting killed .
This is by no means an attempt to make light of what were , for the most part , premeditated and violent attacks intended to kill , wreck or maim an unspecified number and type of victim .
Two of the attacks did , indeed , kill a total of seven people .
Rather it's an reminder that the Times Square scare that has dominated international headlines for the better part of a week is only the latest in a long line of thankfully ill - conceived and poorly executed terrorist acts .
While investigators sort out exactly who 's behind it and why , let 's take a trip down memory lane :
1. Times Square bomb attack ( 2010 )
United States authorities are still investigating a thwarted car bombing in New York 's Times Square , but prosecutors have already charged Faisal Shahzad , 30 , a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Pakistan , with five counts , including attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and trying to kill and maim people within the U.S. Shahzad had recently purchased the 1993 Nissan Pathfinder found abandoned in Times Square on May 1 packed with enough fuel , fertilizer and explosives to ignite a massive fireball .
An onboard fuse was left lit and smoldering .
Investigators are hunting for a man who was caught on tape moments after the SUV was ditched ( and subsequently reported to police by a street vendor , unleashing another monster of sorts ) , but a law enforcement official told the AP on Wednesday that the authorities did not believe there were any other suspects in the plot and that several arrests in Pakistan in the past two days were not related .
The authorities have since said that Shahzad , the 30 - year - old son of a retired air force officer in Pakistan , admitted rigging the Pathfinder with a crude bomb of firecrackers , propane and alarm clocks based on explosives training he received in Pakistan .

2. Christmas Day " underpants bomber " ( 2009 )
The method might have been unorthodox , but the motive of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ( a.k.a. " the underpants bomber " ) — a Muslim Nigerian citizen who attempted to detonate plastic explosives hidden in his underwear while on a Northwest flight from Amsterdam to Detroit — seems tiresomely familiar : A direct assault on the U.S. for perceived misdeeds in a foreign land .
According to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , the spin - off terror group that claimed to have trained and equipped Abdulmutallab , the failed attack was a response to American - backed airstrikes targeting its operations in Yemen earlier in the month .
Turns out Abdulmutallab spent significant time in Yemen under the tutelage of Anwar al - Awlaki , who preaches violent uprising against the West and has been linked to some of the most infamous terrorist attacks on American soil , including 9/11 and the Fort Hood shootings .

3. London car bombs ( 2007 )
Two massive car bombs were discovered on June 29 , 2007 , in the heart of London 's West End and disabled before they could be detonated .
Ambulance officers attending a minor incident reported the first car in the early morning in Haymarket after noticing suspicious fumes .
The second device was discovered soon after in the same area of the city after the car carrying it was ticketed for illegal parking and towed .
Staff at the pound noticed a strong smell of petrol and reported the car to police when they heard about the first device .
A close link was established between this attempt and an attack at Glasgow Airort the following day ( see below ) .

4. Glasgow International Airport attack ( 2007 )
Witnesses described a Jeep Cherokee speeding toward the main terminal building at Glasgow Internatonal Airport with flames coming out from underneath .
They also reported seeing two Asian men , one of them on fire , in the car .
The June 30 , 2007 attack , in which an SUV loaded with propane canisters was driven into the glass doors of the airport and set ablaze , constitutes Scotland 's first terrorist incident , if you do n't count the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie .
Police later identified the two men in the Jeep as Bilal Abdullah , a British - born , Muslim doctor of Iraqi descent who was working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital , and Kafeel Ahmed , who was the driver .
One newspaper reported that a suicide note had indicated that the two intended to die in the attack .
Ahmed did eventually die of his injuries , while Abdullah was found guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to 32 years in prison .

5 . Plot to blow up transatlantic airliners ( 2006 )
Their plan was to perpetrate the worst atrocity on civilian life since the 9/11 attacks , the courts were told when a gang of British Muslims went on trial for plotting to detonate suicide bombs on seven transatlantic flights over North America in 2006 .
The flights chosen by the alleged terrorists were scheduled to leave Heathrow International Airport one afternoon carrying almost 2,000 passengers and crew and destined for six American and Canadian cities .
Had the bombers — as many as 18 — succeeded in boarding the planes and detonating over land , the death toll could have eclipsed that of the Twin Towers collapse .
But they did n't , as the alleged plot was foiled when two of the key gang members were arrested by police in a parking lot following several months of surveillance .
What the plotters did achieve was chaos , cancellation and delays at airports across the U.K. and Europe and the introduction of unprecedented restrictions at airports , including prohibitions on carrying liquids onto commercial aircraft .

6. Richard Reid , a.k.a. the " shoe bomber " ( 2001 )
Next time you 're running for a flight but get held up taking your shoes off at the security gate , thank one Richard Colvin Reid .

7. Summer Olympics bombing in Atlanta ( 1996 )
A chance arrest by an alert policeman led to the capture of Eric Robert Rudolph , the lone suspect in the fatal 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing and a series of blasts across the south who had vanished into the North Carolina hills and been hunted for five years .
Rudolph , who had connections since childhood to a number of anti-Semitic , racist and anti-government groups , was charged with detonating homemade bombs that sprayed nails , metal shanks and other shrapnel and killed one woman while wounding 111 at Atlanta 's Centennial Olympic Park .
Between 1996 and 1998 , he also committed a series of bombings — including at a gay nightclub and an abortion clinic — across the southern U.S. that killed two people .
He escaped the death penalty with a plea bargain and after his sentencing ( to four life terms ) released a statement in which he rationalized his actions as serving the cause of anti-abortion and anti-gay activism .

8. World Trade Center bombing ( 1993 )
In what is perhaps the best example of terrorist bungling in recent history , six men who detonated a bomb below the North Tower of New York 's World Trade Center in 1993 failed in their bid to bring down the towers and were swiftly rounded up and brought to justice .
One of the key steps in catching the men was the arrest of one of the bombers when he tried to get a refund of the deposit on the rental truck used in the bombing .
The Feb. 26 attack , which killed six people and wounded 1,042 , was funded in part by the uncle of one of the plotters — Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Ali Fadden , later considered the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks .
Reports of motives vary , but at least one of the men — Ramzi Yousef — spent time in Al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan .
Yousef had reportedly mailed letters to various New York newspapers just before the attack that made three demands : an end to U.S. aid to Israel , an end to diplomatic relations with Israel and a pledge by the U.S. to end interference " with any of the Middle East countries ' interior affairs . "

9 . Plane crash on White House lawn ( 1994 )
Startled uniformed Secret Service officers at the White House reportedly saw the descending single - engine Cessna minutes before it crashed onto the South Lawn on Sept. 13 , 1994 .
Frank Eugene Corder , 38 , a student pilot with a history of alcohol and drug abuse , had stolen the plane from a Baltimore airfield .
President Bill Clinton and his family , staying at Blair House , just north of the mansion , during renovations , were n't even woken as the plane skidded , slammed through the hedge and clipped a tree before hitting a wall on the west side of the White House at 1:49 a.m.
Corder , a high school dropout from Aberdeen and an Army veteran , was killed on impact .
Two weeks before the crash , Corder 's third wife had reportedly left him and he had since been living out of his car , sliding toward deep depression .
Friends reportedly claim he bore no ill will towards Clinton and likely only wanted the publicity of the stunt , based largely on his sentiments toward Mathias Rust — a German man known for his illegal landing near Moscow 's Red Square in a Cessna 172 in 1987 .

10 . Guy Fawkes ( 1605 )
The story of Guy Fawkes and his involvement in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 is well - known and his demise still celebrated each Nov. 5 by Britons with bonfires in which his effigy is burned .
They dress up and set off fireworks , too .
The plot Fawkes led was an attempt by a group of religious conspirators to kill King James I , his family , and most of the members of the House of Lords , by blowing up the British parliament .
The conspirators saw this as a necessary reaction to increasing oppression of English Catholics .
Fawkes was arrested a few hours before the planned explosion after a tip - off in the form of an anonymous warning letter .
The plot did n't stop him , centuries later , from making the rankings of the BBC - sponsored 100 Great British heros ( at number 30 ) ; and a number of rivers and national parks in ex-colonies , and even two Galapagos islands , are named for him .
A note by an unknown author found in the basement of the British Library with a box full of gunpowder which curators said could be the gunpowder intended to be used by Guy Fawkes in his 1605 attempt to blow up Britain 's parliament .

Rather than passing the Senate bill and then passing the fixes , the House will pass the fixes under a rule that says the House " deems " the Senate bill passed after the House passes the fixes .
The virtue of this , for Pelosi 's members , is that they do n't actually vote on the Senate bill .
They only vote on the reconciliation package .
But their vote on the reconciliation package functions as a vote on the Senate bill .
The difference is semantic , but the bottom line is this :
When the House votes on the reconciliation fixes , the Senate bill is passed , even if the Senate has n't voted on the reconciliation fixes , and even though the House never specifically voted on the Senate bill .
It 's a circuitous strategy born of necessity .
Pelosi does n't have votes for the Senate bill without the reconciliation package .
But the Senate parliamentarian said that the Senate bill must be signed into law before the reconciliation package can be signed into law .
That removed Pelosi 's favored option of passing the reconciliation fixes before passing the Senate bill .
So now the House will vote on reconciliation explicitly and the Senate bill implicitly , which is politically easier , even though the effect is not any different than if Congress were to pass the Senate bill first and pass the reconciliation fixes after .
This is all about plausible deniability for House members who do n't want to vote for the Senate bill , although I doubt many voters will find the denials plausible .
Today Dreier is a figure of derision and pity .
He 's fairly senior in the Republican hierarchy , but he has no juice whatsoever .
He toes the right - wing line religiously -- even voting against the bipartisan bill to control Red Tide , something ultra-popular in his environmentally sensitive district .
Other House Republicans , attuned to their districts , bucked the GOP extremist leadership to vote " aye . "
Liberals ?
Yeah , right ... like Louie Gohmert ( R - TX ) , Brian Bilbray ( R- CA ) , Mary Fallin ( R - OK ) , Adam Putnam ( R- FL ) , Tom Cole ( R - OK ) , Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) , John Boozman ( R - AR ) , John Kline ( R- MN ) , Anders Crenshaw ( R- FL ) , Rob Wittman ( R- VA ) , Adrian Smith ( R- NE ) .
Dreier 's in a netherworld of his own , a victim of his own horrid choices -- neither fish nor foul -- or a little bit of both .
So when he went running to the media yesterday screaming that the Democrats ' healthcare reform bill was dead , most everyone to the left of Michelle Malkin yawned .
No one tells David Dreier anything -- except where the newest humpy tea room is .
A far more reliable , reality - based source of what 's going on is the 's resident politics - of - healthcare expert Ezra Klein , who has made an effort to remove the hyperbole and give as clear an explanation as possible of what Pelosi is trying to accomplish with her " deem and pass " strategy .
Pelosi relishes a great , long - term debate with the GOP on the merits of government protecting society from the ravages of the selfish and greedy .
It 's a damn shame that the Democratic Party -- herding cats -- is so politically clueless as to actuallymembers who are sure to oppose the party 's own grand ambitions for the American people .
Right now the DCCC is pushing Lori Edwards , a reactionary Blue Dog who will always be one press conference away from switching parties à la Parker Griffith , instead of getting behind a true blue grassroots Democrat , Doug Tudor in FL - 12 .
Similarly , we hear Pelosi has put an awkward thumb on the table in favor of one of this year 'sDemocratic candidates , former Joe Lieberman for President campaign chair Katrina Swett , who is trying to steal a New Hampshire congressional nomination away from progressive activist Ann McLane Kuster .
Pelosi , more than anyone , knows the depths of Jane Harman 's perfidy and has certainly been more than aware of the damage Bart Stupak has done to the cause of healthcare reform , to women 's rights , to the Democratic Party and , most importantly , to the United States of America .
She has seen Georgia Blue Dog John Barrow , a cowardly cur if there ever was one , crossing the aisle to vote with the GOP in committee and on the floor over and over and over .
But she is far from countenancing primary challenges against any of them , even though each has an outstanding progressive challenger eager to vote for the ideals of the party of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt .
And , as Digby mentioned at her blog yesterday , that is exactly why MoveOn is raising a war chest to deploy against faithless Democrats and why Blue America started the Sending Democrats A Message page .
We 'll do what weak and compromised leaders wo n't and / or ca n't do .
When I ran into Rahm Emanuel in a DC bar shortly after Donna Edwards beat insider Al Wynn in the Democratic primary , I was n't sure , after I had introduced myself , if he was going to keel over from a heart attack or lunge at me .
And I was just congratulating him on having traded in a loyal and principled Democrat for an aisle - crossing corrupt one .
Meanwhile , back in Dreier territory ... he eventually went on to admit that the Republicans can't stop the procedure that Ezra described ( above ) .
“ There is nothing that can prevent it , ” said Dreier , the ranking member of the Rules Committee .
“ It ’s something they can clearly do if they have the votes . ”
Happy days are here again ?
We 'll see .
Image caption Jordan Romero was due to do some school work during his trip
A 13 - year - old American boy has become the youngest person to reach the summit of Mount Everest , his family says .
Jordan Romero , from California , telephoned his mother from the peak of the world 's highest mountain , she said .
" Mom , I 'm calling you from the top of the world , " Leigh Anne Drake quoted her son as saying .
He was climbing with his father and three Sherpa guides .
The previous record was held by a Nepalese boy of 16 .
The 13 - year - old has now conquered the highest mountains on six of the world 's seven continents .
JORDAN'S SUMMITS Africa - Kilimanjaro : 2006
Europe - Elbrus : 2007
South America - Aconcagua : 2007
North America - Denali : 2008
Oceania - Carstensz Pyramid : 2009
Everest - Asia : 2010
He climbed Africa 's Mount Kilimanjaro aged 10 .
He just needs to scale the Vinson Massif in Antarctica .
He has also scaled Mount Kosciuszko in Australia .
The team set off from Nepal 's capital , Kathmandu , last month , heading for the base camp on the Chinese side of the mountain .
While Nepal insists that anyone planning to climb Mount Everest must be 16 , China does not impose any age restrictions .
Some mountaineers have criticised the Romero family for letting him attempt the feat but his father said the ascent from the Chinese side is less dangerous , the AFP news agency reports .
Last month , his mother told the BBC he would do some school work during the trip .
Also on Saturday , Apa Sherpa , 50 , climbed Everest for the 20th time , surpassing his own record .

A Post By : William Burrard - Lucas
As wildlife photographers , we are continually trying to take unusual and original photographs of our subjects .
In recent years this has meant going to ever increasing lengths as more and more photographers continue to push the boundaries with fantastic photographs .
A year ago , from our small garage in London , we started working on an ambitious project to photograph African wildlife from a unique perspective .
We wanted to get our camera extremely close to dangerous and unpredictable wild animals and photograph them with a wide angle lens .
We booked our plane tickets to Tanzania and had a few months to design , build and test a contraption that would allow us to realise this aim .
Traditionally , these sort of photographs have been taken using camera traps – stationary cameras triggered when the animal breaks an invisible infrared beam .
The problem with this method is that it requires a great deal of time , patience and luck .
We wanted something a little more proactive and thus BeetleCam was conceived ; a DSLR camera mounted on top of a four - wheel drive remote control buggy .
Designing BeetleCam posed several challenges .
The vehicle needed to be capable of traversing the uneven African terrain with a heavy payload of camera , lens and flashes .
It had to be reliable in the harsh , dusty environment and would need to operate for long periods without being charged .
Ideally it would do all this while remaining stealthy and camouflaged .
Through several refinements and redesigns , BeetleCam was honed into a sturdy , resilient and slightly schizophrenic contraption capable of periods of brilliance , interspersed with the odd period of unsolicited autopilot .
We decided that would do fine .
We stuck our trusty Canon EOS 400D on top of vehicle chassis and constructed a split ETTL flash cord that allowed the camera to control the output of two flashes depending on the light conditions ( this would be important for filling in the shadows cast by the bright African sun ) .
A few days before our departure , BeetleCam was ready to be let loose in the wild !
Our primary destination was Katavi National Park , a quite and remote park in South - West Tanzania .
We did n’t hold high hopes of returning to the UK triumphant ; the chances that BeetleCam would be trampled , mauled or inadvertently driven into a river seemed rather high .
On the first day we gave our 400D a fond pat and said farewell .
We thought that Elephants would be a simple enough subject for BeetleCam ’s first outing .
We were wrong .
We quickly learned that Elephants are wary of unfamiliar objects and , due to their highly sensitive hearing , are almost impossible to sneak up on .
We eventually developed a technique which involved positioning the camera well in front of the elephant and then waiting for it approach in its own time .
With this technique we enjoyed great success later in the trip and managed to get some incredible photos of these wonderful creatures .
After obtaining our first photographs of Elephants we were buoyed with optimism and decided to make lions our second subject .
In hindsight this was a foolish idea ; BeetleCam was promptly mauled and carried off into the bush .
A long recovery mission ensued and we were extremely lucky to retrieve an intact memory card from the mangled Canon 400D body .
On downloading the images , we were delighted to find that BeetleCam had performed its duty admirably , and we got a great series of images from the encounter .
Remarkably , although the 400D sustained irreparable damage , the rest of BeetleCam proved very resilient and , with a few pieces of string and bits wood , we were able to patch it up .
We replaced the 400D with our only other available camera – a Canon EOS 1D MK III .
Obviously lions were off the menu for the rest of the trip !
To our surprise it was Africa ’s second most dangerous animal that proved to be the most cooperative subject : the notoriously bad tempered Cape Buffalo .
Adult males who are too old to compete for females collect together and form small bachelor herds .
Despite their reputation for being unperdicatble and aggressive , we found these old brutes were totally unconcerned by the small robot and some even showed mild curiosity !
Upon returning to the UK , we were thrilled with the photographs that we had managed to take during our two - weeks in the field .
We have already started work on BeetleCam Mk II and plan to return to Africa this summer to take more photographs .
If you would like to see video clips of BeetleCam in action and more of the resulting photographs , please visit our website at http://blog.burrard-lucas.com/beetlecam/ .

And there was a clarity about the relationship that was refreshing .
José Mourinho today identified Steven Gerrard , Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole as the type of signings he would like to make at Real Madrid , causing consternation in the boardrooms of Liverpool and Chelsea .
Mourinho is poised to succeed Manuel Pellegrini as Real manager , having announced his departure from Internazionale and he sparked intrigue as he name - checked the trio of World Cup - bound England internationals .
During his time in charge at Chelsea , he almost signed the Liverpool captain Gerrard while he has retained a close relationship with Lampard and Cole .
Cole , 29 , is understood to be considering his future in England as he contends with the fall - out from the break - down of his marriage .
The left - back feels he is being persecuted by sections of the media .
Gerrard , who turns 30 on Sunday , and Lampard , 31 , are considered by Mourinho as photo - fit signings in midfield .
" I like players at the end of their careers , " Mourinho said .
" I love to have some players who are 33 or 34 - years - old .
They are players who you buy and you do not recover the money but if they give you good performances for two or three years , you 've got your money 's worth .
Both [ Gerrard and Lampard ] are great players who always give everything . "
Real 's interest in Gerrard predates their move for Mourinho .
They have talked about making a bid for him , although their valuation would most likely have been laughed at in Liverpool , as it has been in the region of € 15 m .
They paid € 30 m last summer to Liverpool for another midfielder , Xabi Alonso .
Mourinho referred to Cole as he explained the tactics that he intended to use at the Bernabéu .
" Normally , we play with four [ at the back ] but with two offensive full - backs of the style of Ashley Cole or Maicon , " he said .
" In midfield , we can play in a diamond or triangle .
If we play with the triangle , then we line up to three forwards . "
Mourinho went on to say that he saw Sergio Ramos , who generally played at right - back for Real under Pellegrini , as potentially one of the best central defenders in the world , suggesting he might have a vacancy at right - back .
Maicon played in the role for him at Inter .
Left - back , meanwhile , is a problem position for Real .
Liverpool and Chelsea would resist any moves from Mourinho for their players .
One of the most significant details of Mourinho 's deal at Madrid is that he will be granted control of transfer policy by the president Florentino Pérez .
Pellegrini complained that his relationship with Pérez was difficult from the very beginning and that important players were sold over his head .
For Mourinho , however , the situation could hardly be more different .
Real have won nothing in each of the last four seasons under Pérez and , for the first time , the president is prepared to entrust his coach with building the squad .
The star signing is Mourinho and the players need not necessarily be .
When Pérez announced the Portuguese 's capture , the rhetoric of style , spectacle and stability had gone .
Madrid 's identity was instead summed up in a word : success .
Although Pérez insisted he had not even talked to Mourinho about signings , it was significant that he mentioned it at all .
Mourinho will make the decisions and the players he has talked about , the type of footballers he has earmarked , do not necessarily fit the galáctico model .
Asked what Real needed , Mourinho responded simply : " I want three or four defensive players . "
He was keen to stress , though , that his team would look to balance defence with attack .
" My Madrid will always play well , attack and will be winners , " he said .
" However , there will be times when we will have to face the game in a different manner .
Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin moved quickly today to recognise the new powers - that - be in Kyrgyzstan while disavowing any role in the overthrow of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev 's regime .
" Neither Russia , nor your humble servant , nor Russian officials have any links whatsoever to these events , " Putin said in a typically sardonic statement that invited disbelief .
As far as he was concerned , he said , opposition leader Roza Otunbayeva was " the new head of government " .
But if Moscow were found to have had a hand in this latest upheaval , it would hardly come as a shock .
Machiavellian Russian machinations in Kyrgyzstan , as in the other former Soviet republics of central Asia , has become the norm in the Putin era .
Competition with China and the US for control of strategically important energy resources and transit routes is one key motivator .
More fundamentally , Moscow still unfashionably insists on regarding this vast region as falling within its sphere of influence .
Evidence of Russian meddling in Kyrgyzstan is not hard to find .
Financial and commercial blandishments dangled by Putin during a visit to Moscow by Bakiyev last year , including a $ 2bn loan , preceded a decision by the then president to evict the US from its Manas air base , a key staging and supply route to Afghanistan .
Only some nifty footwork by the Obama administration , and a sudden Bakiyev volte - face , allowed the US to hang on to Manas .
It is unlikely that Bakiyev 's apparent double - dealing endeared him to Putin , no more than his recent counter - terrorism training deal with US general David Petraeus .
Perhaps not coincidentally , Russian televisions stations not usually noted for their concern for human rights have freely criticised Bakiyev and his family in recent months for corruption , nepotism and cronyism .
These issues became a potent rallying cry in this week 's street demonstrations .
More broadly , Putin 's authoritarian example seems to have played a significant role in subverting the democratic goals of the tulip revolution of 2005 that ousted the country 's first post - Soviet leader .
A report published in 2008 by the International Crisis Group found that Bakiyev , having risen to power on a tide of populist sentiment , deliberately emulated Putin's " vertical power " paradigm .
His aim was to eliminate centres of opposition and dissent and impose " managed democracy " , Russian - style .
" Parliamentary democracy in Kyrgyzstan has been hobbled .
The task of the new legislature … is to implement the president 's will with minimal discussion and zero dissent .
The innovations … are a good example of how the Vladimir Putin model of governance is being copied in central Asia , " the ICG said .
The report highlighted Bakiyev 's plans to privatise energy resources , " overweening control by the ruling family , widespread corruption , and a monopoly over economic and political patronage " as potential future flashpoints .
All these factors , notably rising utility prices , played their part in provoking Kyrgyzstan 's second post - cold war revolution .
Russia now looks set to exploit the situation for its own purposes .
The US has good reason to take stock , too .
Otunbayeva , a former foreign minister who fell out with Bakiyev , gave assurances today that the deal on the Manas base would be honoured .
But Washington 's self - interestedly insouciant disregard for the regime 's egregious human rights abuses and disregard of democratic norms earned the US few friends among the opposition groups that now wield power .
In his pragmatic dealings with Iran , Burma 's generals , North Korea and other unsavoury regimes , Obama has shown himself at home in the compromised world of realpolitik .
Kyrgyzstan demonstrates how the turn - a - blind - eye approach can rapidly backfire .
Even as Bakiyev was fleeing for his life on Wednesday , the US government was gearing up to entertain his heir - apparent , Maksim , on a visit to Washington .
Obama has no excuse for being unaware of what was going on .
According to Human Rights Watch , several of Kyrgyzstan 's best - known opposition leaders were jailed on politically inspired charges in the past year .
Amid intensifying street demonstrations in March , opposition websites and independent radio stations were blocked or jammed , and the publication of three newspapers was suspended .
Two prominent journalists were killed last year .
Yet it was left to the distinctly unradical figure of Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary general , to raise international concerns about these abuses when he visited Bishkek last weekend .
His comments , outspoken by his standards , demanding that all human rights and freedoms be respected , may have helped embolden the protesters .
In contrast , the US continued to look the other way until after Bakiyev finally fell .
What happens next in vulnerable , impoverished Kyrgyzstan depends on whether its new and not - so - new leaders , representing in effect the country 's third attempt at a post - Soviet fresh start , prove to be any more enlightened and trustworthy than their predecessors .
It would certainly help if Russia and the US , and regional powers like China and Kazakhstan , do not try to exploit the power vacuum , confine themselves to constructive advice and assistance , and stop using the country as a Great Game playboard .
After the revolution , the new leadership is promising great things .
And it would be nice to think , with Roger Daltrey and the Who , that the people of Kyrgyzstan wo n't get fooled again .
Improving feature extraction can often have a significant positive impact on classifier accuracy ( and precision and recall ) .
In this article , I ’ll be evaluating two modifications of the word_feats feature extraction method :
filter out stopwords include bigram collocations
To do this effectively , we ’ll modify the previous code so that we can use an arbitrary feature extractor function that takes the words in a file and returns the feature dictionary .
As before , we ’ll use these features to train a Naive Bayes Classifier .
import collections import nltk.classify.util , nltk.metrics from nltk.classify import NaiveBayesClassifier from nltk.corpus import movie_reviews def evaluate_classifier ( featx ) : negids = movie_reviews.fileids ( ' neg ' ) posids = movie_reviews.fileids ( ' pos ' ) negfeats = [ ( featx ( movie_reviews.words ( fileids=[f ] ) ) , ' neg ' ) for f in negids ] posfeats = [ ( featx ( movie_reviews.words ( fileids=[f ] ) ) , ' pos ' ) for f in posids ] negcutoff = len( negfeats ) * 3/4 poscutoff = len( posfeats ) * 3/4 trainfeats = negfeats [ : negcutoff ] + posfeats [ : poscutoff ] testfeats = negfeats [ negcutoff : ] + posfeats [ poscutoff : ] classifier = NaiveBayesClassifier.train( trainfeats ) refsets = collections.defaultdict( set ) testsets = collections.defaultdict( set ) for i , ( feats , label ) in enumerate ( testfeats ) : refsets[ label ].add( i ) observed = classifier.classify ( feats ) testsets [ observed ].add( i ) print ' accuracy : ' , nltk.classify.util.accuracy( classifier , testfeats ) print ' pos precision : ' , nltk.metrics.precision(refsets[' pos ' ] , testsets [ ' pos ' ] ) print ' pos recall : ' , nltk.metrics.recall(refsets [ ' pos ' ] , testsets [ ' pos ' ] ) print ' neg precision : ' , nltk.metrics.precision(refsets ['neg ' ] , testsets [ ' neg ' ] ) print ' neg recall : ' , nltk.metrics.recall(refsets [ ' neg ' ] , testsets [ ' neg ' ] ) classifier.show_most_informative_features ( )
Baseline Bag of Words Feature Extraction
Here ’s the baseline feature extractor for bag of words feature selection .
def word_feats ( words ) : return dict ( [ ( word , True ) for word in words ] ) evaluate_classifier ( word_feats )
The results are the same as in the previous articles , but I ’ve included them here for reference :
accuracy : 0.728 pos precision : 0.651595744681 pos recall : 0.98 neg precision : 0.959677419355 neg recall : 0.476 Most Informative Features magnificent =
True pos : neg = 15.0 : 1.0 outstanding =
True pos : neg = 13.6 : 1.0 insulting =
True neg : pos = 13.0 : 1.0 vulnerable =
True pos : neg = 12.3 : 1.0 ludicrous =
True neg : pos = 11.8 : 1.0 avoids =
True pos : neg = 11.7 : 1.0 uninvolving =
True neg : pos = 11.7 : 1.0 astounding =
True pos : neg = 10.3 : 1.0 fascination =
True pos : neg = 10.3 : 1.0 idiotic =
True neg : pos = 9.8 : 1.0
Stopword Filtering
Stopwords are words that are generally considered useless .
Most search engines ignore these words because they are so common that including them would greatly increase the size of the index without improving precision or recall .
NLTK comes with a stopwords corpus that includes a list of 128 english stopwords .
Let ’s see what happens when we filter out these words .
from nltk.corpus import stopwords stopset = set ( stopwords.words ( ' english ' ) ) def stopword_filtered_word_feats( words ) : return dict ( [ ( word , True ) for word in words if word not in stopset ] ) evaluate_classifier( stopword_filtered_word_feats )
And the results for a stopword filtered bag of words are :
accuracy : 0.726 pos precision : 0.649867374005 pos recall : 0.98 neg precision : 0.959349593496 neg recall : 0.472
Accuracy went down .2 % , and pos precision and neg recall dropped as well !
Apparently stopwords add information to sentiment analysis classification .
I did not include the most informative features since they did not change .
Bigram Collocations
As mentioned at the end of the article on precision and recall , it ’s possible that including bigrams will improve classification accuracy .
The hypothesis is that people say things like “ not great ” , which is a negative expression that the bag of words model could interpret as positive since it sees “ great ” as a separate word .
To find significant bigrams , we can use nltk.collocations.BigramCollocationFinder along with nltk.metrics.BigramAssocMeasures .
The BigramCollocationFinder maintains 2 internal FreqDists , one for individual word frequencies , another for bigram frequencies .
Once it has these frequency distributions , it can score individual bigrams using a scoring function provided by BigramAssocMeasures , such chi-square .
These scoring functions measure the collocation correlation of 2 words , basically whether the bigram occurs about as frequently as each individual word .
import itertools from nltk.collocations import BigramCollocation
Finder from nltk.metrics import BigramAssocMeasures def bigram_word_feats ( words , score_fn=BigramAssocMeasures.chi_sq , n=200 ) : bigram_finder = BigramCollocationFinder.from_words ( words ) bigrams = bigram_finder.nbest ( score_fn , n) return dict ( [ ( ngram , True ) for ngram in itertools.chain ( words , bigrams ) ] ) evaluate_classifier( bigram_word_feats )
After some experimentation , I found that using the 200 best bigrams from each file produced great results :
accuracy : 0.816 pos precision : 0.753205128205 pos recall : 0.94 neg precision : 0.920212765957 neg recall : 0.692 Most Informative Features magnificent =
True pos : neg = 15.0 : 1.0 outstanding =
True pos : neg = 13.6 : 1.0 insulting =
True neg : pos = 13.0 : 1.0 vulnerable =
True pos : neg = 12.3 : 1.0 ( ' matt ' , ' damon ' ) =
True pos : neg = 12.3 : 1.0 ( ' give ' , 'us ' ) =
True neg : pos = 12.3 : 1.0 ludicrous =
True neg : pos = 11.8 : 1.0 uninvolving =
True neg : pos = 11.7 : 1.0 avoids =
True pos : neg = 11.7 : 1.0 ( ' absolutely ' , ' no ' ) =
True neg : pos = 10.6 : 1.0
Yes , you read that right , Matt Damon is apparently one of the best predictors for positive sentiment in movie reviews .
But despite this chuckle - worthy result
accuracy is up almost 9 %
pos precision has increased over 10 % with only 4 % drop in recall
precision has increased over 10 % with only 4 % drop in recall neg recall has increased over 21 % with just under 4 % drop in precision
So it appears that the bigram hypothesis is correct , and including significant bigrams can increase classifier effectiveness .
Note that it ’s significant bigrams that enhance effectiveness .
I tried using nltk.util.bigrams to include all bigrams , and the results were only a few points above baseline .
This points to the idea that including only significant features can improve accuracy compared to using all features .
In a future article , I ’ll try trimming down the single word features to only include significant words .

This underground shelter was created in Moscow in the 30s years of the XX century especially for the former and the most well - known head of the USSR – Joseph Stalin .
It was planned to build a huge sports complex with a stadium on the surface , used as masking , but its construction stopped in the 1939 after the bunker had been finished .
The bunker is connected with the Kremlin by the tunnel ten miles long .
Nevertheless Stalin preferred to work in the Kremlin and used the shelter only once , in December of 1941 , during World War 2 , deciding , whether Russians should leave Moscow or stay and defend it .
Now this place is open for visitors and the interiors look exact like during the Stalin reign .
“ It ’s time the federal government stopped encouraging sprawl , ” Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) Secretary Shaun Donovan declared this morning before the Congress for the New Urbanism .
He ’d announced moments before that the department would fund $ 3 billion worth of projects this year alone , and they ’d henceforth use “ location efficiency ” ( based on transportation access , residential density , and so on ) to score grant applications .
They ’ll also use the criteria of LEED - ND , the brainchild of CNU , the U.S. Green Building Council , and the National Resources Defense Council , Donovan said .
It was launched last month to apply the green principles of LEED to urban development .
It could turn out to be the first step in a sea
change about how the federal government approaches urbanism , which in
turn could lead to the end of sprawl .
Or , to paraphrase Nixon , we are
all New Urbanists now .
The implications go beyond funding for public housing .
Last year , HUD joined the Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency in creating the Interagency Partnership for Sustainable Communities , an effort to think holistically about housing , transportation , and quality of life when awarding tens of billions of dollars in federal funds .
It is an article of faith among advocates for sustainable development that the notion Americans want sprawl is a pernicious myth .
Sprawl is n’t a function of market forces but the outcome of federal policies dating back to at least the 1950s .
“ For decades , ” Donovan said , “ the government encouraged sprawl ” with freeway construction and a “ housing finance system that perpetuated the ‘ drive until you qualify ’ myth .
It happens every year and we love it .. the lighting of the iconic sails of the Opera House for Vivid Sydney .
It ’s the most spectacular display in what organisers claim is “ the world ’s largest festival of light , music and ideas ” .
The visuals on this year ’s amazing Opera House work , called ‘ Audio Creatures ’ , were created by Ash Bolland .
The accompanying score was composed by Amon Tobin .
Check out the first lighting of this year ’s incredible piece , with its full display including the music , as it was live streamed on the official Sydney Opera House YouTube channel ( skip straight to 17:00 for the beginning of the show ) :
If you are in Sydney from tonight through till 17 June , go and see something .

Call to Queen over ' Mr Asbo ' swan in Cambridge
Rowers in Cambridge have called for the Queen to remove an aggressive swan nicknamed " Mr Asbo " which they claim attacks people using the river .
The bird patrols a 1,600 ft ( 488 m ) stretch of water near its nest in Fen Ditton , a spokesman from the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association said .
President Bill Key said the swan flaps its wings and pecks rowers and boats .
Mr Key said the cox of his crew is afraid to go into the water because she was injured in an attack by the swan .
The Cam Conservators said they have been in discussions about its removal .
Her Majesty 's Warden of the Swans , Prof Chris Perrins , who works in the zoology department at Oxford University , said : " The Crown does not own this bird but it can claim it . "
The cox of my own crew is frightened to go in the water because she received bruising from an attack
Cambridgeshire Rowing Association President Bill Key
He said it is essential that permission is sought from Her Majesty 's Swan Marker , David Barber , who advises on behalf of the Crown whether a claim for ownership will be made .
If approval is given , a licence must be collected from Natural England .
Prof Perrins said the options include relocating the swan or clipping the feathers on one wing to discourage aggressive behaviour by throwing it off balance when it attacks .
Mr Key said that 1,000 local rowers and 2,000 university students use the stretch of water .
" This swan caused untold disruption and injury last year and the same thing is happening again now , " said Mr Key .
" There have been dozens and dozens of attacks .
" The cox of my own crew is frightened to go in the water because she received bruising from an attack in the past . "

Emiller 's Balls - Out Guide To Nginx Module Development
DRAFT : May 28 , 2007 ( changes )
If you 're trying out Nginx , you probably care about web server performance .
As a number of benchmarks have shown ( 1 , 2 ) , it 's about as fast as it gets , and as the powerhouse behind Russia 's second - most popular site ( 1 , 2 ) , it 's been proven to scale .
If you 're still not convinced , take a look at this code snippet from Nginx 's HTTP parser :
if ( m [ 1 ] == ' O ' ) { if ( m [ 0 ] == ' P ' & & m [ 2 ] == ' S ' && m [ 3 ] == ' T ' ) { r->method = NGX_HTTP_POST ; break ; } if ( m [ 0 ] == ' C ' && m [ 2 ] == ' P ' & & m [ 3 ] == 'Y ') { r->method = NGX_HTTP_COPY ; break ; } ...
That 's a man who cares about performance .
Mere mortals would bust out the old battle axe strncmp , but the author of Nginx refuses to perform more character comparisons that is strictly necessary .
Down to every last byte , Nginx was built to scream .
If you 're a web application developer , well , maybe some of your code is not so fast .
You use a scripting language to generate most of your web pages , and you 're starting to feel the overhead .
Perhaps you want to save a few dollars on hardware , or you have some Ajax-y requests that need a turnaround time measured in micro-seconds instead of milliseconds .
Or maybe you 're just looking for an excuse to get inside the guts of a web server .
Whatever it is , you need speed .
You need knowledge .
You need Emiller 's Balls - Out Guide to Nginx Module Development .
Table of Contents
Prerequisites
You should be comfortable with C. Not just " C- syntax " ; you should know your way around a struct and not be scared off by pointers and function references , and be cognizant of the preprocessor .
If you need to brush up , nothing beats K&R .
Basic understanding of HTTP is useful .
You 'll be working on a web server , after all .
You should also be familiar with Nginx 's configuration file .
If you 're not , here 's the gist of it : there are four contexts ( called main , server , upstream , and location ) which can contain directives with one or more arguments .
Directives in the main context apply to everything ; directives in the server context apply to a particular host / port ; directives in the upstream context refer to a set of backend servers ; and directives in a location context apply only to matching web locations ( e.g. , " / " , " / images " , etc . )
A location context inherits from the surrounding server context , and a server context inherits from the main context .
The upstream context neither inherits nor imparts its properties ; it has its own special directives that do n't really apply elsewhere .
I 'll refer to these four contexts quite a bit , so ... do n't forget them .
Let 's get started .
High - Level Overview of Nginx 's Module Delegation
Nginx modules have three roles we 'll cover :
handlers process a request and produce output
filters manipulate the output produced by a handler
load - balancers choose a backend server to send a request to , when more than one backend server is eligible
Modules do all of the " real work " that you might associate with a web server : whenever Nginx serves a file or proxies a request to another server , there 's a handler module doing the work ; when Nginx gzips the output or executes a server - side include , it 's using filter modules .
The " core " of Nginx simply takes care of all the network and application protocols and sets up the sequence of modules that are eligible to process a request .
The de-centralized architecture makes it possible for * you* to make a nice self - contained unit that does something you want .
Note : Unlike modules in Apache , Nginx modules are not dynamically linked .
( In other words , they 're compiled right into the Nginx binary . )
How does a module get invoked ?
Typically , at server startup , each handler gets a chance to attach itself to particular locations defined in the configuration ; if more than one handler attaches to a particular location , only one will " win " ( but a good config writer wo n't let a conflict happen ) .
Handlers can return in three ways : all is good , there was an error , or it can decline to process the request and defer to default handler ( typically something that serves static files ) .
If the handler happens to be a reverse proxy to some set of backend servers , there is room for another type of module : the load - balancer .
A load - balancer takes a request and a set of backend servers and decides which server will get the request .
Nginx ships with two load - balancing modules : round - robin , which deals out requests like cards at the start of a poker game , and the " IP hash " method , which ensures that a particular client will hit the same backend server across multiple requests .
If the handler does not produce an error , the filters are called .
Multiple filters can hook into each location , so that ( for example ) a response can be compressed and then chunked .
The order of their execution is determined at compile - time .
Filters have the classic " CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY " design pattern : one filter is called , does its work , and then calls the next filter , until the final filter is called , and Nginx finishes up the response .
The really cool part about the filter chain is that each filter does n't wait for the previous filter to finish ; it can process the previous filter 's output as it's being produced , sort of like the Unix pipeline .
Filters operate on buffers , which are usually the size of a page ( 4 K ) , although you can change this in your nginx .conf .
This means , for example , a module can start compressing the response from a backend server and stream it to the client before the module has received the entire response from the backend .
Nice !
So to wrap up the conceptual overview , the typical processing cycle goes :
Client sends HTTP request →
Nginx chooses the appropriate handler based on the location config → ( if applicable ) load - balancer picks a backend server → Handler does its thing and passes each output buffer to the first filter →
First filter passes the output to the second filter → second to third → third to fourth → etc. →
Final response sent to client
I say " typically " because Nginx 's module invocation is extremely customizable .
It places a big burden on module writers to define exactly how and when the module should run ( I happen to think too big a burden ) .
Invocation is actually performed through a series of callbacks , and there are a lot of them .
Namely , you can provide a function to be executed :
Just before the server reads the config file
For every configuration directive for the location and server for which it appears ;
When Nginx initializes the main configuration
When Nginx initializes the server ( i.e. , host / port ) configuration
When Nginx merges the server configuration with the main configuration
When Nginx initializes the location configuration
When Nginx merges the location configuration with its parent server configuration
When Nginx 's master process starts
When a new worker process starts
When a worker process exits
When the master exits
Handling a request
Filtering response headers
Filtering the response body
Picking a backend server
Initiating a request to a backend server
Re-initiating a request to a backend server
Processing the response from a backend server
Finishing an interaction with a backend server
Holy mackerel !
It 's a bit overwhelming .
You 've got a lot of power at your disposal , but you can still do something useful using only a couple of these hooks and a couple of corresponding functions .
Time to dive into some modules .
Components of an Nginx Module
As I said , you have a lot of flexibility when it comes to making an Nginx module .
This section will describe the parts that are almost always present .
It 's intended as a guide for understanding a module , and a reference for when you think you 're ready to start writing a module .
1. Module Configuration Struct(s )
Modules can define up to three configuration structs , one for the main , server , and location contexts .
Most modules just need a location configuration .
The naming convention for these is ngx_http_ < module name > _( main|srv|loc ) _conf_t .
Here 's an example , taken from the dav module :
typedef struct { ngx_uint_t methods ; ngx_flag_t create_full_put_path ; ngx_uint_t access ; } ngx_http_dav_loc_conf_t ;
Notice that Nginx has special data types ( ngx_uint_t and ngx_flag_t ) ; these are just aliases for the primitive data types you know and love ( cf. core / ngx_config.h if you 're curious ) .
The elements in the configuration structs are populated by module directives .
2. Module Directives
A module 's directives appear in a static array of ngx_command_t s.
Here 's an example of how they 're declared , taken from a small module I wrote :
static ngx_command_t ngx_http_circle_gif_commands [ ] = { { ngx_string ( " circle_gif " ) , NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF|NGX_CONF_NOARGS , ngx_http_circle_gif , NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF_OFFSET , 0 , NULL } , { ngx_string ( " circle_gif_min_radius " ) , NGX_HTTP_MAIN_CONF|NGX_HTTP_SRV_CONF|NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF|NGX_CONF_TAKE1 , ngx_conf_set_num_slot , NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF_OFFSET , offsetof( ngx_http_circle_gif_loc_conf_t , min_radius ) , NULL } , ... ngx_null_command } ;
And here is the declaration of ngx_command_t ( the struct we 're declaring ) , found in core/ ngx_conf_file.h :
struct ngx_command_t { ngx_str_t name ; ngx_uint_t type ; char *(* set ) ( ngx_conf_t *cf , ngx_command_t * cmd , void * conf ) ; ngx_uint_t conf ; ngx_uint_t offset ; void * post ; } ;
It seems like a bit much , but each element has a purpose .
The name is the directive string , no spaces .
The data type is an ngx_str_t , which is usually instantiated with just ( e.g. ) ngx_str ( " proxy_pass " ) .
Note : an ngx_str_t is a struct with a data element , which is a string , and a len element , which is the length of that string .
Nginx uses this data structure most places you 'd expect a string .
type is a set of flags that indicate where the directive is legal and how many arguments the directive takes .
Applicable flags , which are bitwise - OR'd , are :
NGX_HTTP_MAIN_CONF
: directive is valid in the main config
: directive is valid in the main config NGX_HTTP_SRV_CONF : directive is valid in the server ( host ) config
: directive is valid in the server ( host ) config NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF : directive is valid in a location config
: directive is valid in a location config NGX_HTTP_UPS_CONF : directive is valid in an upstream config
NGX_CONF_NOARGS : directive can take 0 arguments
: directive can take 0 arguments NGX_CONF_TAKE1 : directive can take exactly 1 argument
: directive can take exactly 1 argument NGX_CONF_TAKE2 : directive can take exactly 2 arguments
: directive can take exactly 2 arguments ...
NGX_CONF_TAKE7 : directive can take exactly 7 arguments
NGX_CONF_FLAG : directive takes a boolean ( " on " or " off " )
: directive takes a boolean ( " on " or " off " ) NGX_CONF_1MORE : directive must be passed at least one argument
: directive must be passed at least one argument NGX_CONF_2MORE : directive must be passed at least two arguments
There are a few other options , too , see core/ngx_conf_file.h .
The set struct element is a pointer to a function for setting up part of the module 's configuration ; typically this function will translate the arguments passed to this directive and save an appropriate value in its configuration struct .
This setup function will take three arguments :
a pointer to an ngx_conf_t struct , which contains the arguments passed to the directive a pointer to the current ngx_command_t struct a pointer to the module 's custom configuration struct
This setup function will be called when the directive is encountered .
Nginx provides a number of functions for setting particular types of values in the custom configuration struct .
These functions include :
ngx_conf_set_flag_slot : translates " on " or " off " to 1 or 0
: translates " on " or " off " to 1 or 0 ngx_conf_set_str_slot : saves a string as an ngx_str_t
: saves a string as an ngx_conf_set_num_slot : parses a number and saves it to an int
: parses a number and saves it to an ngx_conf_set_size_slot : parses a data size ( " 8k " , " 1m " , etc. ) and saves it to a size_t
There are several others , and they 're quite handy ( see core/ ngx_conf_file.h ) .
Modules can also put a reference to their own function here , if the built - ins are n't quite good enough .
How do these built - in functions know where to save the data ?
That 's where the next two elements of ngx_command_t come in , conf and offset .
conf tells
Nginx whether this value will get saved to the module 's main configuration , server configuration , or location configuration ( with NGX_HTTP_MAIN_CONF_OFFSET
, NGX_HTTP_SRV_CONF_OFFSET
, or NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF_OFFSET
). offset then specifies which part of this configuration struct to write to .
Finally , post is just a pointer to other crap the module might need while it 's reading the configuration .
It 's often NULL .
The commands array is terminated with ngx_null_command as the last element .
3. The Module Context
This is a static ngx_http_module_t struct , which just has a bunch of function references for creating the three configurations and merging them together .
Its name is ngx_http_ < module name > _module_ctx .
In order , the function references are :
preconfiguration
postconfiguration
creating the main conf ( i.e. , do a malloc and set defaults )
initializing the main conf ( i.e. , override the defaults with what 's in nginx .
conf )
creating the server conf
merging it with the main conf
creating the location conf
merging it with the server conf
These take different arguments depending on what they 're doing .
Here 's the struct definition , taken from http/ngx_http_config.h , so you can see the different function signatures of the callbacks :
typedef struct { ngx_int_t ( * preconfiguration ) ( ngx_conf_t * cf ) ; ngx_int_t ( * postconfiguration ) ( ngx_conf_t * cf ) ; void *(*create_main_conf ) (ngx_conf_t * cf ) ; char *(*init_main_conf )(ngx_conf_t *cf , void * conf ) ; void *(*create_srv_conf )(ngx_conf_t * cf ) ; char *(*merge_srv_conf )(ngx_conf_t *cf , void * prev , void * conf ) ; void *(*create_loc_conf )(ngx_conf_t * cf ) ; char *(*merge_loc_conf )(ngx_conf_t *cf , void * prev , void * conf ) ; } ngx_http_module_t ;
You can set functions you do n't need to NULL , and Nginx will figure it out .
Most handlers just use the last two : a function to allocate memory for location - specific configuration ( called ngx_http_ < module name > _create_loc_conf ) , and a function to set defaults and merge this configuration with any inherited configuration ( called ngx_http_ < module name > _merge_loc_conf ) .
The merge function is also responsible for producing an error if the configuration is invalid ; these errors halt server startup .
Here 's an example module context struct :
static ngx_http_module_t ngx_http_circle_gif_module_ctx = { NULL , /* preconfiguration */ NULL , /* postconfiguration */ NULL , /* create main configuration */ NULL , /* init main configuration */ NULL , /* create server configuration */ NULL , /* merge server configuration */ ngx_http_circle_gif_create_loc_conf , /* create location configuration */ ngx_http_circle_gif_merge_loc_conf
/* merge location configuration */ } ;
Time to dig in deep a little bit .
These configuration callbacks look quite similar across all modules and use the same parts of the Nginx API , so they 're worth knowing about .
3A . create_loc_conf
Here 's what a bare - bones create_loc_conf function looks like , taken from the circle_gif module I wrote ( see the the source ) .
It takes a directive struct ( ngx_conf_t ) and returns a newly created module configuration struct ( in this case ngx_http_circle_gif_loc_conf_t ) .
static void * ngx_http_circle_gif_create_loc_conf(ngx_conf_t * cf ) { ngx_http_circle_gif_loc_conf_t *conf ; conf = ngx_pcalloc( cf->pool , sizeof ( ngx_http_circle_gif_loc_conf_t ) ) ; if ( conf == NULL ) { return NGX_CONF_ERROR ; } conf -> min_radius = NGX_CONF_UNSET_UINT
; conf-> max_radius = NGX_CONF_UNSET_UINT
; return conf ; }
First thing to notice is Nginx 's memory allocation ; it takes care of the free 'ing as long as the module uses ngx_palloc ( a malloc wrapper ) or ngx_pcalloc ( a calloc wrapper ) .
The possible UNSET constants are NGX_CONF_UNSET_UINT , NGX_CONF_UNSET_PTR , NGX_CONF_UNSET_SIZE
, NGX_CONF_UNSET_MSEC
, and the catch - all NGX_CONF_UNSET .
UNSET tell the merging function that the value should be overridden .
3B . merge_loc_conf
Here 's the merging function used in the circle_gif module :
static char * ngx_http_circle_gif_merge_loc_conf(ngx_conf_t *cf , void * parent , void * child ) { ngx_http_circle_gif_loc_conf_t * prev = parent ; ngx_http_circle_gif_loc_conf_t *conf = child ; ngx_conf_merge_uint_value(conf->min_radius , prev->min_radius , 10 ) ; ngx_conf_merge_uint_value(conf->max_radius , prev->max_radius , 20 ) ; if ( conf -> min_radius < 1 ) { ngx_conf_log_error( NGX_LOG_EMERG , cf , 0 , " min_radius must be equal or more than 1 " ) ; return NGX_CONF_ERROR ; } if ( conf -> max_radius < conf-> min_radius ) { ngx_conf_log_error( NGX_LOG_EMERG , cf , 0 , " max_radius must be equal or more than min_radius " ) ; return NGX_CONF_ERROR ; } return NGX_CONF_OK ; }
Notice first that Nginx provides nice merging functions for different data types ( ngx_conf_merge_ < data type>_value ) ; the arguments are
this location 's value the value to inherit if # 1 is not set the default if neither # 1 nor # 2 is set
The result is then stored in the first argument .
Available merge functions include ngx_conf_merge_size_value , ngx_conf_merge_msec_value , and others .
See core /ngx_conf_file.h for a full list .
Trivia question :
How do these functions write to the first argument , since the first argument is passed in by value ?
Answer : these functions are defined by the preprocessor ( so they expand to a few " if " statements and assignments before reaching the compiler ) .
Notice also how errors are produced ; the function writes something to the log file , and returns NGX_CONF_ERROR .
That return code halts server startup .
( Since the message is logged at level NGX_LOG_EMERG , the message will also go to standard out ; FYI , core / ngx_log.h has a list of log levels . )
4. The Module Definition
Next we add one more layer of indirection , the ngx_module_t struct .
The variable is called ngx_http_ < module name > _module .
This is where references to the context and directives go , as well as the remaining callbacks ( exit thread , exit process , etc. ) .
The module definition is sometimes used as a key to look up data associated with a particular module .
The module definition usually looks like this :
ngx_module_t ngx_http_<module name > _module = { NGX_MODULE_V1 , &ngx_http_< module name > _module_ctx , /* module context */ ngx_http_<module name > _commands , /* module directives */ NGX_HTTP_MODULE , /* module type */ NULL , /* init master */ NULL , /* init module */ NULL , /* init process */ NULL , /* init thread */ NULL , /* exit thread */ NULL , /* exit process */ NULL , /* exit master */ NGX_MODULE_V1 _PADDING
} ;
... substituting < module name > appropriately .
Modules can add callbacks for process / thread creation and death , but most modules keep things simple .
( For the arguments passed to each callback , see core/ngx_conf_file.h. )
5. Module Installation
Modules are installed in two ways : handlers are usually installed by a directive 's callback , and filters are usually installed by a postconfiguration callback in the module context struct .
Finally we 're going to tell Nginx where to find our code .
( Load - balancers are a special and somewhat convoluted case ; see Anatomy of a Load - balancer . )
5A . Handler installation
Handlers are installed by adding code to the callback of the directive that enables the module .
For example , my circle gif ngx_command_t looks like this :
{ ngx_string ( " circle_gif " ) , NGX_HTTP_LOC_CONF|NGX_CONF_NOARGS , ngx_http_circle_gif , 0 , 0 , NULL }
The callback is the third element , in this case ngx_http_circle_gif .
Recall that the arguments to this callback are the directive struct ( ngx_conf_t , which holds the user 's arguments ) , the relevant ngx_command_t struct , and a pointer to the module 's custom configuration struct .
For my circle gif module , the function looks like :
static char * ngx_http_circle_gif(ngx_conf_t *cf , ngx_command_t * cmd , void * conf ) { ngx_http_core_loc_conf_t *clcf ; clcf = ngx_http_conf_get_module_loc_conf(cf , ngx_http_core_module ) ; clcf -> handler = ngx_http_circle_gif_handler ; return NGX_CONF_OK ; }
There are two steps here : first , get the " core " struct for this location , then assign a handler to it .
Pretty simple , eh ?
5B . Filter installation
Filters are installed in the post - configuration step .
There are actually two types of filters : header filters that manipulate the HTTP headers , and body filters that manipulate the payload .
We install both in the same place .
Let 's take a look at the chunked filter module for a simple example .
Its module context looks like this :
static ngx_http_module_t ngx_http_chunked_filter_module_ctx = { NULL , /* preconfiguration */ ngx_http_chunked_filter_init , /* postconfiguration */ ... } ;
Here 's what happens in ngx_http_chunked_filter_init : static ngx_int_t ngx_http_chunked_filter_init(ngx_conf_t * cf ) { ngx_http_next_header_filter = ngx_http_top_header_filter ; ngx_http_top_header_filter = ngx_http_chunked_header_filter ; ngx_http_next_body_filter = ngx_http_top_body_filter ; ngx_http_top_body_filter = ngx_http_chunked_body_filter ; return NGX_OK ; }
What 's going on here ?
Well , if you remember , filters are set up with a CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY .
When a handler generates a response , it calls two functions : ngx_http_output_filter , which calls the global function reference ngx_http_top_body_filter ; and ngx_http_send_header , which calls the global function reference ngx_top_header_filter .
ngx_http_top_body_filter and ngx_http_top_header_filter are the respective " heads " of the body and header filter chains .
Each " link " on the chain keeps a function reference to the next link in the chain ( the references are called ngx_http_next_body_filter and ngx_http_next_header_filter ) .
When a filter is finished executing , it just calls the next filter , until a specially defined " write " filter is called , which wraps up the HTTP response .
What you see in this filter_init function is the module adding itself to the filter chains ; it keeps a reference to the old " top " filters in its own " next " variables and declares its functions to be the new " top " filters .
( Thus , the last filter to be installed is the first to be executed . )
Side note : how does this work exactly ?
Each filter either returns an error code or uses this as the return statement : return ngx_http_next_body_filter ( ) ;
Thus , if the filter chain reaches the ( specially - defined ) end of the chain , an " OK " response is returned , but if there 's an error along the way , the chain is cut short and Nginx serves up the appropriate error message .
It 's a singly - linked list with fast failures implemented solely with function references .
Brilliant .
Anatomy of a Handler ( Non-proxying )
Handlers typically do four things : get the location configuration , generate an appropriate response , send the header , and send the body .
A handler has one argument , the request struct .
A request struct has a lot of useful information about the client request , such as the request method , URI , and headers .
We 'll go over these steps one by one .
1. Getting the location configuration
This part 's easy .
All you need to do is call ngx_http_get_module_loc_conf and pass in the current request struct and the module definition .
Here 's the relevant part of my circle gif handler :
static ngx_int_t ngx_http_circle_gif_handler(ngx_http_request_t *r ) { ngx_http_circle_gif_loc_conf_t *circle_gif_config ; circle_gif_config = ngx_http_get_module_loc_conf(r , ngx_http_circle_gif_module ) ; ...
Now I 've got access to all the variables that I set up in my merge function .
2. Generating a response
This is the interesting part where modules actually do work .
The request struct will be helpful here , particularly these elements :
typedef struct { ... /* the memory pool , used in the ngx_palloc functions */ ngx_pool_t * pool ; ngx_str_t uri ; ngx_str_t args ; ngx_http_headers_in_t headers_in ; ... } ngx_http_request_t ;
uri is the path of the request , e.g. " / query.cgi " .
args is the part of the request after the question mark ( e.g. " name=john " ) .
headers_in has a lot of useful stuff , such as cookies and browser information , but many modules do n't need anything from it .
See http/ngx_http_request.h if you 're interested .
This should be enough information to produce some useful output .
The full ngx_http_request_t struct can be found in http/ngx_http_request.h.
3 . Sending the header
The response headers live in a struct called headers_out referenced by the request struct .
The handler sets the ones it wants and then calls ngx_http_send_header (r ) .
Some useful parts of headers_out include :
typedef stuct { ... ngx_uint_t status ; size_t content_type_len ; ngx_str_t content_type ; ngx_table_elt_t * content_encoding ; off_t content_length_n ; time_t date_time ; time_t last_modified_time ; .. } ngx_http_headers_out_t ;
( The rest can be found in http/ngx_http_request.h. )
So for example , if a module were to set the Content - Type to " image / gif " , Content - Length to 100 , and return a 200 OK response , this code would do the trick :
r->headers_out.status = NGX_HTTP_OK ; r->headers_out.content_length_n = 100 ; r->headers_out.content_type.len = sizeof ( " image /gif " ) - 1 ; r->headers_out.content_type.data = ( u_char *) " image /gif " ; ngx_http_send_header(r ) ;
Most legal HTTP headers are available ( somewhere ) for your setting pleasure .
However , some headers are a bit trickier to set than the ones you see above ; for example , content_encoding has type ( ngx_table_elt_t * ) , so the module must allocate memory for it .
This is done with a function called ngx_list_push , which takes in an ngx_list_t ( similar to an array ) and returns a reference to a newly created member of the list ( of type ngx_table_elt_t ) .
The following code sets the Content - Encoding to " deflate " and sends the header :
r->headers_out.content_encoding = ngx_list_push(&r->headers_out.headers ) ; if ( r->headers_out.content_encoding == NULL ) { return NGX_ERROR ; } r->headers_out.content_encoding ->hash = 1 ; r->headers_out.content_encoding ->key.len = sizeof ( " Content - Encoding " ) - 1 ; r->headers_out.content_encoding->key.data = ( u_char *) " Content - Encoding " ; r->headers_out.content_encoding->value.len = sizeof ( " deflate " ) - 1 ; r->headers_out.content_encoding->value.data = ( u_char *) " deflate " ; ngx_http_send_header(r ) ;
This mechanism is usually used when a header can have multiple values simultaneously ; it ( theoretically ) makes it easier for filter modules to add and delete certain values while preserving others , because they do n't have to resort to string manipulation .
4. Sending the body
Now that the module has generated a response and put it in memory , it needs to assign the response to a special buffer , and then assign the buffer to a chain link , and then call the " send body " function on the chain link .
What are the chain links for ?
Nginx lets handler modules generate ( and filter modules process ) responses one buffer at a time ; each chain link keeps a pointer to the next link in the chain , or NULL if it 's the last one .
We 'll keep it simple and assume there is just one buffer .
First , a module will declare the buffer and the chain link :
ngx_buf_t *b ; ngx_chain_t out ;
The next step is to allocate the buffer and point our response data to it :
b = ngx_pcalloc( r -> pool , sizeof ( ngx_buf_t ) ) ; if ( b == NULL ) { ngx_log_error ( NGX_LOG_ERR , r->connection ->log , 0 , " Failed to allocate response buffer . " ) ; return NGX_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR ; } b->pos = some_bytes ; /* first position in memory of the data */ b-> last = some_bytes + some_bytes_length ; /* last position */ b->memory = 1 ; /* content is in read - only memory */ /* ( i.e. , filters should copy it rather than rewrite in place ) */ b->last_buf = 1 ; /* there will be no more buffers in the request */
Now the module attaches it to the chain link :
out .
buf = b ; out .
next = NULL ;
FINALLY , we send the body , and return the status code of the output filter chain all in one go :
return ngx_http_output_filter(r , &out ) ;
Buffer chains are a critical part of Nginx 's IO model , so you should be comfortable with how they work .
Trivia question :
Why does the buffer have the last_buf variable , when we can tell we 're at the end of a chain by checking " next " for NULL ?
Answer : A chain might be incomplete , i.e. , have multiple buffers , but not all the buffers in this request or response .
So some buffers are at the end of the chain but not the end of a request .
This brings us to ...
Anatomy of an Upstream ( a.k.a Proxy ) Handler
I waved my hands a bit about having your handler generate a response .
Sometimes you 'll be able to get that response just with a chunk of C code , but often you 'll want to talk to another server ( for example , if you 're writing a module to implement another network protocol ) .
You could do all of the network programming yourself , but what happens if you receive a partial response ?
You do n't want to block the primary event loop with your own event loop while you 're waiting for the rest of the response .
You 'd kill the Nginx 's performance .
Fortunately , Nginx lets you hook right into its own mechanisms for dealing with back - end servers ( called " upstreams " ) , so your module can talk to another server without getting in the way of other requests .
This section describes how a module talks to an upstream , such as Memcached , FastCGI , or another HTTP server .
1. Summary of upstream callbacks
Unlike the handler function for other modules , the handler function of an upstream module does little " real work " .
It does not call ngx_http_output_filter .
It merely sets callbacks that will be invoked when the upstream server is ready to be written to and read from .
There are actually 6 available hooks :
create_request crafts a request buffer ( or chain of them ) to be sent to the upstream
reinit_request is called if the connection to the back - end is reset ( just before create_request is called for the second time )
process_header processes the first bit of the upstream 's response , and usually saves a pointer to the upstream 's " payload "
abort_request is called if the client aborts the request
finalize_request is called when Nginx is finished reading from the upstream
input_filter is a body filter that can be called on the response body ( e.g. , to remove a trailer )
How do these get attached ?
An example is in order .
Here 's a simplified version of the proxy module 's handler :
static ngx_int_t ngx_http_proxy_handler(ngx_http_request_t *r ) { ngx_int_t rc ; ngx_http_upstream_t *u ; ngx_http_proxy_loc_conf_t *plcf ; plcf = ngx_http_get_module_loc_conf(r , ngx_http_proxy_module ) ; /* set up our upstream struct */ u = ngx_pcalloc(r-> pool , sizeof ( ngx_http_upstream_t ) ) ; if ( u == NULL ) { return NGX_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR ; } u->peer.log = r->connection ->log ; u->peer.log_error = NGX_ERROR_ERR ; u->output.tag = ( ngx_buf_tag_t ) &ngx_http_proxy_module ; u->conf = &plcf ->upstream ; /* attach the callback functions */ u->create_request = ngx_http_proxy_create_request ; u->reinit_request = ngx_http_proxy_reinit_request ; u->process_header = ngx_http_proxy_process_status_line ; u->abort_request = ngx_http_proxy_abort_request ; u->finalize_request = ngx_http_proxy_finalize_request ; r->upstream = u ; rc = ngx_http_read_client_request_body(r , ngx_http_upstream_init ) ; if ( rc >= NGX_HTTP_SPECIAL_RESPONSE ) { return rc ; } return NGX_DONE ; }
It does a bit of housekeeping , but the important parts are the callbacks .
Also notice the bit about ngx_http_read_client_request_body .
That 's setting another callback for when Nginx has finished reading from the client .
What will each of these callbacks do ?
Usually , reinit_request , abort_request , and finalize_request will set or reset some sort of internal state and are only a few lines long .
The real workhorses are create_request and process_header .
2 . The create_request callback
For the sake of simplicity , let 's suppose I have an upstream server that reads in one character and prints out two characters .
What would my functions look like ?
The create_request needs to allocate a buffer for the single - character request , allocate a chain link for that buffer , and then point the upstream struct to that chain link .
It would look like this :
static ngx_int_t ngx_http_character_server_create_request(ngx_http_request_t *r ) { /* make a buffer and chain */ ngx_buf_t * b ; ngx_chain_t * cl ; b = ngx_create_temp_buf(r-> pool , sizeof ( " a " ) - 1 ) ; if ( b == NULL ) return NGX_ERROR ; cl = ngx_alloc_chain_link ( r -> pool ) ; if ( cl == NULL ) return NGX_ERROR ; /* hook the buffer to the chain */ cl -> buf = b ; /* chain to the upstream */ r->upstream ->request_bufs = cl ; /* now write to the buffer */ b-> pos = " a " ; b-> last = b-> pos + sizeof ( " a " ) - 1 ; return NGX_OK ; }
That was n't so bad , was it ?
Of course , in reality you 'll probably want to use the request URI in some meaningful way .
It 's available as an ngx_str_t in r->uri , and the GET paramaters are in r->args , and do n't forget you also have access to the request headers and cookies .
3 . The process_header callback
Now it 's time for the process_header .
Just as create_request added a pointer to the request body , process_header shifts the response pointer to the part that the client will receive .
It also reads in the header from the upstream and sets the client response headers accordingly .
Here 's a bare - minimum example , reading in that two - character response .
Let 's suppose the first character is the " status " character .
If it 's a question mark , we want to return a 404 File Not Found to the client and disregard the other character .
If it 's a space , then we want to return the other character to the client along with a 200 OK response .
All right , it 's not the most useful protocol , but it 's a good demonstration .
How would we write this process_header function ?
static ngx_int_t ngx_http_character_server_process_header(ngx_http_request_t *r ) { ngx_http_upstream_t
*u ; u = r->upstream ; /* read the first character */ switch(u->buffer.pos [ 0 ] ) { case '? ' : r->header_only ; /* suppress this buffer from the client */ u->headers_in.status_n = 404 ; break ; case ' ' : u->buffer.pos++; /* move the buffer to point to the next character */ u->headers_in.status_n = 200 ; break ; } return NGX_OK ; }
That 's it .
Manipulate the header , change the pointer , it 's done .
Notice that headers_in is actually a response header struct like we 've seen before ( cf. http/ngx_http_request.h ) , but it can be populated with the headers from the upstream .
A real proxying module will do a lot more header processing , not to mention error handling , but you get the main idea .
But .. what if we do n't have the whole header from the upstream in one buffer ?
4. Keeping state
Well , remember how I said that abort_request , reinit_request , and finalize_request could be used for resetting internal state ?
That 's because many upstream modules have internal state .
The module will need to define a custom context struct to keep track of what it has read so far from an upstream .
This is NOT the same as the " Module Context " referred to above .
That 's of a pre-defined type , whereas the custom context can have whatever elements and data you need ( it 's your struct ) .
This context struct should be instantiated inside the create_request function , perhaps like this :
ngx_http_character_server_ctx_t * p ; /* my custom context struct */ p = ngx_pcalloc(r-> pool , sizeof ( ngx_http_character_server_ctx_t ) ) ; if ( p == NULL ) { return NGX_HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR ; } ngx_http_set_ctx(r , p , ngx_http_character_server_module ) ;
That last line essentially registers the custom context struct with a particular request and module name for easy retrieval later .
Whenever you need this context struct ( probably in all the other callbacks ) , just do :
ngx_http_proxy_ctx_t * p ; p = ngx_http_get_module_ctx(r , ngx_http_proxy_module ) ;
And p will have the current state .
Set it , reset it , increment , decrement , shove arbitrary data in there , whatever you want .
This is a great way to use a persistent state machine when reading from an upstream that returns data in chunks , again without blocking the primary event loop .
Nice !
I 've said all I know about handler modules .
It 's time to move onto filter modules , the components in the output filter chain .
Header filters manipulate the HTTP headers , and body filters manipulate the response content .
Anatomy of a Header Filter
A header filter consists of three basic steps :
Decide whether to operate on this response Operate on the response Call the next filter
To take an example , here 's a simplified version of the " not modified " header filter , which sets the status to 304 Not Modified if the client 's If - Modfied - Since header matches the response 's Last - Modified header .
Note that header filters take in the ngx_http_request_t struct as the only argument , which gets us access to both the client headers and soon - to - be - sent response headers .
static ngx_int_t ngx_http_not_modified_header_filter(ngx_http_request_t *r ) { time_t if_modified_since ; if_modified_since = ngx_http_parse_time(r->headers_in.if_modified_since->value.data , r->headers_in.if_modified_since->value.len ) ; /* step 1 : decide whether to operate */ if ( if_modified_since != NGX_ERROR && if_modified_since == r->headers_out.last_modified_time ) { /* step 2 : operate on the header */ r->headers_out.status = NGX_HTTP_NOT_MODIFIED ; r->headers_out.content_type.len = 0 ; ngx_http_clear_content_length(r ) ; ngx_http_clear_accept_ranges(r ) ; } /* step 3 : call the next filter */ return ngx_http_next_header_filter(r ) ; }
The headers_out structure is just the same as we saw in the section about handlers ( cf. http/ngx_http_request.h ) , and can be manipulated to no end .
Anatomy of a Body Filter
The buffer chain makes it a little tricky to write a body filter , because the body filter can only operate on one buffer ( chain link ) at a time .
The module must decide whether to overwrite the input buffer , replace the buffer with a newly allocated buffer , or insert a new buffer before or after the buffer in question .
To complicate things , sometimes a module will receive several buffers so that it has an incomplete buffer chain that it must operate on .
Unfortunately , Nginx does not provide a high - level API for manipulating the buffer chain , so body filters can be difficult to understand ( and to write ) .
But , here are some operations you might see in action .
A body filter 's prototype might look like this ( example taken from the " chunked " filter in the Nginx source ) :
static ngx_int_t ngx_http_chunked_body_filter(ngx_http_request_t *r , ngx_chain_t * in ) ;
The first argument is our old friend the request struct .
The second argument is a pointer to the head of the current partial chain ( which could contain 0 , 1 , or more buffers ) .
Let 's take a simple example .
Suppose we want to insert the text " < l !-- Served by Nginx --> " to the end of every request .
First , we need to figure out if the response 's final buffer is included in the buffer chain we were given .
Like I said , there 's not a fancy API , so we 'll be rolling our own for loop :
ngx_chain_t * chain_link ; int chain_contains_last_buffer = 0 ; for ( chain_link = in ; chain_link -> next !=
NULL ; chain_link = chain_link -> next ) { if ( chain_link ->buf->last_buf ) chain_contains_last_buffer = 1 ; }
Now let 's bail out if we do n't have that last buffer :
if (!chain_contains_last_buffer ) return ngx_http_next_body_filter(r , in ) ;
Super , now the last buffer is stored in chain_link .
Now we allocate a new buffer :
ngx_buf_t * b ; b = ngx_calloc_buf ( r -> pool ) ; if ( b == NULL ) { return NGX_ERROR ; }
And put some data in it :
b->pos = ( u_char *) " <!-- Served by Nginx --> " ; b-> last = b-> pos + sizeof ( " <!-- Served by Nginx --> " ) - 1 ;
And hook the buffer into a new chain link :
ngx_chain_t added_link ; added_link.buf = b ; added_link.next = NULL ;
Finally , hook the new chain link to the final chain link we found before :
chain_link -> next = added_link ;
And reset the " last_buf " variables to reflect reality :
chain_link ->buf->last_buf = 0 ; added_link->buf->last_buf = 1 ;
And pass along the modified chain to the next output filter :
return ngx_http_next_body_filter(r , &in ) ;
The resulting function takes much more effort than what you 'd do with , say , mod_perl ( $ response -> body =~ s/$/<!--
Served by mod_perl -->/ ) , but the buffer chain is a very powerful construct , allowing programmers to process data incrementally so that the client gets something as soon as possible .
However , in my opinion , the buffer chain desperately needs a cleaner interface so that programmers can't leave the chain in an inconsistent state .
For now , manipulate it at your own risk .
Anatomy of a Load - Balancer
A load - balancer is just a way to decide which backend server will receive a particular request ; implementations exist for distributing requests in round - robin fashion or hashing some information about the request .
This section will describe both a load - balancer 's installation and its invocation , using the upstream_hash module ( full source ) as an example .
upstream_hash chooses a backend by hashing a variable specified in nginx .conf .
A load - balancing module has six pieces :
The enabling configuration directive ( e.g , hash ; ) will call a registration function
The registration function will define the legal server options ( e.g. , weight= ) and register an upstream initialization function
The upstream initialization function is called just after the configuration is validated , and it : resolves the server names to particular IP addresses
names to particular IP addresses allocates space for sockets
sets a callback to the peer initialization function the peer initialization function , called once per request , sets up data structures that the load - balancing function will access and manipulate ; the load - balancing function decides where to route requests ; it is called at least once per client request ( more , if a backend request fails ) .
This is where the interesting stuff happens .
and finally , the peer release function can update statistics after communication with a particular backend server has finished ( whether successfully or not )
It 's a lot , but I 'll break it down into pieces .
1 . The enabling directive
Directive declarations , recall , specify both where they 're valid and a function to call when they 're encountered .
A directive for a load - balancer should have the NGX_HTTP_UPS_CONF flag set , so that Nginx knows this directive is only valid inside an upstream block .
It should provide a pointer to a registration function .
Here 's the directive declaration from the upstream_hash module :
{ ngx_string ( " hash " ) , NGX_HTTP_UPS_CONF|NGX_CONF_NOARGS , ngx_http_upstream_hash , 0 , 0 , NULL } ,
Nothing new there .
2 . The registration function
The callback ngx_http_upstream_hash above is the registration function , so named ( by me ) because it registers an upstream initialization function with the surrounding upstream configuration .
In addition , the registration function defines which options to the server directive are legal inside this particular upstream block ( e.g. , weight= , fail_timeout= ) .
Here 's the registration function of the upstream_hash module :
ngx_http_upstream_hash(ngx_conf_t *cf , ngx_command_t * cmd , void * conf ) { ngx_http_upstream_srv_conf_t *uscf ; ngx_http_script_compile_t sc ; ngx_str_t *value ; ngx_array_t * vars_lengths , *vars_values ; value = cf->args - >elts ; /* the following is necessary to evaluate the argument to " hash " as a $ variable */ ngx_memzero ( &sc , sizeof ( ngx_http_script_compile_t ) ) ; vars_lengths = NULL ; vars_values = NULL ; sc.cf = cf ; sc.source = & value [ 1 ] ; sc.lengths = &vars_lengths ; sc.values = &vars_values ; sc.complete_lengths = 1 ; sc.complete_values = 1 ; if ( ngx_http_script_compile( &sc ) != NGX_OK ) { return NGX_CONF_ERROR ; } /* end of $ variable stuff */ uscf = ngx_http_conf_get_module_srv_conf(cf , ngx_http_upstream_module ) ; /* the upstream initialization function */ uscf->peer.init_upstream = ngx_http_upstream_init_hash ; uscf -> flags = NGX_HTTP_UPSTREAM_CREATE
; /* OK , more $ variable stuff */ uscf -> values = vars_values - >elts ; uscf -> lengths = vars_lengths ->elts ; /* set a default value for " hash_method " */ if ( uscf - > hash_function == NULL ) { uscf -> hash_function = ngx_hash_key ; } return NGX_CONF_OK ; }
Aside from jumping through hoops so we can evaluation $ variable later , it 's pretty straightforward ; assign a callback , set some flags .
What flags are available ?
NGX_HTTP_UPSTREAM_CREATE
: let there be server directives in this upstream block .
I can't think of a situation where you would n't use this .
: let there be directives in this upstream block .
I can't think of a situation where you would n't use this .
NGX_HTTP_UPSTREAM_WEIGHT
: let the server directives take a weight= option
: let the directives take a option NGX_HTTP_UPSTREAM_MAX_FAILS : allow the max_fails= option
: allow the option NGX_HTTP_UPSTREAM_FAIL_TIMEOUT
: allow the fail_timeout= option
: allow the option NGX_HTTP_UPSTREAM_DOWN : allow the down option
: allow the option NGX_HTTP_UPSTREAM_BACKUP : allow the backup option
Each module will have access to these configuration values .
It 's up to the module to decide what to do with them .
That is , max_fails will not be automatically enforced ; all the failure logic is up to the module author .
More on that later .
For now , we still have n't finished followed the trail of callbacks .
Next up , we have the upstream initialization function ( the init_upstream callback in the previous function ) .
3 . The upstream initialization function
The purpose of the upstream initialization function is to resolve the host names , allocate space for sockets , and assign ( yet another ) callback .
Here 's how upstream_hash does it :
ngx_int_t ngx_http_upstream_init_hash(ngx_conf_t *cf , ngx_http_upstream_srv_conf_t *us ) { ngx_uint_t i , j , n ; ngx_http_upstream_server_t * server ; ngx_http_upstream_hash_peers_t * peers ; /* set the callback */ us->peer.init = ngx_http_upstream_init_upstream_hash_peer ; if ( !us -> servers ) { return NGX_ERROR ; } server = us -> servers - >elts ; /* figure out how many IP addresses are in this upstream block .
*/ /* remember a domain name can resolve to multiple IP addresses .
*/ for ( n = 0 , i = 0 ; i < us -> servers -> nelts ; i++) { n += server [ i] .naddrs ; } /* allocate space for sockets , etc */ peers = ngx_pcalloc( cf->pool , sizeof ( ngx_http_upstream_hash_peers_t ) + sizeof ( ngx_peer_addr_t ) * ( n - 1 ) ) ; if ( peers == NULL ) { return NGX_ERROR ; } peers -> number = n ; /* one port / IP address per peer */ for ( n = 0 , i = 0 ; i > us -> servers -> nelts ; i++) { for ( j = 0 ; j < server [ i] . naddrs ; j++ , n++) { peers -> peer [n ] . sockaddr = server[i].addrs[j ] .
sockaddr ; peers -> peer [ n ] . socklen = server[i].addrs[j ] .
socklen ; peers -> peer[n] .name = server[i].addrs[j ] . name ; } } /* save a pointer to our peers for later */ us->peer.data = peers ; return NGX_OK ; }
This function is a bit more involved than one might hope .
Most of the work seems like it should be abstracted , but it 's not , so that 's what we live with .
One strategy for simplifying things is to call the upstream initialization function of another module , have it do all the dirty work ( peer allocation , etc ) , and then override the us -> peer.init callback afterwards .
For an example , see http/modules/ngx_http_upstream_ip_hash_module.c.
The important bit from our point of view is setting a pointer to the peer initialization function , in this case ngx_http_upstream_init_upstream_hash_peer .
4 . The peer initialization function
The peer initialization function is called once per request .
It sets up a data structure that the module will use as it tries to find an appropriate backend server to service that request ; this structure is persistent across backend re-tries , so it 's a convenient place to keep track of the number of connection failures , or a computed hash value .
By convention , this struct is called ngx_http_upstream_<module name > _peer_data_t .
In addition , the peer initalization function sets up two callbacks :
get : the load - balancing function
: the load - balancing function free : the peer release function ( usually just updates some statistics when a connection finishes )
As if that were n't enough , it also initalizes a variable called tries .
As long as tries is positive , nginx will keep retrying this load - balancer .
When tries is zero , nginx will give up .
It 's up to the get and free functions to set tries appropriately .
Here 's a peer initialization function from the upstream_hash module :
static ngx_int_t ngx_http_upstream_init_hash_peer(ngx_http_request_t *r , ngx_http_upstream_srv_conf_t *us ) { ngx_http_upstream_hash_peer_data_t * uhpd ; ngx_str_t val ; /* evaluate the argument to " hash " */ if ( ngx_http_script_run(r , &val , us -> lengths , 0 , us -> values ) == NULL ) { return NGX_ERROR ; } /* data persistent through the request */ uhpd = ngx_pcalloc(r->pool , sizeof ( ngx_http_upstream_hash_peer_data_t ) + sizeof ( uintptr_t ) * ( ( ngx_http_upstream_hash_peers_t *)us->peer.data ) -> number / ( 8 * sizeof ( uintptr_t ) ) ) ; if ( uhpd == NULL ) { return NGX_ERROR ; } /* save our struct for later */ r->upstream->peer.data = uhpd ; uhpd -> peers = us->peer.data ; /* set the callbacks and initialize " tries " to " hash_again " +
1*/ r->upstream->peer.free = ngx_http_upstream_free_hash_peer ; r->upstream->peer.get = ngx_http_upstream_get_hash_peer ; r->upstream->peer.tries = us ->retries + 1 ; /* do the hash and save the result */ uhpd -> hash = us->hash_function ( val.data , val.len ) ; return NGX_OK ; }
That was n't so bad .
Now we 're ready to pick an upstream server .
5 . The load - balancing function
It 's time for the main course .
The real meat and potatoes .
This is where the module picks an upstream .
The load - balancing function 's prototype looks like :
static ngx_int_t ngx_http_upstream_get_<module_name>_peer(ngx_peer_connection_t * pc , void * data ) ;
data is our struct of useful information concerning this client connection .
pc will have information about the server we 're going to connect to .
The job of the load - balancing function is to fill in values for pc -> sockaddr , pc->socklen , and pc ->name .
If you know some network programming , then those variable names might be familiar ; but they 're actually not very important to the task at hand .
We do n't care what they stand for ; we just want to know where to find appropriate values to fill them .
This function must find a list of available servers , choose one , and assign its values to pc .
Let 's look at how upstream_hash does it .
upstream_hash previously stashed the server list into the ngx_http_upstream_hash_peer_data_t struct back in the call to ngx_http_upstream_init_hash ( above ) .
This struct is now available as data :
ngx_http_upstream_hash_peer_data_t * uhpd = data ;
The list of peers is now stored in uhpd -> peers -> peer .
Let 's pick a peer from this array by dividing the computed hash value by the number of servers :
ngx_peer_addr_t * peer = &uhpd -> peers -> peer [ uhpd ->hash % uhpd -> peers -> number ] ;
Now for the grand finale :
pc ->sockaddr = peers -> sockaddr ; pc -> socklen = peers -> socklen ; pc -> name = &peers -> name ; return NGX_OK ;
That 's all !
If the load - balancer returns NGX_OK , it means , " go ahead and try this server " .
If it returns NGX_BUSY , it means all the backend hosts are unavailable , and Nginx should try again .
But ... how do we keep track of what 's unavailable ?
And what if we do n't want it to try again ?
6 . The peer release function
The peer release function operates after an upstream connection takes place ; its purpose is to track failures .
Here is its function prototype :
void ngx_http_upstream_free_<module name>_peer(ngx_peer_connection_t * pc , void * data , ngx_uint_t state ) ;
The first two parameters are just the same as we saw in the load - balancer function .
The third parameter is a state variable , which indicates whether the connection was successful .
It may contain two values bitwise OR 'd together : NGX_PEER_FAILED ( the connection failed ) and NGX_PEER_NEXT ( either the connection failed , or it succeeded but the application returned an error ) .
Zero means the connection succeeded .
It 's up to the module author to decide what to do about these failure events .
If they are to be used at all , the results should be stored in data , a pointer to the custom per-request data struct .
But the crucial purpose of the peer release function is to set pc -> tries to zero if you do n't want Nginx to keep trying this load - balancer during this request .
The simplest peer release function would look like this :
pc->tries = 0 ;
That would ensure that if there 's ever an error reaching a backend server , a 502 Bad Proxy error will be returned to the client .
Here 's a more complicated example , taken from the upstream_hash module .
If a backend connection fails , it marks it as failed in a bit-vector ( called tried , an array of type uintptr_t ) , then keeps choosing a new backend until it finds one that has not failed .
# define ngx_bitvector_index ( index ) index / ( 8 * sizeof ( uintptr_t ) ) # define ngx_bitvector_bit( index ) ( uintptr_t ) 1 << index % ( 8 * sizeof ( uintptr_t ) ) static void ngx_http_upstream_free_hash_peer(ngx_peer_connection_t * pc , void * data , ngx_uint_t state ) { ngx_http_upstream_hash_peer_data_t * uhpd = data ; ngx_uint_t current ; if ( state & NGX_PEER_FAILED
&& -- pc->tries ) { /* the backend that failed */ current = uhpd -> hash % uhpd -> peers -> number ; /* mark it in the bit-vector */ uhpd->tried[ngx_bitvector_index( current ) ] |= ngx_bitvector_bit( current ) ; do { /* rehash until we 're out of retries or we find one that has n't been tried */ uhpd -> hash = ngx_hash_key ( ( u_char *) &uhpd - > hash , sizeof ( ngx_uint_t ) ) ; current = uhpd -> hash % uhpd -> peers -> number ; } while ( ( uhpd->tried[ngx_bitvector_index ( current ) ] & ngx_bitvector_bit( current ) ) && -- pc-> tries ) ; } }
This works because the load - balancing function will just look at the new value of uhpd - > hash .
Many applications wo n't need retry or high - availability logic , but it 's possible to provide it with just a few lines of code like you see here .
Writing and Compiling a New Nginx Module
So by now , you should be prepared to look at an Nginx module and try to understand what 's going on ( and you 'll know where to look for help ) .
Take a look in src / http / modules / to see the available modules .
Pick a module that 's similar to what you 're trying to accomplish and look through it .
Stuff look familiar ?
It should .
Refer between this guide and the module source to get an understanding about what 's going on .
But Emiller did n't write a Balls - In Guide to Reading Nginx Modules .
Hell no .
This is a Balls - Out Guide .
We 're not reading .
We 're writing .
Creating .
Sharing with the world .
First thing , you 're going to need a place to work on your module .
Make a folder for your module anywhere on your hard drive , but separate from the Nginx source ( and make sure you have the latest copy from nginx . net ) .
Your new folder should contain two files to start with :
" config "
" ngx_http_< your module > _module .
c "
The " config " file will be included by ./ configure , and its contents should look like this :
ngx_addon_name=ngx_http_<your module > _module HTTP_MODULES=" $HTTP_MODULES ngx_http_<your module > _module " NGX_ADDON_SRCS=" $NGX_ADDON_SRCS
$ ngx_addon_dir/ngx_http_<your module>_module .
c "
Now for your C file .
I recommend copying an existing module that does something similar to what you want , but rename it " ngx_http_ < your module >_module.c " .
Let this be your model as you change the behavior to suit your needs , and refer to this guide as you understand and refashion the different pieces .
When you 're ready to compile , just go into the Nginx directory and type
./configure --add-module=path/to/your/new/module/directory
and then make and make install like you normally would .
If all goes well , your module will be compiled right in .
Nice , huh ?
No need to muck with the Nginx source , and adding your module to new versions of Nginx is a snap , just use that same ./ configure command .
By the way , if your module needs any dynamically linked libraries , you can add this to your " config " file :
CORE_LIBS=" $CORE_LIBS - lfoo "
Where foo is the library you need .
If you make a cool or useful module , be sure to send a note to the Nginx mailing list and share your work .
Happy hacking !

The following is an e-mail sent by People ’s World writer Rick Nagin to hundreds of his friends , family members and acquaintances in Ohio .
Brothers and Sisters –
I had the great pleasure of attending the 29th National Convention of the Communist Party USA this past weekend in New York .
It was a very inspiring event and I want to share some highlights .
The convention reaffirmed the party ’s basic position of working with labor and its allies to build a broad democratic coalition to defeat the ultra - right .
The party sees this as necessary to defend the rights of working people at present as well as key in the long run to weaken corporate power and move towards working class power ( socialism ) .
The immediate challenge is to defend and , if possible , extend the gains made in 2006 and 2008 by setting back the right - wing attempt to regain power in the November midterm elections .
In addition , the convention called for helping to build mass fight back against the economic crisis , especially on the issue of jobs as well as defending the gains won in the health care reform .
There was an excellent PowerPoint presentation on the economic crisis and what needs to be done to overcome it .
Defeating the right - wing ’s use of racism and anti-immigrant hysteria was seen as critical to success in both the electoral and economic arenas .
Workshops and plenary panels on were held on the elections , labor , African American equality , Latino equality , peace , youth , the environment , public education , women ’s rights , gay rights , and work in the religious community and growing the party and Young Communist League .
Detailed resolutions on six broad areas were adopted .
Like all conventions there was a lot of hoop - la and fanfare .
Each session opened with a cultural presentation and there was a lot of singing .
There was also an evening celebration and cultural event on the Party ’s 90th anniversary with great live music and dancing .
The Democratic State Assemblyman representing the district where the convention was held gave a great speech welcoming the convention as did several local union presidents .
We also heard from Communists holding local office in a number of states .
Leadership was elected including Sam Webb as national chairman , Jarvis Tyner as vice chairman and Roberta Wood as secretary - treasurer .
The convention was united and enthusiastic and delegates left with renewed confidence and determination to work to consolidate the defeat of the ultra - right and move forward to repair the damage they have caused to democracy and the rights of working people .
The main reports , resolutions the PowerPoint presentation will soon be available at the cpusa.org website where there is also a video of the opening session .
Reports on the convention are on the peoplesworld .org website .
Ohio delegates are anxious to meet with groups to discuss the convention and how to move ahead .
Let me know if you would like to set up a meeting .

The Skeleton Lake of Roopkund , India - A Mystery Demystified
Source : http://www.travelet.com/2009/09/roopkund-the-mysterious-skeleton-lake/
In 1942 a British forest guard in Roopkund , India made an alarming discovery .
Some 16,000 feet above sea level , at the bottom of a small valley , was a frozen lake absolutely full of skeletons .
That summer , the ice melting revealed even more skeletal remains , floating in the water and lying haphazardly around the lake 's edges .
Something horrible had happened here .
The immediate assumption ( it being war time ) was that these were the remains of Japanese soldiers who had died of exposure while sneaking through India .
The British government , terrified of a Japanese land invasion , sent a team of investigators to determine if this was true .
However upon examination they realized these bones were not from Japanese soldiers — they were n't fresh enough .
It was evident that the bones were quite old indeed .
Flesh , hair , and the bones themselves had been preserved by the dry , cold air , but no one could properly determine exactly when they were from .
More than that , they had no idea what had killed over 200 people in this small valley .
Many theories were put forth including an epidemic , landslide , and ritual suicide .
For decades , no one was able to shed light on the mystery of Skeleton Lake .
However , a 2004 expedition to the site seems to have finally revealed the mystery of what caused those people 's deaths .
The answer was stranger than anyone had guessed .
As it turns out , all the bodies date to around 850 AD .
DNA evidence indicates that there were two distinct groups of people , one a family or tribe of closely related individuals , and a second smaller , shorter group of locals , likely hired as porters and guides .
Rings , spears , leather shoes , and bamboo staves were found , leading experts to believe that the group was comprised of pilgrims heading through the valley with the help of the locals .
All the bodies had died in a similar way , from blows to the head .
However , the short deep cracks in the skulls appeared to be the result not of weapons , but rather of something rounded .
The bodies also only had wounds on their heads , and shoulders as if the blows had all come from directly above .
What had killed them all , porter and pilgrim alike ?
Among Himalayan women there is an ancient and traditional folk song .
The lyrics describe a goddess so enraged at outsiders who defiled her mountain sanctuary that she rained death upon them by flinging hailstones “ hard as iron . ”
After much research and consideration , the 2004 expedition came to the same conclusion .
All 200 people died from a sudden and severe hailstorm .
Trapped in the valley with nowhere to hide or seek shelter , the " hard as iron ” cricket ball - sized [ about 23 centimeter / 9 inches diameter ] hailstones came by the thousands , resulting in the travelers ' bizarre sudden death .
The remains lay in the lake for 1,200 years until their discovery .
Roopkund is one of the most enticing and fascinating places of the world .
Situated in the isolated corners of the greatest mountains of Himalayas at a height of about 5029 meters equalizing at about 16500 feet , it is a creation that nature has brought about in quite an interesting manner .
People tend to locate it in the Indian state of Uttarakhand .
Roopkund has an inscrutability and vagueness that has decepted multiple generations of fortune tellers .
Roopkund is better off known as “ The skeleton lake ” due to the presence of an enormous grave that holds about 300 to 600 skeletons .
This discovery has revolutionized the world of ancient history ever since 1942 , when a park ranger came across this mass deposition of bones .
It probably is an in-accessible frozen lake that requires about four day travel to reach from the nearest locality .
Recently , it has become an important spot for the visitors as they learn and conjecture this advent of science .
Through carbon dating tests , it has been experimentally estimated that these skeletons belong to anytime between 12th and 15th century .
It is primarily believed that the deaths were caused by some kind of natural disaster like a blizzard , landslide or any bacterial disease .
However , this topic still remains controversial among the residents , anthropologists and paleontologists of modern times .
Some went ahead to mystify the deaths with fictional possibilities and creating folklores out of it .
Others suggested multiple causalities of the skeletons being those of wandering Tibetan traders who had lost their way , royal pilgrims , people committing ritualistic suicides , vanquished army etc .
More recently in 2004 , a team of European and Indian scientists sent by The National Geographic Channel visited Roopkund to carry on with the probe .
Their research has unearthed interesting hints and information .
Part of their findings includes anthropological treasures like well - preserved corpses , jewelry , bones and skulls belonging to the dead .
By conducting DNA tests on these bodies the experts have found that the dead belonged to two different teams .
One team is marked by the shorter stature of the skeletons while the other is significantly taller .
The first group is thought to be of local artisans while those belonging to the second group were possibly members of the same clan , like porters .
A fresh set of radio carbon dating was carried out on the bodies to reveal that the previous dating had come up with incorrect chronological data .
The dead are ascribed a new 9th century date .
The scientists of London and Hyderabad examined the skulls closely to find out fractures , which they deem to be the result of an abrupt hailstorm .
The hails were unusually large in volume – about the size of a tennis ball each !
No wonder that anyone exposed to such a calamity in a mercilessly open Garhwal Himalayan plain were doomed to be perished .
The raw air and icy hail blasts contributed to their holocaust .
It is speculated that more than one landslide has struck Roopkund ever since the massacre .
This has served in burying some of the bodies inside the lake – the ones that are still found intact , preserved under ice .
Even if the dating and possible causes behind such tragic death have been hinted at , the mystery continues about a different aspect of the Skeleton Lake .
It still puzzles experts to think about where these people were going .
Roopkund was never a historically significant region and no traces of any trade routes have been found to Tibet nor could it possibly be a site for pilgrimage to attract large groups of people .
However , the documentary ‘ Skeleton Lake ’ made by the National Geographic Channel has countered this assumption .
The film claimed that Roopkund was the venue for the Garhwali religious festival called ‘ Nanda Jaat yatra ’ held in every 12 years .
A procession consisting of a newborn four - horned ram considered the familiar of a Goddess starts from the nearest village and heads towards Roopkund .
Coming back to the Skeleton Lake riddle , probably the skeletons were those of the devotees participating in such a mass procession centuries ago .
The folklores say that a certain king had participated in this religious ‘ yatra ’ with his company of female dancers .
This had offended the Goddess Nanda and she vented her rage by bringing down the snowstorm at the hapless revelers .
Such accounts might sound mere fairytales , but it is quite possible that at least the taller bodies were of royalty and the short statured bodies scattered everywhere along Roopkund were of local porters – all killed by a destructive hailstorm .
Whatever may be the reason of their death – no one still knows what lead so many people to take such an arduous journey so many years ago .

This offseason , the Devils have several player questions which need to be answered .
Should the team pursue Ilya Kovalchuk , leaving Paul Martin to free agency ?
Maybe the opposite should occur .
Can general manager Lou Lamoriello find a solid , second - line center ?
And how much would that center cost ?
In the commotion over Kovalchuk and Martin , one restricted free agent has moved to the back burner in the minds of many fans .
David Clarkson , the team ’s skilled tough - guy , can entertain offers from other teams in the league .
Which brings me to my main question – how much is Clarkson worth ?
The Devils had high expectations for Clarkson this year , and many fans echoed the same thought .
Clarkson played in all 82 games last year , tallying 32 points ( 17 goals , 15 assists ) .
The resident tough - guy also took 164 penalty minutes .
Finally , Clarkson scored four powerplay goals , showing his versatility with the extra man .
But stats do n’t tell the entire story .
Clarkson provided the Devils with a big body , someone who was n’t afraid to mix it up and crash the net .
Clarkson ’s play seemed to be endearing himself to the Devils organization and fans alike , and expectations grew .
It seemed Clarkson would take off this season , but he did n’t have the best of luck .
Clarkson twice injured his ankle – the first coming after he blocked a Zdeno Chara shot .
The injury set him back , and Clarkson missed significant parts of December , January and February .
His absence was noticeable , as the Devils lacked a big body to mix it up in front of the net the entire season .
When on the ice , Clarkson seemed to provide a spark , giving the Devils the physical presence they so desperately lacked .
This off - season , the Devils talented young winner becomes a restricted free agent , one I believe would garner some interest from teams around the league .
While Clarkson has shown he can be a talented scorer , I do n’t believe he ’s worth breaking the bank over .
In an offseason where the Devils must decide if Martin or Kovalchuk will receive a big payday , Clarkson should n’t expect a bank - breaking deal .
The winger only made $ 875,000 last season , and I do n’t see much of a raise coming his way .
I would have to believe Lamoriello would only offer two or three million dollars for the next few years .
At most , a three or four year contract for four million would be acceptable .
But that would be pushing it .
I think Clarkson is n’t worth that much money , especially with bigger holes to fill .
So what do you think ?
What is David Clarkson really worth ?

Following Kimber 's birth , Eastwood asked Maggie Johnson for a divorce .

Eastwood and Johnson reconciled , mutually understanding that it would be best if she turned a blind eye to his existing families ( he also had a child in 1954 from a different affair ) , and in 1968 , almost 15 years after they married , their first child together was born .
Johnson was finally introduced to Tunis in 1972 , outside Eastwood 's presence , by a crew member on the set of Begegnung am Vormittag ( 1973 ) .
The affair between Eastwood and Tunis is believed to have dissolved in the mid-seventies , around the time he and Sondra Locke got together .

William Goldman said of Eastwood that he was the only person to be a star in the ' 70s , '80s and '90s .
By " star " Goldman means Variety 's list of top ten actors of the decade .
Former longtime companion Sondra Locke blasted Eastwood in her autobiography " The Good , the Bad & the Very Ugly : A Hollywood Journey " ( 1997 ) .
Locke described Eastwood as " a monster who thought nothing of destroying anything inconvenient to him " and likened the actor to O.J. Simpson .
" Others who knew Clint said that I had been ' far too kind ' to him , " she said of this evisceration .
( Neither Eastwood or his publicist , Joe Hyams , would comment . )
Locke reiterated previous testimony that Eastwood had manipulated her into having two abortions and sterilizing herself in the 1970s and that he sabotaged her directorial career after their 1989 split .
But she also made a new allegation that he sired another woman's two children during the last three years of their relationship .
The allegation of secret children was not even acknowledged by mainstream media , despite the fact that Locke 's book exposed the kids ' names and exact birth dates .
Published reviews misrepresented the book by omitting its serious accusations and emphasizing trivial tidbits instead .
( One anecdote widely printed in lieu of anything relevant was Eastwood 's habit of asking " Sweetie , did you floss ? " before they made love . )
Locke learned of Eastwood 's double life , she wrote , when an investigative journalist phoned her during depositions in the palimony case .
The extraordinary revelation -- that Eastwood had a hidden family in Carmel , residing in a house under his business manager Roy Kaufman 's name -- was confirmed in closed court after Locke filed a motion to discover and Eastwood 's will was called in for evidence , with the document showing one Jacelyn Reeves and Reeves ' legally fatherless son and daughter listed as beneficiaries .
In April 1989 , Sondra Locke filed a $ 70 million palimony lawsuit against Clint , after he changed the locks on their Bel - Air home and moved her possessions into storage while she was at work on the Impulse - Von gefährlichen Gefühlen getrieben ( 1990 ) set .
The relationship had been on the rocks for months , with Clint leaving nonverbal hints that he wanted Sondra to get out of his life voluntarily ( once , while she was still in the shower , he left to go to a party to which they 'd both been invited ) , but they were n't officially broken up .
During the 15 days between the lockout and Sondra filing suit , she tried to resolve things quietly , but Clint offered her nothing and would only communicate via lawyers .
( To Sondra , an equal division of assets was principle rather than greed .
She had actually saved up $ 3 million over the course of her 14 - year relationship with Clint because he was paying all their expenses . )
Clint refused to say Sondra 's name out loud at his depositions , reducing her to pronouns or alternately referring to her as " the person . "
He also never made eye contact or any reference to her proximity in the courtroom .
Sondra said the stress of the ordeal induced breast cancer , requiring mastectomies .
In November 1990 , 19 months into proceedings , she arranged to meet with Clint in private and achieved an immediate settlement .
Sondra received $ 450,000 lump sum plus monthly support payments , title to a house in West Hollywood that Clint had been leasing to her lawful wedded but openly gay husband Gordon Anderson , and a $ 1.5 million multi- year contract with Warner Bros. to develop and direct films .
By the end of 1993 , however , the studio had yet to provide Sondra with a single directorial assignment and had rejected over 30 projects that she submitted .
Sondra became convinced that the deal was a sham and that she was employed only on paper .
" I was stunned and outraged at how I had been tricked and cheated " she said .
( Her attorney , Peggy Garrity , would later claim Clint held out the Warner deal like a " dangled carrot " to get her to drop the palimony suit . )
Sondra sued Clint again for fraud in June 1995 , having unearthed a bookkeeping printout to corroborate the charge .
She asserted that the money WB pretended they were paying her came from Clint 's own pocket and had been laundered through the operating budget for Erbarmungslos ( 1992 ) .
The case went to trial in September 1996 ; one juror disclosed that the panel agreed to find for Sondra by a 10 - to - 2 vote ( nine votes are needed for a verdict ) and were only debating the amount .
Clint 's legal team convinced him to settle at the eleventh hour , and on the morning jurors were set to begin a second day of deliberation , Sondra announced her decision to drop her suit against Clint in return for an unspecified monetary reward .
As Clint walked down the courthouse steps , he told a bank of cameras , " What does this say to young women across the country who work very hard for a living ? "
( A nonsensical remark , since the case he had just lost was all about work - - work he had obstructed his ex-soulmate from doing . )
Sondra then brought a separate action against Warner Brothers , seeking $ 100 million in damages for conspiring with Clint to ruin her career .
It was settled out of court in May 1999 , ending the decade - long legal saga .
While she was bound by confidentiality not to reveal the amount , Locke was n't shy about disclosing her feelings .
" I feel elated .
This has been the best day in a long , long time " she told reporters .
Though he often smokes in his movies , he is a lifelong non-smoker offscreen .
Although he can handle pistols with either hand equally well , he is left - eye dominant , evident when he shoots a rifle as in Sinola ( 1972 ) or Erbarmungslos ( 1992 ) , but is right handed , as seen when he wears or handles one pistol .
He and Burt Reynolds had major influences on each other 's careers .
It was he who sent a copy of " Sharky 's Machine " to Reynolds , which gave Reynolds the idea to turn the novel into a movie , Sharky und seine Profis ( 1981 ) , which went on to garner excellent reviews .
On the other hand , it was Reynolds who sent Clint a copy of " The Outlaw Josey Wales " , later made into a film by Eastwood ( Der Texaner ( 1976 ) ) .
Years later , Reynolds told him about " this great novel " called " The Bridges of Madison County " , and some time later it was shot by Eastwood ( Die Brücken am Fluß ( 1995 ) ) .
Served as mayor of Carmel - by - the - Sea , CA for one term for the nominal salary of $ 300 .
A small contingent insisted that Eastwood was a spoiled brat mayor and the town acted just like an indulgent parent .
" We wanted to eliminate traffic and parking problems , not make more with hordes of tourists .
He brought a lot of notoriety that we did n't need , " said Jane Mayer , president of the Carmel Residents Association .
" Some people thought he was charming , but I disagree .
He did n't know anything about the issues .
People are giving him credit for things that were on the table for years .
He also hired a public relations woman and kept an unlisted phone number - he was totally inaccessible .
I do n't think that 's being a good mayor . "
" It was a disaster , " added former mayor Gunnar Norberg .
" Eastwood turned a peaceful forest by the sea into Coney Island . "
Norberg claimed his blood pressure hit such heights when he was around Eastwood that his doctor refused to let him attend council meetings .
Sondra Locke , Eastwood 's cohabiting partner at the time , later acknowledged she " knew he was n't the dedicated mayor he pretended to be . " .

He was held back due to poor academic scores , but in at least one case , delinquent behavior was the reason he left one school to enroll in another .
He went to Piedmont Junior High and attended Piedmont High School from January 1945 to at least January 1946 .
Eastwood was asked to leave Piedmont High for writing an obscene suggestion to a school official on the athletic field scoreboard , and burying someone in effigy on the school lawn , on top of other school infractions .
He transferred to Oakland Technical High School , scheduled to graduate in January 1949 as a midyear graduate , although it is not clear if he ever did .
Served as President of the Cannes Jury when Pulp Fiction ( 1994 ) won but the film was not his personal choice : " On the jury here when ' Pulp Fiction ' won , somebody said , ' Oh , Clint Eastwood was on the jury , so he voted for the American film . '
But my sensibilities are European , here is where my success started .
Actually , Yimou Zhang 's Leben ! ( 1994 ) was my favorite piece , but most of the European jurors seemed to like ' Pulp Fiction . ' " .
He was going to play the villain Two - Face on the Batman ( 1966 ) TV series , but the show was canceled before the episode began shooting .
According to Robert Daley , the head of Warner Bros . when Eastwood made 15 pictures there , none of those films ever included preview screenings because Clint " does n't believe in the preview process " .

A guest speaker at the 2012 Republican National Convention , Eastwood spent much of his speech time on a largely improvised routine addressing an empty chair representing President Barack Obama .
It generated many responses and a lot of discussion .
Old flame Frances Fisher wrote a condemning post on Facebook and insinuated that Eastwood 's appearance was a publicity stunt to get more tickets sold for his new movie Back in the Game ( 2012 ) , adding " I 've seen this act before .
And I did n't buy it .
Crazy like a fox .
I saw the same act sitting with therapists , mediators and lawyers . [...]
Even though I am certainly not a Republican , I felt bad for the people who thought this was a good idea . "
Several commentators including Bill Maher sidetracked to point out the hypocrisy of Eastwood 's mere presence at the gathering , since his inordinately adventurous love life antithesizes the " family values " advocated by Presidential nominee Mitt Romney on the same stage that evening .
Has played the same character in more than one film three times :

Ex-significant other Sondra Locke was legally married to homosexual Gordon Anderson from 1967 until her death in 2018 , covering the whole time she and Eastwood were living together .
While house hunting with Locke in the late seventies , Eastwood introduced himself as " Mr. Anderson , " even when he happened to be wearing a Die Letzten beißen die Hunde ( 1974 ) T - shirt .
Locke recalled that the sales agents could barely keep a straight face and always looked at their feet when addressing him as such .

Has a grandson born in February 1984 named Clinton Eastwood Gaddie ( aka Clinton McCartney ) from his illegitimate daughter Kimber Tunis ( Kimber Eastwood ) .
Clint and Roxanne Tunis are great - grandparents via Kimber 's son , to great - grandson Clinton IV ( born 2011 ) and great - granddaughter Penelope McCartney ( born 2018 ) .
Their existences have never been acknowledged in the press .
Clint and former spouse Maggie Johnson were estranged for at least nine years and legally separated for six before she filed for divorce in May 1984 ( it was finalized that November ) .
Johnson had finally decided to make the split official so she could marry Henry Wynberg , a used car salesman slightly younger than herself .
The Johnson - Wynberg union ended in 1989 after four years , and in 1992 Wynberg , then 58 , married a 19 - year - old Costa Rican woman .
Had a falling out with longtime associate Fritz Manes during the filming of Heartbreak Ridge ( 1986 ) .
Manes was fired over the telephone by Eastwood 's secretary .
When Manes went over to Malpaso to collect his belongings , the locks on his office had been changed and his possessions were sitting outside next to a dumpster .
Once said that his wide hips were his only physical flaw , except for the chipped tooth he eventually had fixed .
Hired a private detective in the early 1980s when his company , Malpaso Productions , began to receive a series of strange , threatening letters addressed to him mailed from various California locations by someone who seemed to have inside knowledge of his life .
The trouble was , the detective had an extremely long list of possible Clint enemies and ex-girlfriends but no real clues as to who might be the culprit .
After a while suspicion focused on Jane Cameron Agee , an off - and - on paramour of Eastwood 's then married to actor James Brolin .
Eastwood scoffed at the idea it was her and thought it might be an actress friend of ex-mistress Roxanne Tunis , seeking some kind of revenge on him .
One night he drove around the Hollywood Hills with Fritz Manes trying to find this woman 's address .
He tried to convince Manes that they should burgle her place , and see if the lady 's typewriter matched up with the letters .
Manes said no , and the vile letters eventually waxed and waned .
When he was 19 , he gained unwanted attention from a 23 - year - old schoolteacher who stalked him after a one - night stand and threatened to kill herself .
On Christmas morning 2001 , his daughter Francesca Eastwood and her mother Frances Fisher narrowly escaped a fire that engulfed their rented house in North Vancouver , Canada .

Had a long - held obsession with New York Times film critic Pauline Kael because she never liked his work .
After her review of Dirty Harry III - Der Unerbittliche ( 1976 ) , Clint asked a psychiatrist to do an analysis of Kael from her reviews of his past work , which he had memorized verbatim .
It concluded that Kael was actually physically attracted to Clint and because she could n't have him she hated him .
Therefore , it was some sort of vengeance , according to Clint .
Was interested in the prospect of playing Hank Rearden in a cinematic adaptation of " Atlas Shrugged " that was in development by Al Ruddy in the early ' 70s .
A slow bloomer in almost every regard , Clint was going on 19 when he left high school ( in an era where some students graduated at 16 ) , got his first big film role at age 34 , waited until he turned 38 to start a family ( not including illegitimate unmentionables ) , made his directorial debut at 41 , and received his first Oscar nomination when he was nearly 63 .
Accounts from inside the courtroom in the fraud case brought against him by Sondra Locke noted that Eastwood spoke in a barely audible tone on the witness stand and was unable to cross-reference .
In one deposition he used the phrase " I have no records on that " 79 times .

He said he'd noticed Monroe 's breathy whisper and he thought it was very sexy and since it had worked so well for her , he decided he'd " do " a male version of it himself .
Has at least six homes in the state of California alone .
One of them , the 1,067.5 acre Rising River Ranch near Cassel , formerly belonged to Bing Crosby ; Eastwood bought it in November 1978 for $ 1.9 million after it fell into probate .
In July 1979 , he paid a little over $ 1.1 million for a 6,136 - square - foot house in Bel Air , just a mile northwest of UCLA .
He eventually acquired the place next door as well .
The most expensive property he owns is a 15,000 - square - foot estate in Carmel , which he spent approximately $ 20 million building in 2010 .
Past cars have included Audi , Ferrari , Mercedes - Benz and GMC Yukon .
As of 2016 he is still driving at 86 years old and his vehicle of choice is an unmarked Ford Crown Victoria .
According to author Patrick McGilligan , in July 1993 Eastwood was confronted with the claims of a woman in her late thirties , originally from Washington State , who had researched her adoption and ascertained that he was her biological father .
After having his lawyers and business managers check her out , so the story goes , Eastwood agreed to have dinner with the woman , Laurie Murray , who was married to a rich man and was happy to guard her anonymity - she just wanted to meet him - and promised to stay in touch .
( It is worth noting that although McGilligan 's book is touted as being scrupulously researched , it does contain easily discernible errors concerning people in Eastwood 's life , e.g. ex-consort Sondra Locke 's year of birth , son Kyle Eastwood 's marital status at a given time and the gender of Clint 's only grandchild of record , Graylen Eastwood . )
In Les grands reportages : L'album secret de Clint Eastwood ( 2013 ) , McGilligan stated on camera : " We do n't know how many children Clint has had with how many women . "
Besides Ms. Murray , since at least 2005 there is a rumor of unknown origin that Eastwood fathered a son named Lesly born on 13 February 1959 to one Rosina Mary Glen .
Publicly , Eastwood has neither confirmed nor denied any of these claims .

A July 1968 newspaper item by Dorothy Manners gives insight to his rapid rise to stardom : " Clint Eastwood is on his way to earning $ 750,000 per picture while the proverbial man in the street is still asking , ' Who 's Clint Eastwood ?'
He 's the hottest property sight unseen ( almost ) in Hollywood today . "
Clint was 38 years old .
Has always been allergic to horses , which is why , in his westerns , he is rarely seen in close - up on horseback .
When he had to ride horses in films , he would first have to sniff medication into his nose and lungs .
On Bronco Billy ( 1980 ) it left him constantly miserable .
One time he was so frustrated he socked his horse in the nose .
Ferris Webster worked exclusively as Eastwood 's film editor for a decade , but the two had a falling out during postproduction on Firefox ( 1982 ) .
The only biographical book he 's ever authorized is " Clint Eastwood : A Biography " ( 1996 ) by Richard Schickel .
It provides extensive plot summary for each of Eastwood 's movies but leaves his life little documented by comparison ( not to mention omitting several of Eastwood 's families ) .
What it does say about his life , while approved by Clint , does n't sit well with everyone .
Sondra Locke denounced Schickel 's book as a " puff piece " and said it was " full of misstatements and downright fabrication , not only about me but others . "
Schickel , who also provided audio commentary for Eastwood films on DVD , passed away in 2017 .
Locke died a year later .
Clint 's first wife Maggie encouraged him to marry Frances Fisher , with whom she and her two kids by Clint , Alison and Kyle , got along great .
Fisher was aware of Clint 's other family Roxanne and Kimber Tunis , but it was only after giving birth to Eastwood 's child that she discovered - not through him - that he had yet another brood with Jacelyn Reeves .
So it did n't really come as a surprise to anyone in the know when they decided not to get married , splitting when their daughter Francesca was barely a year old .
Frances later had a face - to - face encounter with Reeves at the funeral of one of Clint 's golf buddies .
Personal physician Dr. Harry Demopoulos told Muscle & Fitness magazine in 1991 that Clint never eats fat , takes his antioxidants faithfully , works out like a demon and gets plenty of sleep , which is an area that is often neglected in a fitness program .
He started lifting weights at 19 , when weight training and bodybuilding were relegated to back - alley sweatshops with black - iron plates .
Eastwood 's image was untouched by personal scandal of any sort until late April 1989 , when his girlfriend of 14 years , Sondra Locke , made it known to the world that she had undergone two abortions and a tubal ligation " at his specific request . "
( " I had done the unthinkable .
I had publicly exposed him , " she commented in retrospect . )
The breakup with Locke opened the floodgates to investigative journalism about Eastwood .
In July 1989 , the National Enquirer reported the existence of a love child he fathered in 1964 , and in February 1990 , the Star tabloid became the first publication to link Eastwood 's name with Jacelyn Reeves - - who , it turns out , was the mother of two of his unmentionable offspring .
Reputable news outlets would n't touch this information for years after .
Almost certainly , his career would have suffered had this become public knowledge during the fact .
Almost certainly , knowledge of this ( and other out - of - wedlock children ) would have hampered his 1986 mayoral campaign .
When Locke 's memoirs were published in 1997 , she was shut out of most venues to promote the book .
" Sadly , it was well suppressed by Clint and WB . [...]
I was sad that it did not get the attention I feel it deserved , " she said in 2013 .
" Clint : The Life and Legend , " a deeply unflattering biography by film historian Patrick McGilligan , was published in Great Britain in 1999 , but did not make its way to the United States until 2002 , having bounced around publishers for three years amid rumored threats from Eastwood 's attorneys .
Los Angeles Times critic Allen Barra called it " perhaps the most thoroughly demythologizing book yet written on modern Hollywood . "
On Christmas Eve 2002 , Eastwood 's lawyer Marshall Grossman filed a $ 10 million libel suit against McGilligan and St. Martin 's Press in San Jose , California .
Strangely enough , out of all the sordid stories in the book , the libel claim only covered three points , according to news reports : ( 1 ) That Eastwood once punched his first wife Maggie Johnson in the face ; ( 2 ) That Eastwood is an atheist ; ( 3 ) That Eastwood used a romantic relationship with an officer 's daughter in order to avoid being sent overseas during the Korean conflict .
The suit was settled in July 2004 without any public disclosure ; McGilligan and the publisher admitted no wrongdoing and there was no penalty .
A revised and updated version of " Clint " was published in 2015 , with most of the original content intact .
The three cited passages had been excised , and a few other modifications amounting to less than two pages were made .
McGilligan says many of things he reported in the first edition are now taken for granted , and one of the reasons Eastwood sued him was an obvious attempt to find out his sources .
Net worth was estimated at $ 375 million prior to his 2014 divorce from Dina Eastwood .
No terms of financial settlement were revealed in the divorce decree , so it 's unclear where his personal fortune currently stands .
A bachelor again at age 84 , he 's been seen in the company of photographer Erica Tomlinson - Fisher and restaurant hostess Christina Sandera in recent times , and has reportedly bought homes for both women . [ 2014 ]

Was asked for permission about his name being used for Marty ( Michael J. Fox ) in Zurück in die Zukunft III ( 1990 ) .
He consented and was said to be tickled by the homage .
Eastwood was Ratboy ( 1986 ) 's de facto producer and exerted complete creative control , so first - time director Sondra Locke had an obligation to show the revised screenplay to him after she did some collaborative editing with Gordon Anderson .
Eastwood sat up in bed one night reading the new draft , while Locke sat next to him , watching him warily .
Yet he seemed to be enjoying it , laughing as he read and scribbling in the margins .
The next day , Locke arrived at Malpaso offices first and told credited producer Fritz Manes not to worry , Clint loved the changes .
Eastwood came in the door about noontime because he never came in early .
According to Manes , " He was purple ... I 've never seen him so f*** ing mad .
He takes this thing and he throws it so hard it almost broke the window behind me .
He said , ' I 'm closing this thing down .
How could you let her do this ?'.
I said , ' I thought you knew . '
He said , ' Well , you do n't have to worry about this piece of s*** anymore .
I 'm going out and telling Warners to shut the production down . ' "
Clint went to the outer office and grabbed Sondra and they went off somewhere and had a huge explosion .
Manes went over to the floor and picked up the script .
" It had F*** - C*** SUCKER - S*** - across every page , " said Manes .
" Every page had some awful thing on it like some lunatic had scribbled all over it ! "
Production ultimately went ahead , but Locke had to abandon Anderson 's script and all the new characters and details he had created .
Sondra cites the Ratboy ( 1986 ) debacle as " the beginning of the end " of her relationship with Clint , and declared in hindsight that " obviously whatever control issues he had over my directing were fueled by the hidden birth of a son . "
( Although she did n't know it at the time , Eastwood was cheating on her and had just become the father of Scott Clinton Reeves , born more than 300 miles away to a stewardess in Monterey . ) .
Known to be passive - aggressive in private life , communicating only by gesture , inference , and what is n't said or done .
Went to the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2013 and 2015 .
After being contacted by Sondra Locke in 1994 , feminist leader Gloria Steinem said she would orchestrate a nationwide campaign to ban Clint Eastwood films .
However , there was no ban on Clint 's movies , and no explanation of why not .
Although Clint has often peddled the notion that he grew up poor , actually his family lived in a very wealthy part of town , had a swimming pool , belonged to the country club , and each drove their own car .
His mother Ruth Wood often brought her own bedsheets when she visited overnight at Clint's .
Biographer Patrick McGilligan affirms that " the people who know Clint best suspect there are other families in his closet " in addition to his verified children , editorializing " If Kimber Tunis was kept secret for twenty - five years , and the Washington woman for forty , might there not be others ? " .
To date , 24 of the 47 films Eastwood has starred in depict violence against women .
He 's made 17 films in which a female character is killed , 12 films depicting rape or attempted rape , and 11 films showing a female character physically battered . [ 2019 ]
According to the unpublished manuscript " Take Ten " by Ria Brown , Anita Lhoest at one point became pregnant with Clint 's child , but went ahead and had an abortion .
Speaking on condition of anonymity , one of the mothers of Eastwood 's children told biographer Patrick McGilligan :
" There is no guilt with Clint .
Anything that vaguely resembles guilt is channeled into anger .
His anger is always intended to prove people wrong , or prove their behavior bad .
And if people are wrong or bad , there is nothing for him to feel guilty about . " .

In general , he wraps films early and uses the actors ' first takes .
Most of his films are shot in the spring or summer and released around Christmastime .
According to Robert Daley , " If they ever called a meeting of all the people Clint has screwed over , they 'd have to hold it in the LA Coliseum . " .
One afternoon in the early 1970s , Eastwood and Paul E. Lippman were walking around San Francisco when a random woman on the street ( who happened to be of short stature , just his type ) sniffed , " Oh , you 're Clint Eastwood . . .
I hear you 're a bum lay ! "
Clint , very stunned and at a total loss for words , stretched his neck muscles mightily , as he always did when stuck for a quick response , then finally managed , " Well . . . uh . . . where did you hear that ? "
To which she pertly answered , " Oh , it 's all over town . "
After a few more neck stretches , Clint invited her for a drink at some club to discuss the matter , then spent the night at Sausalito 's Alta Mira Hotel trying to prove otherwise .
The next morning Lippman asked her if she still thought Clint Eastwood was ' a bum lay ' , and she held out a flat hand , palm down , and wiggled it .

When The Variety Club honored Clint in 1986 , hardly anyone in the audience knew him personally .
He 'd never even met some of the celebrities who gave a speech .
Yet everyone acted like good friends .
Lifeguarded for a summer at Kennydale Beach in Renton , Washington , 1953 .
" He never had to bring his lunch .
He never had to do any of the normal duties like beach clean - up , because all the girls would do it for him , " according to Penny Wade , chief of budget and personnel for King County Parks .
" There are stories , " Wade added .
One of many fictitious stories to be spoon fed to reporters - and go unchallenged for decades - is that Eastwood got into show business after being scouted by director Arthur Lubin at Fort Ord during the filming of Francis Joins the WACS ( 1954 ) .
For one thing , Eastwood had already left Fort Ord by the time Lubin filmed there in spring 1954 .
( His military stint lasted from 1951 - 53 , not 1950 - 54 like his early publicity biographies state . )
It was Clint who took the initiative ; he wanted to be an actor and had somehow managed to encounter cinematographer Irving Glassberg after moving to L.A. in late summer or early fall of 1953 .
Glassberg introduced him to Lubin at a gas station on Santa Monica Boulevard , and that 's how they met .
First wife Margaret Neville Johnson , known as Maggie , was born in 1931 and had one sibling , Gilbert F. Johnson Jr. ( 1924-2006 ) .
Her parents were Gilbert Sr. ( 1896 - 1966 ) and Edith ( 1896 - 1970 ) .
An alumni of UC Berkeley , Maggie was employed as a secretary for auto parts suppliers Industria Americana when she met Clint on a blind date in the San Francisco area in spring 1953 .
They did not date exclusively , and Clint spent the majority of that summer up in Seattle , where to impress a girl he dug he joined a small theater group .
The Seattle girlfriend , who has never been identified , became pregnant by Clint and gave birth to daughter Laurie Eastwood on February 11 , 1954 - less than 8 weeks after he married Maggie .
The first incarnation of his publicity advanced the fairy tale that Clint was " a star on the high school basketball team , " and this became an established nugget of his life story , carried down in permutations through the years in articles and books , appearing in even as authoritative and recent a source as Current Biography ( Yearbook , 1989 ) .
Is allegedly updating and revising his will constantly .
Hates being written about , even if it 's the most harmless mention .
Women he 's been photographed with throughout his career have often been misidentified in accompanying captions , because he 's always refused comment on his personal life .
Most celebrities issue a press release when they get married or divorced , break up with their significant other , or become a parent .
Eastwood never has .
Hence , many discrepancies exist .

Nowadays you'd have many battles before you blow it up , but eventually you 'd take it down .
And that 's okay , I do n't heavily quarrel with that , but for me personally , having made films for years and directed for 33 years , it just seems to me that I long for people who want to see a story and see character development .
Maybe we 've dug it out and there 's not really an audience for that , but that 's not for me to really worry about .
And I like to direct the same way that I like to be directed .
[ on directing ]
Most people like the magic of having it take a long time and be difficult . . . but I like to move along , I like to keep the actors feeling like they 're going somewhere , I like the feeling of coming home after every day and feeling like you 've done something and you 've progressed somewhere .
And to go in and do one shot after lunch and another one maybe at six o'clock and then go home is not my idea of something to do .

To me cinema can be a much more friendly world if there 's a lot of things to choose from .

[ 1985 ]
My old drama coach used to say , " Do n't just do something , stand there . "
Gary Cooper was n't afraid to do nothing .
One of the first films I went to - I went with my dad because my mother did n't want to go see a war movie - was Sergeant York ( 1941 ) .
My dad was a big admirer of Sergeant York stories from [ World War I ] .
It was directed by Howard Hawks .
That was when I first became aware of movies , who made them , who was involved .
Most people who'll remember me , if at all , will remember me as an action guy , which is OK .
There 's nothing wrong with that .
But there will be a certain group which will remember me for the other films , the ones where I took a few chances .
At least , I like to think so .
The plan was , when I first started directing in the 1970s , to get more involved in production and directing so at some point in my life , when I decided I did n't want to act anymore , I did n't have to suit up .
I feel very close to the western .
There are not too many American art forms that are original .
Most are derived from European art forms .
Other than the western and jazz or blues , that 's all that 's really original .
In Die Brücken am Fluß ( 1995 ) Kincaid 's a peculiar guy .
Really , he 's kind of a lonely individual .
He 's sort of a lost soul in mid-America .
I 've been that guy .
I think people jumped to conclusions about Dirty Harry ( 1971 ) without giving the character much thought , trying to attach right - wing connotations to the film that were never really intended .
Both the director [ Don Siegel ] and I thought it was a basic kind of drama - what do you do when you believe so much in law and order and coming to the rescue of people and you just have five hours to solve a case ?
That kind of impossible effort was fun to portray , but I think it was interpreted as a pro-police point of view , as a kind of rightist heroism , at a time in American history when police officers were looked down on as " pigs " , as very oppressive people - I 'm sure there are some who are , and a lot who are n't .
I 've met both kinds .
You have to trust your instincts .
There 's a moment when an actor has it , and he knows it .
Behind the camera you can feel the moment even more clearly .
And once you 've got it , once you feel it , you can't second - guess yourself .
You can find a million reasons why something did n't work .
But if it feels right , and it looks right , it works .
Without sounding like a pseudointellectual dipshit , it 's my responsibility to be true to myself .
If it works for me , it 's right .
None of the pictures I take a risk in cost a lot , so it does n't take much for them to turn a profit .
We do n't deal in big budgets .
We know what we want and we shoot it and we do n't waste anything .
I never understand these films that cost twenty , thirty million dollars when they could be made for half that .
Maybe it 's because no one cares .
We care .
There 's a rebel lying deep in my soul .
Anytime anybody tells me the trend is such and such , I go the opposite direction .
I hate the idea of trends .
I hate imitation ; I have a reverence for individuality .
I got where I am by coming off the wall .
I 've always considered myself too individualistic to be either right - wing or left - wing .
I do n't like the wimp syndrome .
No matter how ardent a feminist may be , if she is a heterosexual female , she wants the strength of a male companion as well as the sensitivity .
The most gentle people in the world are macho males , people who are confident in their masculinity and have a feeling of well - being in themselves .
They do n't have to kick in doors , mistreat women , or make fun of gays .
I do n't believe in pessimism .
If something does n't come up the way you want , forge ahead .
The reason I became a Republican is because [ Dwight D. Eisenhower ] was running .
A hero from World War II , a charismatic individual , a military man , a non-attorney - even then I liked that !
I was a very young person voting for the first time .
A lot of people joke that a conservative is a liberal who 's made his first $ 100,000 and then decides , " Wait a second , I want to save this , why are they taxing it away ? " .
Today the country 's in kind of a turmoil over taxing .
Being raised in the thirties , watching my parents work hard to make ends meet , with jobs scarce , and then the war years - it tends to make a person a little more fiscally conscious than if you 've been born into a wealthier family .
You know , if you go to most people who are self - made and ask them what their political philosophy is , usually they 're a little more conservative than people who had a better start .
This film cost $ 31 million .
With that kind of money I could have invaded some country .
They say marriages are made in Heaven .
But so is thunder and lightning .
I 've always supported a certain amount of gun control .
I think California has always had a mandatory waiting period , so we were never concerned about it like the rest of the country .
Some states did n't have any at all .
So I 've always supported that .
I think it 's very important that guns do n't get in the wrong hands , and , yes , I would support most of that .
I do n't know too much about trigger locks .
I 've never really discussed that with anyone .
But I do feel that guns - it 's very important to keep them out of the hands of felons or anyone who might be crazy with it .
I 've thought about retiring for years now .
When I did Sadistico - Wunschkonzert für einen Toten ( 1971 ) in 1970 , I thought that if I could pull this off maybe I could step behind the camera , and it would be time to see the end of me .
Every year I have threatened to do that - and here I am .
So it may come sooner than you think .
[ on World War II ]
I feel terrible for both sides in that war and in all wars .
A lot of innocent people get sacrificed .
It 's not about winning or losing , but mostly about the interrupted lives of young people .
I 've done a lot of violent movies , especially in the early days .
My recent efforts , like Die Brücken am Fluß ( 1995 ) , were n't too violent .
In recent years I 've done less , and , yes , I am concerned about violence in film .
In '92 , when I did Erbarmungslos ( 1992 ) , which is a film that had a very anti- violence and anti-gun play - anti-romanticizing of gun play theme , I remember that Gene Hackman was concerned about it , and we both discussed the issue of too much violence in films .
It 's escalated ninety times since Dirty Harry ( 1971 ) and those films were made .
Maybe I 'm getting to the age when I 'm starting to be senile or nostalgic or both , but people are so angry now .
You used to be able to disagree with people and still be friends .
Now you hear these talk shows , and everyone who believes differently from you is a moron and an idiot - both on the Right and the Left .
I like to play the line and not wander too far to either side .
If a guy has just had a bad day in the mines and wants to see a good shoot 'em up , that 's great .
My involvement goes deeper than acting or directing .
I love every aspect of the creation of motion pictures and I guess I 'm committed to it for life .
Whatever success I 've had is due to a lot of instinct and a little luck .
I 've always had the ability to say to the audience , watch this if you like , and if you do n't , take a hike .
I 've actually had people come up to me and ask me to autograph their guns .
[ on former President Ronald Reagan ]
Yes , I liked him very much .
When he was a former president of the Screen Actors Guild , I do n't think he had the vast support that a lot of other presidents have had .
So I do n't know why that is , it 's just the nature of things .
[ when asked if he is still registered as a Republican ]
Yes , I am .
I started - I enrolled as a Republican in 1951 when Dwight D. Eisenhower was running .
And I was in the military .
I was a fan of his .
And that 's how I got started off .
I was never - my parents were mixed , I think one Republican , one Democrat , so I did n't have any grand - pappies to influence me .
When I was doing Die Brücken am Fluß ( 1995 ) , I said to myself , " This romantic stuff is really tough .
I can't wait to get back to shooting and killing . "
[ when asked if he has disappointed his conservative fans by directing Million Dollar Baby ( 2004 ) ]
Well , I got a big laugh out of that .
These people are always bitching about " Hollyweird " , and then they start bitching about this film .
Are they all so mad because Die Passion Christi ( 2004 ) is only up for the makeup award and a couple of other minor things ?
Extremism is so easy .
You 've got your position , and that 's it .
It does n't take much thought .
And when you go far enough to the right you meet the same idiots coming around from the left .
[ on John Huston ]
It 's another aspect of the character that pleased me : he was interested in other things besides his art .
He liked women , gambling , living the high life .
He could have a life parallel to his work .
I could identify with this type of behavior .
But , because of this very fact , he became attracted more and more by other things , so that what interested him in life moved him away from his art to the point that he nearly lived a tragedy .
And the tragedy brings him back to reality .
If you study Huston 's life , you realize that at the age of nineteen he thought he did n't have long to live because of a heart defect a doctor has notified him of as a result of a misdiagnosis .
It drove him to elaborate a personal philosophy according to which he would profit from life to the maximum .
He did n't take care of himself - he was a confirmed smoker , a heavy drinker - and yet he lived to be more than eighty .
Paul Newman spoke to me about him when we were acting at the same time , each in a different movie , in Tucson , Arizona .
He was starring in Das war Roy Bean ( 1972 ) and I was doing Sinola ( 1972 ) with John Sturges .
Huston drank martinis and smoked cigars all night long , slept from one o'clock to four o'clock in the morning because he was an insomniac , did everything he should n't do to live to be old , and yet he died at a very great age !
It was the same thing with John Wayne , who was first of all the opposite of a health fanatic .
I never considered myself a cowboy , because I was n't .
But I guess when I got into cowboy gear I looked enough like one to convince people that I was .
If you want a guarantee , buy a toaster .
I always cry when I watch myself on screen .
I also wonder how I got this far in life .
Growing up , I never knew what I wanted to do .
I was not a terribly good student or a very vivacious , outgoing person .
I was just kind of a backward kid .
I grew up in various little towns and ended up in Oakland , California , going to a trade school .
I did n't want to be an actor , because I thought an actor had to be an extrovert - somebody who loved to tell jokes and talk and be a raconteur .
And I was something of an introvert .
My mother used to say : " You have a little angel on your shoulder . "
I guess she was surprised I grew up at all , never mind that I got to where I am .
The best I can do is quote a line from Erbarmungslos ( 1992 ) : " Deserve 's got nothing to do with it . "
Every movie I make teaches me something , and that 's why I keep making them .
I 'm at that stage of life when I could probably stop and just hit golf balls .
But in filming these two movies about Iwo Jima , I learnt about war and about character .
I also learnt a lot about myself .
I was a teenager when the battle of Iwo Jima took place .
I remember hearing about the bond drive and the need to maintain the war effort .
Back then , people had just come through 10 years of a Depression , and they were used to working for everything .
I still have an image of someone coming to our house when I was about six years old , offering to cut and stack the wood in our back yard if my mother would make him a sandwich .
The Americans who went to Iwo Jima knew it would be a tough fight , but they always believed they 'd win .
The Japanese were told they would n't come home - they were being sent to die for the Emperor .
People have made a lot out of that very different cultural approach .
But as I got into the storytelling for the two movies [ Flags of Our Fathers ( 2006 ) and Letters from Iwo Jima ( 2006 ) ] , I realised that the 19 - year - olds from both sides had the same fears .
They all wrote poignant letters home saying : " I do n't want to die . "
They were all going through the same thing , despite the cultural differences .
As for me , I like being behind the camera instead of in front of it .
I can wear what I want .
Will I act again ?
I never say never .
I like doing things where I can stretch and go in different directions .
I 'm not looking to take it easy .
Like the Marines on Iwo Jima , I understand that if you really want something , you have to be ready to fight .
Life is a constant class , and once you think you know it all , you 're due to decay .
You 're due to slide .
I have to keep challenging myself and try something I have n't done before .
The studios are n't always happy with that .
When I wanted to make Mystic River ( 2003 ) , the studio said , " Uh - oh , it 's so dark . "
And I said , " Well , it 's important .
And it 's a nice story . "
Then the next movie , Million Dollar Baby ( 2004 ) , they said , " Who wants to see a picture about a girl boxing ? "
And I said , " It 's really a father - daughter love story .
Boxing just happens to be what 's going on . "
They did n't have much faith .
So there are always obstacles and people afraid to take risks .
That 's why you end up with remakes of old TV shows as movies .
But playing it safe is what 's risky , because nothing new comes out of it .
[ on the Iraq war ]
My druthers would have been , " Get a more benevolent dictator and stick him in .
You know , try somebody a little less mean . "
You do n't go in there and fire the army .
The army 's got to do something .
When you fire 'em , you leave them all unemployed .
Worst thing in the world .
Just get somebody else who they respect and bring him on your side .
That 's one way of doing it .
[ on President George W. Bush ]
You 've got to admire somebody who stands up for what they believe regardless of how the polls go .
A lot of presidents do everything by the polls .
They do a focus group then all of a sudden they say , " OK , that 's what I 'm going to be for because that 's where focus group is leading me .
[ on the Iraq war ] I was n't for going in there .
Only because democracy is n't something that you get overnight .
I do n't think America got democracy overnight .
It 's something we had to fight for and believe in .
[ on Sergio Leone ] I spun off Sergio and he spun off me .
I think we worked well together .
I like his compositions .
He has a very good eye .
I liked him , I liked his sense of humor , but I feel it was mutual .
He liked dealing with the kind of character I was putting together .
" Macho " was a fashionable word in the 1980s .
Everybody was kind of into it , what 's macho and what is n't macho .
I really do n't know what macho is .
I never have understood .
Does it mean somebody who swaggers around exuding testosterone ?
And kicks the gate open and runs sprints up and down the street ?
Or does handsprings or whatever ?
Or is macho a quiet thing based on your security .
I remember shaking hands with Rocky Marciano .
He was gentle , he did n't squeeze your hand .
And he had a high voice .
But he could knock people around , it was a given .
That 's macho .
Muhammad
Ali is the same .
If you talked with him in his younger years , he spoke gently .
He was n't kicking over chairs .
I think some of the most macho people are the gentlest .
I was tired of playing the nice , clean - cut cowboy in Tausend Meilen Staub ( 1959 ) , I wanted something earthier .
Something different from the old - fashioned Western .
You know :
Hero rides in , very stalwart , with white hat , man 's beating a horse , hero jumps off , punches man , schoolmarm walks down the street , sees this situation going on , slight conflict with schoolmarm , but not too much .
You know schoolmarm and hero will be together in exactly 10 more reels , if you care to sit around and wait , and you know the man beast horse with eventually get comeuppance from hero this guy bushwhacks him in reel nine .
But [ Für eine Handvoll Dollar ( 1964 ) ] was different ; it definitely had satiric overtones .
The hero was an enigmatic figure , and that worked within the context of this picture .
In some films , he would be ludicrous .
You can't have a cartoon in the middle of a Renoir .
In those days , they 'd make interview tests , not acting tests .
They 'd sit you in front of the camera and talk -- just as we 're talking now .
I thought I was an absolute clod .
It looked pretty good ; it was photographed well , but I thought , " If that 's acting , I 'm in trouble " .
But they signed me up as a contract player -- which was a little lower than working in the mailroom .
I like working with actors who do n't have anything to prove .
[ on Ambush at Cimarron Pass ( 1958 ) ]
Probably the lousiest western ever made .
[ on the retirement of friend and fellow actor Gene Hackman ] :
It is a sad thing .
I know his agent and I saw him recently , and he said , ' Ca n't you talk Gene into coming back ? '
I said , ' I 'd love to see him come back , but I think it 's not very nice to ride him . '
He 's too good an actor not to be performing but , by the same token , he probably thinks that 's enough .
[ on Gran Torino ( 2008 ) ]
That will probably do it for me as far as acting is concerned .
You always want to quit while you are ahead .
You do n't want to be like a fighter who stays too long in the ring until you 're not performing at your best .
There are certain things you have to be realistic about .
Dirty Harry would not be on a police department at my age so we 'll move on from that .
[ on Westwärts zieht der Wind ( 1969 ) ]
It was n't like Du sollst mein Glücksstern sein ( 1952 ) , where it had a cohesive plot line .
They started out with a real dramatic story and then made it fluffy .
When they changed it around , I tried to bail out .
It was n't my favorite .
I was n't particularly nervous about singing on film .
My dad was a singer and we'd have sing - arounds .
But certainly [ Frank Sinatra ] was n't worried .
With Der Mann aus San Fernando ( 1978 ) , they gave me the script and I thought , " This is something .
This is kinda crazy .
But there 's something kind of hip about it .
This guy 's out drifting along and his best friend is an orangutan " .
I mean , the scenes of talking to an orangutan about your troubles , I 'd never seen anything quite like it .
He has a romance that falls through , he does n't get the girl , and then he goes off with the orangutan .
I thought ,
What could be better ?
I would n't put it in the time capsule of films you did that you thought were great , but everything 's a challenge .
Gene Hackman was interesting because I gave the Erbarmungslos ( 1992 ) script to his agent and he said no , he did n't want to do anything violent .
But I went back to him and said , " I know where you 're coming from .
You get to a certain age and I 'm there too , where you do n't want to tell a lot of violent stories , but this is a chance to make a great statement " .
At this particular time in my life , I 'm not doing anything as a moneymaker .
It 's like I 'm pushing the envelope the other way to see how far we can go to be noncommercial .
But I 'm definitely not going for the demographics of 13 - to 15 - year - olds .
I did n't know if Mystic River ( 2003 ) would go over at all .
I had a hard time getting it financed , to tell you the truth .
But I just told Warners the same thing I did with Million Dollar Baby ( 2004 ) : " I do n't know if this is going to make any money .
But , I think I can make a picture that you'd be proud to have in your library .
People have lost their sense of humor .
In former times we constantly made jokes about different races .
You can only tell them today with one hand over your mouth or you will be insulted as a racist .
I find that ridiculous .
In those earlier days every friendly clique had a ' Sam the Jew ' or ' Jose the Mexican ' - but we did n't think anything of it or have a racist thought .
It was just normal that we made jokes based on our nationality or ethnicity .
That was never a problem .
I do n't want to be politically correct .
We 're all spending too much time and energy trying to be politically correct about everything .
[ on the possibility of a Dirty Harry ( 1971 ) sequel ]
I 'm 78 years old , and you 're pretty well drummed out of the police force by that age .
There could be a scenario .
I suppose if some mythical writer came out of nowhere and it was the greatest thing on the planet , I 'd certainly have to think about it .
But it 's not like I 've ever courted it .
I feel like that was an era of my life , and I 've gone on to other things .
I 'm not sure about being Dirty Harry again -- but who knows ?
I keep finding interesting stories , or they come to me , so I 'll keep making movies .
[ on a possible return to acting after saying he was giving it up with Gran Torino ( 2008 ) ]
I 'm like Der weiße Hai 2 ( 1978 ) : " Just when you think it 's safe to go back in the water ... "
[ on Angelina Jolie ]
She 's wonderful .
To me , she 's like a throwback to the women in film of the Forties .
Not to say women today are n't great , but back then there was more individuality .
They did n't have the same Botox look .
Angelina has that great individuality , her own look and her own style .
I think she would have been just as big a name in that era , the same as Katharine Hepburn Bette Davis and Ingrid Bergman
[ on Million Dollar Baby ( 2004 ) ]
It 's a tragedy that could have been written by the Greeks or Shakespeare .
I do n't quite understand this obsession about doing remakes and making television series into feature films .
I would rather see them encourage writers with new ideas in all different genres like they used to in the heyday of movies .
[ on death ] I do n't think older people think about it that much , my mother was 97 .
She passed away a few years back .
The only thing she ever said to me , toward the last , she said , ' I want out of here , I am tired . '
And I said ' No , no , three more years .
We get the century mark . '
I figured I could coax her into more after that , but when she finally did pass away , she could n't talk because she had had a stroke .
They said do you want to be resuscitated for while , and she said ' no . '
So , I had to grant her that wish .
She had no fear and I think as you get older -- you probably have more fear as a younger person than you do as an older person .
Because as an older person you have stacked up a lot of background and time - in - grade , so to speak , so you are probably thinking what the hell ' I have had a good time .
If you believe in reincarnation you 're putting too much on the other side .
I believe you have just one shot at life , and you should do the best you can with that shot .
And I suppose you should be thankful that you 've been given the ability to do certain things in life , and not be greedy enough to want to stay around forever .
[ on the Rocky ( 1976 ) movies ] I loved the first one .
I always admired Sylvester Stallone 's tenacity to go ahead and get that made .
[ on directing Leonardo DiCaprio as J. Edgar Hoover ]
He could make a lot of money making mechanical genre pictures but he wants to be challenged .
And it 's much more of a challenge to play someone who does n't have the slightest thing in common with you .
[ on Bruce Surtees ]
He was fearless .
He was n't afraid to give you sketchy lighting if you asked for it .
He did n't believe in flat light or just bright , ' Rexall drugstore ' lighting , which a lot of times you can get if you get somebody that is n't very imaginative .
He was perfect for me , because we did n't have very big budgets in those days .
He 'd made dollies by towing a blanket across the floor with the cameraman sitting on it .
I do n't believe in pessimism .
If something does n't come out the way you want , forge ahead .
If you think it 's going to rain , it will .
[ on surviving a plane crash in the early 1950s ]
They had one plane , a Douglas AD , sort of a torpedo bomber of the World War II vintage , and I thought I 'd hitch on that .
Everything went wrong .
Radios went out .
Oxygen ran out .
And finally we ran out of fuel up around Point Reyes , California , and went in the ocean .
So we went swimming .
It was late October , November .
Very cold water .
I found out many years later that it was a white shark breeding ground , but I 'm glad I did n't know that at the time or I 'd have just died .
[ on his planned remake of Ein Stern geht auf ( 1937 ) ]
I talked about that for a while with Warner Brothers ' people and we 're still playing with that idea .
But the problem at the beginning was they were more infatuated with just the idea of the casting .
They were talking about having Beyoncé in it , and she was very popular , but she also is very active and it's hard to get a time scheduled , so we never could get that worked out .
But I 'm still playing with the idea .
I 've done war movies because they 're always loaded with drama and conflict .
But as far as actual participation ... it 's one of those things that should be done with a lot of thought , if it needs to be done .
Self - protection is a very important thing for nations , but I just do n't like to see it .
Extremism is so easy .
You 've got your position and that 's it .
It does n't take much thought .
And when you go far enough to the right , you meet the same idiots coming around from the left .
The stronger the participation of the female characters , the better the movie .
They knew that in the old days , when women stars were equally as important as men .
I like the image of the piano player : the piano player sits down , plays , tells his story , and then gets up and leaves - letting the music speak for itself .
[ after the Carmel city council refused his architectural plans for a downtown construction ]
They do n't know who they 're fuckin ' with .
I 'll build that damn building the way I want it if I have to run the fucking city council to do it .
My father used to say to me , ' Show 'em what you can do , and do n't worry about what you 're gonna get .
Say you 'll work for free and make yourself invaluable ' .
[ asked by Steve Kroft on 60 Minutes ( 1968 ) how many children he has , 11/16/97 ]
I have a few .
[ press statement issued 4/27/89 in response to claims made by ex-significant other Sondra Locke ]
I adamantly deny and deeply resent the accusation that either one of those abortions or the tubal ligation were done at my demand , request or even suggestion .
As to the abortions , I told Locke that whether to have children or terminate her pregnancies was a decision entirely hers .
Particularly with regard to the tubal ligation , I encouraged Locke to make her own decision after she had consulted with a physician about the appropriateness of and the necessity for that surgical procedure .
[re Patrick McGilligan 's 2002 unauthorized biography of him ]
I do n't know if this is the same book that came out in England , but if it is , it 's just very factually inaccurate .
He has me involved with women I 've never met and attending schools I 've never gone to - and there was a photograph supposedly of me that was n't me .
The stories about my father were n't true ( sic ) .
There were incidents described that never took place ; I 've never broken a window with a ball peen hammer in my life .
If you can't even get the little stuff right , then how are you going to get the big stuff right ?
But I do n't want to talk about it too much , because I hate even giving it credence .
It 's a very mean - spirited book .
I do n't care if you write something bad about me , as long as it's true .
I 'm not Mr. Evangelical Pure - as - the - snow .
I just want the true [ stories ] out .
They 're fair game .
But when they 're made up , they 're not fair game .
[ on misrepresentation of his early work ]
My parts ranged from one - liners to four - liners , but to look at some of the billings in TV Guide these days , you 'd think I co-starred in those films .
[ on director Arthur Lubin ]
We spent a lot of time together , traveled together .
He liked me a lot ; got me into the talent program at Universal , gave me a lot of breaks .
Bought me some nice clothes , too .
That 's when people started wondering about us !
I tried being reasonable , I did n't like it .
[ to Sondra Locke , 1975 ]
I 've never known anyone that I wanted to be around me all the time .
I guess I 'm usually trying to get away .
[ in bed with Sondra Locke on Thanksgiving night 1975 ]
I never knew I could love somebody so much , and feel so peaceful about it at the same time .
Crimes against children are the most heinous crime .
That , for me , would be a reason for capital punishment because children are innocent and need the guidance of an adult society .
[ 1/14/09 , his reply to David Letterman 's question " You have uh - - is it seven children ? " ]
Uh , at least .
I was always respectful of people who were deeply religious because I always felt that if they gave themselves to it , then it had to be important to them .
But if you can go through life without it , that 's OK , too .
It 's whatever suits you .
[ on home pornography ]
The ultimate turn -on .
My grandfather lived to be late 90s on one side and on the other side , 70s or something .
And my father died young , at 63 .
But he did n't take very good care of himself .
I grew up with J. Edgar Hoover .
He was the G- man , a hero to everybody , and the Federal Bureau of Investigation was the big , feared organization .
He was ahead of his time as far as building up forensic evidence and fingerprinting .
But he took down a lot of innocent people , too .
It 's much more fun to play something you 're nothing like than what you are ...
It 's much easier to hide yourself in a character .
[ characterizing his relationship with Roxanne Tunis ]
It did n't mean anything ; it was just an affair .
I was young and . . . anyway she was a stand - in and extra on the show , and she was really crazy about me , and always hanging out in my dressing room .
Plagiarism is always the biggest thing in Hollywood .
I always thought of myself as a character actor .
I never thought of myself as a leading man .
I love stories about women .
When I was a kid , I thought movies just came from air .
I thought they just appeared .
Why am I a star ?
It ca n't be because of looks .
I kind of make a film for myself to sort of express myself .
[ 2007 , on troubled actress June Fairchild , his Die Letzten beißen die Hunde ( 1974 ) co-star who wound up homeless ]
My heart sank when I heard of what had become of June .
There are organizations that can help her but I 'm sure she could also use a friendly face right now .
I 'd really like to meet her .
I 've been through my womanizer part of my life .
There was a point when it was an illness , just compulsive , but that 's behind me now .
I 've never considered myself addicted to anything , but if I was , that was it .
Everybody has certain things they wish they had n't done in life .
They wish they had n't kicked their dog when they were ten or something .
I like Italian movies .
I was frequently there in the '60s , in Rome and the vicinity .
It was a great period in life .
I was very influenced by their stuff .
[ January 1962 ]
There has to be something for me beyond western roles , which rarely give you a full feeling of acting accomplishment .
Have you ever heard of a western star being called an actor 's actor ?
I 'll bet not !
[ April 2010 ] I planned on not working at this time in my life , but I am enjoying working more now than I ever have .
I have been lucky enough to work in a profession I really like and I figure I will continue until somebody hits me over the head .
In the past I have been with women who wanted more from me than I was ever willing to give .
I was probably not as attentive as I could have been .
I can be selfish and some of the women did n't have a good idea of their self .
They wanted me to mould them and I just can't do that .
I 'm not good in big crowds .
I prefer smaller , one - to - one nights out , which is why I 've never been single .
I like the company of women , but I do go for longer - term relationships than flings .
The best things to come of all those relationships are my children .
[ 2002 ]
I 've waited all my life for a woman like Dina .
She is bright , funny , independent .
It 's fate that I met her when I was in my sixties .
I 'd love to have been with her 20 , 30 years ago and I would have settled down much sooner .
I spent my twenties and thirties being angry , then my forties and fifties being disappointed .
It 's only in the last part of my life that I 've learned to be happy .
[ if he could give advice to his younger self ]
He was never a smart kid .
I was a slow learner , so I 'd say speed up the process a bit - and maybe practice a little more !
[ December 2014 ]
I just went through a period where my DNA was in demand for a while .
I think that 's all ended - but , you never know !
[ on marriage ] I have n't exactly been successful at it , but I made a couple of attempts .
I 've had moments of success interrupted by moments of satyr .
Shelley Berman used to say that .
I admire people who can accomplish and do it , but it 's very difficult in today 's society , because there are so many things pulling at people .
People gain different interests as time goes by , so they decide that they want to try something else .
You have to keep trying !
You do n't want to give up and be so cynical that , you say , ' Never ! '
But , maybe , at my stage in life , there 's a silver act .
Never say never .
Sergio Leone loved long stories and long pictures .
To me , I do n't mind a long picture if you 've got a lot of story .
But if you 're just making a long movie to just show off more production value , I think you can edit some of that stuff down .
That 's where he and I would

Video files take much longer to upload than music files
In the last few years users have started to share that content with each other across the net , whether legal or not .
This is something that has plagued the music industry for several years .
And now , mainly thanks to a system called BitTorrent , the movie industry could face the same struggle .
But BitTorrent could also be the solution .
Hollywood is definitely interested in distributing its movies over the net .
King Kong is the first major film in the UK to be released as a download at the same time as on DVD .
Users on the web will visit a download site and pull the data onto their computers .
Many users can be served at once but , if demand is huge , users will effectively have to queue up and wait their turn .
But there is another way to get hold of content and it has caused a nightmare for the music industry of late , with users sharing content amongst themselves , their peers .
Using a peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file - sharing program and a decent internet connection , a user can make all his files available to anyone else who is using the same program .
If you wanted to get hold of a particular song , your file - sharing program would hunt for that file on other people 's hard drives .
When it finds it , it downloads a copy to your own computer .
The more users who download the file , the more places there are for other users to get it .
This reduces the likelihood of bottlenecks , and is a very efficient way of distributing files across the net .
Of course , it is illegal to share copyrighted material like that .
But this has not stopped people doing it .
Larger files
More recent developments include being able to download different parts of the same file from different users .
But video files are much larger than music files and have slower upload times .
This is where BitTorrent comes in .
It is an incredibly efficient way of distributing large files , like video , across the net , even when there is a high demand , and even when only one person has the complete file .
The key is that a user 's computer does not need to wait until it has downloaded the entire file .
As soon as it has downloaded a chunk , it starts uploading it to any other users who do not yet have that chunk .
Similarly , your computer finds other users who have chunks that you are missing , and downloads many at once .
The group of machines sharing a file is called a swarm , for obvious reasons .
And the torrent of data flowing between them is called a torrent .
The more people in the swarm , the faster the file spreads .
Using BitTorrent is not particularly difficult .
There are many different BitTorrent programs freely available for download .
These manage the uploading and downloading for you , maximising your internet connection , which can end up shifting gigabytes in a session .
Once finished downloading , it is considered good manners to stay online , allowing the program to continue sharing the file with other users .
Broadband ' hogs '
BitTorrent 's efficient use of broadband connections has hugely increased the amount of traffic going across the net , because it runs all users ' net connections flat out to deliver huge files .
Recent estimates say that around a third of all internet traffic is based around BitTorrent .
Some internet service providers think this is unacceptable .
Recently BT began clamping down on so - called " broadband hogs " , by starting to enforce a 40 GB monthly limit .
Certainly you could kind of see P2P as one of the killer applications for broadband
Jonathan Arber , Ovum
So - called traffic - shaping is part of an ongoing battle between ISPs and BitTorrent programmers .
As network providers look for smarter ways to identify torrent traffic , and reduce its impact on their network , more and more help sites are springing up showing users how to encrypt their data to avoid it being tracked and controlled .
Bulldog is one ISP which does not feel the need to traffic shape its data flow .
The company 's Gavin Young says this is because there are different types of ISPs .
He told Click : " Some ISPs are what we call infrastructure - based , and that means they build their own networks .
" But other ISPs , maybe just for example a brand , are paying money for the fibre , connectivity in that network , and maybe they can't even afford to buy a whole fibre and they 're just leasing per megabit units of bandwidth .
You 're going to be more inclined to try to shape your traffic to keep your cost base down . "
Jonathan Arber , a technology expert from Ovum , who specialises in file - sharing , believes ISPs are right to be worried about the amount of traffic that something like BitTorrent creates .
He said : " Certainly , you could see P2P as one of the killer applications for broadband .
What that means is that , if users find that their broadband service is actually limiting the application that they most want to use , they 'll simply go somewhere else . "
New approach
According to Bulldog 's Gavin Young , a recent online survey which asked people how ISPs should react to P2P traffic found most respondents wanted to slow it down .
In other words to traffic - shape .
He added : " Basically this is a kind of a robotic application to a lot of people .
" They do n't necessarily interact that much , they might kick off a download , and go to work or whatever , and so it 's not like you 're surfing the web , or expecting a response or an instant message .
" If something takes three hours instead of two hours , fine .
I suspect as people are doing more with video , as opposed to music and songs , that kind of kick - it - off - and - walk - away approach is going to be more common . "
But instead of traffic - shaping and limiting what could be the killer application for broadband , could not an ISPs just buy more bandwidth ?
After all , it is their business to provide this data flow .
Mr Young explained : " Unfortunately , if you buy more bandwidth , somebody has to cover the cost of that .
" What we 're seeing is ISPs introducing tiered services , so for example , given the opportunity for light users to maybe have a metered package , who pay per unit at a time or per amount of data you download .
So you can control your own costs as a user , and unlimited packages will inevitably cost a bit more .
There are many programs that use the BitTorrent protocol , but it is still not a completely user - friendly experience .
Ovum 's Jonathan Arber said : " The various applications , while they are getting more user - friendly , still require a degree of technical knowledge in order to really get BitTorrent working the way it should .
" If you want to kind of get the kind of download speeds that people talk about , you 're going to have to know a little bit about configuring the application , a little bit about configuring your own network as well . "
