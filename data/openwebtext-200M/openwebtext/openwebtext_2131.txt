CAPTCHA - based security systems have been having a rough time of late .
CAPTCHA 's were initially deployed as a security technique meant to prevent computer - controlled bots from creating e-mail or forum accounts .
Bot authors and security researchers have played a game of oneupmanship for years , with each side trying to outfox the other , but the recent , well - publicized failures of the Windows Live Mail / Hotmail and GMail CAPTCHA systems have had some wondering if CAPTCHAs are finally outdated .
One group of researchers does n't think so , however , and has developed a new CAPTCHA - style system , dubbed IMAGINATION , that it believes will inject new life into current CAPTCHA design .
IMAGINATION uses a two - part authentication scheme to assess a user 's humanity .
The first authentication step requires the user to find and click on the geometric center of an image .
The image , however , is actually a composite of multiple photos that have been selected from a database .
If you 're curious about what a composite photo might look like , you can check Alipr 's example , available here .
Any of the pictures are fair game , and both photos and placement are randomized .
Once the end - user correctly identifies the geometric center of the image in question , he 's presented with a second photo , and asked to pick an appropriate caption for it from a list of choices .
Again , both photo and captions would be randomized , though at least one caption option would always be the correct answer .
This type of authentication - by - word - choice would require a certain degree of oversight on the part of the security administrator .
An ambiguous picture of a canine , for example , should not offer a choice between " wolf " and " dog " in its list of appropriate captions .
Step one of the IMAGINATION CAPTCHA : click in the center of one of the composited images
Thus far , Alipr 's design appears both solid and user friendly .
The latter is particularly important , given that many modern - day CAPTCHA 's have become so complex and visually warped in their attempts to foil computer - based registrants that they often end up frustrating the human populations that ( supposedly ) can read them easily .

Air pollution is killing the smell of flowers , possibly eliminating the " scent trail " that helps guide those terribly important pollinators , like bees , to the plants that depend upon them for survival , scientists believe .
The discovery could be one of several factors in the " colony collapse disorder " that is wiping out honey bees around the world .
While it is still too soon to determine the full impact of air pollution on the symbiotic relationship between insects and the flowers they pollinate , researchers at the University of Virginia are confident they have shown that pollutants are killing the scent trail , and that could turn out to be extremely significant .
Before the industrial revolution , the trail extended at least half a mile from the flower , but today at that distance " it 's almost completely destroyed , " said Quinn McFrederick , a doctoral candidate in biology at the university and lead author of a study that in the current issue of the journal Atmospheric Environment .
Scientists have known for some time that airborne chemicals like ozone , hydroxyl and nitrate radicals -- major components of smog -- alter the chemicals produced by flowers that give them a specific smell .
But it had not been known how that affected the trail that helps lead insects to the flowers .
Scents that could travel for more than half a mile in the 1800s now probably travel less than about 600 feet , according to Jose D. Fuentes , professor of environmental sciences at the university and a co-author of the study .
" This makes it increasingly difficult for pollinators to locate the flowers , " Fuentes said .
In a telephone interview , McFrederick said that the scent trail deteriorates even very close to the flowers , and that could discourage insects , especially bees and moths , from even sampling the flower to see if it contains the nectar they need for survival .
And if they pass up the flower , it will not receive the pollination it needs .
So both the pollinator and the pollinated suffer .
At this point the research consists of a mathematical model into which the researchers inserted the known impact of various pollutants on the molecules carrying the scent .
They then extrapolated out to various distances to see how much of an impact that would have .
But the findings have n't been tested in " the real world , " McFrederick said .
He and his colleagues hope to do that soon .
The findings are intriguing , but no one knows just yet how significant they really are .
" We do n't know an awful lot about how insects actually use these scent trails , " he said .
It 's unknown how much of a scent is required for the insect to detect it , and no one knows yet if new chemicals produced by the reaction between scent molecules and air pollution can also be detected by insects .
But what is known is that scent is important in the overall pollination process .
Bees and many other insects depend primarily on vision to find flowers .
But the researchers believe that scent , detected at a considerable distance from the flowers , may tell the insects the general direction of the flowers .
So insects travel in that direction until they actually see the flowers , and then depend on scent somewhat to decide which flowers to visit .
Some other insects , like nocturnal moths , must depend very heavily upon scent , McFrederick said .
And if that 's the case , " plants that do n't depend on animal pollinators would do better than plants that do depend on animal pollinators , " he added .
" Plants that can be pollinated by the wind , or plants that can pollinate themselves , might be expected to do better and their populations to be proportionally larger in areas where there is lots of pollution . "
Two years ago an international team reported that a 25 - year study had found just that in the Netherlands and parts of Great Britain .
When the bee population declined , so did the plants that the bees pollinate .
" In Britain , pollinator species that were relatively rare in the past have tended to become rarer still , while the commoner species have become even more plentiful , " Stuart Roberts of the University of Reading said at the time .
" Even in insects , the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "
That trend has not been documented yet in the United States , but there is no debate about the decline in pollinators .
In the last 50 years the bee population that farmers depend upon for pollination has declined by 50 percent , according to one study .
The decline in bees has been blamed chiefly on diseases spread by mites and viruses , as well as pollution and pesticides .
Now , scientists may be able to add another element to the equation .
The sweet aroma coming from flowers is n't as strong as it once was , and that 's probably happening all over the globe .

As revelations of the Bush administration�s illegal surveillance programs continue to expose the criminal nature of the regime in Washington , new reports suggest that House Democrats are preparing to capitulate to the White House on warrantless wiretapping and amnesty for lawbreaking telecoms .
When the Orwellian " Protect America Act " expired in February , Republicans and right - wing Democrats argued that unless the state�s covert alliance with giant telecommunications companies were not shielded from congressional oversight or public scrutiny , " Americans would die . "
Director of National Intelligence ( DNI )
Mike McConnell made this threat explicit last August when he told the El Paso Times : Now part of this is a classified world .
The fact we�re doing it this way means that some Americans are going to die , because we do this mission unknown to the bad guys because they �re using a process that we can exploit and the more we talk about it , the more they will go with an alternative means and when they go to an alternative means , remember what I said �
( Chris Roberts , " Transcript : Debate on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , " El Paso Times , August 22 , 2007 ) But as Steven Aftergood , the director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists told The New York Times , " If we�re to believe that Americans will die from discussing these things , then he is complicit in that .
It �s an unseemly argument .
He�s basically saying that democracy is going to kill Americans . "
But with " Blue Dog " Democrats on - board with the Bush administration , its more a case of Americans killing ( their own ) democracy .
As Salon�s Glenn Greenwald reports , Numerous reports � both public and otherwise � suggest that [ Steny ]
Hoyer is negotiating with Jay Rockefeller to write a new FISA bill that would be agreeable to the White House and the Senate .
Their strategy is to craft a bill that they can pretend is something short of amnesty for telecoms but which , in every meaningful respect , ensures an end to the telecom lawsuits .
It goes without saying that no " compromise " will be acceptable to Rockefeller or the White House unless there is a guaranteed end to those lawsuits , i.e. , unless the bill grants amnesty to lawbreaking telecoms .
( Glenn Greenwald , " What backroom conniving Are Steny Hoyer and the Chris Carney Blue Dogs up to on FISA ? , " Salon , May 2 , 2008 ) According to Alexander Bolton�s article in The Hill , right - wing and freshman congressional Democrats " are growing skittish , " and that House Speaker Nancy " impeachment is off the table " Pelosi ( D - CA ) , " has stepped back from the FISA talks and let Hoyer spearhead House talks with the Senate and executive branch . "
Translation : give the White House what it wants .
And what the White House wants is the ability �and legal cover �to spy at will .
As AT&T whistleblower Mark Klein revealed in 2006 , NSA gained access to " massive amounts " of internet data after the company allowed the spy agency to hook into its network in San Francisco and other cities .
The retired technician described how the NSA created a system that vacuumed up internet and phone - call data with AT&T executives as the agency�s willing accomplices .
Despite administration claims that its so - called " Terrorist Surveillance Program " is aimed solely at overseas terrorists , Klein demonstrated that a vast proportion of the data swept up by AT&T and forwarded to NSA was purely domestic .
Klein told The Washington Post , [ T ]he NSA built a special room to receive data streamed through an AT&T Internet room containing " peering links , " or major connections to other telecom providers .
The largest of the links delivered 2.5 gigabits of data � the equivalent of one - quarter of the Encyclopedia Britannica�s text � per second , said Klein , whose documents and eyewitness account form the basis of one of the first lawsuits filed against the telecom giants after the government�s warrantless - surveillance program was reported in the New York Times in December 2005 .
( Ellen Nakashima , " A Story of Surveillance : Former Technician ' Turning In� AT&T Over NSA Program , " The Washington Post , November 7 , 2007 , Page D01 ) Klein�s story of flagrant lawlessness by the Bush regime and the telecoms was seconded by Babak Pasdar , a security consultant and CEO of Bat Blue Corporation , who provided a signed affidavit to the Government Accountability Project describing the FBI�s " Quantico circuit . "
Last month The Washington Post reported that FBI investigators " with the click of a mouse " have the ability to " instantly " transfer data along a computer circuit " to an FBI technology office in Quantico . "
Verizon is the company named by the Post in its report as having provided " unfettered access " to its data stream , a charge denied by the company .
Despite these revelations , the Bush administration continues to illegally target the American people .
As Ryan Singel reported last week , 2007 might have been a rough year for U.S. home prices , but growth in government wiretaps remained healthy , with the eavesdropping sector posting a 14 % increase in court orders compared to 2006 .
In 2007 , judges approved 4,578 state and federal wiretaps , as compared to 4,015 in 2006 , according to two new reports on criminal and intelligence wiretaps� .
It �s unclear how many people these orders applied to since they can name more than one target , and in January 2007 , the Bush Administration began getting so - called basket warrants from the secret court , in order to reduce the political heat over its warrantless wiretapping program .
Those orders , which the administration described as " innovative , " likely covered many individuals or entire geographic regions and required periodic re-authorization from the court .
Sometime in spring 2007 , one judge on the court ruled that the orders were unconstitutional , prompting a summer fear - mongering campaign to get Congress to expand the government�s warrantless wiretapping powers .
( Ryan Singel , " Court - Approved Wiretapping Rose 14 % in ' 07 , " Wired , May 1 , 2008 )
We don�t know , and the administration won�t say , how many Americans have been swept up by so - called " basket warrants . "
None of this however , trouble congressional Democrats .
As the administration continues to eviscerate the Constitution , it should be clear that like the Republicans , the Democratic party completely accepts the overall framework of Bushist " national security " and the specious argument that it is waging a global " war on terrorism . "
Since taking control of both house of Congress in 2006 , the Democrats � like their Republican " adversaries " � have refused to hold hearings on domestic spying nor have they sought to expose the scope of the illegal NSA program .
Lost in the shuffle , are the obvious � and growing � dangers posed by these intrusive programs .
In a time of systemic crisis for the capitalist system as a whole , the massive intelligence being gathered by the Bush regime , and by future administrations �
Democratic or Republican , take your pick � will be deployed as tools for wholesale repression under conditions of growing class polarization , economic crisis and mass opposition to war .
Telecom immunity ?

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - NBC Universal , a unit of General Electric
Co , plans to say next week that the entry price for a 2009 Super Bowl 30 - second ad will be $ 3 million , the Wall Street Journal said on Tuesday .
The $ 3 million mark has never been the starting price for a commercial at the Super Bowl , though individual slots have sold for that much before , the report said .
Prices to buy a 30 - second spot for the 2008 Super Bowl averaged $ 2.7 million , it was reported earlier .
NBC Universal representatives could not be reached immediately for comment .
The role of Islam in Turkish society is a subject of continual debate .
Secularists are protesting against what they see as the government 's increasingly Islamic agenda , and as Sarah Rainsford found out , the latest battleground could be across the butcher 's counter .
Current legislation is threatening Turkey 's pork butchers " We 're going filming at a pork butcher 's and a pig farm , " I told my Turkish cameraman in a text message .
Slightly anxious , I added : " Is that OK with you ? "
A moment later a message from Gokhan flashed back .
" Yes , " he wrote .
" I like a good pork steak ! "
He is not the only one .
Another Turkish friend told me that eating pork , which is forbidden by Islam , is increasingly popular in secular high society here .
She described this as an act of defiance by some Turks who fear religious dictates have begun creeping into their lives since a government led by devout Muslims took power .
But those people could soon be looking for a new way to rebel because Turkey 's pork industry is on the brink of extinction .
Shrinking business Lazari Kozmaoglu describes himself as the last pork butcher in Istanbul .
Lazari Kozmaoglu has worked as a butcher for 40 years
We met at his unmarked shop , in the shadow of a towering , Orthodox church .
Outside , hungry - looking cats sat pawing the window .
As Lazari showed me round , he reminisced about the cosmopolitan Istanbul of his youth - filled with ethnic Armenians and local Greeks like himself .
The days when the pork business was booming .
Many of those Christians have long since left or been forced out .
But Lazari stayed on .
Curiously , all the other slaughter houses that once dealt with pork have been closed too
For more than 40 years he has been selling pork to his own fast - shrinking Christian community , to defiant Muslims , and to foreigners .
Now , he is being squeezed out of business .
Lazari's being prevented from slaughtering pigs and the stock of meat in his freezer is running critically low .
He owns an abattoir but the Agriculture Ministry has refused him a licence to operate it , saying it does not meet strict new regulations .
Curiously , all the other slaughter houses that once dealt with pork have been closed too .
Lazari 's reluctant to say what he suspects is happening .
" There are only 2,000 Greeks left in Istanbul , " he grumbled .
" None of us dares speak out . "
So a rare customer filled in the gaps .
" It 's all about Islam , " Sami said , as the shop assistant wrapped his sausages in greaseproof paper .
" Most people are more religious these days .
They do n't want to eat pork , and they do n't let others produce it either . "
In a typical " Istanbul " twist , the customer himself was Jewish .
Behind him I spotted my Muslim colleagues - munching contentedly on ham sandwiches .
Conservative rule Today 's governing AK Party is far more conservative than my workmates .
It is extremely popular in rural Turkey , and with the new urban , religious - conservative middle - class here .
But the AKP 's leaders once belonged to a more radical , pro-Islamic party , and strictly secular Turks suspect their agenda has not changed .
To such sceptics , the fate of the pork business is proof .
A couple of hours ' drive towards the Bulgarian border , I found a farm that seemed at first to be thriving .
Despite an ever increasing number , Zafer is unable to sell his pigs
Trees heavy with honey - blossom did nothing to disguise the stink of some 300 pigs , snuffling through the mud for food .
" You 'll find the smell addictive , " Zafer the farmer laughed , as I tried in vain to block it out .
A lively man , with bushy brown curls , he invested heavily in his farm , spurred on by visions of British tourists breakfasting on his bacon , and diplomats barbecuing his pork chops .
But four years on , Zafer can not sell a single animal for slaughter .
Just like Lazari with his abattoir , Zafer 's farm has failed the new hygiene test .
On top of that the regulations now say you can only farm pigs if you say which abattoir will slaughter them : Catch - 22 when they have already been closed .
Back in Istanbul , the local Agriculture Ministry man denied the situation 's anything to do with Islam
" The government does n't announce out loud that it has banned the pig farms , " Zafer told me .
" But at the end of the day , that 's what 's happened here .
They 're trying to send a message to their religious constituents , " he said .
Back in Istanbul , the local agriculture ministry man denied the situation 's anything to do with Islam .
He insists the regulations were introduced to bring Turkey up to European standards .
" We 've got no problem with pork , " Ahmet Kavak told me .
" The farmers just need to meet the criteria . "
Hope for resolution
As evidence , he claimed the ministry was now working closely with Lazari to help open his slaughter house .
If that does finally happen - after years of fruitless negotiation - the butcher believes farmers could be lured back to the pork business .
Zafer is ready and waiting .
" This lot are eating me out of house and home , " he laughed , pointing to a wriggling pile of pink and black - spotted piglets .
His herd keeps on expanding .
But Zafer 's passionate about pig farming , so he keeps the animals as pets , holding out for a solution .
" The authorities thought we 'd give up . "
Zafer told me .
Then , he continued , " at the elections , they could say : ' Look , we 're Muslims , we finished off this business , ' but we 're still here - and determined to solve this " .
He smiled as a three - day old piglet clambered across his feet , then trotted off after its mother across the field .

What are these ?
ONE afternoon last week I found myself sitting at a desk that was not mine , answering to a name that was not mine , and fielding phone calls and e-mail messages from colleagues who do n’t exist .
I held a “ meeting ” with an actor pretending to be a passive - aggressive employee who was sabotaging a new sales plan with his vocal disapproval .
I had a “ conference call ” with an actress who was convincingly frosty as she refused to share key research and manpower that her department had and mine needed .
In other words , I spent that day doing what a growing number of employees will do if they are to reach a position of power or potential : I was being “ assessed . ”
Most evaluations are not nearly this elaborate and consist of answering true / false questions on screen or with pen and ink , rather than a full day of role playing .
But the purpose is the same .
There are 2,500 profiling “ instruments , ” ( oddly , the word test is never used by those in the testing business ) , and every year , companies seem to rely on them more when deciding to hire or promote .
Sixty - five percent of the companies surveyed reported their use in 2006 , up from 34 percent of companies a year earlier , according to Staffing Industry Report , a human - resources newsletter .
The reasons for this growth have little to do with the content of tests themselves , because that has stayed more or less the same for three decades .
What has changed , instead , is the workplace .
There are no difficult ideas in this column .
Like , for example , when I tell you about the Daily Telegraph front page headline which says “ Abuse of cannabis puts 500 a week in hospital ” , and it turns out they ’re actually quoting a figure from a report on the number of people having contact with any drug treatment service of any variety .
The colossal majority of these , of course , are outpatient appointments for drugs counselling , not hospital admissions .
So there are not 500 people a week suddenly being put into hospital by cannabis .
But this is not a news story : like their recurring dodgy abortion figures , it is the venal moralising of a passing puritan , dressed up in posh numbers .
Similarly , there ’s nothing very complicated about a report from CNW Marketing in Oregon , which the Independent ’s motoring correspondent has now quoted ( twice ) in his attempt to demonstrate that Hummers , Jeeps , and various other cars the size of a small caravan are – “ in fact ” – greener than smaller hybrid cars like the Prius .
Because readers love a quirky paradox .
CNW , a car industry marketing firm , manage to do this by making calculations over the lifetime of a car .
They decide that about 90 % of the environmental cost of a car ’s lifetime environmental impact is from its manufacture and recycling , not the fuel it burns whilst tootling around .
This is the polar opposite of all other life - cycle analyses .
CNW include all kinds of funny things to make their numbers work , like the erosion of the road surface of the people who travel to the car factory .
They also decide , for the purposes of their calculation , that people will keep their giant , cyclist - killing Jeeps for twice as long as their green hybrid cars , and if you think that is a leap of faith , they also decide that Prius drivers will travel about half as many miles a year as Jeep drivers .
This may be true if you observe the behaviour of people who choose to buy these cars .
But it ’s hard to see how it is a factor for anyone making a new purchasing decision , since you ’re probably going to drive as much as you ’re going to drive , and buying a 4 × 4 is not suddenly going to turn you overnight into a chubby , middle - class parent driving your children 400 yards to school .
Although for those of us afflicted with a disproportionate anality , the most infuriating thing about this report is the contrast between its opaque methodology and its spurious , four - figure accuracy .
They confidently assert that your Hummer will last “ 34.96 years ” , which is almost as irritating as this paper slipping into bogusly accurate currency conversions for estimated figures , like last week ’s “ $ 56 bn ( £ 28.26 bn ) international food supplement industry ” .
Mind you , in the translators ’ academic journal META , vol 43 no 4 , p 562 they give a mean sentence length for translated texts of 24.08714286 words , with no discernible trace of a knowing smile .
I know I ’m wrong to care .
On the BBC news site “ crews were hopeful the 20 m cubic litres of water could be held back and not breach the dam wall ” .
And that ’ll be a struggle , since “ cubic litres ” are a nine - dimensional measuring system , so the hyperdimensional water could breach the dam in almost any one of the five other dimensions you have n’t noticed yet .
In the Metro they reckon “ solving problems is really down to keeping an open mind .
Brain scans showed that volunteers who hit a mental block during verbal tests gave off strong gamma rays , which are linked with being focused and alert . ”
Gamma rays are produced by sub-atomic particle interactions , like electron - positron annihilation or radioactive decay .
They will sterilise your brain very nicely , before the dead , irradiated neurons start to grow over with scar tissue , and that may well affect concentration .
And meanwhile , in Elle magazine they ’re promoting the scientific theories of yet another self - declared nutritional genius : “ Marisa cited flour and water as the two biggest problem foods .
She gave us flour and water and urged us to make a gloopy paste , with which we stuck pieces of paper to the wall .
Then she said this is what ’s stuck to our insides when we eat pasta and bread . ”
They only do it to wind you up .
If you close your eyes , it ’ll all go away again .

Evolutionary biologists , from Charles Darwin onwards , have believed that isolation plays a key role in the origin of species .
Now a study of cave - dwelling salamanders that have evolved into separate species from their surface - dwelling kin despite regularly interbreeding suggests that isolation is not necessary for speciation .
Cave - dwelling species were thought to be classic examples of how isolation is necessary for speciation .
Cave populations isolated underground gradually evolve to lose newly useless structures such as eyes and pigmentation .
But when Matthew Niemiller , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville , and his colleagues saw hints of hybridisation between Tennessee cave salamanders ( Gyrinophilus palleucus ) and the surface - dwelling spring salamander ( G. porphyriticus ) , they decided to take a closer look .

Regular mixing
The researchers sequenced DNA samples from 109 cave and spring salamanders from 43 locations throughout Tennessee .
They then plugged the data into a sophisticated computer model that compared possible evolutionary histories for the salamanders and calculated which scenario provided the most likely explanation for the genetic patterns observed .
The results suggested that the cave salamanders could not have evolved in isolation from the surface species .
In fact , the most likely history was one in which spring salamanders regularly interbred with cave salamanders even as the two species were diverging about 2 million years ago .
Natural selection in the cave salamander for traits helpful for life in caves – such as sharper non-visual senses and a permanently aquatic lifestyle – must have been strong enough to override this gene flow between the surface and cave animals , says Niemiller .
Applying the same analysis to other cases where species were thought to have evolved in isolation – both within caves and without – is likely to yield more examples , he speculates .
“ It ’s very difficult to show that two divergent forms have experienced gene flow , ” he says .
“ It might be more prevalent than we currently recognise . ”
Common occurrence ?
Andrew Hendry , an evolutionary biologist at McGill University ’s Redpath Museum in Montreal , Canada , agrees that speciation occurs in the face of gene flow much more often than many biologists are willing to admit .
Niemiller ’s study provides further proof , particularly because of the timing of the gene flow .
“ What is interesting is that the migration events cluster fairly early on , ” he says .
“ This suggests gene flow was initially fairly high , and then as they adapt to the new environment , you get the buildup of barriers due to adaptation , and then gene flow goes down . ”
However , says Hendry , the computer model at the heart of Niemiller ’s analysis is still relatively new , he says , and it takes so much computer time to run it that theoreticians have not yet learned all of its limitations .
As a result , Niemiller ’s study may do little to convince confirmed isolationists , he says .

He ’s already filed a lawsuit ( PDF ) that says he was denied a promotion because of his atheism .
Since then , Specialist Jeremy
Hall has n’t won many fans in the military .
He ’s still facing threats .
Spc. Jeremy
Hall filed a formal statement Wednesday with the Army .
He says he overheard a conversation between two sergeants in his platoon and one wanted to “ bust Hall in the mouth . ”
Hall says he faces the animosity because he is an atheist and is suing the Department of Defense .
He alleges it permits a culture that pushes fundamentalist Christianity .
He says he does not feel safe his unit .
It ’s bad enough we have our soldiers overseas right now ; that many are not treated with respect because they are not Christian is despicable .
The Department of Defense has to take action against high - ranking army officials who allow this harassment to continue .

An analysis of century - old bottles of absinthe — the kind once quaffed by the likes of van Gogh and Picasso to enhance their creativity — may end the controversy over what ingredient caused the green liqueur 's supposed mind - altering effects .
The culprit seems plain and simple :
The century - old absinthe contained about 70 percent alcohol , giving it a 140 - proof kick .
In comparison , most gins , vodkas and whiskeys are just 80 - to 100 - proof .
In recent years , the psychedelic nature of absinthe has been hotly debated .
Absinthe was notorious among 19th - century and early 20th - century bohemian artists as " the Green Fairy " that expanded the mind .
After it became infamous for madness and toxic side effects among drinkers , it was widely banned .
The modern scientific consensus is that absinthe 's reputation could simply be traced back to alcoholism , or perhaps toxic compounds that leaked in during faulty distillation .
Still , others have pointed at a chemical named thujone in wormwood , one of the herbs used to prepare absinthe and the one that gives the drink its green color .
Thujone was blamed for " absinthe madness " and " absinthism , " a collection of symptoms including hallucinations , facial tics , numbness and dementia .
Prior studies suggested that absinthe had only trace levels of thujone .
But critics claimed that absinthe made before it got banned in France in 1915 had much higher levels of thujone than modern absinthe produced since 1988 , when the European Union lifted the ban on making absinthe .
" Today it seems a substantial minority of consumers want these myths to be true , even if there is no empirical evidence that they are , " said researcher Dirk Lachenmeier , a chemist with the Chemical and Veterinary Investigation Laboratory of Karlsruhe in Germany .
Lachenmeier and his colleagues analyzed 13 samples of absinthe from old , sealed bottles in France , Switzerland , Italy , Spain , the Netherlands and the United States dated back to the early 1900s before the ban .
After uncorking the bottles , they found relatively small concentrations of thujone in that absinthe , about the same as those in modern varieties .
Laboratory tests found no other compound that could explain absinthe 's effects .
" All things considered , nothing besides ethanol was found in the absinthes that was able to explain the syndrome of absinthism , " Lachenmeier said .
( Ethanol is a word for common drinking alcohol . )
The scientists are set to detail their findings in the May 14 issue of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
Local artist Serge Toussaint was contracted by the FDOT ( Florida Department of Transportation ) to paint a mural to spruce up the I - 95 overpass in the Liberty City area of Miami on northwest 62nd street also known as Martin Luther King Boulevard .
Toussaint did just that and created a mural with the Rev. Martin Luther King , Jr. and Senator Barack Obama .
Toussaint 's explanation of his vision for including Senator Obama was simple but powerful and touching .
Apparently the mural was considered too political for the FDOT .
Toussaint was asked to remove Obama .
He explained his vision of Barack Obama as the manifestation of King 's dream .
He said he wanted to cry as he painted over the Obama image .
The FDOT may be within its rights to ask Toussaint to remove Obama but it is also a statement of the lack of understanding of the significance of Barack Obama 's candidacy to Blacks not just in this country but throughout the world .
I specify Blacks because Obama 's candidacy affects different groups of people in very different ways .
You see , white people who support Barack Obama get his message of hope , better days than today , inclusiveness and respect .
Well , Black people get that same message and more .
Barack Obama also represents possibilities , equity , access and freedom .
If you 're not a minority and black you really can't understand what that means .
You really can't fully understand the significance of and pride in his accomplishments .
That 's not a denigration of folks who are not minorities and not black ; it just is what it is .
It 's also important to understand the symbolism of the juxtaposition of Barack Obama next to Dr. Martin Luther King .
Dr. King is a historical icon .
The Montgomery Bus Boycott and his other non-violent campaigns for civil rights in this country are legendary and the subject of civics lessons taught to children throughout this country .
His birthday is celebrated and the day of his death is remembered .
Barack Obama is an icon also .
He is the bi-racial son of an immigrant father from Africa and an American - born Caucasian mother .
He was not born into financial wealth .
He is a living , breathing example of what can be accomplished through education and hard work .
To have the possibility of that dream erased by a few strokes of paint is disheartening .
Further insult is the implication that Barack Obama 's image should be removed because Gov. Charlie Crist may be John McCain 's running mate .
Are we really expected to live under such colonialism that Obama 's image would be politically - offensive to the governor and not allowed ?
I think not .

A secret stash of porno movies made by the East German army during the Cold War has been discovered .
During the ' 80s , an amateur film circle was set up in a barracks in Biesdorf , East Berlin , in order to provide blau movies for the army top brass as well as visiting dignitaries .
Despite the politburo's anti-pornography stance , over 100 people were involved in the films — in front of , as well as behind the camera .

The films , with titles such as Glass Dreams , Private Werner 's Big Surprise and F***ing for the Fatherland , were made on 12 mm cameras .
Initially , a dozen men were involved , but by the mid-'80s , there were 160 people in the know .
Soldiers were measured up to see if they were well - enough endowed for a starring role in the films , which were short and shoddy .
Former soldeier Dietmar Schuertze , now a media spokesman for the Bundeswehr , worked as both actor and sound assistant on the movies .
" They were made , essentially , in secret but nothing got done in that man 's army without the approval of the brass , " he said , adding that they were made for the ruling classes ' consumption .
Filming often took place at garden parties , with officers and party officials checking the action out .

Some of the less salacious moments were shown on German TV earlier this week , but the quarter - century - old movies were incredibly dated .
" I did n't recognize myself , " said one former soldier .
" And neither , thank God , did my wife . "

The Eight - Circuit Brain
Definitions , Functions , Vertical Connectivities
© 1985 -2019 Antero Alli
updated 8/26/2019
Intelligence , a word commonly defined as intellect alone along with its classical measurement , the I.Q. ( Intellectual Quotient ) test .
However , this definition fails to recognize other functions of Intelligence beyond , but also inclusive of , intellect .
The 8 - Circuit Brain model , as first developed by Timothy Leary ( " Info - Psychology " ) and then advanced by Robert Anton Wilson ( " Prometheus Rising " ) and myself ( " Angel Tech " and " The Eight - Circuit Brain " ) , posits eight interacting functions of Intelligence .
The Eight - Circuit Brain presents a symbolic system , a diagnostic grid that can be used to track and interpret a greater variety of experiences and states of consciousness .
No actual ' circuits " exist in the body per se ; the term " circuits " symbolize a spectrum of eight interactive areas of human experience .
In the list below , I have distilled basic definitions and functions of all eight circuits along with a primer on how upper and lower circuits can interact with each other .
I 've also included how circuits 1 - 4 represent a specific area of identification - how and where we identify ourselves .
Circuits 5 - 8 include specific shocks that activate the states of consciousness these circuits represent .
All eight circuits are posited here as equal in value , without any imposed hierarchical standards of any being " inferior " or " superior " to others .
All eight circuits refer to states of consciousness functioning at various degrees of latency and integration within the individual -- in nonlinear ( simultaneous ) and linear ( evolutionary ) modalities .
- A.A .
THE FOUR SURVIVAL CIRCUITS
IDENTIFICATIONS AND INTEGRATIONS
C - 1 Physio-Biological Intelligence ; the will to survive
IDENTIFICATION : with the physical body and all things material
INTEGRATION : the degree of physical confidence earned and maintained
to assure physical survival , shelter , safety , well being , biological health .
C - 2 Emotional - Territorial Intelligence ; the will to power
IDENTIFICATION : with emotions , status , and ownership of property
INTEGRATION : the degree of emotional confidence earned and maintained
to assure ego strength , personal territory , and independence .
C - 3 Symbolic - Conceptual Intelligence ; the will to reason
IDENTIFICATION : with concepts , ideas , theories , and beliefs
INTEGRATION : the degree of intellectual confidence earned and maintained
to assure skills in problem - solving , communication , and learning ( education ) .
C - 4 Social - Moral Intelligence ; the will to interact with others
IDENTIFICATION : with family , groups , sexual orientation , morality & ethics
INTEGRATION : the degree of social confidence earned and maintained to assure
attractiveness , interpersonal relations , sense of community , moral compass .
THE FOUR POST - SURVIVAL CIRCUITS
THEIR SOURCES AND SHOCKS
C - 5 Somatic Intelligence of Body Wisdom and Five Senses
IDENTIFICATION : with the experience of getting high and feeling happy
Sources : whatever triggers the experience of process over outcome , rapture ,
ecstatic communion with nature , tantra ( yoga , meditation ) , charisma , second wind ,
falling deep in love ( endorphins ) , and any expanding presence of being here now .
Shocks : Ecstasy and Bliss ( absence of self - created suffering )
C - 6 Intuitive - Psychic Intelligence of the Brain , Spine , & CNS
IDENTIFICATION : with the Central Nervous System and the Body Electric
Sources : whatever triggers the experience of the energetic body and its aura ,
the second attention , intuition , clairvoyance and psychic abilities , ritual , sex magick ,
relativistic perception .
Shocks : Uncertainty ( shattering of assumptions , certitudes
and dogmas )
C - 7 Mytho - Genetic Intelligence of DNA and the Planetary Entity
IDENTIFICATION : with the Planet , all Living Things , Ancestral Gestalt , DNA
Sources : whatever triggers the experience of ancestral and past life memories ,
autonomous archetypes , synchronicity , planetary ( Gaia ) mind , cosmic consciousness .
Shocks : Indivisibility ( absence of dualistic consciousness )
C - 8 Quantum - Nonlocal Intelligence of Subatomic interactions
IDENTIFICATION : with Void as true nature ; dreambody / dreamtime / astral plane
Sources : whatever triggers the experience of near death , out - of - body states ,
lucid dreams , conscious dreamworking while out of body , unity with Void , singularity .
Shocks : Death and Impermanence ( absence of ego identification ) .
THE THREE SUB - PHASES
HOW INTELLIGENCE CAN BE INCREASED
All eight functions of Intelligence can be accessed through full absorption , integration and transmission of each of the eight areas of experience symbolized by the circuits .
These three sub - phases reflect the tertiary function of our most basic biological unit of intelligence : the neuron .
All three sub-stages are necessary for the advancement of intelligence .
If you only absorb , nothing can be integrated ; if nothing can be integrated , whatever is absorbed merely regurgitates ; we end up parroting other people 's experiences , mass media associations , what we read in books , etc .
Each of these eight levels of experience have their own distinct ways of knowing and defining intelligence that do not necessarily apply to other levels .
For example , C - 2 emotions follows different processes than C - 3 thinking .
SHOCKS & ANCHORS
Each of the eight circuits exist within each individual at various degrees of expression and latency .
It would be erroneous to assume any one circuit as " better " or " worse " , or " superior " or " inferior " than any other .
Better to look at all eight circuits as symbolizing a spectrum of consciousness simultaneously working together in a dynamic changing whole .
There are countless ways these eight functions interact and / or act on each other .
The specific dynamics I have been researching involve how the " survival " circuits ( 1 - 4 ) act as anchors to stabilize the shocks from experiences symbolized by the four " post - survival " circuits 5 - 8 .
In addition , I have seen how upper circuit experience acts on lower circuits as catalysts for growth and development .
Here 's how I 've seen the lower circuits and the upper circuits paired up in this anchor / shock theory :
1/5 ; 2/6 ; 3/7 ; 4/8
VERTICAL CONNECTIVITIES
Without a supple and resilient foundation ( integration of circuits 1 - 4 ) , any significant force of expanded consciousness ( circuits 5 - 8 ) can destabilize us in a number of ways .
Once the survival circuits can be more fully integrated , enough inner stability and strength develops to help absorb the shocks of upper circuit experiences , ie. , the shocks of C - 5 Ecstasy , C - 6 Uncertainty , C - 7 Indivisibility , and C - 8 Impermanence .
Upper circuit post - survival shocks stimulate growth and development in the four survival circuits , just as the survival circuits ( once integrated ) can help substantiate and bring into manifestation the expanded consciousness and accelerated energy states symbolized by circuits five through eight .

Uncategorized 5 Snacks That will Smash That Afternoon Groggy Feeling 6467
Written on 5/07/2008 by Garrett
Whelan who writes about cooking for men or anyone trying to kick the fast food habit at FatBastardEats.com .
You should snack , a lot .
During the day you should eat approximately 200 calories every 2 to 4 hours , both for health and productivity .
If you let your blood sugar get too low , you could be on your way to some serious binge eating and desperate snack choices .
In fact , 90 % of your overeating could probably have been avoided if you ate a little before you got hungry .
But you do n’t plan to snack , so you overeat .
Then what happens ?
Grogginess , sleepiness and the inevitable productivity plummet .
Your response to said grogginess ?
Candy , sweets , coffee , and other quick fixes that cause quick blood sugar highs only to be followed by lower lows .
The cycle continues forever until you actually go to sleep .
Regular , planned snacking can avoid all this .
So how to we snack ?
Clearly we have to make some smart choices and they do n’t have to include baby carrots and diced apples .
A snack should meet some physical needs ( keeping our blood sugar from getting too low ) and some mental needs ( i.e. Brain Food ! ) .
So we need snacks that meet the following 4 criteria :
It must have a low Glycemic Index .
The higher the GI , the quicker your blood glucose levels will rise .
If your blood sugar gets too high , your body releases insulin to bring it down .
This makes you tired and hungry again right after you just ate .
Lower carbs , more fat and fiber ( to slow absorption ) will mean snacks with a lower GI .
It must be filling .
Ever take a pill in the morning and as soon as you turn around you ca n’t remember if you took it or not ?
You do n’t want a snack like that .
It must be interesting to your mouth .
Your mouth likes contrasts : sweet and sour .
crunchy and chewy .
We want a snack that uses this .
Ideally our snack is self - regulating .
That means that we wo n’t eat too much of it .
This one is tougher , and we wo n’t always find something that has this quality .
In those cases we have to practice the dreaded art of self control .
Stumped for ideas ?
Here are 5 snacks ( in no particular order ) that fit that criteria and that you ’re probably not eating :
Spicy Nuts .
Now regular nuts meet our A , B and C requirements .
They ’re crunchy and interesting and full of fat , fiber and protein .
But if you had a trough of them at the office , you ’d be buying new pants weekly .
That ’s why I like spicy peanuts , they ’re self regulating .
You can only eat as many as you can handle .
I like Ass Kickin’ Peanuts myself .
As an added bonus , snacking on these all day really builds up your tolerance for heat .
So the next time you and your brother go out for Thai food you can make him look like a total wimp ( I hate my brother ) .
Homemade Salsa and Tortilla Chips .
Tortilla chips with any dip are crunchy , creamy and low on the GI .
Salsa is the best choice for a dip because it has the highest flavor / nutrition ratio and because when you make a batch it ’s good for a week .
You can pack it up and take it to work , unlike guacamole , which might make it to the table before it turns brown .
And I say homemade because it ’s better , cheaper and super easy .
I use the Alton Brown salsa recipe ( halve that unless you ’re a pro linebacker ) and I buy bulk tortillas from the supermarket and fry them up in some corn oil .
In about 10 minutes I have a bag of chips at 1/6 the cost and they ’re restaurant quality .
Deviled Eggs .
Boiled eggs have the same benefits , but deviled eggs bring a little more flavor to the mouth party ( yeah , I said that ) .
They taste great , they ’re filling and they have 0 carbs which means they do n’t even register on the GI .
I would call them self regulating because they are not easily packed and transported .
Half a Toasted Peanut Butter and Honey sandwich .
A whole sandwich is a bit too much for a snack , but a half is perfect .
The peanut butter is the key part here , it ’s got enough fat , protein and fiber to keep the GI low .
The honey provides a nice sweetness with fewer calories ( sugar is only 80 % as sweet as honey ) and it wo n’t create the purple slurm on one side of your sandwich like jelly will .
Do n’t skip the toasting part though .
The toast has a crunchy outside , chewy inside thing that makes this snack interesting ; remember that ’s important .
Homemade Popcorn .
This is my favorite .
It ’s pure fiber and carbohydrate and it ’s GI is n’t too high .
It tastes great and it has the most interesting mouth feel ( I ’m telling you , that ’s important ) of any snack .
It ’s perfectly healthy if you do n’t add butter and it ’s not too bad if you use a healthier olive oil butter spread .
It keeps great for a day or so and if you have n’t eaten it by then ( why would you not eat it by then ? ) throw it in a bowl with milk and sugar .
Popcorn is the original cereal .
And if you make it yourself ( do n’t buy those overpriced bags of microwave popcorn with carcinogenic imitation butter ) it ’s practically free .
It literally costs pennies per gallon if you pop it in a wok on your stove .
Almost free , tasty and healthy .
What more could you want ?
Huh ?
You want more ?
5 is n’t enough for you ?
Fine , whatever .
Here is a 6th :
Bonus : Diced Apple with Lime .
This is big in Mexico and it ’s a great way to make an apple a little tastier .
Just dice it up real fine and squeeze a lime or lemon on top .
The sour gives a great contrast to the earthy , sweet flavor of the apple .
It also stops the apple from turning brown so you can dice it at home and throw it in a zip lock for work .
Snacking is an important part of your day but you have to snack smart .
Look for things that have a low GI ( fat and fiber ) and always plan to snack .
It ’s thinking that you wo n’t eat anything between breakfast and lunch that leaves you standing in front of the candy machine at 10:30 in the morning , starting a cycle that ’s going to ruin your day .

Nicky Reilly was arrested and taken to hospital A man arrested after an explosion at an Exeter restaurant has " a history of mental illness " and was a recent convert to Islam , police have said .
Nicky Reilly , 22 , from Plymouth , suffered serious facial injuries when a device detonated at the Princesshay shopping centre in the city .
He is now in police custody in hospital and officers have also searched an address linked to him in Plymouth .
A senior police officer said Mr Reilly had been " preyed on and radicalised " .
Anti-terror police and security services are assisting the inquiry .
Mr Reilly was arrested after the explosion at 1250 BST on Thursday in the Giraffe restaurant in the £ 230 m shopping development , which is one of Exeter 's main attractions .
CCTV footage taken from a nearby camera appears to show him emerging from the cafe with blood pouring down his face before his arrest .
No -one else was hurt in the explosion at the restaurant , which was busy at the time and is popular with families .

After the incident , officers evacuated the city 's bus station - which is about half a mile away - and extended an exclusion cordon 100 metres around the scene .
However , police have now re-opened the city centre though the restaurant remains closed .
Devon and Cornwall Police Deputy Chief Constable Tony Melville said : " Our investigation so far indicates Reilly , who had a history of mental illness , had adopted the Islamic faith .
" We believe , despite his weak and vulnerable illness , he was preyed upon , radicalised and taken advantage of . "
After the arrest , police evacuated some properties 40 miles away in the Stonehouse area of Plymouth before officers from the Tactical Aid Group searched a flat in King Street , Plymouth , which was linked to Reilly .
Neighbours shocked
They confirmed he travelled from Plymouth to Exeter by bus and are appealing for anyone who may have seen him over recent weeks to contact them .
Officers would like to know more about Mr Reilly and trace his recent movements .
Police have been searching a flat in Plymouth Neighbours have described Mr Reilly as a " big friendly giant " and told BBC News they were shocked at what had happened .
Businesses in the vicinity have been asked to retain any CCTV footage which could assist police .
Eyewitness Peter Lacey , who was in the restaurant with his wife , told BBC News : " There were three explosions .
It is my impression they sounded more like gunshots than a bomb , like a lightbulb exploding .
" They came from a locked toilet . "
The £ 230 m Princesshay development officially opened last September .
The scheme has been heralded as the biggest single investment in regeneration in the city 's history .
It contains a mix of shops , restaurants and apartments .

Boston University professor emeritus Howard Zinn had long used the written word to describe his version of US history .
But in 2008 , at the age of 85 , Zinn turned to a new platform -- the graphic novel , with " A People 's History of American Empire . "

Mandatory DSL line - sharing is a common practice in other developed countries , and was in the US as well until an FCC decision ruled that DSL was an " information service " and not subject to the rules .
Line - sharing is what enables much of the competition in other countries and allows small ISPs like Wireless Nomad to thrive in Canada and offer innovative services .
But line - sharing has its drawbacks ; chief among them , of course , is that without control of the line , an ISP is not ultimately in control of the service it is selling .
Canadian DSL resellers learned that lesson the hard way this week as ISPs learned that Bell Canada now runs traffic - shaping hardware even on the lines it resells .
Readers at Broadband Reports noted the issue earlier this week as owners of small ISPs suddenly found that their customers were having traffic throttled , even though the ISPs were vehemently anti-throttling .
The problem was compounded by the fact Bell Canada did not apparently tell the ISPs that it was about to make the change .
The company has subsequently confirmed the throttling and says it should be fully in place by April 7 .
The throttling itself is not uncommon in Canada , where network neutrality has not been the heated issue it has become in the US .
Cable operator Roger has been shaping P2P traffic for years , and when encryption became common , simply throttled all encrypted network traffic in 2007 .
Shaw is also reported to be a fan of throttling , but Bell Canada 's move is potentially more incendiary because it now affects wholesellers and retailers of Bell service .
Details of Bell Canada 's implementation remain scarce or contradictory , but the timing of the news is interesting , coming as it does just days after the CBC announced its own plans to use BitTorrent to distribute Canada 's Next Great Prime Minister .
Given P2P 's obvious ( and growing ) legal uses , transparency is going to be an important part of any throttling scheme .
If a network operator makes clear that BitTorrent speed is reduced after 30 GB a month , for instance , that 's one thing ; if the throttling remains mysterious and arbitrary , that 's another .
Hitting back at throttling
Users are fighting back , though .
Canadian law professor Michael Geist points to a Google map that Canadian users have been collaboratively using to comment on filtering .
Here in the US , where Comcast is under FCC scrutiny for its own traffic - shaping practices , much has been made of the need for transparency .
But until transparency truly arrives , the P2P video company Vuze is developing an open - source plug - in for Azureus that makes it easy to sniff out ISPs using Comcast 's " TCP reset packets " P2P blocking scheme .
Vuze tells
Ars that the plug - in " monitors network connections , and every 10 minutes , it measures the number of reset TCP connections , displaying the results to the user .
If they then click the " share results " checkbox , their results go to Vuze 's central server that aggregates the results and compares them across ISPs . "
Wikis have also been set up to track ISP traffic - shaping practices around the world .
Taken together , such measures show that consumers ( and , increasingly , legitimate businesses like Vuze and even NBC Universal ) at least have the tools to shine a light into some traffic - shaping 's darker corners .
But what good is this sort of transparency without a truly competitive market ?
Bell Canada 's move , should it turn out to affect all wholesalers and resellers of Bell 's DSL service , could mean that many of the options consumers once had in the DSL market are suddenly subject to throttling , and on Bell 's terms .
That leaves lobbying action and government regulatory bodies , both of which are slow to achieve results , and are certainly places where telcos and cable operators deploy huge resources to prevent " bad " decisions from being made .
Damien Fox , one of the cofounders of Wireless Nomad mentioned above , tells
Ars today that the situation is " unacceptable , and a symptom of Bell 's arrogance .
It is blatant censorship of our users '
Internet connections , and Bell is not going to escape a fight on this one .
Either they back down , or independent providers should go to the CRTC , or the Federal Court if need be , to get our Internet connections unblocked . "
We 'll keep an eye on this one as it develops .
PLANNING FOR THE APOCALYPSE ….
The New York Times reports that business lobbyists are feverishly working to get lots of business - friendly regulations in place before the Bush administration expires , “ in the belief that they can get better deals from the Bush administration than from its successor . ”
I ’d say that ’s a pretty sound belief .
And hardly a surprising one , either .
But here ’s something I did n’t know : when the Bush administration took over in 2001 it unilaterally froze nearly all of Bill Clinton ’s last - minute regulatory changes , eventually changing or killing about 20 % of them .
But the next president wo n’t be able to do that :
Whoever becomes the next president , Democrat or Republican , will find that it is not so easy to make immediate and sweeping changes .
The Supreme Court has held that a new president cannot arbitrarily revoke final regulations that already have the force of law .
To undo such rules , a new administration must provide a compelling justification and go through a formal rule - making process , which can take months or years .
So the stakes really are higher this time around .
I can hardly wait to see what kind of last minute damage Bush decides to inflict on the Republic as his term in office draws to a close .
That said , here ’s my favorite part of the story :
A priority for many employers in 2008 is to secure changes in the rules for family and medical leave … .
The National Association of Manufacturers said the law had been widely abused and had caused “ a staggering loss of work hours ” as employees took unscheduled , intermittent time off for health conditions that could not be verified .
The use of such leave time tends to rise sharply before holiday weekends , on the day after Super Bowl Sunday and on the first day of the local hunting season , employers said .
News flash : workers sometime call in sick even when they are n’t !
And this is causing a “ staggering loss of work hours . ”
Clearly we need new regulations to cut down on Super Bowl malingering .
John McCain screwed up on Foreign Policy 101 AGAIN .
Yesterday at the AP annual meeting , McCain said he would defer any decision to General Petraeus over whether troops should be shifted from Iraq to Afghanistan in order to intensify the search for Osama bin Laden .
Only problem is that this is not Petraeus ’s job , as he has stated before .
By my count , this makes 6 times this month that McCain has screwed up basic foreign policy facts … the other 5 being various conflations of who exactly is fighting in Iraq .
As Hertzberg says today :
It ’s easy to say one word when you mean to say another , nearly identical word , but it ’s impossible to repeatedly misspeak an entire anecdote — or , as in McCain ’s case , an entire strategic reality .
Couple that with remarks made by leading conservative thinkers in the New York Times last week .
They claim that McCain “ is not as fully formed on his foreign policy as his campaign advisers say he is , and that while he speaks authoritatively , he operates too much off the cuff and has not done the deeper homework required of a presidential candidate . ”
This is not deep homework , and has nothing to do with running for President .
For John McCain to make this many mistakes while holding an important national security post as Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee is simply unacceptable .
These types of mistakes would prevent John McCain from getting a job as a research assistant at any think tank in DC , let alone delivering anything resembling a responsible foreign policy as president .
The brilliant minds of the punditry seem content to ignore this pattern or question it in any way , despite the fact that McCain is repeatedly screwing up the very platform upon which he claims to run .
I ’m all for having a healthy conversation about why McCain makes these mistakes , but the first step is admitting that it is wrong , irresponsible , and unacceptable .
It is the " job " after all of talking heads to hold our leaders accountable .
This is much more than a “ gaffe . ”
This is demonstrated and repeated incompetent behavior that has very real consequences .
I , for one , am pretty bitter that it 's not getting any airtime .

Star Trek Blogging : The Klingon Way Daniel
This is a guest post by Joshua Clanton .
Image by Eli from PhotoshopStar
In the world of Star Trek , Klingons are known as a warrior people , formidable in battle , fierce in their passions , and concerned with honor above all .
But the life of a Klingon has lessons for humans , even for that sedentary class known as bloggers .
Here are three proverbs that can help you learn to blog the Klingon way .
Act and you shall have dinner .
Think and you shall be dinner .
Because so much of Klingon life is centered around battle and the hunt , the ability to act quickly and decisively is highly prized .
When your opponent is swinging a bat ’leth at you , there is n’t any time to contemplate the best course of action .
You need to act instinctively to avoid a painful death .
In blogging too , taking action can be much more important than thinking things through .
One of my most popular posts was just written up quickly and when I did allow myself to think about whether I should publish it , I hesitated wondering whether my readers would like it or not .
Fortunately I decided to act instead of overthinking it .
Four thousand throats may be cut in one night by a running man .
This proverb also emphasizes speed , but even more importantly , it warns against underestimating someone ’s abilities , whether that is you or someone else .
If a warrior can cut a single person ’s throat , then the only obstacle to cutting four thousand is how quickly he can repeat this act .
The warrior who can not only cut throats , but do it quickly , is the warrior capable of achieving greatness .
In blogging as well , the limiting factor for most blogs is how quickly and strongly they pursue their goals .
Often they underestimate themselves , thinking that they can only do so much in a given period of time .
That ’s true enough , but if you perfect your technique by eliminating distractions and systematically pursuing your goals , gaining a few thousand subscribers might not be so impossible after all .
Mere life is not a victory , mere death is not a defeat .
To a Klingon , it is n’t enough to merely live .
One must also live well .
This means fighting great battles , going on great hunts , serving the Empire well , and finally dying a glorious death knowing that you have passionately pursued the things you want most .
Then too , it is n’t enough to merely blog .
One must also blog well .
This means writing great articles , posting great comments , supporting your blogger friends , and when the time is right , retiring your blog honorably knowing that you pursued blogging passionately .
Qapla ’!*
* Success !

nice article
helse Star trek is n’t actually my cup of tea , although this post made me smile :) .
Thanks
Peter helse
Kondomer Great show ! .. and a great blog .
🙂 I have not seen all Star Trek episodes , but I like what I have seen so far .
Have you ever seen Andromeda ?
That should be related to Star Trek somehow ?
Vsem Well
I just started my blog today and I really needed this verbal kick in the butt ; trying to overcome my jitters .
Live long and prosper !

There is no honour without action , no reward without suffering .
I would have though that ferengi would be more apt .
PopArtDiva Dear Joshua : I have seen every episode of Star Trek in original broadcast !
I then taped every episode in rerun .
Packed away in storage there are hundreds of VHS tapes loaded with places where no man has gone before , lol , as well as some serious Star Trek memorabilia !
Funny post and you make a very good point !
We can sometimes think ourselves out of a dynamic post by being too timid !
As to why so many Vulcan greetings , blogging is much like Vulcan too .
Remember I.D.I.C. – Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combination – so many blogs in the universe !
Though the Vulcans valued peace they were fierce warriors too , but their preference of logic over emotion is a valid premise .
Sometimes you should think before you act – or post – especially if your emotions are involved !
A judicious use of both action and thought would benefit many a blogger .
So maybe a half - breed blogger of a Vulcan and a Klingon union would be best ?
I shall close with the other Vulcan greeting : Peace and Long Life
Pink Ink I ’ve NEVER even watched a single Star Trek episode ( yes , what planet have I been on ) , but this post had me smiling .
I think a certain balance of acting and thinking is ideal .
No nail - biting and tweaking until dawn , but at least give it some thought so you do n’t look STUPID .
I ’m new to this blogging thing ; thanks for the daily blog tips .
Joshua Clanton – Design for the WEB I do n’t get why everyone is using a Vulcan greeting on a Klingon post .
🙂 @ Carol : I have n’t seen them all yet , but I ’m pretty close .
About 36 left to go .
Glad that you found the post helpful !
Carol McCrow
Hi , I just had to comment .
I ’ve been watching Star Trek for a long time .
I remember watching the original with my dad when they were new episodes !
Anyway , I liked the objective and it made good sense .
I ’m very good at over - thinking or over - analyzing myself or my work , and sometimes it is to your benefit to just go with it .
Over - thinking something clouds the true picture , or it does for me anyway .
I like the way you used Star Trek on your site - it caught my attention and I found your blog worth reading and helpful .
Thanks !
I ’ll be reading more of your blogs .
Live Long And Prosper !
Carol McCrow P.S.
I can safely say I have seen every last episode !
And movie !
And I still watch them .
They ’re part of my comfort zone .
beautifullovepictures innovative blogging idea , but i am not there yet
jonson roth Sorry , no .
Enterprise is far more interesting than DS9 , except when they started having Cardassians ( sp ? ) .
[ But not Kardashians . ]
Joshua Clanton @ Gia ’da : Glad that I could help you get over your jitters .
Congrats on your new blog !
@ David :
Thanks !
@
Blogtalks :
But what about the Borg ? 😉
Joshua Clanton @ Luis : I ’m glad you found it inspiring .
Now get out there and act !
😉 @ Frank C. : Kosh is cool , though I prefer Londo .
“ Now , I go to spread happiness to the rest of the station .
It ’s a terrible responsibility but I have learned to live with it . ” @ space code : I usually find it helpful to jot down my main points first and then fill in the details .
That seems to result in more of my drafts making it to the front page of my blog .

Act and you shall have dinner .
Think and you shall be dinner . <— nice quote lol i better start acting rather den thinking lol !

I sometimes even find myself stuck in this pattern of thinking about my blog and how I can improve it , when I should be out there writing posts , networking , and commenting on sites like this one !

Great post !

Well I just started my blog today and I really needed this verbal kick in the butt ; trying to overcome my jitters .
Live long and prosper !
space code I agree with the first point .
My blog is full of drafts that I never finish writing because I keep thinking about what to write when I actually already had a rough idea in my mind .
Frank C I prefer Kosh from Babylon 5 , “ Understanding is a three - edged sword . ” and “ The avalanche has already started .
It is too late for the pebbles to vote . ”
Luis Gross Great post !
This was very inspiring Daniel , I honestly feel like writing 30 post ’s before morning breaks !
I must say these words cannot be anymore truthful .
Acting and thinking can determine a very different future depending on which one you choose .
Success ? or Failure ?
I ’m going for success !
Joshua Clanton @ Daniel :
Do what I do ; use Netflix ( or something like it ) .
You ’ll be caught up in no time .
Daniel Scocco
Some of these days I need to start watching the episodes again .
Joshua Clanton @ Barbara Ling : DS9 is the best !
I ’m glad I could remind you of it . 🙂
Joshua Clanton
Thanks , Jason !
I definitely agree that acting before thinking has a negative side , but I think people often need to learn to act before they can learn to judge quickly and accurately .
Barbara Ling LOVE THIS POST !!
My favorite reference to Klingons is the following ( from Wiki ) : …. ” With fire and steel did the gods forge the Klingon heart .
So fiercely did it beat , so loud was the sound , that the gods cried out , ‘ On this day we have brought forth the strongest heart in all the heavens .
None can stand before it without trembling at its strength . ’
But then the Klingon heart weakened , its steady rhythm faltered and the gods said , ‘ Why do you weaken so ?
We have made you the strongest in all of creation . ’
And the heart said … ‘ I am alone . ’
And the gods knew that they had erred .
So they went back to their forge and brought forth another heart .
But the second heart beat stronger than the first , and the first was jealous of its power .
Fortunately , the second heart was tempered by wisdom .
‘ If we join together , no force can stop us . ’
And when the two hearts began to beat together , they filled the heavens with a terrible sound .
For the first time , the gods knew fear .
They tried to flee , but it was too late .
The Klingon hearts destroyed the gods who created them and turned the heavens to ashes .
To this very day , no one can oppose the beating of two Klingon hearts . ” DS9 – the ultimate of the Star Trek series .
Thanks for such a great post !

— You bring honor to us all I could n’t agree more with the idea that one should act before thinking sometimes .
That said , it can also get us into a heap of trouble 😛

It was inevitable .
Neocon bloggers , hardly satisfied at the ineffectiveness and lethargy of the antiwar movement , are insinuating a reemergence of the Weather Underground and the SLA after a hooded somebody on a bicycle placed a flash - boom device at a recruitment center located in Times Square .
“ Now the movement has decided to morph into domestic terrorism , ” writes Hot Air , a blog appropriately entitled .
“ Of course , the people responsible will claim that they bombed the office during the night to keep anyone from being hurt .
That ’s exactly the same kind of rationalization that people like the Weather Underground and the SLA used at first , anyway — that terrorism was justified by their politics .
In fact , a few like William Ayers and Bernadette Dohrn still claim that . ”
Hot Air looks backward at the late 60s and early 70s when COINTELPRO agents provocateurs gave the antiwar movement a bad name .
His leap in logic is reminiscent of the tripe put out by the neocon New York Post prior to the last Republican National Convention .
“ A number of extremists with ties to the 1970s radical Weather Underground have recently been released from prison and are in New York preparing to wreak havoc during the Republican National Convention , The Post has learned , ” the Post prattled .
“ A top - level source with extensive knowledge of police plans would n’t disclose the names of the aging rabble - rousers but said a handful of them are already here and will play a behind - the - scenes role in attempting to disrupt the GOP gala . ”
It was pure nonsense , as nothing happened at the convention , nothing of the sort feverishly dreamed up by neocons , that is .
Instead , 1,800 protesters were arrested , 1,700 of them for no reason at all except to strike fear into the hearts of people who believe the First Amendment of the Constitution means what it says .
In fact , the NYPD had planned in advance to arrest hundreds of people and even gave their plan an appropriate name : Operation Overlord II , a reference to the Allied invasion of Normandy , which was codenamed Overlord .
In New York during the RNC , the cops – at the behest of the real overlords — invaded the First Amendment .
Mr. fetid Hot Air cites a blog entry by Catherine Moy on Melanie Morgan ’s blog .
“ Attacks against military recruiters and their offices are growing around the United States , spurred by anti-American anarchists who thrash the centers , assault and batter people , and intimidate those who want to serve their country , ” writes Moy .
“ Though they pride themselves on being “ anarchists , ” these groups are well organized and disciplined in their attacks .
Once an action begins , the fervor of destruction feeds on itself and others join in .
The events are not unlike attacks from packs of rabid dogs . ”
Above : Bernardine Dohrn .
Hot Air looks backward at the late 60s and early 70s when COINTELPRO agents provocateurs gave the antiwar movement a bad name
Maybe rabid dogs of the sort that work for the police ?
Recall police agents provocateurs stirring up trouble in Montebello last year , or the violent antics of police organized “ black bloc ” anarchists during the WTO protests in Seattle back in 1999 and the fabrication of evidence by police during the WTO protests in Genoa 2001 in order to justify attacks on peaceful anti-globalist protesters who were portrayed as dangerous anarchists .
In November , 2003 , during a protest against the Free Trade Area of Americas in Miami , especially egregious police provocateuring was on parade , so much so the United Steelworkers of America called for a congressional investigation .
“ The globalist elite have demonstratively used provocateuring to demonize all demonstrators attempting to expose their criminality , ” writes Steve Watson , but Hot Air , Catherine Moy , and the neocons will have nothing of it .
“ The Code Pink protesters who throw paint , rocks , and the unknown terrorists who throw bombs want to disarm the nation while it ’s under attack by radical jihadists , and at the same time want to stop young men and women from exercisig ( sic ) their own choices , ” rants Hot Air .
“ Since the Code Pink contingent and the nutcases who throw bombs can’t possibly win through the democratic process , they want to engage in intimidation — and now terrorism — to frighten people into acquiescence . ”
Huh ?
Code Pink throwing bombs ?
In fact , Code Pink is non-violent — that is unless you consider protesting in front of a United States Marine Corps Officer Selection Office located in Downtown Berkeley , California , as violence .
In February , a scuffle between The World Ca n’t Wait protesters and police erupted outside of the office and two people were arrested .
No bombs or rocks were thrown .
But then Hot Air and the neocons have a long and sordid tradition of lies , fabrication , and deception to uphold .
No doubt , as well , the neocons consider Henry David Thoreau , Martin Luther King , Jr. , Mohandas Gandhi , and Rosa Parks anarchists and terrorists , too .
Code Pink will not throw rocks or bombs , that is not unless the MacArthur Foundation and billionaire financier George Soros want them to .
But then , for neocons such as the former Marxist David Horowitz , George Soros is a “ liberal ” and , who knows , probably an anarchist to boot .
In Bushzarro world , the water gets muddy pretty darn fast .
A blogger going by the handle “ Confederate Yankee ” is a bit more reasonable , but not much .
“ This was an act of domestic terrorism , ” he writes .
“ I do not , however , feel comfortable blaming any specific anti-war group for this act , or even pinning this as an anti-war act at this point in time … .
Whoever built this bomb may have sympathies towards the anti-war movement and / or anti-military feelings , but I would be surprised to find them affiliated officially with any specific anti-war or anti-military group , and would be even more surprised if anyone inside one of these groups had advance knowledge of the attack . ”
In order to not come off as sounding too complementary , however , he notes that on March 6 , 1970 , “ members of the radical activist group known as the Weather Underground , Diana Oughton , Ted Gold and Terry Robbins , blew themselves straight to hell when the bomb they were building , which was intended to blow up a dance at Fort Dix , exploded in an otherwise quiet New York neighborhood . ”
Of course , neocon exuberance would not be complete without the diva of internment camps weighing in .
“ It has been happening for years — the targeting of military recruiting stations .
It happened again this morning , ” writes occasional Faux News commentator Michelle Malkin , who means to say people have protested against military recruitment for years , mostly sans violence , that is unless you consider minor vandalism — for instance , red paint splashed on an ROTC station in North Carolina and on an Army recruiting station near the University of Minnesota — as violence .
Nothing short of complete acquiescence – or , as Bill O’Reilly would have it , shutting up – works for the neocons .
Point is , the neocon cheerleaders and wannabes — who do n’t give a whit about the U.S. military , otherwise they would n’t support sending them into the Iraqi meat grinder — love this sort of stuff , as it gives them reason to rant and rave about those of us who consider the Iraq “ war ” a crime .
For the neocons and their blogger sycophants , there is no difference between the Weather Underground , the SLA , and the antiwar movement , never mind the clownish absurdity of such statements .
It is simply grist for their demented propaganda mill , cranking out excuses for war crimes and mass murder .

Tutti pazzi per Mara .
La neoministra delle Pari Opportunità , un passato da starlette , ha colpito la stampa straniera .
E non solo .
Ieri il Bild tedesco l'ha definita : " La ministra più bella del mondo " .
Il Financial Times ha pubblicato una grande foto del neoministro .
Lei , chiamata in causa , replica secca : " Non mi occupo di questa cose " .
Ma in Rete le foto del suo calendario fatto per Max , qualche anno fa , spopolano .
Eccole .
So you 're thinking , " April 1st ... is n't that already supposed to be April Fool 's Day ? "
Yes — and that will provide the ideal cover for celebrating Amazing Breakthrough Day .
As I argued in " The Beauty of Settled Science " , it is a major problem that media coverage of science focuses only on breaking news .
Breaking news , in science , occurs at the furthest fringes of the scientific frontier , which means that the new discovery is often :
Controversial
Supported by only one experiment
Way the heck more complicated than an ordinary mortal can handle , and requiring lots of prerequisite science to understand , which is why it was n't solved three centuries ago
Later shown to be wrong
People never get to see the solid stuff , let alone the understandable stuff , because it is n't breaking news .
On Amazing Breakthrough Day , I propose , journalists who really care about science can report — under the protective cover of April 1st — such important but neglected science stories as :
BOATS EXPLAINED : Centuries - Old Problem Solved By Bathtub Nudist
YOU SHALL NOT CROSS ! Königsberg Tourists ' Hopes Dashed
ARE YOUR LUNGS ON FIRE ?
Link Between Respiration And Combustion Gains Acceptance Among Scientists
Note that every one of these headlines are true — they describe events that did , in fact , happen .
They just did n't happen yesterday .
There have been many humanly understandable amazing breakthroughs in the history of science , which can be understood without a PhD or even BSc .
The operative word here is history .
Think of Archimedes 's " Eureka ! " when he understood the relation between the water a ship displaces , and the reason the ship floats .
This is far enough back in scientific history that you do n't need to know 50 other discoveries to understand the theory ; it can be explained in a couple of graphs ; anyone can see how it 's useful ; and the confirming experiments can be duplicated in your own bathtub .
Modern science is built on discoveries built on discoveries built on discoveries and so on all the way back to Archimedes .
Reporting science only as breaking news is like wandering into a movie 3/4ths of the way through , writing a story about " Bloody - handed man kisses girl holding gun ! " and wandering back out again .
And if your editor says , " Oh , but our readers wo n't be interested in that — "
Then point out that Reddit and Digg do n't link only to breaking news .
They also link to short webpages that give good explanations of old science .
Readers vote it up , and that should tell you something .
Explain that if your newspaper does n't change to look more like Reddit , you 'll have to start selling drugs to make payroll .
Editors love to hear that sort of thing , right ?
On the Internet , a good new explanation of old science is news and it spreads like news .
Why could n't the science sections of newspapers work the same way ?
Why is n't a new explanation worth reporting on ?
But all this is too visionary for a first step .
For now , let 's just see if any journalists out there pick up on Amazing Breakthrough Day , where you report on some understandable science breakthrough as though it had just occurred .
April 1st .
Put it on your calendar .

Izzy Miyagh has been looking for a home for three years
The drop in house prices might be a disaster for many home - owners , but some first - time buyers see it as a godsend .
Left behind by more than a decade of soaring property values , thousands of young workers look to a slump as their only hope of securing an affordable mortgage .
The Bank of England may have warned that the credit crunch will squeeze the availability of home loans .
But with prices falling by 2.5 % in March 2008 - the biggest monthly decline since September 1992 - plenty are optimistic that their time may be about to come .
' Ca n't wait '
One frustrated young professional is 34 - year - old Izzy Miyaghi from Birmingham .
He has been trying to get his feet on the first rung of the property ladder for three years .
But Izzy 's masters degree and £ 28,000 - a- year job as a community education outreach officer have not helped him achieve his ambition .
With a typical flat in his area selling for £ 120,000 , he believes only a housing recession will help him .
" I ca n't wait for the crash , " he says .
" Bring it on .
" People talk about the crisis in the property market .
But the real crisis is that so many people can't afford a home of their own .
" I 'm not looking for an investment .
I 'm looking for somewhere to live .
The sooner a correction comes along , the better . "
Of course , many first - timers feel guilty about hoping for a slump .
English teacher Heidi McFadden , 29 , from Colchester , Essex , is old enough to remember the repossessions and negative equity that followed the crash in the early 1990s .
It 's incredibly difficult to find somewhere
Sebastian Clarke
But unable to find anywhere affordable on her £ 30,000 - a- year wage packet , she admits that doom - and - gloom headlines are giving her hope .
" Morally , I feel bad about wanting it because I know people will end up on the street , " she says .
" But an entire generation of young professionals has been unable to get on the housing ladder as a direct result of immoral lending .
" I do n't want to pay more than three times my salary , because any more is too risky , but that wo n't get me anywhere round here . "
Nor are these sentiments confined to south - east England and the cities .
Sebastian Clarke , 25 , from Aberystwyth , Ceredigion , is an IT worker on about £ 20,000 a year , who is also finding it tough to buy his own home .
He and his fiancee were offered a mortgage of £ 96,000 - but most of the two - bedroom houses in the area go for between £ 160,000 and £ 170,000 .
HAVE YOUR SAY
The only people who lose are very recent first time buyers and investors Adrian Hatherall , London
And even property which is well above their price bracket would make the keenest DIY enthusiast shudder .
" I went to see a one - bedroom cottage in the country - it had no water , no electricity , no kitchen , no bathroom , no drainage and no sewerage , " Sebastian says .
" The asking price was £ 125,000 .

Gallup Daily : Obama Pulls Ahead of Clinton , 50 % to 43 % Both Democrats now lead McCain in fall ballots
PRINCETON , NJ --
For the first time in nearly three weeks , the statistical tie between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in Gallup Poll Daily tracking of national Democratic preferences has been broken , with Obama now ahead by seven percentage points , 50 % to 43 % .
This is based on national interviews with Democratic voters from May 9 - 11 .
Importantly , Obama has led Clinton in each individual day of polling included in today 's three - day rolling average , as well as the two days prior to that .
Such stability was absent from the race for the past several weeks when Clinton and Obama often traded nightly leads in Gallup Poll Daily tracking and , as a result , neither candidate could achieve a significant leg up over the other in national preferences .
( To view the complete trend since Jan. 3 , 2008 , click here . )
Although Obama did not achieve an immediate bounce in national Democratic support after last week 's primary elections in Indiana and North Carolina , it could be that the subsequent political punditry , proclaiming the Clinton campaign is effectively over , is affecting voters .
With Clinton continuing to campaign hard , concerns about what the protracted Clinton - Obama battle could do to the party 's chances of beating probable Republican presidential nominee , John McCain , in the fall , continue to be raised .
However , according to Gallup Poll Daily tracking from May 7 - 11 , both Democratic candidates are now beating McCain among national registered voters in Gallup Poll Daily trial heats for the fall election .
Obama leads McCain by four points , 47 % to 43 % .
Clinton leads McCain by five points , 49 % to 44 % .
Both leads represent the candidates ' highest margins over McCain , to date , since Gallup began tracking the general election ballots in early March .

US financial crisis fuels social unrest
Workers protest rising prices in UAE , Egypt
By Joe Kay
22 March 2008
The global financial crisis that has its origins in US credit markets is heightening social tensions around the world .
This week , social unrest exploded to the surface in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , where as many as 1,500 workers staged protests against inflation and unpaid wages .
Inflation is becoming a major source of discontent throughout the Middle East and Asia , particularly in countries whose currency is pegged to the US dollar , including most of the oil - rich states in the Persian Gulf .
In non-oil - exporting countries , such as Egypt , where the currency is not linked to the dollar , rising import prices and shortages of key goods such as bread have also provoked protests .
All of these countries are politically unstable and characterized by the most acute social contradictions .
Their regimes are authoritarian , either semi-feudal sheikdoms or military - dominated dictatorships controlled by narrow ruling elites .
A large majority of their populations consist of brutally exploited workers and peasants .
In many cases , the workers are mostly immigrants with no civil rights .
Many of these repressive regimes sit atop economies that are being at once transformed and destabilized by an influx of oil wealth , largely unplanned economic expansion — whose benefits go almost exclusively to the ruling elites — and a rapid growth in the working class .
The potential for social and political upheaval is enormous .
According to the UAE ’s official news agency , WAM , 1,500 striking workers participated in demonstrations on Tuesday in the emirate of Sharjah , the third largest emirate in the UAE .
The workers are employed by Drake & Scull , an engineering contractor owned by the US - based Emcor Group .
WAM reported that the protest turned violent , with workers burning part of an office building and overturning or burning several cars and buses owned by the company .
Police said that several officers were attacked , but there is no independent confirmation of this claim .
The news service ArabianBusiness.com reported that workers were complaining of unpaid wages .
The company stated , however , that the main causes of the protest were declining real wages and the falling value of the UAE ’s currency , the dirham .
Like most Gulf States , the UAE relies heavily on immigrant workers who are paid low wages — as little as $ 50 a week — and are denied basic democratic rights , such as the right to demonstrate and unionize .
These workers , many of whom come from South Asia , have provided the labor for a construction boom fueled by an influx of oil money in recent years .
In total , UAE citizens comprise only 15 percent of the population .
The 3 million migrant workers in the UAE make up about 90 percent of the workforce in the private sector .
According to a 2007 report by Human Rights Watch , “ Abuses against migrant workers include nonpayment of wages , extended working hours without overtime compensation , unsafe working environments resulting in deaths and injuries , squalid living conditions in labor camps , and withholding of passports and travel documents . ”
Several factors have combined in recent months to severely undercut the already poor living standards of migrant workers .
The dirham is pegged to the US dollar , which has lost much of its value .
At the same time , except for oil , most of the goods in UAE and the other Gulf States are imported from Europe and other countries whose currencies are appreciating against the dollar .
This means that imports are becoming much more expensive .
Global prices for basic commodities have risen sharply , driven in part by speculation .
The rising cost of imports is exacerbating inflationary pressures that have been generated by the construction boom .
Under normal conditions , the central banks in these countries would increase interest rates to curb inflation .
However , in order to keep their currencies pegged to the US dollar , they have been forced to follow the US Federal Reserve in cutting interest rates , adding to inflation .
The Fed has cut rates repeatedly over the past several months — including by 75 basis points on Tuesday — in an effort to inject more cash into the financial markets and end a sharp contraction in credit markets .
This week , central banks in the UAE , Saudi Arabia , and Bahrain all followed suit .
Overall inflation in the UAE last year was about 10 percent .
However , food price inflation is estimated to be much higher .
According to the Emirates Consumer Protection Society , food inflation in 2007 was 27 percent , and the organization estimates that inflation next year could rise to 40 percent .
Many of the workers have taken jobs in the UAE in order to provide for their families at home .
As the value of the dirham has dropped relative to other currencies , including the Indian rupee , the remittances sent back have lost value .
To make matters even worse , inflation in India and other South Asian countries has jumped sharply as well , compounding the impact of lower remittances .
The UAE government has responded to the protests with promises of a quick crackdown , including arrests and deportations .
At least 30 workers were arrested on Tuesday .
UAE officials have demanded that workers present their grievances through bogus labor resolution bodies .
The uprising in Sharjah followed protests by thousands of workers at construction facilities last fall in Dubai , the largest of the emirates in the UAE by population .
A court recently sentenced 45 Indian construction workers to six months in jail and deportation for their role in the protests .
The Gulf States have traditionally pegged their currencies to the dollar because oil is priced in dollars on the international market .
There have been some calls within ruling circles in these countries for removing the link to the dollar in order to deal with inflation .
However , there has been intense pressure from the US not to do this , for fear that it would precipitate a run on the dollar and threaten the status of the US currency as the world reserve currency .
A move by the Gulf States away from the dollar would be particularly significant due to the critical role of oil on world markets .
Last year , Kuwait became the first Gulf State to remove the dollar peg , and Qatar may follow soon .
Qatar announced on Thursday that it would put off a decision on its interest rates until at least Sunday , signaling that it may decide to remove the dollar peg .
Kuwait did not change its rates in response to the Fed move .
The UAE has decided not to follow Kuwait , at least for now .
According to a March 17 Bloomberg report , citing an unnamed UAE Central Bank official , “ US Embassy officials last week told [ UAE ] central bank Governor Sultan Bin Nasser al - Suwaidi of their concern about reports that the sheikhdom may drop the [ dollar ] peg . ”
In response , UAE officials pledged to maintain the peg at least through the end of this year .
The Gulf monarchies , including Saudi Arabia and the UAE , are heavily dependent on American imperialism for military and political backing .
US Vice President Dick Cheney met with Saudi King Abdullah on Friday , and the economic and financial crisis was no doubt high on the list of discussion topics , next to US plans for possible military action against Iran .
The Saudi sheikhdom , which has the closest ties to the US , has so far sought to pressure the other Gulf States to refrain from moving against the dollar .
In other countries in the Middle East , Asia , and Africa , inflation is becoming a major problem as well .
In Egypt , attempts by the government to ration subsidized bread have produced long lines and protests .
World wheat prices have more than tripled since last summer , and Egypt ’s working poor depend upon subsidized bread to survive .
Egypt is one of the world ’s largest wheat importers , and the rise in prices is placing strains on government coffers .
The protests have rattled the government of President Hosni Mubarak , who called on the Egyptian army to begin producing bread for commercial use .
Social explosions from rising bread prices are not unknown in Egypt .
In 1977 , hundreds of thousands of protesters demanded that then - President Anwar Sadat reverse plans to lift bread subsidies .
Similar conditions prevail throughout the region .
A recent survey of Jordanians found that 85 percent of the population chose high prices and living costs as the most important problem .
Inflation has shot up in China , Hong Kong , Vietnam , India , South Africa , Iran , and a host of other countries .
These conditions are adding up to an explosive situation , of which the protests in the UAE and Egypt are only the first signs .
Social tensions are rising in every country .
As only the latest example , millions of workers in Greece have begun a strike action to protest cuts in pensions and an increase in the retirement age .
The financial crisis , the worst since the 1930s , is confronting the population of the entire world with recession or worse .
In response to an economic disaster of its own making , the ruling elite of the US and every other country will seek to place the burden of the crisis on the backs of the international working class .
They lived in a typical suburban neighborhood with picket fences that resembled Nancy Kerrigan 's teeth .
He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience , like a guy who went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it .
She caught your eye like one of those pointy hook latches that used to dangle from screen doors and would fly up whenever you banged the door open again .
The little boat gently drifted across the pond exactly the way a bowling ball would n't .
McBride fell 12 stories , hitting the pavement like a Hefty Bag filled with vegetable soup .
From the attic came an unearthly howl .
The whole scene had an eerie , surreal quality , like when you 're on vacation in another city and " Jeopardy " comes on at 7 pm instead of 7:30 .
Her hair glistened in the rain like nose hair after a sneeze .
Her eyes were like two brown circles with big black dots in the center .
Bob was as perplexed as a hacker who means to access T:\flw.quid55328.com \aaakk / ch@ung but gets T:\flw.quidaaak / ch@ng by mistake .
He was as tall as a six - foot three - inch tree .
The hailstones leaped from the pavement , just like maggots when you fry them in hot grease .
Her date was pleasant enough , but she knew that if her life was a movie this guy would be burried in the credits as something like " Second Tall Man . "
Long separated by cruel fate , the star - crossed lovers raced across the grassy field toward each other like two freight trains , one having left Cleveland at 6:36 pm traveling at 55 mph , the other from Topeka at 4:19 pm at a speed of 35 mph .
The politician was gone but unnoticed , like the period after the Dr. on a Dr. Pepper can .
John and Mary had never met .
They were like two hummingbirds who had also never met .
The thunder was ominous - sounding , much like the sound of a thin sheet of metal being shaken backstage during the storm scene in a play .
His thoughts tumbled in his head , making and breaking alliances like underpants in a drier without " Cling - Free . "
The red brick wall was the color of a brick - red crayola crayon .
A Swedish hip - hop artist who the IFPI used as leverage in their legal battle against The Pirate Bay , wants nothing to do with the case .
Without consultation , the IFPI were claiming damages on his behalf from The Pirate Bay , even though they do n't even own the rights to his music .
Like most of the music industry associations around the world , the IFPI claims to champion the cause of the artist , by promoting them and protecting their interests .
One such artist is Max Peezay , a Swedish hip - hop artist who is mentioned in the IFPI legal case against The Pirate Bay .
It ’s claimed that money was lost as a result of Max ’s music being available for download via the site .
The thing is , the CEO of the IFPI in Sweden , Lars Gustafsson , never asked Max Peezay if he wanted to be used in the case against The Pirate Bay .
If he had , he might ’ve been clear on Max ’s views on this matter , in that he wants nothing to do with it .
Brokep of The Pirate Bay told TorrentFreak : “ He ’s pro-file sharing .
Some of his lyrics already state that .
And he ’s not willing to feel like a sell - out to please Ifpi – who never actually asked him for his permission to sue in his name . ”
Characteristically over - stepping the mark , the IFPI forgot a little detail when putting Max Peezay forward in The Pirate Bay case says Brokep : “ In fact , they [ IFPI ] did n’t even own the rights to his music . ”
According to a SVD report , due to the refusal of Max to being involved in the case , the IFPI have reduced the amount of money they are claiming from The Pirate Bay by roughly 12,000 EUR ( apprx $ 19,000 ) , which unfortunately wo n’t reduce the $ 2.5 m total claim by much .
Brokep has a message for all of the other pro-filesharing artists :
“ What we ’re waiting for now is all of those other artists to speak up as well .
We know many of the artists actually put up their albums on The Pirate Bay themselves – and we ’re really happy about that !
And we know that you do n’t like to be abused by the record labels in this farce .
So we want you to show your support .
Not necessarily for TPB but for your fans .
It ’s an important message to send to the community . ”
The Pirate Bay case will generate huge amounts of publicity when it kicks into high gear so it ’ll be interesting to see where the artists really stand on this issue and who they align themselves with , the IFPI – or the public .

Escaping volcanic gasses are channeled through a network of ceramic pipes , resulting in condensation of molten sulfur .
This sulphur trickles out of the end of the pipes , solidifying nearby as it cools further .
The miners then break up the sulphur deposits and carry them out of the crater to a nearby sugar refinery .
Due to unprotected exposure to volcanic gases and loads of up to 100kg per trip , the life expectancy of the miners is low .
Most miners make this journey twice a day .
Serious injuries , especially chest and eye problems , are common but these men accept this form of martyrdom with resignation .
The miner there get paid around $ 5 per day which is twice better daily income what they could earn on the coffee plantations .
A continuous upwelling of sulfur from fumaroles at the level of the lake is the basis of a thriving enterprise .
Pure hot red sulfur , oozing out of hissing fissures , turns bright yellow as it dries .
It ’s then broken up into big chunks with hammers and loaded into baskets .
Typical loads range from 70 – 100 kilograms , and must be carried to the crater rim approximately 200 meters above before being carried several kilometers down the mountain .
At the end of the day , nine to 12 tons of sulfur have been delivered .
A natural source of sulfuric acid , the sulfur is used by oil refineries and in the production of detergents and fertilizers .
But miners wo n't see the benefits .
They 'll just risk their lives again and again , working without any type of protection or security , only to earn some money to feed their families .

Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama had some very strong things to say to the Building Trades National Legislative Conference today .
First Obama took John McCain to task for offering four more years of George W. Bush .
“ Now , John McCain seems to think the Bush years have been pretty good because he ’s offering more of the same .
And today ’s a good reminder of that because it ’s Tax Day .
This is supposed to be a day when we pay what we owe to the government .
But it ’s become a day when George Bush ’s Washington rewards its friends on Wall Street . ”
Obama stated what he thinks should be done about the economy .
“ We need to roll back the Bush - McCain tax cuts and invest in things like health care that are really important .
Instead of giving tax breaks to the wealthy who do n’t need them and were n’t even asking for them , we should be putting a middle class tax cut into the pockets of working families .
That ’s why I ’m the only candidate in this race who ’s proposed a tax cut that would save our families $ 1,000 a year , and eliminate income taxes entirely for seniors making less than $ 50,000 . ”

This is what he said later about unions , “ It ’s time we had a President who did n’t choke saying the word “ union . ”
It ’s time we had a Democratic nominee who did n’t choke saying the word “ union . ”
We need to strengthen our unions by letting them do what they do best – organize our workers .
If a majority of workers want a union , they should get a union .
And that is why I ’ll fight for and why I intend to sign the Employee Free Choice
Act when it lands on my desk in the White House .
( This was a nice little shot at Bush , McCain , and Clinton ) .
Obama had some words for the people who criticize his economic plan as being too expensive , “ Now , I know some will say we ca n’t afford all this .
But it seems to me – if we can spend $ 10 billion a month rebuilding Iraq , we can spend $ 15 billion a year in our own country to create jobs and strengthen the long - term competitiveness of our economy . ”
With these remarks today , Obama reaffirmed why the Democratic Party should make him their nominee .
Unlike Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama does n’t run from the word liberal .
It has been over 25 years , since this country had a truly left leaning president , and now more than ever , we need a president will undo the damage that our once great nation has suffered over the past eight years .
Obama is still green on the national stage , which explains his poor usage of terms like “ bitter ” , and “ cling ” , but political talent like his comes along maybe once a generation .
I think that as a nation we would regret passing him up .

Obama also has news for McCain
Obama departed from his regular stump speech today in Columbus to respond to John McCain .
" John McCain may like to say he wants to follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of Hell , but so far all he ’s done is follow George Bush into a misguided war in Iraq , " he said .
Obama was responding , incredulously , to McCain 's suggestion that he 's unaware of the presence of Al Qaeda in Iraq , which the Arizona Senator said earlier today was apparently " news " to Obama at last night 's debate .
" McCain thought that he could make a clever point by saying , ' Well let me give you some news , Barack , Al Qaeda is in Iraq , ' like I was n’t reading the papers , like did n’t know what was going on . "
Obama said , leaning into his developing McCain impression .
He then described the context -- a hypothetical question from Tim Russert -- and said , " First of all , I do know Al Qaeda is in Iraq , and that ’s why I said we should continue to strike Al Qaeda targets . "
" I have some news for John McCain , " Obama continued , " That ’s there was no Al Qaeda in Iraq until George Bush and John McCain " began the Iraq war , he said .
" They took their eye off the people who really were responsible for 9/11 , " he said .
This is the core terrain of an Obama - McCain general election : McCain attacks
Obama 's readiness to lead ; Obama links him , Bush , and the war .

Mildred Loving , a black woman whose anger over being banished from Virginia for marrying a white man led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling overturning state miscegenation laws , died on May 2 at her home in Central Point , Va .
She was 68 .
Peggy Fortune , her daughter , said the cause was pneumonia .
The Supreme Court ruling , in 1967 , struck down the last group of segregation laws to remain on the books — those requiring separation of the races in marriage .
The ruling was unanimous , its opinion written by Chief Justice Earl Warren , who in 1954 wrote the court ’s opinion in Brown v. Board of Education , declaring segregated public schools unconstitutional .
In Loving v. Virginia , Warren wrote that miscegenation laws violated the Constitution ’s equal protection clause .
“ We have consistently denied the constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights of citizens on account of race , ” he said .
By their own widely reported accounts , Mrs. Loving and her husband , Richard , were in bed in their modest house in Central Point in the early morning of July 11 , 1958 , five weeks after their wedding , when the county sheriff and two deputies , acting on an anonymous tip , burst into their bedroom and shined flashlights in their eyes .
A threatening voice demanded , “ Who is this woman you ’re sleeping with ? ”
There was a time when Ophelia Owens blamed bad genes for the asthma that spans three generations of her family .
She and her mother both suffer from the potentially deadly malady .
So do the youngest of Owens ' seven children , a pair of bright - eyed , exuberant boys ages 3 and 5 .
Then , last year , Owens and a handful of other Detroit moms with children in the Head Start pre-school program were recruited to participate in an effort involving the University of Michigan and the nonprofit group Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice .
After attending a workshop put on by the group , and hearing that studies have shown that minorities are disproportionately exposed to pollutants , the women were given disposable cameras and asked to take pictures of their surroundings , showing both the good and bad aspects of their environments .
A year ago , the photos were put on display , and the moms were asked to talk about them .
Among the photos was a chilling shot of Owens ' two little boys sitting in a hospital emergency room , masks strapped to their faces as they inhaled medicated mist to relieve the symptoms of an asthma attack .
She and the children all experienced asthma attacks simultaneously , and with only one treatment device — known as a nebulizer — available , the only option was a hectic dash to the emergency room .
By that point , Owens no longer blamed the asthma running through her family on heredity .
The problem , she came to believe , had as its root pollution and not her family tree .
And a prime contributor to the toxic stew that forced her to rush her children to the hospital so that they could continue breathing was the Detroit municipal waste incinerator located about 1.5 miles from her family 's home near Wayne State University .
Elaine Hockman can't tell you whether Owens ' belief is correct .
In fact , the former Wayne State statistician wo n't say the incinerator causes anyone to have asthma .
Nor , for that matter , would she claim the incinerator causes cancer or low birth weights , or low test scores .
What she will tell you with absolute certainty is that there 's a definite correlation between all of those things and incinerators in general , and the Detroit incinerator in particular .
Find an incinerator like the one near the intersection of interstates 94 and 75 in Detroit and you can accurately predict that there will be certain kinds of health problems at rates significantly greater than you would expect to find under normal circumstances .
That is the inescapable conclusion drawn from analysis of the data , says Hockman , who co-authored a peer - reviewed paper published in 1998 in the Journal of Environmental Planning and Management .
John Waffenschmidt , vice president of environmental science and community affairs for Covanta , the company that runs what it prefers to call Detroit 's " waste to energy " facility , has n't read Hockman 's paper , but he questions the relevance it has for Detroit in 2008 .
His company did n't begin operating the plant until 1993 , three years after the state ordered an upgrade in air - pollution - control equipment that cost the city nearly $ 180 million .
" The Detroit facility went through a retrofit that was n't completed until 1995 , " says Waffenschmidt .
" What I find is that there is a tendency for old data to stay alive . "
What Detroit has today , he says , " is a well - performing , modern , waste - to - energy facility . "
" An objective review of all the available emissions data leads to the conclusion that the facility operates well below permitted limits and does not have any negative impact on human health and the environment , " Waffenschmidt says .
Actual emissions of key pollutants such as dioxin , mercury , cadmium and lead are all 50 percent or more below limits allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency , he says .
That may be , counters Hockman , but that does n't mean they are safe .
Hockman became interested in the issue of environmental justice in the late 1980s after being approached by Bunyan Bryant , a University of Michigan professor credited with helping found the environmental justice movement .
Though retired from Wayne State , she continues to work with the University of Michigan 's School of Natural Resources and Environment on environmental justice issues .
Central to that movement is the contention that poor people , especially poor people of color , are the ones most likely to be subjected to a disproportionate share of society 's harmful waste .
Bryant asked if Hockman would help acquire and analyze data to see if there were statistics to substantiate the theory .
What she found when analyzing data for Michigan was startling evidence .
Regarding the Detroit incinerator specifically , Hockman says that neighborhoods around the facility were between 80 percent and 96 percent nonwhite .
Combining U.S. Census data from 1990 and 2000 , she also found these same neighborhoods to be the state 's poorest , with average median household incomes as low as $ 15,300 .
These same areas had asthma rates that were , for the most part , between two and three times what would be considered normal .
The farther away from the incinerator you go , the whiter and more affluent neighborhoods become .
In neighborhoods outside the city , where household incomes were about $ 70,000 a year and the communities almost exclusively white , asthma rates were significantly below normal .
Although not as conclusive as Hockman 's study , research done in 2005 by Brad van Guilder of the nonprofit Ecology Center in Ann Arbor found that children living in areas around the incinerator are hospitalized for asthma- related problems at rates three times the national average .
Waffenschmidt says it is unfair to lay blame for what are essentially problems typically associated with an urban environment at the waste - to - energy facility 's doorstep .
The issue is a complicated one , he explains .
For one thing , the electricity and steam produced at the facility are needed , and if burning garbage were n't producing it , it would have to be replaced by another source such as coal .
And if you take that garbage — the facility processes 800,000 tons of waste annually — to a landfill instead of the incinerator , there will be more pollution spewing from the exhausts of trucks fueled by diesel and traveling long distances to dumps .
He notes , also , that the incinerator is located at the juncture of two interstates .
The amount of pollution coming from the tailpipes idling in rush hour traffic morning and evening is immense .
Likewise , there are many other sources of pollution in the area .
He finds no argument from Hockman on that point .
" The people living around the incinerator are already overburdened with environmental and health problems , " she says .
" They are also the poorest people , with the least amount of resources to fend for themselves and fight against polluters . "

But the sporting festival has already become a PR disaster for the country .
Repression in Tibet and ongoing crackdowns have revealed the extent to which the country remains a police state .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The Bush administration ’s top security officials ignored FBI concerns over the abusive treatment of terrorism suspects , which one agent called “ borderline torture , ” a four - year Justice Department probe found .

The FBI , alarmed by interrogation techniques such as the use of snarling dogs and forced nudity , clashed with the Defense Department and CIA over their use , said the 370 - page report released on Tuesday by the Justice Department ’s inspector general .
Critics say the techniques employed by the CIA and U.S. military in questioning terrorism suspects captured after the September 11 attacks amounted to torture .
FBI agents participated interrogations and still do , but bureau Director Robert Mueller directed agents in 2002 not to participate in coercive questioning , the report said .
The FBI and Justice Department officials raised concerns over the abusive interrogations with the National Security Council , which comprises top security - agency officials , and with officials at the Guantanamo Bay detention center for terrorism suspects .
“ Ultimately , neither the FBI nor the DoJ had a significant impact on the practices of the military with respect to the detainees , ” the report said .
The report quotes an FBI agent as objecting that the CIA ’s interrogation of senior al Qaeda commander Abu Zubaydah was “ borderline torture , ” and said at one point an agent helped care for him in the hospital “ even to the point of cleaning him up after bowel movements . ”
Specific interrogation techniques for Abu Zubaydah were blacked out in the report as classified information , but the CIA has acknowledged he was one of three suspects subjected to “ waterboarding , ” a form of simulated drowning .
‘ FREQUENT FLYER ’
The report cites techniques used in Guantanamo , Afghanistan or Iraq including a “ frequent flyer program ” of sleep disruption , prolonged “ short shackling ” of hands and feet , or wrapping a detainee ’s head in duct tape .
It cited an instance in which a female interrogator at Guantanamo grabbed a detainee ’s genitals and a guard explained her purpose was “ to cause him pain . ”
It also said a U.S. Marine captain questioning suspected September 11 conspirator Mohammed al - Qahtani squatted over a Koran , which provoked Qahtani to lunge at the Marine and the holy book before he was quickly subdued .
The report said Mueller instructed agents in August 2002 , about eight months after interrogations began at Guantanamo Bay , not to participate in joint interrogations using coercion , in keeping with longtime bureau policy .
But the agency gave ineffective guidance on whether abuse should be reported for further investigation , it said .
In 2004 agents were required to report abusive conduct they suspected was beyond the authority of the interrogator .
But agents told Justice Department investigators they often did not know what techniques the military authorized .
The report also said there are “ significant and unresolved ” problems with the FBI ’s continued involvement in interrogations of prisoners who have been interviewed by the CIA , which has fewer restraints on interrogation techniques .
Mueller said last week the FBI is still helping to get information from detainees and prepare terrorism cases against suspects at Guantanamo Bay , despite differences with the CIA over interrogation techniques .
He said the agency continues to follow its guidelines .
“ The policy of the bureau ... is not to use coercion , ” he said .
The Justice Department investigators surveyed about 1,000 FBI agents for the report and interviewed more than 230 witnesses .
Bill Clinton defends Bosnia remarks
Former President Bill Clinton said his wife asked him to stop talking about her trip to Bosnia .
Clinton told reporters in Indiana Friday , " Hillary called me and said ' You do n't remember this .
You were n't there , let me handle it . '
I said , ' Yes ma'am . ' "

On Thursday , the former president gave a passionate defense of his wife ’s claim about “ landing under sniper fire ” — just as the damaging controversy was dying down .
Bill Clinton said the news media treated her like she had “ robbed a bank ” and claimed she was experiencing end - of - day fatigue , even though she had made the claim in morning speeches .
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) acknowledged two weeks ago that she “ misspoke ” and “ made a mistake ” in her overly vivid account of the 1996 landing in Tuzla , Bosnia , during a goodwill mission as first lady .
Video of a tranquil arrival ceremony refuted the claim , and her comments hurt her struggling campaign by reviving questions about her candor .
On Thursday he revived the issue by claiming the comments were true during a “ Solutions for America ” campaign event in at Boonville High School in Boonville , Ind .
Here are his comments , recorded by networks and reported by CBS News :
" You know , I got tickled the other day .
A lot of the way this whole campaign has been covered has amused me .
But there was a lot of fulminating because Hillary , one time late at night when she was exhausted , misstated — and immediately apologized for it — what happened to her in Bosnia in 1995 [ sic ] .
Did y'all see all that ?
Oh , they blew it up .
" Let me just tell you .
The president of Bosnia and General Wesley Clark – who was there making peace where we'd lost three peacekeepers , who had to ride on a dangerous mountain road because it was too dangerous to go the regular , safe way — both defended her , because they pointed out that when her plane landed in Bosnia , she had to go up to the bulletproof part of the plane , in the front .
Everybody else had to put their flak jackets underneath the seat in case they got shot at .
And everywhere they went , they were covered by Apache helicopters .
So they just abbreviated the arrival ceremony .
" Now I say that because what really has mattered is that , even then , she was interested in our troops .
And I think she was the first first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt to go into a combat zone .
And you woulda thought , you know , that she 'd robbed a bank the way they carried on about this .
And some of them , when they 're 60 , they 'll forget something when they 're tired at 11 at night , too . ”
CBS News producer Ryan Corsaro , who covers Sen. Clinton , reports she made the claim in mid-morning on St. Patrick ’s Day .
CBS also has aired videotape of the senator making the remark on at least two other occasions .
The Eleanor Roosevelt claim also has been questioned , since Pat Nixon traveled to Vietnam in 1969 .
Indiana holds its Democratic primary on May 6 .
So when will the National Audubon Society learn whether its Sabal Palm sanctuary winds up south of the new border ?
“ I could n’t tell you a specific date , ” Mr. Knocke said .
“ But there should be no uncertainty about how quickly we want to move . ”
Put yourself , then , in the dusty shoes of Jimmy Paz , 66 , the weathered manager of Sabal Palm .
At the moment he is sitting at a picnic bench outside the modest visitors center , trying to speak above some chattering chachalacas feeding on grapefruit rinds .
Now and then he interrupts himself to point out the iridescent brilliance of a green jay , or to ask passing birders where they are from .
Montana , a few say .
California , say others .
Mr. Paz , a native of not just Brownsville but “ beautiful Brownsville , ” knows the area and its rhythms .
He says the Fence would create a twilight zone out of a swath of distinctive American soil , disrupt and damage wildlife and have the opposite of the intended effect : it will be the birders and other tourists  not the illegal immigrants  who stop coming .
It may also put him out of a job .
“ It would be like putting a fence around Central Park , ” he said .
Mr. Paz remembers cycling as a boy to the “ palm jungle ” along the Rio to re-enact scenes from the Tarzan movies he had just seen at the Queen Theatre in downtown beautiful Brownsville .
After a decade in the Army , he returned to hold a series of jobs , including police officer and windshield repairman , while the Audubon Society acquired parcels of that jungle to create a sanctuary to be called Sabal Palm , after the stocky palm trees of the Rio Grande valley .
Ten years ago he became manager of the very property where he once imitated Johnny Weissmuller  property that sits roughly between a bio - diverse preserve owned by the Nature Conservancy of Texas and a swath of land restored by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service .
Combined , Eden .
Image
Mr. Paz has come to know those who frequent this sanctuary : the buff - bellied hummingbirds , the long - billed thrashers , the ever - prowling Border Patrol agents , the river - wet visitors from Mexico , passing through .
Driving the grounds in his pickup truck , he points to a telltale inflatable tube , discarded at river ’s edge .
As the presidential campaign lurches deeper into the netherworld of attack politics , the Democratic Party is becoming dangerously polarized .
Hillary Clinton's and Barack Obama 's supporters increasingly say they would n't be happy with the opposing candidate as their nominee , and the two rivals feel free to bash each other more than ever .
Obama got back on the winning track by capturing the Wyoming caucuses March 8 and then the Mississippi primary March 11 .
He holds a lead of about 130 delegates .
The next big test is scheduled for April 22 in Pennsylvania , where 158 delegates will be awarded and Clinton leads solidly in the polls .
The next several weeks will give the candidates a lengthy period to raise money , refine their messages , and zero in on each other .
They are losing no time on all fronts .
The latest dust - up focused on former Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York , a supporter of Clinton , member of her finance committee , and the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984 .
She told the Daily Breeze of Torrance , Calif . : " If Obama was a white man , he would not be in this position .
And if he was a woman ( of any color ) , he would not be in this position .
He happens to be very lucky to be who he is . "
After Obama called her remarks absurd , Ferraro added fuel to the fire .
" I really think they 're attacking me because I 'm white , " she said , contending later that her remarks were being unfairly " spun by the Obama campaign as racist . "
Amid saturation media coverage , Ferraro resigned from Clinton 's campaign , telling nbc News she wanted " to get this off the news . "
Ferraro is n't the first presidential surrogate or adviser to take a fall this political season .
Scrutiny of everyone representing the candidates has greatly increased , and criticism has mounted as each side seeks even the slightest advantage .
Samantha Power , an Obama foreign - policy adviser , called Clinton " a monster " and resigned under pressure .
Before the New Hampshire primary , Bill Shaheen , a prominent Clinton backer in New Hampshire and husband of Senate candidate Jeanne Shaheen , left Clinton 's campaign after suggesting that the Republicans would pounce on Obama 's admitted adolescent use of drugs if he were the Democratic nominee .
But it is the race issue that has deeply unsettled the Democratic contest and widened the troubling rift .
In Mississippi , for example , Obama won 90 percent of the black vote and only one quarter of the white vote , a racial pattern that has persisted in several southern states .
In other parts of the country , where Obama 's share of the white vote has been much larger , racial divisions have not been as pronounced .
Dead heat .
With 10 nominating contests left , including primaries in Indiana and North Carolina May 6 and West Virginia May 13 , it 's unlikely that either candidate can reach the 2,025 delegates needed for the nomination .
About 800 " superdelegates " — elected officials , party leaders , and activists — could decide the outcome .
They can vote however they want and are n't bound by the results of the primaries and caucuses .
Many are holding back until they see who wins the most pledged delegates , states , and votes .
Another wild card is what happens to the delegates of Florida and Michigan .
Those states violated party rules by holding their primaries too early , and the Democratic National Committee disqualified all 366 of their combined delegates .
Clinton won both primaries , but Obama 's name was n't on the Michigan ballot , and neither campaigned actively in the two states .
Now party leaders are trying to figure out a way to restore the states ' delegates , possibly holding new primaries by mail , which would cost millions of dollars .
A big sticking point is how to pay for it .
Some Democratic strategists are concerned that , unless things get patched up , the beneficiary will be John McCain , the Republican nominee who can point to disarray among the Democrats and argue that their party is n't able to govern itself , let alone the country .
And the divisions could cause some Democrats to stay home in November if they believe their candidate was treated unfairly .
' YouTube Moments ' Hold Politicians Accountable
from the power - to - the - people dept
Virginia Postrel points out a great story on the way YouTube is changing the dynamics of political debate .
It points out that when Bill Clinton was first running for president in 1992 , the media landscape had relatively few mechanisms for holding politicians accountable for misstatements .
There was only room for so many stories on the nightly news , and so when politicians told white lies , reporters tended to move on before anybody could check the claims for accuracy .
But now that anyone can create a blog post or a YouTube video , politicians ' fibs and gaffes can take on a life of their own , whether it 's Hillary Clinton 's sniper fire , Barack Obama 's " bitter " Pennsylvanians , or John McCain 's " 100 years in Iraq . "
The nightly news does n't always cover these kinds of comments when they happen , but someone in the blogosphere almost always catches them and they then get endlessly reported , debunked , and hashed out online .
And once a clip has generated a lot of heat among bloggers , it can often become a big enough story that mainstream media outlets pick it up again .
While some of these attacks can be nit - picky or taken out of context , on the whole it's a definite improvement in the quality of democratic debate .
With video cameras everywhere and bloggers ready to pounce on any misstatement , politicians have a stronger incentive to tell the truth , and not to talk out of both sides of their mouth .
Meanwhile , USA Today reports that the presidential candidates are raising eye - popping sums of money in small increments via the Internet .
In the first quarter of 2008 , Barack Obama led the pack with $ 129 million in small donations , followed by Hillary Clinton at $ 65 million and John McCain at $ 37 million .
Even John McCain 's fundraising would have been considered a major accomplishment four years ago -- Howard Dean made headlines with $ 15 million in online donations in the third quarter of 2003 , much of it from small donors .
If the trend lasts -- and there are good reasons to think it will -- it will also have a democratizing effect on the political process .
Presidential candidates will be more inclined to pay attention to the priorities of grassroots activists , and comparatively less worried about pleasing insiders capable of raising money in $ 2300 increments .
And of course , these developments are connected .
The rise of blogs , YouTube , and other participatory media has gotten more people engaged and invested in the political debate , which in turn makes them more likely to open their wallets .
Conversely , the fact that blog readers are often campaign contributors gives bloggers real leverage over candidates -- bloggers can punish candidates perceived as not playing fair by directing contributions to their opponents .
All of which is producing a more engaged and accountable political process .
Of course , things are far from perfect , but there are good reasons to think that 21st century politics will be better than politics was in the 20th century .

Homicide or suicide ?
Man 's death a mystery Did S.F. man fatally stab himself , then wash off knife ?
Friends , family say that 's absurd

Man 's death a mystery 1 / 9 Back to Gallery
Early one Saturday morning last June , Hugues de la Plaza was found stabbed to death in his apartment in San Francisco .
At the time , police could n't tell whether the 36 - year - old sound engineer was killed by an intruder or somehow killed himself .
Few people commit suicide by jabbing themselves repeatedly in the chest with a knife , but de la Plaza 's door was locked , there were no signs of a struggle , and a security camera mounted outside his apartment in Hayes Valley saw no one but de la Plaza go through his front door .
His family and friends say police soon told them they were leaning toward concluding it was suicide .
They said investigators speculated that de la Plaza , a dual French and U.S. citizen , had taken drugs that night while at a nightclub , came home and stabbed himself three times with a steak knife .
No bloody knife was found , but the investigators said de la Plaza could have washed one in the sink after fatally wounding himself .
To his friends and family , it was an absurd theory .
De la Plaza was a social animal who loved life and had just gotten a new position at the educational software company LeapFrog .
He had been making plans both for the next day and for several months down the line .
Besides , they said , he turned away at the mere sight of blood .
Then an autopsy found no drugs in de la Plaza 's blood and only a modest amount of alcohol .
Tests showed no traces of blood on the knife found in the sink .
Still , his acquaintances complain , police have n't officially labeled the death a homicide .
' There goes their theory '
" Everything that the police laid out before us , in terms of it being a suicide , has fallen through , " said Melissa Nix , a former girlfriend who has taken the lead in pressing for police to conclude the case was a homicide .
" They were waiting for the drug results , and that did n't show up , " Nix said .
" They were waiting on the knife - there was nothing on the knife .
So there goes their theory .
" It 's crazy .
He bled all over the place , then he has a change of heart and decides to wash the steak knife ? "
Authorities acknowledge that they are no closer to finding out what happened than when they broke down de la Plaza 's locked door and found his body the morning of June 2 .
They had been waiting for the chief medical examiner 's office to determine whether de la Plaza was slain before they ruled officially on whether it was a homicide , but when that report was finally issued in December , it was inconclusive .
" It is strange , and the fact that the ( medical examiner ) could n't make a determination makes it even stranger , " said police spokesman Sgt. Neville Gittens .
De la Plaza 's friends and family have not relied on the police alone .
They hired a private investigator , John Murphy , who says he has interviewed a dozen people , has reviewed the evidence and is certain de la Plaza did not kill himself .
" No way , " he said .
" I see no evidence of a suicide .
Where is the so - called suicide weapon or murder weapon ?
Logically , if you stab yourself , the weapon is at your feet or in your hand . "
In February , the friends complained to the city Police Commission , and last month they filed a complaint with the civilian - run watchdog agency , the Office of Citizen Complaints .
They said the lead inspector on the case , Antonio Casillas , and other investigators were willfully ignoring evidence of a homicide and had conducted an inadequate probe .
" Homicide has refused to call this murder a murder , " Nix , a reporter who covers education for the Sacramento Bee , said in her complaint .
She accused investigators of trying to " spin " the case as a suicide and showing a " cavalier disregard for what they are charged to do : investigate murders . "
Homicide investigators wo n't talk about de la Plaza 's death , referring questions to Gittens , who noted that the case is still open and that police have reached no conclusions .
The French government also has become involved , dispatching an investigator to San Francisco to find out what happened to one of its citizens .
Police know this much :
When de la Plaza was killed , he had just returned to his Linden Street apartment in Hayes Valley from a Friday night with friends at the Underground SF nightclub .
Nightclubbing with friends
Neil Zarama , a co-worker at LeapFrog in Emeryville , said de la Plaza had gone out on a date after work that day and had met up with friends at the club about 10:30 p.m .
" He was great , he was happy , " Zarama said .
At closing time , de la Plaza told Zarama that he was hoping to get together later with a woman he had met .
Zarama said he later learned that the plan had fallen through .
De la Plaza was set to go on a motorcycle ride that Saturday , Zarama said .
And he was making long - term plans as well , talking of a move to Argentina in three months .
Suicide seemed like the last thing on his mind , Zarama said .
" There was nothing like that in his way , at all , " Zarama said .
" He never said anything dark . "
De la Plaza walked the three - quarters of a mile from the club on Haight Street to his home .
A surveillance camera mounted on the front of the building showed him going inside alone at 2:06 a.m. , said Nix , who saw the images .
But there was a side entrance as well that was not covered by a camera .
De la Plaza went on his computer and used it until about 2:38 a.m. , when police believe he was either stabbed or stabbed himself .
Wounded , he went outside his apartment , leaving blood on the doorknob and on the landing rail , then went back inside and locked the door , according to police .
A next - door neighbor reported hearing a commotion but no screaming .
The neighbor , Orion Denley , a concierge at a local hotel , said a loud thud had shaken his wall as he was dozing off .
" Then , as I was listening to noises , I heard ( de la Plaza 's ) door open and close , then open and close again a few minutes later , and then I heard footsteps running down the stairs , " Denley said .
He heard the door a third time , then more footsteps in de la Plaza 's apartment and another thud , Denley said .
He did n't know what to make of it , but he did n't think enough of it to call police .
" It did n't sound like a scuffle going on at all , " Denley said .
No knife , no note
Police were summoned at 8:30 a.m. Saturday after a neighbor saw blood on the stoop .
Officers had to break down de la Plaza 's locked door .
Once inside , they found no knife by de la Plaza 's side .
In fact , while they found plenty of blood , they found no bloody knife .
But they saw something they thought might be a remnant of blood on a knife in the sink .
Their theory was that de la Plaza had washed the knife after stabbing himself , but tests on the blade showed no trace of blood .
There was no suicide note .
On a notepad , however , someone had written two sentences : " Learn as if you were to live forever , " and , " Live as if you were to die tomorrow . "
There were no intruder footprints , and the pattern of blood in the apartment did not indicate there had been a struggle , police said .
The autopsy showed that de la Plaza had been stabbed three times , including once in the neck .
The report found no drugs in de la Plaza 's blood , only alcohol at a concentration of 0.11 percent , a bit above the legal definition for drunken drivers , 0.08 percent .
The medical examiner 's report said that de la Plaza 's injuries were " not inconsistent with self - inflicted stab wounds , " but that it was impossible to rule out homicide .
Handful are never solved
Dr. Amy Hart , chief medical examiner , said 2 to 5 percent of suspicious deaths nationwide are never able to be classified as a homicide or suicide .
" A lot of investigation has been done " on de la Plaza 's death , she said .
" There was really insufficient evidence to help us , or push us , to determine " whether it was a homicide or a suicide .
De la Plaza 's friends , however , say police did n't do all they could to make that determination .
Jean - Phillipe Goudet , a French police detective who works in the United States and is based in Los Angeles , was brought in to assist San Francisco police after de la Plaza 's family in France went to their government for help .
Nix said Goudet took some basic investigatory actions that police had failed to perform , such as looking at what de la Plaza was doing on his computer before someone yanked the cord at 2:38 a.m .
" If not for Goudet , Hugues ' laptop would still sit untouched , " Nix said in her complaint to the city .
" Homicide told Goudet they could not break into it .
...
Four months after the murder , Goudet received permission from SFPD to bring two ( computer ) professionals - on the French government 's dime - to break into the drive . "
Nix said she hopes the laptop will provide clues as to whom de la Plaza had been meeting through online dating sites where he was active .
Delay in cell phone check
Goudet also was the first investigator to check de la Plaza 's cell phone to determine whether he had sent or received calls or text messages that might help explain how he died , Nix said .
Police still have not performed DNA tests on the blood found at the apartment to determine whether any came from someone other than de la Plaza , his friends say .
Goudet would not discuss details of the investigation .
He did not fault the police .
" The problem is that you have so many homicides in San Francisco , " Goudet said .
" We can not ask them to treat this case specially .
We just ask permission to help them . "
Nix said police simply want to believe the case is not a homicide .
" There was no knife in his hand ; the knife is not in the house , " she said .
" What happened ?
The knife walked out by itself ?
Or was he murdered by somebody ? "
Casillas , the lead inspector , and his supervisors in the homicide unit declined to talk about the investigation or Nix 's complaint to the city .
They referred all inquiries to Gittens , the spokesman for the department .
Gittens conceded that the case continues to be a puzzle to police .
" The case is still open , " he said .
" If somebody would come forward and tell us what happened , we'd be happy to listen . "

of the Iraq War
Much of the remaining confidence Americans had in the economy is ebbing away .
Unfortunately , that could play right into a vicious economic cycle .
" Eroding consumer confidence foreshadows weakening consumer spending , which could further hurt the already deteriorating economy since consumer spending accounts for more than two - thirds of the nation ’s economic activity , " according to the Associated Press .
" A big worry is the employment market , which has been shedding jobs in recent months .
The Labor Department is expected to show another loss of 65,000 when it releases its April report Friday ; that follows a 80,000 job loss in March .
Analysts also estimate that the unemployment rate will remain at 5.1 percent , " according to the AP .
The percentage of respondents who described jobs as " hard to get " rose from 24.5 percent in March to 27.9 percent in April .
The percentage of respondents who described jobs as " plentiful " declined from 19.2 percent in March to 16.6 percent in April .
The lack of confidence in the flagging economy has been spurred on by rising gas and food prices and weakening job prospects .
As a result , " a widely watched measure of consumer sentiment [ reached ] a five - year low , a private research group said Tuesday , " according to the AP .
" The New York - based Conference Board said that its Consumer Confidence Index , which had plummeted in March , fell again to 62.3 in April , down from the revised 65.9 last month and 76.4 in February .
The number was in line with the consensus estimate of 62 from Wall Street economists surveyed by Thomson / IFR , but the index remains at its weakest point since March 2003 , when it registered 61.4 , ahead of the U.S. invasion of Iraq , " according to the AP .
The Consumer Confidence Index was not the only index that fell between March and April .
" The Present Situation Index , which measures shoppers ’ current assessment of economic conditions , dropped to 80.7 in April from 90.6 in March .
The Expectations Index , which measures the outlook over the next six months , was little changed at a depressed 50.1 , compared to 49.4 in March , " according to the AP .
Other economic reports capture the same dismal outlook .
The housing market ’s continued slump was measured by Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller index , which recently indicated that " housing prices dropped in February at the fastest rate ever , " according to the AP .
Housing prices have fallen 15 percent since their peak levels in 2006 , according to the AP , and may continue to fall .
Robert Shiller , the economist behind Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller index , said he predicted that housing prices might fall by more than 30 percent , eclipsing the housing slump seen during the Great Depression .
" The percentage of respondents surveyed who intended to take a vacation over the next six months has fallen to a 30 - year - low , another indication that consumers are turning more frugal , " according to the AP .
Even teenagers are becoming more frugal ; for more on that , see our blog post Recession Forces Teens To Curb Spending .
" Meanwhile , money from the government ’s economic stimulus plan have begun dropping into bank accounts — but with rising gas and groceries bills , early indications suggest that shoppers will focus on catching up on basics like meat or eggs , instead of buying a new TV or clothes .
That means that grocery stores and discounters could be the few beneficiaries in the retail world of the stimulus plan , " according to the AP .
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by another quarter point tomorrow and then hold interest rates steady for the rest of this year .
The Fed ’s repeated interest rate cuts have been attempts to boost the economy without encouraging inflation .
On May 1 , the BBC website reported an attack on Somalia with the words : “ Air raid kills Somali militants . ”
One might think the BBC ’s headline would identify the agency responsible for the bombing , but the first few sentences also shed no light :
“ The leader of the military wing of an Islamist insurgent organization in Somalia has been killed in an overnight air strike .
“ Aden Hashi Ayro , al - Shabab ’s military commander , died when his home in the central town of Dusamareb was bombed .
“ Ten other people , including a senior militant , are also reported dead . ”
Only in the fourth sentence , was responsibility ascribed :
“ A US military spokesman told the BBC that it had attacked what he called a known al - Qaeda target in Somalia . ”
English teachers often illustrate use of the passive form with the sentence : ‘ A man has been arrested . ’
The passive is preferable , students are told , because the active form , ‘ The police have arrested a man , ’ contains a redundancy — the agent is already indicated by the action .
There ’s no need to actually mention ‘ the police . ’
Likewise , the BBC takes for granted that the US is the world ’s policeman ; no need to mention it by name .
The action of bombing an impoverished Third World country already indicates the agent .
This also helps explain why no mention was made of the illegality of this act of aggression .
On the rare occasions when the media mention the conflict in Somalia at all , the focus tends to fall on US attempts to hunt down al Qaeda , or on the West ’s alleged humanitarian motives .
Other priorities were indicated in 1992 when the US political weekly The Nation referred to Somalia as “ one of the most strategically sensitive spots in the world today : astride the Horn of Africa , where oil , Islamic fundamentalism and Israeli , Iranian and Arab ambitions and arms are apt to crash and collide . ”
( December 21 , 1992 )
In December 2006 , the US backed the invasion of Somalia by its close Ethiopian ally to overthrow the Islamist government , the Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) .
Christian Ethiopia is a historic enemy of Somalia , which is made up entirely of Sunni Muslims .
On December 4 of that year , General John Abizaid , the commander of US forces from the Middle East through Afghanistan , travelled to Addis Ababa to meet the Ethiopian prime minister , Meles Zenawi .
Three weeks later , Ethiopian forces crossed into Somalia and Washington launched a series of supportive air strikes .
The Guardian quoted a former intelligence officer familiar with the region :
“ The meeting was just the final handshake . ” ( Xan Rice and Suzanne Goldenberg , “ The American connection : How US forged an alliance with Ethiopia over invasion , ” The Guardian , January 13 , 2007 )
Political analyst James Petras commented :
“ Somalia . . . was invaded by mercenaries by Ethiopia , trained , financed , armed and directed by US military advisers . ”
( Petras , ‘ The Imperial System : Hierarchy , Networks and Clients : The Case of Somalia , ’ Dissident Voice , February 18 , 2007 )
USA Today reported in January 2007 that the US had “ quietly poured weapons and military advisers into Ethiopia , ” which had received nearly $ 20 million in US military aid since late 2002 .
The report added :
“ The [ Somalia ] intervention is controversial in Ethiopia , where the Meles government has become increasingly repressive , said Chris Albin - Lackey , an African researcher at Human Rights Watch .
“ The Meles government has limited the power of the opposition in parliament and arrested thousands .
A government inquiry concluded that security forces fatally shot , beat or strangled 193 people who protested election fraud in 2005 . ”
Petras noted that , having driven the last of the warlords from Mogadishu and most of the countryside , the ICU had established a government which was welcomed by the great majority of Somalis and covered over 90 % of the population :
“ The ICU was a relatively honest administration , which ended warlord corruption and extortion .
Personal safety and property were protected , ending arbitrary seizures and kidnappings by warlords and their armed thugs .
The ICU is a broad multi-tendency movement that includes moderates and radical Islamists , civilian politicians and armed fighters , liberals and populists , electoralists and authoritarians .
Most important , the Courts succeeded in unifying the country and creating some semblance of nationhood , overcoming clan fragmentation . ” ( Petras , op . cit )
Martin Fletcher wrote in the Times of the ICU :
“ I am no apologist for the courts .
Their leadership included extremists with dangerous intentions and connections .
But for six months they achieved the near - impossible feat of restoring order to a country that appeared ungovernable …
“ The courts were less repressive than our Saudi Arabian friends .
They publicly executed two murderers ( a fraction of the 24 executions in Texas last year ) , and discouraged Western dancing , music and films , but at least people could walk the streets without being robbed or killed .
That trumps most other considerations .
Ask any Iraqi .
“ The Islamists have now been replaced – with Washington ’s connivance – by a weak , fragile Government that was created long before the courts won power , that includes the very warlords they defeated and relies for survival on Somalia ’s worst enemy . ”
( Fletcher , ‘ The Islamists were the one hope for Somalia , ’ The Times , January 8 , 2007 )
It was clear to many commentators that the Ethiopian invasion would prove disastrous .
Three months later , the Daily Telegraph reported :
“ A new humanitarian crisis is rapidly taking shape in the Horn of Africa where eight days of heavy fighting in Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia , has forced about 350,000 people to flee .
“ Artillery fire has devastated large areas of the city , forcing about one third of its population to leave .
Yesterday Mogadishu ’s main hospital was shelled .
“ The plains around Mogadishu are filled with refugees enduring desperate conditions with little food or shelter .
The fighting began when Somalia ’s internationally recognised government , supported by Ethiopian troops , launched an offensive against insurgents . ”
( Mike Pflanz , ‘ Fighting brings fresh misery to Somalia , ’ Telegraph , April 26 , 2007 )
The Telegraph cited a British aid worker : “ They are bombing anything that moves . ”
Catherine Weibel , from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees was also quoted :
“ Everyone we are talking to says this is the worst situation they have seen in 16 years since the last government fell . ”
The War On Terror . . .
And The Real Concern
The preferred media framework for making sense of US actions closely parallels cold war mythology .
We are to believe the US is passionately , even blindly , battling ideological enemies in an effort to protect itself and the West .
Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland could be relied upon to paint this picture of events :
“ A fortnight ago the Ethiopians entered Somalia to topple the Islamist forces who had just taken Mogadishu .
Americans dislike that Islamist movement , fearing it has the makings of an African Taliban , so they backed the Ethiopians to take it out .
According to Patrick Smith , the editor of Africa Confidential , the war on terror is fast becoming a cold war for the 21st century , with the US finding proxy allies to fight proxy enemies in faraway places . ”
( Freedland , “ Like a deluded compulsive gambler , Bush is fuelling a new cold war , ” The Guardian , January 10 , 2007 )
If this sounds curiously simplistic , even childish , it is .
In fact , the cold war , like the “ war on terror ” , was far less ideological , far more prosaic , than journalists like Freedland claim .
Historian Howard Zinn has , for example , commented on the Vietnam war , which the BBC would have us believe “ was America ’s attempt to stop Communists from toppling one country after another in South East Asia ” :
“ When I read the hundreds of pages of the Pentagon Papers entrusted to me by [ military analyst ] Daniel Ellsberg , what jumped out at me were the secret memos from the National Security Council .
Explaining the U.S. interest in Southeast Asia , they spoke bluntly of the country ’s motives as a quest for ‘ tin , rubber , oil . ’ ”
Ethiopia ’s invasion coincided with the Pentagon ’s goal of creating a new ‘ Africa Command ’ to deal with what the Christian Science Monitor described as : “ Strife , oil , and Al Qaeda . ” Richard Whittle wrote :
“ The creation of the new command will be more than an exercise in shuffling bureaucratic boxes , experts say .
The US government ’s motives include countering Al Qaeda ’s known presence in Africa , safeguarding future oil supplies , and competing with China , which has been courting African governments in its own quest for petroleum , they suggest . ”
( Richard Whittle , ‘ Pentagon to train a sharper eye on Africa , ’ January 5 , 2007 )
As Andy Rowell and James Marriott have noted , the key fact is that “ some 30 per cent of America ’s oil will come from Africa in the next ten years ” .
( Rowell and Marriott , A Game as Old as Empire — The Secret World of Economic Hit Men and the Web of Global Corruption , edited by Steven Hiatt , Berrett - Koehler , 2007 , p.118 )
The US has plans for nearly two - thirds of Somalia ’s oil fields to be allocated to the US oil companies Conoco , Amoco , Chevron and Phillips .
The US hopes Somalia will line up as an ally alongside Ethiopia and Djibouti , where the US has a military base .
This alliance would give America powerful leverage close to the major energy - producing regions .
Chatham House , a British think tank of the independent Royal Institute of International Affairs , commented on US and Ethiopian intervention last year :
“ In an uncomfortably familiar pattern , genuine multilateral concern to support the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Somalia has been hijacked by unilateral actions of other international actors — especially Ethiopia and the United States — following their own foreign policy agendas . ”
Catastrophic Crisis
This ‘ hijacking ’ has had truly appalling consequences .
More than one million people have been made internal refugees , and the UN food security unit warned last week that 3.5 million people , half of Somalia ’s population , are facing famine .
Fighting has turned Mogadishu into a ghost town .
About 700,000 people have fled — out of a population of up to 1.5 million .
The International Committee of the Red Cross describes Somalia ’s crisis as “ catastrophic . ”
Soaring food prices have driven thousands of protestors onto the streets of the capital , Mogadishu .
On May 5 , Professor Abdi Samatar , a professor of geography and global studies at the University of Minnesota , told the US radio program Democracy Now :
“ Well , what you see in Mogadishu over the last year and a half or so , since the Ethiopian invasion , which was sanctioned by the US government , has destroyed virtually all the life - sustaining economic systems which the population have built without the government for the last fifteen , sixteen years . ”
A kilo of rice , which previously sold at around seventy US cents , now costs as much as $ 2.50 .
The average day ’s income for anyone fortunate enough to have a job is less than a dollar a day .
The gap between incomes and the cost of food primarily imported from overseas means that millions of people cannot afford to eat .
Last week , Amnesty International reported that it had obtained scores of accounts of killings by Ethiopian troops that Somalis have described as “ slaughtering [ Somalis ] like goats . ”
In one case , “ a young child ’s throat was slit by Ethiopian soldiers in front of the child ’s mother . ”
Amnesty reported that during sweeps through neighborhoods , Ethiopian forces placed snipers on roofs , and civilians were unable to move about for fear of being shot :
“ While some sniper fire appeared to be directed at suspected members of anti-TFG [ Transitional Federal Government ] armed groups , reports indicate that civilians were also frequently caught in indiscriminate fire .
In many cases families were forced to carry their wounded to medical care in wheelbarrows and on donkeys because ambulance drivers would not operate their vehicles due to general insecurity , including sniper fire .
As a result , it has become very difficult for civilians to access medical care . ”
The British government has consistently downplayed both the gravity of the crisis and the murderous behavior of Ethiopian forces .
In the Foreign Office ’s latest annual human rights assessment of Somalia there was no mention of Ethiopia , let alone the conduct of its troops .
No surprise — Ethiopia is one of the largest recipients of UK aid in Africa and , as discussed , is an important regional ally .
The Media Follow , The Government Lead
Predictably , the government ’s strategic silence is reflected in press reporting .
In the last year , the words ‘ Somalia ’ and ‘ famine ’ have appeared in a grand total of seven British broadsheet newspaper articles discussing the topic .
Of the few references to the latest US attack in the British press over the last week , only the Independent and the Sunday Times made briefs references to Somalia ’s humanitarian crisis .
The Independent noted that life for Somalia ’s nine million residents has become “ unbearable ” .
The Guardian merely quoted Reuters :
“ Western security services have long seen Somalia as a haven for militants .
Warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre in 1991 , casting the country into chaos . ”
( Reuters , “ US airstrike kills head of al - Qaida in Somalia , ” Guardian International , May 2 , 2008 )
The Amnesty report was mentioned in three broadsheet newspapers .
Of these , The Guardian failed to mention the US role at all .
Ian Black commented :
“ Ethiopia sent in troops in December 2006 and ejected them .
Since then , Mogadishu has been caught up in a guerrilla war between the government and its Ethiopian allies and the Islamist insurgents .
Up to 1 million Somalians are internally displaced . ”
( Ian Black , ‘ Somali refugees speak of horrific war crimes , ’ The Guardian , May 7 , 2008 )
By contrast , a short Independent piece led with the US role :
“ Amnesty International has called for the role of the United States in Somalia to be investigated , following publication of a report accusing its allies of committing war crimes . ”
Amnesty ’s Dave Copeman was cited :
“ There are major countries that have significant influence .
The US , EU and European countries need to exert that influence to stop these attacks . ”
This is the sole reference to Copeman ’s comments in the entire national UK press .
Professor Samatar commented on the latest US attack :
“ [ I ] t ’s quite befuddling to Somalis and many other peace - loving people around the world as to why the United States has chosen to bomb people who are desperate for assistance and food , and who have been dislocated and traumatised by an Ethiopian invasion , a country that has its own people under tyranny in itself . ”
The Truth of “ Our Leaders ”
With our shared responsibility for the catastrophe in Somalia buried out of sight , the Telegraph reported this week :
“ Gordon Brown urged the Burmese authorities to give ‘ unfettered access ’ to humanitarian agencies .
‘ We now estimate that two million people face famine or disease as a result of the lack of co-operation of the Burmese authorities .
This is completely unacceptable , ’ he said . ”
( Alan Brown , ‘ Burmese officials “ are seizing emergency aid and selling it for profit ” , ’ Daily Telegraph , May 13 , 2008 )
The great lie is that we are represented by people like Gordon Brown , described as “ our leaders . ”
Because they represent us and we are not monsters , we are to believe that “ our leaders ” are seeking to resolve problems afflicting humanity in general , while working more specifically to protect us from terrorism and other threats .
In other words , we are to believe that ‘ our leaders ’ , like us , are rational , compassionate and well - intentioned .
The truth is very different .
In fact we are free to chose from parties and leaders who all represent the same interests of concentrated state - corporate power — the tiny fraction of the population that owns much of the country and runs its business .
Crucially , “ our leaders ” front a political system that has an overwhelming advantage in high - tech military power .
They are all too willing to use this power to convulse countries with bloodshed when doing so supports their lucrative version of economic “ order ” .
Iraq is the obvious example — Somalia is another .
“ Our leaders ” rule in the name of democracy , but they act in the interests of a narrow , extremely violent kleptocracy .
Back to cable they will go :
On Sunday NBC will stop showing repeats of “ Monk ” and “ Psych , ” two dramas from NBC Universal ’s USA cable network .
A two - hour block of “ The Office ” will be shown in their place .
Six seasons of “ Monk , ” starring Tony Shalhoub as a detective who suffers from obsessive - compulsive disorder , were hits on cable .
Similarly , “ Psych , ” starring James Roday as a police consultant with uncanny observational powers , has shown success since it was introduced in 2006 .
But the programs did not fare well on the network .
“ In recent weeks , the dramas have hovered around a 1.1 rating among adults 18 - 49 and typically came in last place among the major networks during their respective hours , ” The Hollywood Reporter noted .
In at least one way , the broadcast ratings were actually lower : The April 28 episode of “ Monk ” on NBC averaged 5.8 million viewers , while the February 22 season finale of “ Monk ” on USA averaged 6.9 million viewers .
Ben Silverman , the co-chair of NBC Entertainment , said in December that the writers ’ strike had “ put a flashlight ” on the network ’s decision to repurpose the two shows , but that NBC would have done it anyway .
Mr. Silverman has said that NBC will consider the same treatment for “ In Plain Sight , ” an upcoming drama on USA .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are roughly tied in national Democratic preferences -- 47 % for Obama vs. 45 % for Clinton -- according to Gallup Poll Daily tracking conducted March 6 - 8 .
Support lines for the two Democratic contestants have now switched since Gallup 's March 7 report , and Obama is back on top , although his two percentage point lead is not statistically significant .
Clinton gained on Obama in the days leading up to last week 's March 4 primary voting , but her successful showing -- winning three of the four elections held that day -- failed to boost her candidacy nationally .
Obama had a solid victory in Saturday 's Wyoming caucuses , winning 61 % of the vote and more than half of the delegates .
Any impact this might have on national Democratic preferences will not enter the three - day rolling averages in Gallup Poll Daily tracking until Monday 's report .

Physicists at the Bhavnagar University in Gujarat , India , have demonstrated how to trap and retrieve light using a soup of micro- and nano - sized magnetic spheres .
1
The unusual fluid , they say , works at room temperature , holds photons for far longer than other systems , and can also be tuned with a magnet to store any wavelength of visible light .
’ The discovery could pave the way for lab - on - a - chip devices for processing optical information , ’ Rasbindu Mehta , who led the team , told Chemistry World .
For over a decade scientists have been working towards light - based computing : where circuits control photons - particles of light - in the same way that they currently manipulate electrons .
Photon - based computing should be faster than electronics .
It would also cut out the ungainly components used to convert between the optical signals that transmit data and the electrical signals that manipulate and store it .
Any microchip designed to process optical signals has to store photons , perhaps by slowing or trapping light in carefully designed crystals .
Mehta ’s team coated micron - size magnetite spheres with oleic acid and dispersed them through a ferrofluid , which is a suspension of much smaller magnetic nanoparticles ( in this case held in kerosene ) .
When an external magnetic field was applied to the fluid , which was held in a glass cell , laser light passing through the medium was trapped inside .
Photons escaped when the field was switched off .
’ It is fantastic , ’ said Hema Ramachandran , who heads the photonics unit at the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore , and was one of several physicists who witnessed the demonstration .
She said she was planning some experiments with Mehta ’s group .
’ It was a chance discovery , ’ explained Mehta ’s colleague Rajesh Patel .
While investigating the optical properties of their transparent fluid the researchers noticed that , in a certain magnetic field range , light scattering - both forward and backward - became zero .
’ We thought the light got trapped inside , ’ said Patel .
’ So , we switched off the laser [ which was shining light through the system ] and then the magnetic field , and there it was - a flash of colour lighting up our dark room . ’
A rigorous theoretical explanation is yet to come , but the researchers believe that the spheres are aligned by the magnetic field and form microcavities - filled by the ferrofluid - in which the photons get trapped , resonating back and forth .
Changing the external magnetic field alters the refractive index of the cavities , by changing the dispersion of both the ferrofluid and the larger spheres .
This in turn decides which wavelength of light is trapped by the system .
And what is more , said Mehta , photons can be stored for as long as the magnetic field is switched on .
’ This is the first visual evidence of storage and retrieval of light for a long and controllable duration - in all other reports , storage time of photons is restricted to a few nanoseconds , ’ he said .
Physicist Ortwin Hess , at the Advanced Technology Institute in the University of Surrey , said the results were ’ very interesting ’.
’ As I understand it , the spheres act as resonators ( every resonator stores light ) for a particular wavelength , ’ he told Chemistry World .
’ The interesting fact is that via the ferroelectric properties of the materials , a particular wavelength can then be controlled and released by application of a field . ’
Hess recently published a scheme to slow down and eventually store light using artificially designed solid metamaterials , but his idea is still theoretical .
2Other experiments have involved stopping light altogether by using a gas of sodium or rubidium atoms chilled to near absolute zero , though that system is not practical for microchips .
Many photonic crystals also control light by being patterned on the nano and micro-scale , and having regions of variable refractive index .
Pumping a second laser light at photonic crystals can even alter their photon - trapping properties .
But Mehta ’s team seem to have chanced on a simpler fluid system with the easy dynamic control for which photonic crystal designers yearn .

It took me three days to collect 88 friends on Facebook . . . and four days to be ordered offline by my daughter .
I ’d embarrassed her with a public scolding when I did n’t like the swear word she used on the site .
I did n’t realize when I sent my message that it could be seen by all my Facebook friends , and my daughter ’s friends , and their friends . . . and everyone in the Facebook universe , to hear my daughter tell it .
I knew then that this social networking stuff is n’t as easy as it looks .
And I understand now why 8,000 people have joined the group “ For the love of god -- do n’t let parents join Facebook , ” where discussion board questions run like this : “ how can one get there parents to leave facebook without pissing them off . ”

I thought I was ahead of the curve when I joined Facebook in February .
But it turns out middle - age women like me are the site ’s fastest - growing demographic .
Now , with 200 million members , Facebook is so yesterday .
Twitter , it seems , is the new craze .
Now I ’m friending while everyone else is sending Tweets .

When I announced I ’d joined , I got lots of advice in e-mails from readers about status messages and privacy settings .
I also got a few laughs , courtesy of other clueless baby boomers .
Sheldon Kuna of Calabasas got “ tagged ” in a photo by one of his kids , but he did n’t know what the heck that meant .
He had nine friends -- all his children ’s pals -- on his Facebook list .
When he turned 62 , “ two of them sent me birthday wishes , but I did n’t know how to thank them , ” he said .
Christine Soderbergh ’s daughter greeted her friend request with “ eww mom , I do n’t want you creeping around my space . ”
Her son allowed her to friend him , and then telephoned to tell her “ how to e-mail him so I was n’t on his wallpaper . ”
It ’s “ wall , ” Christine , not “ wallpaper . ”
That ’s why they do n’t want us creeping around .

Some , like me , felt burdened by the constant status updates .
Edna Ball , 59 , of Whittier wondered why she should care “ that an old high school acquaintance is making a big pot of fish stew in Ontario , Canada . ”
But others , like Mindy Atwood , were delighted .
“ It is a relief to just sit down and say ‘ Mindy is ’ something , anything and people seem to care ! ”
Key word , Mindy , seem to .
Most people like joining online groups , posting YouTube links and taking such quizzes as “ Which color is your aura ? ” or “ What kind of shoe defines you ? ”

On Saturday , at The Times Book Festival , I discovered three old friends in two hours , while I was on stage with my oldest daughter , doing a tag - team chat about my column .
A woman up front took the mike for a question and when I heard her voice , I knew it was Iris .
Our daughters had gone to school together , but we lost touch when they graduated .
Then , in the audience , I spotted Audrey ; we were high school cheerleaders together .
She was with her mother , Mrs. McBath , my 10th - grade algebra teacher .
I could hardly wait to finish speaking , so I could hug them .
And my daughter -- my Facebook guru -- was making her own discovery , off in the corner with Jessica , Iris ’ daughter .
They had been such close friends once , she called Jessica ’s grandfather “ grandpa . ”
But they went to different high schools , then off to college .

A few months ago , they “ friended ” each other .
But until Saturday they had not spoken .
They laughed and caught up , and by the time we left they were talking about how much fun it would be to move in together .
When it comes to “ friending , ” even my daughter agrees that Facebook is a poor substitute for a hug .

That is the claim of psychologists who have found that tapping away on a mobile phone or computer keypad or checking them for electronic messages temporarily knocks up to 10 points off the user ’s IQ .
This rate of decline in intelligence compares unfavourably with the four - point drop in IQ associated with smoking marijuana , according to British researchers , who have labelled the fleeting phenomenon of enhanced stupidity as “ infomania ” .
Research on sleep deprivation suggests that the IQ drop caused by electronic obsession is also equivalent to a wakeful night .
Infomania is mainly a problem for adult workers , especially men , the study commissioned by Hewlett Packard , the technology company , has concluded .
The noticeable drop in IQ is attributed to the constant distraction of “ always on ” technology when employees should be concentrating on what they are paid to do .
Infomania means that they lose concentration as their minds remain fixed in an almost permanent state of readiness to react to technology instead of focusing on the task in hand .
Workers lose productivity by interrupting a business meeting and disrupt social gatherings because of their infirmity , the report said .
The brain also finds it hard to cope with juggling lots of tasks at once , reducing its overall effectiveness , it added .
And while modern technology can have huge benefits , excessive use can be damaging not only to a person ’s mind , but to their social life .
Eighty volunteers took part in clinical trials on IQ deterioration and 1,100 adults were interviewed .
More than six in ten ( 62 per cent ) of people polled admit that they were addicted to checking their e-mail and text messages so assiduously that they scrutinised work - related ones even when at home or on holiday .
Half said that they always responded immediately to an email and one in five ( 21 per cent ) will interrupt a meeting to do so .
Furthermore , infomania is having a negative effect on work colleagues , increasing stress and dissenting feelings .
Nine out of ten polled thought that colleagues who answered e-mails or messages during a face - to - face meeting were extremely rude .
Yet one in three Britons believes that it is not only acceptable , but actually diligent and efficient to do so .
The effects on IQ were studied by Dr Glenn Wilson , a University of London psychologist , as part of the research project .
“ This is a very real and widespread phenomenon , ” he said .
“ We have found that infomania , if unchecked , will damage a worker ’s performance by reducing their mental sharpness .
“ Companies should encourage a more balanced and appropriate way of working . ”
The report suggests that firms who give employees gadgets and devices to help them keep in touch from wherever they might be should also produce guidelines on use .
These “ best practice tips ” including using “ dead time ” , such as travelling time , to read messages and check e-mails and turning devices off in meetings .
David Smith , commercial manager of Hewlett Packard , said : “ The research suggests that we are in danger of being caught up in a 24 - hour ‘ always on ’ society .
“ This is more worrying when you consider the potential impairment on performance and concentration for workers , and the consequent impact on businesses . ”
He said that although the company produced such technology , it was similar to a motor manufacturer making a 150 mph sports car and telling drivers to stick within speed limits .
He added : “ Similarly , ‘ always on ’ technology has proven productivity benefits but people need to use it responsibly .
We know that technology makes us more effective , but we also know that misuse of technology can be counter - productive . ”

Vehicles move past the National Stadium , also known as the " Bird 's Nest , " which is seen lit at night in Beijing April 15 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jason Lee
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Speeding drivers in south China are getting clear away thanks to machines which switch the numbers on their licence plates in seconds , state media said on Tuesday .
“ More than 50 percent of cars caught on camera for speeding and other offences either cover up their plates or use a fake licence plate , ” a traffic policeman in the Guangdong city of Yangjiang was quoted by the Beijing Youth Daily as saying .
“ Our chances of capturing them is next to nil . ”
The price of the remote - control device starts at around 800 yuan ( $ 115 ) , while a more advanced apparatus with the ability to flip over the numbers in less than three seconds costs more than double .
“ The era of covering up the licence plate by hand has passed , ” a driver surnamed Zheng told the newspaper .
“ It ’s really convenient and economical too , ” a salesman who specializes in such devices in the provincial capital of Guangzhou was quoted as saying .
In April , Xinhua news agency reported that China had confiscated thousands of fake military vehicles and number plates in a move to crack down on citizens masquerading as privileged members of the People ’s Liberation Army .
In years past , Chinese counterfeiters have used fake military vehicles to ship bootleg cigarettes and other goods , previous reports have said .
I love cheat sheets !
I have at least 30 in front of me at the moment scattered throughout my desk – CSS cheat sheet , Awk cheat sheet , keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet for vt100 / ansi screen terminal emulator , Emacs and Vim , then Ethernet , IP and TCP header layout cheat sheets , and many , many others .
I have created about 15 out of these 30 and in my future posts I 'll make them available for download .
These cheat sheets have certainly made me a better developer and I 'm super excited that I can share them here on my blog so that you can become a better developer , too .
Someone might say that looking up the information in a man or info page , manual or Google is equivalent to looking it up on a cheat sheet , if not better .
I disagree .
First of all it is usually , but not always , takes more time to find where in the documentation the particular thing is located but in the cheat sheet you have it right in front of you .
For example , suppose you were C programmer and forgot how to print a floating point number , you 'd type `man 3 printf ' and quickly find the answer .
That 's fine - it's as fast or even faster than looking something up in a cheat sheet but that 's just because you knew exactly what you were looking for !
But let 's look at Joe Random who just began learning gawk programming language and at the moment wants to replace a part of a string with another string .
He 'd probably already have the manual open and would start going through it looking for string functions .
It would take him a good minute or so before he finds the correct place and reads how the function works .
Now , if he had a cheat sheet , like the one I created here , he'd have all the string functions in front of him and he would quickly locate that it is gsub or gensub .
He 'd find not only that but also all the other string functions and next time he has a problem he might remember the right function subconsciously .
What I want to emphasize is that the cheat sheets are not for NOT remembering things and just looking them up hundreds of thousands of times and never actually learning them but are FOR remembering and learning new things faster .
It is also interesting to find what technologies you have not used for a while because the cheat sheets pile up in most recently .
I made this cheat sheet in Microsoft Word because I am not that good with TeX , particularly formatting data so it looked nice .
So the awk cheat sheet is available in .doc and .pdf .
I will usually post the cheat sheets in these two formats .
This cheat sheet contains :
Predefined Variable Summary , which lists all the predefined variables and which awk versions ( original awk , nawk or gawk ) have it built in ,
GNU awk's command line argument summary ,
I /O statements ,
Numeric functions ,
Bit manipulation functions ,
I18n ( internationalization ) functions ,
String functions , and finally ,
Time functions .
Let me know if you notice any inaccuracies , mistakes or see that I have left something out .

Data Loss Statistics reveal that “ More than 22 percent [ of computer users surveyed ] said backing up information is on their to - do list , but they seldom do it ” and “ nine percent admitted they have never backed up their files . ”
The Cost of Lost Data illustrates the causes of data loss reminding us of the importance of data backups :
Our Old Storage
I used to make a copy of important files and burn a CD to put in our safe deposit box yearly .
However , I got a little lazy and the newest copy is probably a few years old .
My husband also set up mirrored hard drives ( RAID 1 ) .
This seemed sufficient until I heard a story from a friend about a family who lost all their pictures of their children when their computer failed .
I realized that not only do we have very important financial data , but also priceless pictures of our children since we ’ve gone to a digital camera .

Are you backing up your files ?
How often and by what method ?
I thought to myself : that ’s not what they believe at Nike .
Then he told me something else .
Li-Ning shoes were purposely priced 20 percent below their Nike and Adidas equivalent .
He did n’t explain why , but he did n’t have to .
Li-Ning is simply not confident that its current brand can stand up to its big Western competitors .
Truth to tell , neither is just about any other big consumer company in China .

It is easy when you live in the West to take brands  their power , their ability to conjure up feelings of status among consumers , the loyalty they can generate  completely for granted .
Brands are almost part of the air we breathe .
But go to China , and you get a whole new appreciation for brands .
One afternoon , for instance , I went to a big five - story mart called the Silk Market , which was lined with tiny retail outlets all selling “ branded ” goods of every sort  watches and purses , shirts and suits , you name it .
As I walked down a crowded aisle , I was inundated with sellers grabbing and clutching me , while pushing their goods under my nose .
But they did n’t say , “ Do you want a purse ? ”
They shouted : “ Louis Vuitton ! Gucci ! Armani ! ”
All the goods were knock - offs , of course .
But it certainly spoke to the power of brands  a fake Louis Vuitton was somehow “ better ” than a better - made unbranded purse .
You notice it everywhere in China .
What is the car of choice in China if you have some money ?
Surprisingly , an Audi .
Why ?
Because Audi got here early and did the best job among foreign car manufacturers of persuading the Chinese that an Audi is a symbol that you ’ve made it .
Everybody wants an iPhone  even though they are not even sold yet in China .
Stroll down a fancy mall in Shanghai or Beijing and they ’re all cluttered with the familiar Western brands .
And not a single big Chinese brand .
Partly , it is understandable that China would be lacking in brands as big as Toyota or Sony .
It took Japan decades of work and innovation for those brands to succeed internationally : China ’s experiment in capitalism is less than three decades old , and it has grown up around low - cost manufacturing .
For a long time , this was a country of scarcity  it still is in some parts  so there was no need for anything so high - falutin as branding .
Even when that began to change , the primary way Chinese companies competed was on price .

There is another reason , too .
There is a powerful sense among Chinese consumers that domestic brands are inferior  and a distinct lack of confidence among Chinese companies in the allure of their own brands .
“ It is very difficult to be a Chinese brand , ” said Feng Jun , the 39 - year - old founder of Aigo , a consumer electronics company that also has high hopes of conquering the West with its branded products .
( Among other things , it makes the most popular Chinese digital music player . )
“ No one in China believes in a Chinese brand . ”
CAMP DAVID , Md.  President Bush on Saturday dismissed assertions that his administration had softened demands that North Korea fully declare all of its nuclear activities , including secret efforts to enrich uranium and sell nuclear technology abroad .
Appearing here at the presidential retreat with South Korea ’s new president , Lee Myung - bak , Mr. Bush said that any judgment about North Korea ’s willingness to dismantle its nuclear program  the core of an agreement negotiated last year  would only come once North Korea completed a declaration of its nuclear activities .
The deadline for that declaration passed at the end of last year , and no new deadline has been set .
That has left the agreement signed 14 months ago by North and South Korea , the United States , China , Japan and Russia increasingly in doubt .
Mr. Bush , facing criticism from some conservatives , distanced himself from statements by administration officials that the United States and other countries were prepared to accept something less than a full admission about North Korea ’s secret nuclear programs .
We 've already seen one hack to automate Guitar Hero , but it had the slight disadvantage of having to be pre-programmed for each song , and even then it was slightly hit - and - miss .
Now , a father looking for a way to finally beat his son at the game has taken things considerably further , with his hack actually using the composite video input to determine which notes need to be hit in real time .
That , as you might have guessed , is way beyond any notion of practicality , and far outside the realm of the average DIYer 's skill level , but it seems like it does indeed work , although there are apparently a few minor kinks left to be worked out .

The University of California at Berkeley is being sued for statements on their Understanding Evolution Web site that some religious beliefs contradict science -- like the idea that the Earth and living things were finished up in six days .
The plaintiffs argue that a government - funded state university cannot claim that " some religious denominations are better than others , " though I certainly can't find anyplace where Berkeley does so .
I suppose next under the gun will be NASA for its estimate that the universe is 13.7 billion years old , or the US Geological Survey for finding the age of the Earth to be a potentially unholy 4.5 billion years ...
X Saves the World
Jeff Gordinier
Viking ( 2008 )
Somewhere in between the ceaseless celebrations of the baby boomers turning 60 and the millennial generation discovering they were suffering from a quarter - life crisis , the cultural powers that be forgot to take note of a major milestone : generation X began to turn 40 .
Molly Ringwald , of the quintessential Gen X film The Breakfast Club , celebrated her 40th birthday earlier this year .
Prozac Nation author Elizabeth Wurtzel might well be spending her days taking notes on perimenopause -- she 's turning 41 in July .
And if Kurt Cobain were still alive , no one would be thinking of him as an angry young man .
He would be 40 - plus too .
Yet generation X , those born roughly between 1965 and 1980 ( it 's worth noting that demographers disagree about the group 's exact parameters , preferring to use the dates 1963 to 1977 ) , remains forever young in the public imagination , still those 20 - somethings sitting around Seattle and Austin grunge bars and coffee houses exchanging ironic witticisms about life and doing not much else with their time .
" Somebody seems to have forgotten generation X , " writes Jeff Gordinier , American author of the just released X Saves the World : How Generation X Got the Shaft but Can Still Keep Everything From Sucking .
" The stodgy old species known as the 30 - something has been shuttled off like Molly Ringwald herself , to some sort of Camp Limbo for demographic lepers . "
Gordinier seeks to rescue generation X from the shadows in this rollicking book .
He revisits Gen X highlights from childhood in the inflation - ridden 1970s through slacking during the recession of the early 1990s to the dot - com boom and bust , and what came after .
He looks at the careers of folks as disparate as director Paul Thomas Anderson and Meetup founder Scott Heiferman and his partners to prove that , well , Gen X does n't deserve its slacker reputation .
They work , those 30 - and 40 - somethings .
They really do -- when they can get work , that is .
Generation X , it seems , has a nasty habit of getting bushwhacked by bad economic conditions time and time again .
Yes , they 've produced a few Internet millionaires , but census bureau figures reveal that the men of generation X are grossing less than their fathers at the same age .
And if you think you detect a tone of slight bitterness in my reportorial voice , in the interests of full disclosure I admit to a birth date that marks me as a full - fledged member of generation X .
Too easy on the slack - offs ?
Yet in his attempt to shill for a group that is genuinely in need of some good public relations , Gordinier lets some less than exemplary Gen X traits slide .
When it comes to solipsistic spending , for example , generation X puts baby boomers to shame .
What other generation can claim to have made $ 1,000 architecturally inspired infant strollers and $ 5 cups of designer coffee into necessities ?
Gordinier could also have devoted more page space to the women of his generation , who are now on the forefront of the work / life balance debate .
Yet Gordinier is ultimately an optimist , believing generation X is only now coming into its own as a true force for change .
He points to a growing number of 30 - and 40 - something social activists , arguing that the sheer number of political , international , economic and environmental disasters that have occurred over the course of George W. Bush 's presidency leaves generation X with no choice but to begin to go about the business of fixing our society .
In short , he believes the group will turn into the demographic equivalent of Winston Wolf , the clean - up character played by Harvey Keitel in Pulp Fiction :
We 're equipped .
We 're wary enough to see through delusional " movements " : we 're old enough to feel a connection to the past ( and yet we 're unsentimental enough not to get all gooey about it ) ; we 're young enough to be wired ; we 're snotty enough not to settle for crap ; we 're resourceful enough to turn crap into gold ; we 're quiet enough to endure our labors on the margins .
Beyond that , we 're all we got .
Nobody else is going to do it .
I met recently with Gordinier in his suburban New York City town to discuss what makes generation X distinctive , if demography is destiny and which generation can legitimately claim Barack Obama as one of its own .
Helaine Olen :
Why did you write this book ?
Jeff Gordinier : " One day I was looking out there , and the sun was going down over the Hudson River and these angels appeared .
I realized the angels were Kurt Cobain and Tupac Shakur , and they spoke to me and they said , " Tell our story , Jeff !
It 's time ! "
" No , no .
What happened was my son Toby was born on Jan. 27 , 2006 .
My editor at Details called me at home when Toby was maybe a week or 10 days old .
I was really tired , frustrated and vulnerable .
And he wanted something for the April issue .
We were riffing about generation X , I was whining and this screed poured out about the fucking crap culture and American Idol culture that I found so abhorrent .
Whatever progress had been made in terms of fostering an alternative viewpoint in America , it failed miserably .
The generation X viewpoint had been marginalized . "
HO : What is the Gen X viewpoint ?
JG : " I think the Gen X viewpoint is indirection .
The boomer and millennial viewpoint is " I want to be in the fucking spotlight . "
Gen Xers are uninterested in the spotlight .
They 're more interested in dodging it and doing good work quietly .
I think there 's a sort of comfort in the margins .
Our influence on American culture has been in the shadows .
It has been from the margins , even if we 're talking about something as macro as Google .
Its genesis was microcosmic . "
HO : Where do you think that comes from ?
JG : " I think it 's partly just because we 're smaller .
You know , we 're sort of sandwiched between two larger demographic groups .
We were marginalized from the start .
But the first president I can remember is Nixon .
The first war I can remember is Vietnam .
That has to do a number on you when you 're a kid .
Oh , war .
The war we 've messed up .
Oh , the president that resigned because he messed up .
It sort of plants a seed of questioning , I guess .
" And , let 's be honest , punk rock has a lot to do with it .
It just does .
Not just the music but the sensibility .
That attitude is so different than the boomer attitude .
The attitude of people like Jello Biafra and Johnny Rotten , so scabrous and questioning and unwilling to be pinned down , unwilling to be lumped in .
That seems to be so much a part of the Gen X sensibility . "
HO : Is demography destiny ?
JG : " It 's weird the degree to which it seems to be , do n't you think ?
Yet , people are unaware of how much they were formed by shared cultural influences .
You know , whether it was just watching Gilligan 's Island in reruns , or having some faint memory of Watergate and Vietnam , going through this phase in which a lot of people 's parents got divorced , not in my case , but that 's , I think , something that impacted a lot of Xers .
" I think a huge influence on us was the stock market crash of 1987 , even though , maybe , at the time , you were n't even aware that it would be important .
But I mean , that happened Oct. 19 , 1987 ; I graduated from college in 1988 , so just a few months later , and lo and behold , I could n't find work .
That affects your sensibility .
It changes what you expect .
I mean , it 's a little like my grandmother 's Depression mentality . "
HO : One of the odd things I find is that when you say Gen X , people still envision a bunch of slackers hanging around a coffee shop .
But Gen Xers are well into their 40s .
Why does this persist ?
JG : " There 's a kind of cut - and - paste media laziness to a lot of the coverage of things like this .
I 've been a slacker .
I wasted my time .
I drank beer , I played chess with old guys , I sat around , I wrote a couple pieces , but , you know , so I slacked .
Who has n't ?
It was good times .
But for the most part , I was just unemployed , looking for work .
I mean , I was n't slacking .
I wanted a job , you know ?
We had a hard time finding work .
That 's different than not wanting to work at all .
" And how can you still even use the word ' slacker ' about the generation that created Google ?
I mean , generation X has reinvented global business .
We have .
I mean , I have n't .
If we 're speaking collectively , we 're talking about people who have changed the way the entire world does business .
That 's pretty big , and this kind of becomes absurd to continue to call those people ' slackers . ' "
HO : You write in the book that the Internet reflects Gen X values . . .
JG : " I think something like YouTube reflects Gen - X values .
Craigslist , certainly .
Wikipedia .
Google .
But instead of Gen - X values , why do n't we talk about Gen - X head space .
I think that , when you look at something like Wikipedia , something that 's crowd - source like that , I mean , it reflects the same obsession with encyclopedic knowledge that , I think , a lot of Xers have .
Instead of baseball statistics , a lot of X guys , for instance , are obsessed with Guided By Voices ' B-sides .
It 's similar to me to a Tarantino movie , or a Beck song -- these pieces of art that are larded with cultural references , cultural allusions . "
HO : Yet , reading your book , it seems to me you think the dot - com boom was to Gen X what the apple was to Adam and Eve .
JG : " These dot - com guys , at the beginning , they were pretty cool .
They were like punks .
They were just true to themselves , and the companies that were created were based on cool " kill your idols " kind of ideas .
So you could n't hate them quite so much .
It seemed like the right people were getting money .
And -- it was just contagious .
I think that there was this vast collective acknowledgement of money and sort of wanting money .
" And I think the other thing is that , it 's not just money itself .
I think Gen Xers , our alternative sensibility , in some ways , segued .
We 're tempted by all things small - batch , and microbrewed , and indie .
Organic .
Those are not bad things , but in some ways , they are a mask for the same Yuppie sensibility that afflicts the boomers and the millennials in a more mass way .
So it leads down the same road , do n't you think ? "
HO : Just because it looks good or tastes good , it 's still a $ 1,000 stroller or a $ 25 bottle of beer ?
JG : " Yeah , we 're all weak .
Everybody has their vice . "
HO : So how is Gen X an alternative force in the culture ?
You could say Gen X has had amazing PR .
We buy insanely expensive stuff , because it looks or tastes cool .
We move to working class neighborhoods like Park Slope or Wicker Park and soon they are only working class neighborhoods in our heads because our arrival eventually ensures that the true working class can't afford to live there .
How do you reconcile this -- if you can ?
JG : " Well that 's the great generation X original sin , is n't it , that our own connoisseurship became corruption .
That 's a huge question .
Everyone is susceptible to the Yuppie Virus .
In a way , Gen Xers are their own virus .
It 's true , that urge for the margins is partially what erodes the margins . . . "
HO : You say in the book that Barack Obama is a Gen X figure .
How so ?
JG : " Barack Obama is our people .
I mean , he has a Gen X sensibility .
Did you read Dreams From My Father ?
It 's a remarkable book .
It 's so shockingly honest , and not just about drugs , or whatever .
It 's honest about dissent and his doubts about forms of protest .
It 's stunning to read that .
When he was at Occidental College for a couple years , he attends and speaks at this rally against apartheid in South Africa , and midway through the rally , he 's struck by this wave of doubt .
He 's not sure that he 's accomplishing anything .
He feels that members of the board of trustees of the college are looking out their windows laughing at them .
He feels like there 's a charade going on .
That struck me as a Gen X sensibility .
That line of thinking can lead to apathy and disengagement , but in his case , it certainly did n't . . . "
HO : So how do you get Xers off the couch ?
We are the original couch potatoes , after all .
JG : Well , I think Barack Obama 's doing it .
And I think part of it has to do with the incredible suckitude of the last eight years .
I mean , it 's astonishing what we 've been through .
Wait , what the hell am I saying ?
I 'm a Yuppie .
I have n't been through it .
But what we 've witnessed .
Gitmo , Abu Ghraib , Katrina , the erosion of civil liberties , I mean , it 's -- regardless of what party you 're with , or like , what political perspective you have , these have been really distressing years .
And I think , for Gen Xers I know who are libertarians , or are kind of old - school liberals , it 's been so troubling that they 've -- felt themselves compelled to get up and do something . "
HO : So is that where Xers are headed ?
JG : " I remember when my wife and I saw the Democratic National Convention on TV in 2004 , and Obama spoke , and I was crying .
Shit .
I mean , real tears .
I cried .
I was like , ' Fuck !
What 's happening ?
This guy 's awesome !'
My wife said , ' I 'd follow this guy anywhere .
I 'd vote for this guy .
Who is this guy ? '
It was just a remarkable speech .
And then we thought , ' We 'll get burned .
We 'll get burned .
Let 's face it .
Do n't believe in this .
You know , he 's a cool guy , but let 's not get all full of hope or anything .
Hope is a trick . '
" I think that , not just generation X , all sorts of people who are reflexively sarcastic suddenly feel compelled to put that aside .
So when you say , ' Where is Gen X headed ? '
Maybe that 's where we 're headed .
Maybe we become sappier .
Maybe we become a little less sarcastic for a while .
I do n't know .
It 's hard , though .
I mean , what -- are we gonna put Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert out of work ?
What happens to Sarah Silverman ? "
HO : So you do n't think generation X has peaked ?
JG : " Nope .
Strangely , I think we 're just getting started .
I actually think we 're on the brink of new accomplishments , even though they might be quiet , under - the - radar accomplishments .
And time is on our side , weirdly enough .
I mean , look at it this way : Eventually , whether they 'll admit it or not , the boomers are going to die . "

WASHINGTON  Senator John McCain is set to release 400 pages of medical records , including documents related to his melanoma surgery in August 2000 , to a tightly controlled group of reporters on the Friday before Memorial Day weekend .
Mr. McCain said late last week that he had nothing to hide .
Campaign officials have nonetheless said that even if nothing in the records suggests a problem with his health , a rush of news media reports focusing on the cancer surgery was not politically helpful and that they wanted to play down the information as much as possible  something that the timing of the release would seem to accomplish .
“ There are going to be no surprises , ” Mr. McCain , 71 , told reporters last Friday aboard his campaign bus on a trip to West Virginia .
His doctors , he added , “ have told me that everything ’s fine . ”
In an unforeseen bit of timing , the release of the records , which cover 2000 to 2008 , will follow by three days the disclosure that Edward M. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , who is Mr. McCain ’s good friend in the Senate , has a malignant brain tumor .
A fascinating study of security cameras in San Francisco has concluded that any effect on they have on crime is incredibly localized , and they only works on certain kinds of crime — furthermore , the same number of crimes end up getting committed in the long run , just down the street from the cameras .
Still , San Francisco Mayor Gavin
Newsom vows to continue putting up the little orwellscopes , because they lull people into feeling secure .
Using a complicated method , researchers were able to come up with an average daily crime rate at each location broken out by type of crime and distance from the cameras .
They then compared it with the average daily crime rate from the period before the cameras were installed .
They looked at seven types of crime : larcenies , burglaries , motor vehicle theft , assault , robbery , homicide and forcible sex offenses .
The only positive deterrent effect was the reduction of larcenies within 100 feet of the cameras .
No other crimes were affected – except for homicides , which had an interesting pattern .
Murders went down within 250 feet of the cameras , but the reduction was completely offset by an increase 250 to 500 feet away , suggesting people moved down the block before killing each other .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- The U.S. Navy likely will make its first attempt to shoot down a faulty spy satellite Wednesday night .
A Delta II rocket lifts off in December , carrying a reconnaissance satellite that failed hours later .
The U.S. government issued a formal notice warning ships and planes to stay clear of a large area of the Pacific Ocean west of Hawaii .
The notice says the two - and - a - half hour window begins 2:30 a.m. Thursday Greenwich Mean Time , which is 9:30 p.m. Wednesday on the East Coast , and 4:30 p.m. Wednesday in Hawaii .
The timing is also after the U.S. space shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to be safely on the ground .
Pentagon officials caution that the notice reflects the first opportunity to take a shot at the satellite , but it 's possible the attempt could be delayed until later .
Watch Pentagon spokesman Jeff Morrell describe the launch window
" We have to make the notification , but it 's possible the conditions wo n't be ideal , or that everything wo n't be ready , " said a Pentagon official who asked not to be identified .
Pentagon officials says if the first attempt to hit the satellite fails , there may be time for a second attempt , but that would only come after an assessment that would be hours or even days after the first attempt .
Because the 5,000 - pound satellite malfunctioned immediately after launch in December 2006 , it has a full tank of fuel .
It would likely survive re-entry and disperse potentially deadly fumes over an area the size of two football fields , officials have said .
The Navy plans to fire at the satellite as it enters Earth 's atmosphere at an altitude of about 150 miles .
Officials want the missile to hit the edge of the atmosphere to ensure debris re-enters and burns up quickly .

The Missile Defense Agency estimated the cost of a sea - based attempted intercept at $ 40 million to $ 60 million .
Without any intervention , Pentagon officials have said they believe the satellite would come down on its own in early March .
The option of striking the satellite with a missile launched from an Aegis cruiser was decided upon by President Bush after consultation with several government and military officials and aerospace experts , said Deputy National Security Adviser James Jeffrey .
" If we miss , nothing changes , " said NASA administrator Michael Griffin .
" If we shoot and barely touch it , the satellite is just barely in orbit " and would still burn up somewhat in the atmosphere , he said .
" If we shoot and get a direct hit , that 's a clean kill and we 're in good shape , " he added .

NASA : Shuttle 's end may cost 2,300 jobs in Houston NASA : Shuttle retirement may cost 2,300 jobs in Houston

As many as 2,300 people , most of them contractors , could lose their jobs at Johnson Space Center as the shuttle fleet nears retirement in two years , NASA officials predicted Tuesday .
In the first report of its kind to Congress about the expected drawdown in the space agency 's work force , the officials said the reductions would come mostly from the ranks of contractors .
The number of permanent civil servants would essentially remain flat .
The officials did not predict the timing of the cuts across the space agency but said that they may begin near the end of the current fiscal year , which ends in September .
Between 5,800 and 7,300 workers throughout the agency would lose their jobs over the next three years .
The losses at the space agency 's Clear Lake complex could amount to as few as 400 jobs through 2011 if work quickly picks up on the Constellation program , the initiative to build a successor to the shuttle for missions to the moon and Mars .
That would depend on an increase in congressional funding and support by the next president .
As the date for the shuttle 's retirement nears , the space agency will continually revise the projected job losses .
" This is a snapshot in time ... clearly a work in progress , " said NASA spaceflight chief Bill Gerstenmaier .
" We need to be careful we do n't overreact to these numbers and send an unintended message to our work force that there will be these huge drops , because we honestly do n't know , " Gerstenmaier said .
" There are a lot of variables that need to be worked out . "
Currently , Johnson Space Center employs about 16,800 workers , including those involved in the development of the next - generation spacecraft and management of space station and shuttle operations .
Retirements not factored in
About 82,000 people work at the space agency 's 10 facilities in the United States , including major installations in Texas , Florida and Louisiana .
One of the best - known , Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral , Fla. , where the shuttle is launched , faces the biggest loss .
Between 5,900 and 6,800 workers , out of a work force of about 9,000 , were projected to lose their jobs , even though Kennedy will also serve as the launch site for the next spacecraft .
President Bush gave NASA a new direction in the aftermath of the 2003 Columbia tragedy , the agency 's second shuttle disaster , when he set NASA on a course to return to the moon .
Leading an international effort , the space agency will establish a lunar base as a steppingstone to Mars and other deep - space destinations .
Bush set 2020 as the date for the first lunar mission .
NASA responded by initiating the Constellation program , an agencywide effort led by Johnson Space Center to develop a combination of capsules , rockets and lunar landers .
Congress has required the space agency to update the unemployment projections every six months .
Tuesday 's initial estimates of job losses do not account for retirements .
About 25 percent of the shuttle 's work force will be eligible to retire by the time the winged ships touch down for the last time .
NASA had once planned to ground the shuttle Atlantis after a mission to overhaul the Hubble Space Telescope later this year , but officials now are weighing whether to assign the ship additional missions to finish assembling the international space station by the mandatory retirement date .
The space agency plans to begin launches of the Orion moon capsule and Ares I rocket by March 2015 on missions carrying up to six astronauts to the space station .
Work on the Orion and Ares I is led by Johnson and NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama .
Johnson would get Altair
In order to return to the moon with astronauts , NASA intends to award contracts for the Ares V , a larger rocket with a powerful upper stage , and the Altair lander .
Marshall would lead development of the Ares V and upper stage , while Johnson would supervise the Altair work .
NASA would like to select contractors for those projects in 2011 .
" Our biggest threat is not showing the work force that we have a stable future , " said Rick Girbrech , a senior NASA official who joined Gerstenmaier for a news conference .
In Congress , some lawmakers are battling what they call " the gap , " the five - year period between the shuttle 's retirement and the inaugural flight of the moonship .
Rep. Nick Lampson , D - Stafford , whose district includes Johnson Space Center , expressed hope that a drive to give the space agency an additional $ 2 billion could be restarted in Congress .
" If there is a way to shorten the gap and put more money into NASA , then we should address the jobs issue , " Lampson said Tuesday .
" Raising this issue to a high priority will not be easy . "
The jobs issue has also been under scrutiny by the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership .
" It would not be fair to say there will not be a drop - off , but I do n't think anyone can say it will be a major drop - off , " said Bob Mitchell , the partnership 's president
He predicted that commercial space companies would create jobs as NASA turns its attention to the development of a moon base .
The biggest threat to Johnson 's employment , Mitchell said , would be attempts by other NASA installations to wrestle away work that has traditionally been managed in Houston .

What do airlines do when their annual fuel bills double ?
For one thing , they put their planes on a diet .
With fuel now an airline 's single largest expense
( followed by labor ) , CNN reports that carriers are desperately trying anything that will save money at the pump .
Reducing aircraft weight is one strategy , so the airlines are going over their planes with a fine tooth comb and tossing anything that is n't absolutely necessary .
You have to give it to the airlines , they 've left no stone unturned .
Just how far are they going ?
US Airways is chucking meal carts and replacing them with models that are 12 pounds lighter .
They 've also tossed the glassware in first class in favor of less jet - set but lighter plastic cups .
Carriers also are pulling magazine racks , trash compactors and ovens
( because honestly , what U.S. airline is broiling up hot meals these days ? )
American Airlines has all but called in Jenny Craig to shave weight from its fleet , pulling in - seat phones and their heavy wiring , removing lavatory power converters and investing in lighter silverware for business class passengers .
American , which has something of a reputation for chopping costs ( its legendary former CEO Bob Crandall once bragged that he saved the airline $ 40,000 by removing olives from first class dinner salads ) , has fired up the troops by forming an employee - driven " Fuel Smart Team " charged with continually searching for ways to save energy .
Though it should be noted that American was lambasted earlier this year for flying a 225 - seat Boeing 777 from Chicago to London with just five passengers on board .
Does lightening a plane 's load really make much of a difference ?
The airlines think so .
JetBlue says removing extra trash bins and other supplies will shave $ 16,000 off their daily fuel expenditure from each three hour flight .
US Airways says using lighter beverage carts will save $ 1.7 million in annual fuel costs .
American expects to cut fuel consumption by 111 million gallons through its weight reduction efforts , and the airline 's Ned Raynolds says that the Fuel Smart program is saving the airline $ 200 million a year .
But airlines are balancing the urge to slim down with the need to maintain appearances , especially in first and business class .
Facing competition on long - haul routes from far sexier international airlines ( ever seen the first class cabin on one of Emirates ' planes ? ) the major US airlines have been making big investments in premium class seating , dining and service .
When it comes to wooing the big - money passengers , plastic cups probably are n't going to cut it , no matter how much fuel they save .

__1859 : __Egyptian workers under French engineers begin construction of the Suez Canal .
The canal was not the first to link the Mediterranean and Red seas .
Egyptian pharaohs , Persian kings and Roman emperors had built small canals linking the Nile to the Great Bitter Lake and then from the lake to the Gulf of Suez .
These canals periodically fell into disrepair and were eventually abandoned when Europeans first navigated around Africa .
Emperor Napoleon of France wanted to build a canal at the start of the 19th century , but his surveyors told him that the Red Sea was 30 feet higher than the Mediterranean , and that a canal would flood the Nile Delta and cause untold damage to the Mediterranean .
Environmental concerns aside , they were wrong .
The two seas are at the same elevation , and the surveyors , working in wartime conditions , had made too few observations and had not made them well .
Napoleon scrapped the idea .
Napoleon met his Waterloo , but the idea did n't go away .
A canal across the Isthmus of Suez could cut the ocean distance from Europe to Asia by up to 6,000 miles , and it could be built at sea level , without any locks .
So Viscount ( and diplomat ) Ferdinand Marie de Lesseps founded La Campagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez ( Universal Company of the Suez Maritime Canal ) in 1858 to dig the ditch .
Amid allegations of slave labor ( from the British , who did n't like the idea of the French controlling the shortest route to India ) , workers removed more than 2,600 million cubic feet of earth – 600 million from dry land and another 2 billion dredged from underwater .
Of the 1.5 million Egyptians who worked on the canal , as many as 125,000 died of cholera .
Construction was interrupted several times by economic and political problems .
The total original cost of building the canal was about $ 100 million ( about $ 1.5 billion in today 's money ) , about twice the engineers ' estimate .
However , about three times that sum has since been expended on repairs and improvements .
The canal opened Nov. 17 , 1869 , with a procession of international royalty .
The partying went on for two weeks .
The effect on world trade was immediate , shortening the route between Europe and India , the East Indies , China , Japan and Australia .
The canal opening came just six months after completion of the U.S. transcontinental railroad .
The two wonders shrunk the globe rapidly , together enabling Jules Verne 's fictional adventurers of 1873 to travel Around the World in 80 Days .
Today , the 101 - mile canal is the longest in the world without locks .
It 's been widened from 72 feet to 200 feet .
It was originally navigable to ships of 26 - foot draft ; now it accommodates up to 62 feet , with plans to deepen it another 10 feet by 2010 to allow supertankers to transit the canal .
The Suez Canal has just a single shipping lane for more than half its length , with several wide bays to allow northbound and southbound ships to pass .
Ships take on local pilots and travel in escorted convoys .
About 15,000 ships make the 11 - to - 16 - hour passage through the canal each year .
The Egyptian government says the canal bears about 7 percent of world shipping .
De Lesseps ' success of building a sea - level canal through the desert landed him the job of building the Panama Canal , but he met his own Waterloo there :
The French effort to cross that isthmus was defeated by mountains and malaria .

As 2007 drew to a close , the tally of detainees released from Guantánamo throughout the year rose to 122 , as another 10 Saudis were repatriated , to add to the 53 sent home between February and November .
With 492 detainees now released  and 281 remaining  the administration ’s initial claim that the prison housed the " worst of the worst " grows ever more hollow .
It should be noted , however , that , unlike most of the other detainees freed last year , the Saudis were not sent home because they had been cleared by the military review boards convened to assess whether they still posed a threat to the United States , but because of successful diplomatic negotiations between the U.S. and Saudi governments .
After initial doubts , the Americans seem satisfied that the Saudi government ’s rehabilitation program  which involves psychological counseling , religious reeducation , job training , art therapy , and financial support  is proving successful .
Even with this caveat , however , it appears that none of the 10 Saudis just released was involved with al - Qaeda or the 9/11 attacks .
Like many others released in the last few years , four were Taliban foot soldiers , mostly recruited through fatwas issued by radical sheiks in their homeland , ordering them to aid the Taliban in their inter-Muslim civil war against the Northern Alliance , which began long before 9/11 .
Four others were missionaries or humanitarian aid workers , including one , the charity director mentioned above , who had long been regarded by the Americans as a major player in al - Qaeda and the Taliban .
Of the remaining two , the status of one is still difficult to ascertain , even after six years in U.S. custody , and the story of the other  Bandar Ali al - Rumaihi  is completely unknown , as his name does not correspond with any of the names on the Pentagon ’s lists of detainees .
The Taliban Foot Soldiers Captured in Afghanistan
Three of the four Taliban foot soldiers were captured during the surrender of the northern Afghan city of Kunduz in November 2001 , six weeks after the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan began .
Twenty - one - year - old Mishal Saad al - Rashid was typical of numerous men captured at this time in his insistence that he went to Afghanistan , over a year " before any problem happened in America , " to help the Taliban fight Gen. Dostum and Ahmed Shah Massoud of the Northern Alliance .
He was confused that the Northern Alliance had formed a coalition with the United States , as the only coalition that he knew of was between the Northern Alliance and Russia .
Although this confusion , repeated by several other detainees , was partly due to the propaganda issued by the pro-Taliban sheiks in Saudi Arabia , it also had some basis in fact , at least in the case of Dostum , who had fought with the Russians during the Soviet invasion , before switching sides in the early 1990s .
In his tribunal at Guantánamo , Rashid accepted an allegation that he was a member of the Taliban and also acknowledged that he had received military training in Afghanistan .
He was one of several hundred Taliban fighters who surrendered after the fall of Kunduz , believing that they would be freed after handing over their weapons .
They discovered , instead , that they were to be imprisoned in Qala - i - Janghi , a fortress run by Gen. Dostum .
After lax security enabled some of the prisoners to stage an uprising against their captors , the majority were killed during a week - long battle with the Northern Alliance , backed up by U.S. and British Special Forces and supported by American bombing raids .
Responding to an allegation that he had taken part in the uprising he exclaimed , " What uprising ?
We did n’t do any uprising .
We had given up our weapons , so how could we be part of an uprising ?
They [ Dostum ’s troops ] were the ones that had all the weapons .
We tried to defend ourselves , but we could n’t because they had the weapons . "
Also held in Qala - i - Janghi was 22 - year - old Nayif al - Usaymi , a college student , who explained that , as with several other detainees , he had been inspired to travel to Afghanistan to receive military training so that he could fight in Chechnya .
After a facilitator " provided him with instructions on obtaining a Pakistani visa as well as a specific route to take , " he arrived in Afghanistan in March 2001 , where , after meeting two men who told him the history of the Taliban , he agreed to be recruited , and spent eight months on the front lines at Khawaja Ghar , in northern Afghanistan .
Captured after the fall of Kunduz , he was taken to Qala - i - Janghi , but reported that he managed to escape from the fort .
This was a rare occurrence , as most who tried to do so were shot and killed , but he was recaptured six weeks later .
In Guantánamo , he insisted that he " never saw any fighting because he was stationed at the rear of the front line , " and it was noted that he was regarded as " being of low intelligence or law enforcement value to the United States and also as unlikely to pose a threat to the U.S. or its interests " by a Saudi delegation in 2002 .
The third foot soldier , 18 - year - old Khalid al - Ghatani , was recruited through a notorious pro-Taliban fatwa issued by the octogenarian Sheik Hamoud al - Uqla .
After traveling to Afghanistan in autumn 2000 , he spent six months at a camp named Pakistani Center No. 5 and then moved to the front lines at Khawaja Ghar , where he " guarded sleeping quarters / bunkers for Pakistani troops who fought at the front lines . "
He was apparently captured after being shot by a sniper and spending time in a hospital in Kunduz .
After his tribunal , the presiding officer noted that he " did not fire his weapon at any soldiers or persons , " and mention was also made of al - Ghatani ’s own statement that he went to Afghanistan not to fight for the Taliban but to receive weapons training and to " stand guard . "
He was , however , criticized for his behavior in Guantánamo , where , apparently , he had been " cited for assault , hostile activity , and harassment of guards on numerous occasions , " and once for " making a weapon "  although how this would have been possible , in the paranoid , security - obsessed cell blocks of Guantánamo , was not explained .
The Taliban Foot soldier Captured in Pakistan
In the summary of evidence against the fourth foot soldier , 25 - year - old Abdul Hakim al - Mousa , it was alleged that he traveled to Afghanistan for combat training and was recruited in Saudi Arabia by someone who " introduced him to the safe house system . "
According to this account , he subsequently spent time at safe houses in Quetta , Khost , and Kandahar and was arrested on Feb.
7 , 2002 , with at least a dozen other detainees in a safe house  or a number of safe houses  in Karachi that reportedly belonged to Abdu Ali Sharqawi .
Also known as Riyadh the Facilitator , Sharqawi is a supposedly " high - value " detainee , described as " part of the al - Qaeda network responsible for moving Arabs to and from Afghanistan . "
Subjected to " extraordinary rendition " after his capture , he was sent to Jordan to be " interrogated " by the Americans ’ proxy torturers in the Jordanians ’ notorious General Intelligence Department prison in Amman , where , he said , he was tortured continuously .
" I was told that if I wanted to leave with permanent disability both mental and physical , that that could be arranged , " he explained in a statement made in April 2006 that was released last month .
" They said they had all the facilities of Jordan to achieve that .
I was told that I had to talk , I had to tell them everything . "
In January 2004 , he was rendered back to a secret CIA - run facility in Afghanistan , where he stayed until September 2004 , when he was finally transferred to Guantánamo .
Unlike Sharqawi , the other men captured in the raid were transferred to Guantánamo after processing in the U.S. prison at Kandahar airport .
Several of these men , including two Kuwaitis , have already been released , and there is no evidence that most of the others  including Mousa  had anything to do with al - Qaeda .
In Guantánamo , it was noted that a Saudi delegation had deemed him to be " of low intelligence or law enforcement value to the United States , and unlikely to pose a terrorist threat to the U.S. or its interests . "
Mousa ’s own explanation for his presence in Afghanistan was rather weak  he said that he traveled " to defend himself against thieves , defend Saudi Arabia , and learn how to shoot a weapon for the purpose of hunting "  although the Americans ’ allegations were no better .
Desperate to pin something on him , they resorted to guilt by association , alleging that one of the people he was captured with attended al - Farouq and " was escorted by a senior al - Qaeda member to a meeting where he presented money to Osama bin Laden , " and that another attended al - Farouq and " was present at a speech given by Osama bin Laden at the camp . "
The Missionaries
Two of those released maintained throughout their imprisonment that they were missionaries .
Twenty - eight - year - old taxi driver Jamil al - Kabi explained that , in 2000 , he " sold his taxi and decided to devote more time to the Dawa , or ‘ the call . ’ "
After starting his mission in Mecca , by " going out and finding young Muslims who were not following the word of Islam and trying to get them to the mosque , " he then spent six months in Lahore , the home of Jamaat - al - Tablighi , the vast , worldwide missionary organization whose annual meetings in Pakistan and Bangladesh attract millions of followers .
Despite the size of the organization and its avowedly non-political manifesto , U.S. authorities have persistently maintained that it was actually " used as a cover to mask travel and activities of terrorists , including members of al - Qaeda . "
In Kabi ’s case , his subsequent missionary ventures in Indonesia and Malaysia attracted generic allegations , unrelated to him , that Tablighi " recruits " from both countries traveled to militant training camps in Pakistan .
Describing the circumstances of his capture , Kabi said that , after traveling to Karachi , where he stayed at the Tablighi mosque for a month , he met four men and traveled with them to Kabul .
He said that he stayed for four months at the Wazir Akbar Khan mosque and continued the Dawa , aided of one of his companions , who " helped him translate with people who did not speak Arabic . "
When Kabul fell to the Northern Alliance , in November 2001 , he said that " word began to spread " that the Alliance soldiers " were killing all of the Arabs . "
He and his companions fled to Jalalabad , where they stayed for a month before walking through the mountains to the Pakistani border , where he was captured .
The status of the other purported missionary , 21 - year - old Abdul Rahman al - Hataybi , had not been satisfactorily explained by the time of his release , even after nearly six years of interrogation .
According to the allegations against him , after failing his military entrance exam he was " immediately contacted by a recruiter for al - Qaeda " and sent to Afghanistan , with all his expenses paid , to train at al - Farouq , a camp for Arab recruits established by the Afghan warlord Abdul Rasul Sayyaf in the early 1990s but associated with Osama bin Laden in the years before 9/11 .
Although the U.S. administration claimed that he had been " identified as a member of al - Qaeda by a foreign government service " and reported that his name had been found on various documents recovered in raids on suspected al - Qaeda safe houses , Hataybi ’s own story was consistently at odds with the American version .
The authorities acknowledged that he was a member of Jamaat - al - Tablighi , but they largely overlooked his insistence that he had worked only as a missionary .
In a number of comments listed under factors favoring release or transfer , Hataybi said that he " traveled to Pakistan for the sole purpose of providing missionary work to those individuals in need of assistance . "
He claimed " never to have set foot in Afghanistan , " having conducted all his missionary work in Karachi and Lahore , and he also claimed that " a Pakistani police intern tortured him , and forced him to say that he was part of al - Qaeda and that he had traveled to Afghanistan for the purpose of jihad . "
He added that he " lied because he wanted the torture to stop . "
The Humanitarian Aid Workers
Of the three humanitarian aid workers , the first , 19 - year - old Ziyad al - Bahuth , was captured by Pakistani forces after crossing the border in December 2001 .
He explained that he took 90,000 riyals ( about $ 24,000 ) from Saudi Arabia to help the poor people in Afghanistan , and said that he gave the money to a man named Mohammed Khan to distribute via the Taliban , adding that he stayed for approximately a year to see how the money was distributed .
Bahuth admitted attending a Taliban training camp near Kabul for a week .
He also admitted that he spent time in Kabul with a known member of the Taliban who , he believed , facilitated his weapons training in order to encourage him to join the Taliban , but Bahuth denied that he either joined the Taliban or had any relationship with al - Qaeda .
His tribunal was particularly noteworthy for the following exchange , which , while possibly demonstrating a healthy skepticism on the part of the U.S. authorities , could also demonstrate how little they understood about the charitable obligations of Islam :
" Presiding Officer :
When you were around 18 years old , you raised 90,000 riyals to take to a country you had never been to before to give the money to the needy and the poor people .
Is that right ?
" Detainee : Yes .
" Presiding Officer : That is remarkable . "
The second humanitarian aid worker , 29 - year - old Abdullah al - Utaybi , said that he left Saudi Arabia with $ 30,000 and traveled to Turkey , where he was looking for a wife .
After the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan began in October 2001 , he said that he " decided to travel to Pakistan to offer his assistance and cash to Afghan refugees . "
He stated that he flew to Pakistan but was captured at a checkpoint in Quetta , near the border , where the money was discovered and he was seized and handed over to U.S. forces .
Utaybi maintained that he had never set foot in Afghanistan , even though several unnamed individuals alleged that he had been the director of the Herat office of al - Wafa , a Saudi charity , based in Kabul , which was blacklisted by the U.S. authorities in September 2001 for alleged ties with terrorism .
It has not been possible to establish whether there was any truth in these allegations , but one man who would certainly have known is Abdullah al - Matrafi , the director of al - Wafa in Afghanistan , whose inclusion in the latest batch of released detainees was genuinely surprising .
The Director of a Blacklisted Charity
A father of three , Abdullah al - Matrafi , who was 38 years old at the time of his capture , had directed a fundraising committee in Bosnia and worked as an imam in Mecca before establishing al - Wafa .
At the time of his release , he was presumably aware that most of the other detainees who had worked for al - Wafa had been freed , as their claims that they were involved in genuine humanitarian aid work were accepted one by one .
He , however , was regarded as a " high - value " detainee , against whom was stacked an array of allegations of his deep involvement with both the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
After the invasion of Afghanistan began , Matrafi sent his family to safety in Pakistan but stayed on in Kabul , even though the organization ’s stores were the targets of bombing raids , in which seven aid workers were killed .
He finally left the capital when he was seriously injured in a bombing raid , and his family last heard from him on Dec. 10 , 2001 , as he was about to board an Emirates flight from Lahore to Dubai .
He never made it onto the plane .
Abducted at the airport by U.S. agents , he was transferred back to Afghanistan and put on the first flight to Guantánamo .
Little was heard about him in Guantánamo , although it was clear that the authorities regarded him as a major supporter of terrorism , alleging in his tribunal that he knew Osama bin Laden , that his plan to provide funds to bin Laden for training caused disagreement within al - Wafa , that he admitted that al - Wafa purchased weapons and vehicles for the Taliban , and that he " negotiated a deal that allowed the Taliban to direct al - Wafa ’s activities . "
In his review boards , further allegations were added , including claims that he " admitted he took orders from Osama bin Laden , " that he " provided financial support to al - Qaeda after the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001 , and that he purchased medical laboratory equipment for a microbiologist who was " developing anthrax for al - Qaeda . "
Set against these allegations , however , were a number of counterclaims , which , typically , were ignored when the authorities declared him an " enemy combatant . "
On several occasions , Matrafi stated that there was no relationship between al - Wafa and al - Qaeda , " explaining that al - Qaeda disliked al - Wafa , and both organizations were in disagreement . "
It was also noted in the summary of evidence for his second review board that two months before 9/11 , he met with bin Laden at his house in Kandahar .
Matrafi stated that the purpose of the meeting was " to discuss unresolved issues " from a previous meeting " concerning disagreements between al - Wafa and al - Qaeda . "
A brief survey of Matrafi ’s statements before his capture is sufficient to explain his refusal to accept that he was affiliated with terrorists .
In October 2001 , after al - Wafa was blacklisted , Matrafi appeared on the Arabic news channel al - Jazeera , protesting his innocence and offering to open up the organization ’s accounts to public scrutiny .
In addition , two detainees in Guantánamo who had worked for al - Wafa backed up his statements .
Ayman Batarfi , a Yemeni doctor who tended wounded soldiers during the battle of Tora Bora , pointed out that , although al - Wafa had a good working relationship with the Taliban , this was required to pursue its humanitarian work .
Both Batarfi and another man , Mustafa Hamlili , an Algerian - born Pakistani resident who has been cleared for release but is still in Guantánamo , reinforced Matrafi ’s claim that the organization was regarded with suspicion by al - Qaeda because of its Saudi links .
Batarfi may , in fact , be the alleged " al - Qaeda facilitator " mentioned in the summary of evidence from Matrafi ’s first review board who identified him as " having problems with Osama bin Laden because [ he ] had come to do charity work in Afghanistan and was funded by the Saudi royal family , who Osama bin Laden rejected and denounced . "
This source added , moreover , that Matrafi " would take Saudis from al - Farouq and try to send them back to Saudi Arabia . "
What was largely overlooked , however , was an even more compelling statement on Matrafi ’s behalf .
In May 2006 , an audiotape from Osama bin Laden , whose authenticity was not called into doubt by U.S. intelligence , explicitly stated that two detainees in Guantánamo  Matrafi and the al - Jazeera cameraman Sami al - Haj  had no connection whatsoever with al - Qaeda .
None of this helped him , however , and what probably counted against him more than anything else was the discovery , in August 2002 , of a store of chemicals in offices used by al - Wafa in Kabul , which included " 36 types of chemical , explosives , fuses and terrorist guide books . "
Whether this had anything to do with him is unknown .
His brother , Mohammed , reiterated that the organization had no links to al - Qaeda .
" My brother and I have repeatedly said we have no terrorist links , and that any organization , official or non-governmental , is free to come and investigate our headquarters , " he told the press , adding , " We are only helping the Muslim people of Afghanistan . "
Time alone will tell what the Saudi government makes of Abdullah al - Matrafi on his return .
But like the allegations against his workers that disappeared like a malevolent mirage under scrutiny , it may well be that those who vouched for him were correct in their appraisal that he was the head of a charity that was required to work with the Taliban but that was otherwise committed to bringing humanitarian aid to some of the most deprived people on earth .

Lead generation marketing helps take the dreaded cold calling out of the sales equation .
Types of Marketing Lead Generation
Lead generation marketing comes in many forms .
Digital lead generation is very important in today ’s marketing world .
Leads can come from search engines like this search engine marketing company or from email marketing tactics and beyond .
Capturing leads through website forms is a very simple form of lead generation .
Did your company put on a presentation ?
Consider adding the presentation to your website with a gated form to generate leads .
Social media marketing can also be a fruitful source of lead generation .
As people like and interact with your company or organization they can be used as leads .
Social media is another easy way to gather leads .
Facebook , in particular , is a popular and powerful lead generation tool .
If you implement the Facebook pixel onto your company or organization ’s website you ’ll gain many insights into who your potential customers are .
Twitter ’s lead gen cards are also useful in social media lead generation .
Email marketing is a common form of lead generation for many companies .
Consider segmenting your email list in order to target specific groups of people through email marketing .
Most email marketing services allow you to see who has opened , clicked , or even unsubscribed from your mailing list .
Start Lead Generation Marketing

The appeals court , the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit , ducked the question in January , which was easy to do because the company on the losing side raised it only after the court had already issued its decision .
The company , Translogic Technology , was frank in explaining the delay : it had not known of the issue until Professor Duffy published his article .

Last month , Translogic asked the Supreme Court to consider the question .
Some provisions of the Constitution are open to interpretation , but some are clear .
The Constitution says , for instance , that some government officials may be appointed only by the president , the courts or “ heads of departments ” like the attorney general or the secretary of commerce .
But a 1999 law changed the way administrative patent judges are appointed , substituting the director of the Patent and Trademark Office for the secretary of commerce .
Jennifer Rankin Byrne , a spokeswoman for the office , said 46 of the 74 judges on the patent court , the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences , were appointed under the new law .
“ That method of appointment is almost certainly unconstitutional , ” Professor Duffy wrote in his paper , first published last summer on an influential patent law blog .
There are two possible contrary arguments .
One is that the patent judges are not the sort of “ inferior officers ” to whom the Constitution ’s appointments clause applies , but instead mere employees ( and thus inferior to inferior officers ) .
But the Supreme Court has already ruled , in Freytag v. Commissioner in 1991 , that special trial judges of the tax court are inferior officers , and the patent judges have more power and discretion than they do .
The other possible argument is that the director of the patent office is entitled to appoint the judges because he is the head of a department .
The Freytag decision “ pretty clearly forecloses ” that argument , Professor Duffy wrote .
Freytag said the departments referred to in the Constitution are “ executive departments like the cabinet - level departments . ”
But the patent office is part of the Commerce Department , and its director is an under secretary of the department  not its head .
Two residents in Basra describe conditions in the city and what they know of the fighting between Iraqi forces and local militia .
RAAD , BASRA
The Iraqi Prime Minister has given the militia 72 hours to leave Basra I think the worst fighting is in Hayania district , it 's the poorest area of Basra and a stronghold of the Mehdi Army , but it 's a bit far from us to know what 's really going on .
There is not much fighting where we live in al - Janina district , but we can hear the fighting in al - Jumhouriya - a poor neighbourhood a couple of miles away .
The government started this operation without warning , so we were caught off guard .
We are stuck in our house , unable to go out and buy food .
No shops are open anyway .
People have already started to ration their food .
The water supply has been cut .
I do n't know why - maybe it's because the water engineers are staying at home like everyone else .
I think the state forces are winning the battle , but they are fighting from a distance and not going in house to house yet .
The troops fighting now came from Baghdad .
I think the national forces do n't trust the local men to crack down on the militia
We definitely support the government in trying to enforce the law .
The only way they can do it at the moment is through force .
I think they have left it too long , actually .
Over the last few months the militias have become really unruly , they have been getting away with whatever they want .
The Mehdi Army is the worst - especially the breakaway elements .
The militia which belongs to the Mayor 's Fadhila party is also very bad .
The current head of police is a good person who wants to confront them , he is just unable to do so .
The troops fighting now came from Baghdad .
I think the national forces do n't trust the local men to crack down on the militia .
ALI AHMAD , BASRA CITY CENTRE
The Iraqi army has imposed a curfew , so we can hardly leave the house .
We live in the city centre ; it seems the Iraqi army is in control around here .
We welcome the Iraqi army , we think they will be able to take full control of Basra , and restore law and order
From what I have gathered from people I know in the Mehdi Army , their men do n't have enough ammunition to hold out for very long .
The gunfire and artillery fire around the city intensifies every two hours .
I live close to a hospital , and though I havent seen any of the killed or wounded , I can hear lots of ambulance sirens .
I phoned members of my family who live in other areas of the city .
They say they have seen lots of casualties in areas like Hayania and Tamimia .
We still have electricity here , however , the cost of food and fuel has risen dramatically .
For example , a gas canister used to cost 6,000 Iraqi Dinars and now it is 15,000 Dinars .
My family was ready for this , we managed to store fuel and food before the fighting began .
However , many others did n't and so they are struggling to get the basics for their families .
The Mehdi Army men are only here out of self - interest .
They wanted to take control over every aspect of life in Basra for no reason except gaining more power and control .
My family and I welcome the Iraqi army in the area .
We believe they will be able to take full control of Basra , and restore law and order .

What are these ?
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- J.P. Morgan Chase & Co JPM , - 0.84 % CEO Jamie Dimon said Thursday that Bear Stearns BSC , - 10.00 % , which Morgan has agreed to buy , has borrowed $ 25 billion from a new Federal Reserve facility established to loan money directly to investment banks with trouble financing their business .
Dimon , along with Bear CEO Alan Schwartz , are testifying in front of a Senate Committee Thursday .
Doron Efrati was assigned to the Kfir Brigade , part of an infantry battalion that was especially created to serve in the West Bank following the outbreak of the second intifada .
He figured if he was going to be drafted anyway , he would agree to serve in the Israeli - occupied territories , " to see what really happens , and maybe to change things , " he says .
" But I did n't succeed . "
Today , he is one of 39 recently discharged soldiers whose testimonies are part of a grim new report on the situation in the West Bank city of Hebron , where the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) oversee a volatile population of 700 to 800 Jewish settlers living amid nearly 170,000 Palestinians .
The 118 - page report , which tells of systematic mistreatment of local Palestinians by both soldiers and settlers , was released during this week 's Passover holiday .
The timing is not coincidental .
Forty years ago this week , a small group of far - right religious Israelis , led by Rabbi Moshe Levinger , wrangled with a reluctant Israeli military establishment to hold a Passover seder in Hebron , revered as the burial place of several biblical patriarchs and matriarchs .
Rabbi Levinger , who saw in Israel 's 1967 military victory over the Arabs a heralding of a Messianic - era redemption , rented hotel rooms for himself and his followers the following Passover , and refused to leave .
Today , his flock constitutes the only Jewish settlement inside a Palestinian city .
The report , put out by the nongovernmental group Breaking the Silence , is meant to challenge what the group sees as a growing assumption by Israelis that Israeli - Palestinian friction in the West Bank has quieted down since the Al - Aqsa Intifada petered out around 2004 .
" A lot of people come and say , ' Oh , that 's all in the past , ' " explains Yehuda Shaul , executive director of the group , which has brought 3,000 people on eye - opening trips to Hebron .
On the contrary , he adds , he sees abuses as increasingly institutionalized .
" The whole point of Breaking the Silence is to understand the moral price tag of a military occupation . "
Asked to respond to the group 's report , an IDF spokesman said in a written statement , " All IDF soldiers of all ranks are instructed to follow a strict set of moral guidelines which dictate codes of conduct in combat settings .
IDF soldiers operate according to these guidelines , which determine the way they are expected and instructed to behave at all times . "
But in the report , 39 recently discharged soldiers who served in the Hebron area between 2005 and 2007 describe a pattern of repeated violations .
Mr. Efrati is one of the five who have made their identities known ; most offered anonymous accounts .
The IDF does not investigate " anonymous complaints , " said the spokesman , who asked not to be named in keeping with Israeli army policy .
One of Efrati's worst experiences started when some Palestinian kids threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at his unit when he was out on patrol in south Hebron .
About 40 minutes afterward , he says , other soldiers in his unit identified and shot dead one of the youths who threw a flaming bottle .
He was 11 years old .
" It was reported in the Israeli media later that one terrorist with a Molotov cocktail was killed , " he recalls , sitting in a Tel Aviv cafe .
" I did n't feel so good , but most of my friends did n't care , and we had so much to do .
These things were happening all the time , " he says .
The IDF spokesman said that in the event of an incident , " Officers from every unit that comes in direct contact with the civilian population in the West Bank take steps to ensure that similar incidents , whether commonplace or highly unusual , are never repeated . "
But Efrati describes numerous actions he witnessed on a regular basis .
One involves locking an entire family into one room , and then using the rest of the house – the roof included – as a base .
He says that in one such mission , in the village of Tarkumiyeh near Hebron , soldiers stayed overnight .
Additional jeeps with sirens came in the morning , trying to draw a crowd .
When the stones started flying , soldiers were able to shoot from the roof .
Michael Manekin , one of the leaders of Breaking the Silence , which has collected testimonies from more than 500 soldiers , says that 's a " fixed procedure . "
Efrati says the only explanation given for the operation is that there were " a lot of terrorists in the village . "
He says that on one occasion where he witnessed clear violation of policy – he saw an army comrade hitting someone who was already handcuffed and calm , he complained to his commander .
The answer ?
" Let 's leave the dirty laundry in the company . "
Efrati also describes regularly being sent on late - night missions that involved raiding homes in the wee hours of the morning , turning over the house and searching for weapons .
This often was carried out for the purposes of " mapping " – keeping track of who lives where – but he and most others who gave testimonies for the reports said that this technique was not carried out to target specific militant activity , but to instill fear .
" It 's done because we want the Palestinians to feel that we can be anywhere at anytime , " he says .
" The first time you enter some family 's home , you feel , why am I doing it ?
But then after two , three times , you get used to it . "
Efrati's stories are far from the worst in the report .
The testimonies include details of beatings and detaining Palestinians for checks without reason and making them sit or squat in uncomfortable positions .
According to one troubling testimony , a soldier who gets annoyed at the sight of a Palestinian farmer whipping his donkey decides to ride the man and give him a taste of the same .
The soldiers describe a constant stream of settler violence and vandalism against Palestinians , some of which is captured on the extensive camera system through which the IDF monitors what happens in the city .
But if the report is correct , the footage is rarely turned over to the police to prosecute settlers .
Some of the most damning testimonies have been given on condition of anonymity – some soldiers fear legal action , and others are afraid of the social pressures to keep quiet .
Says Mr. Shaul : " I hope that by doing this , it will get people to break their silence earlier . "

Snowball :
An elephant uses his trunk to compact the snow
The elephants at the African Lion Safari in Hamilton , used their trunks to gather the snow and pile it high to create the massive ball of ice .
They worked hard to compact the snow and the structure was so stable that one of the safari park workers could stand on it .

What do you get when you combine William “ Captain Kirk ” Shatner and the Commodore Vic20 ?
Geektastic advertising is what you get
Yes , the ad that most sums up my childhood .
He was n’t lying – I really did learn computing with this beast !
You have to give Commodore credit .
Who else at that moment in time summed up “ space age ” more than the guy who boldy groped green alien hotties where no other starship captain had dared to before ?
Hey , you should check out the AdSavvy Show !
As you look at advertising on other blogs , forums , and websites , you might come across advertising rates that are broken down into CPM .
CPM stands for Cost Per Mille , or basically cost per thousand views .
So if a site has its advertising set at $ 5 CPM and gets 10,000 page views , then the cost to you is $ 50 .
Some advertising does n’t give you the CPM value , but it can still be quite important to calculate this yourself as a larger site with more traffic might seem like a good deal , until you realize you are paying $ 100 for every 1000 advertisement views .
The formula to calculate the CPM is :
CPM = Cost of Ad / ( Page Views / 1000 )
The standard for most blogs seems to be around the $ 3 CPM mark , as this is the point where the site is able to profit from their work , and the advertiser does n’t feel like he or she is getting a bad deal .
Depending on the site though , CPM rates can vary from $ 0.01 all the way up to $ 100 .
Really , as an advertiser or a site owner you have to decide what is most worthwhile to you .
Read / WriteWeb , a very popular site I enjoy , has a CPM of $ 20 .
And so for a 160×600 Banner on their site , the minimum cost for 20,000 impressions is $ 400 .
TechCrunch advertises a CPM of around $ 3 .
An advertising campaign with them for a 125×125 pixel graphic is $ 10,000 per month and requires a two month commitment .
eXtra for Every Publisher has a variety of advertising positions open , and using last months statistics , which we are blowing out of the water this month , you will see that my advertising rates are between $ 1 CPM and $ 2 CPM , which is well below the industry standard .
Why would a site owner go below the $ 3 CPM mark ?
I can think of two reasons of the top of my head , and eXtra for Every Publisher fits the first one : age and traffic focus .
eXtra for Every Publisher is a new site , having been created in July of this year , but because of how focused the traffic is , and how popular the site has become in such a short time , I think the advertising options here are an amazing deal .
The second reason why sites go below the $ 3 CPM mark is usually because they do n’t have focused traffic .
Sites like personal blogs , or generic informational sites are so broadly focused that their can be a limitation in how much success advertisers have , and as such , they do n’t want to pay as much .
A smart website owner will understand this , and adjust their advertising rates accordingly .
When do you go above $ 3 CPM ?
If you have built up a powerful brand , a popular site , and have decided to further monetize your site , then you can raise the rates of your advertising .
I think that there does come a point though where you will hopefully get so much traffic that you can charge $ 3 CPM and make $ 10,000 a month , but until that point , if you are the resource for a subject , and you know you can find advertisers willing to pay beyond the $ 3 CPM mark , then raise your rates .
You will know if you have gone too far as you wo n’t be able to sell your advertising positions , even with hard work .
The last thing you will want to consider is the amount of space you are giving an advertiser , and its positioning .
Larger advertisements and premium advertising space usually goes for higher rates than positions lower on the page and in smaller spots .
Final words
Getting advertisers , and setting your rates can be very difficult .
If you price too low , then you will have a full slate of advertisers , but you wo n’t be getting the most revenue return for your effort .
If you price too high , then you will have a hard time securing advertisers , and again may not make much revenue for your efforts .
Also , as a site grows and changes , it continues to become a balancing act .
There are some who have done very well for themselves through advertising , both at higher CPM rates , and lower CPM rates .
It all depends on the site , the advertisers , and the owner .
If you are looking for advertising that is focused on web development , making money online , problogging , and WordPress , then I suggest you check out my advertising page and contact me today .
Building and using dedicated networks
As we recently reported , the Internet 's backbone should be able to scale to handle the sheer volume of traffic that it 's expected to face in the foreseeable future .
But a number of factors complicate any analysis based on the simple volume figures .
Many services , such as VoIP and streaming video , create expectations of guaranteed bandwidth that may be tough to maintain in the face of vast volumes of spam and P2P traffic ; everything may get there , but not necessarily when we 'd like it to .
Meanwhile , problems with the " last mile " networks can obscure the capacity of the network backbone .
The academic world has faced similar issues for a while , and will soon be facing a flood of data from the biggest news in physics , the activation of the Large Hadron Collider .
The data gathered at the LHC , located at CERN outside of Geneva , will be distributed to a worldwide grid of computer clusters for analysis , which will require sustained transfers well in excess of 10 Gigabits per second .
To get a sense of how the academic world is solving its networking needs and what that might mean for the future of general networking , we spoke with executives at Internet2 and the European network provider DANTE .
Academic network structure
DANTE's GÉANT2 network
Despite differences in detail , both Internet2 and DANTE take similar approaches to providing academic users with dedicated , high - bandwidth capacity .
The groups lease capacity on what 's termed " dark fiber " — unused capacity on commercial fiber networks .
They then purchase equipment to light that fiber .
There is nothing special about that equipment , as the providers use the same hardware from companies like Juniper and Alcatel that commercial providers are using .
Both groups typically take the traffic from the dedicated fiber and hand it off to local service providers .
The precise details on how that happens differ due to the realities of geopolitical boundaries .
In the US , given that geographically remote locations fall within a single national border , these local providers are generally individual companies or organizations .
In Europe , where there are a multitude of national boundaries , DANTE hands data off to National Research and Education Networks , or NRENs .
These groups are responsible for actually getting the data into the individual research centers .
The networking capacity is typically divided three ways .
Some is allocated for a normal , packet - based network , with traffic contending for bandwidth as it does in normal , commercial networks .
In addition , both network providers discussed the allocation of dedicated Point - to - Point links , in which a bandwidth is allocated and guaranteed .
Finally , Internet2 maintains a parallel capacity that 's dedicated for experimental use , designed to test new protocols for enhanced data transfer .
So far , this structure has been able to easily handle the academic world 's capacity demands .
As Dai Davies of DANTE put it , " in earlier years , network capacity was the issue — that 's not true anymore . "
Davies suggested that , even if demand increased significantly , adding additional capacity would n't be a problem ; once the structure is in place , " adding capacity incrementally is cheap , " he said .
Internet2 links major US Universities
Success stories in science and networking
Both DANTE and Internet2 were happy to emphasize a number of cases where the networking capacity has clearly aided the scientific community .
One example both cited was the use of the network for radio astronomy .
Facilities like the Very Large Array pioneered the use of interferometry , which uses very fine timing information on signals received by physically separated receivers to reconstruct an image with far higher resolution than any of the individual receivers .
That reconstruction means that all the data needs to be on a single computer system at the same time .
Initially , this required that all the individual radio telescopes ship their data on tape to a single data center , a process that could take months .
Davies described how the costs for dedicated networking bandwidth wound up being in line with the actual shipping fees , while allowing the data to arrive at the center in real - time .
About the only ones that resisted the change , he suggested , were the few observatories that did n't have access to the dedicated network .
The staff at Internet2 ( we spoke with CTO Rick Summerhill and deputy operating officer Steve Cotter ) were also enthused about some of the research into networking that was being tested on their infrastructure .
They specifically described some research that was designed to limit the impact of the packet routing and acknowledgement that forms the basis of current TCP / IP communications .
To get around the problem that both sending and acknowledgement are sensitive to traffic conditions , researchers are testing a system where the initial packets of a large data transfer are used to determine the current traffic conditions .
If they 're favorable , most of the transfer then occurs via a large , point - to - point data flow , avoiding the overhead of the acknowledgements .
Both DANTE and Internet2 also discussed how the technology they develop for specialized uses makes its way back to the commercial arena .
In Internet2's case , the work they emphasized was in the software involved in data control , where the technology involved was designed to keep data on the Layer 1 network and out of routers for as long as possible .
Davies also described how his organization was frequently involved in the product development of the hardware that will eventually be running future versions of their networks .
After the jump we are printing the letter from Anonymous warning of the threats , along with the story of one " outed " Anonymous organizer who has permitted LAist to publish his story .
According to the latest from Anonymous , the precautions are needed , and the backlash has already begun .
Anonymous members are being publicly outed , and emails warn of threatening letters and DVDs being sent to Anonymous members by the COS .
For months , a group calling itself Anonymous has been running giggling circles around the Church of Scientology .
At the same time , caution is always advised - masks are worn , everyone is named Anonymous .
People are advised to park far away or take public transit , and use the buddy system to avoid being followed home .
The precautions seem almost a little over - the - top .
Recent email to Anonymous members
Anonymous ,
Over the last week a number of people have started receiving DVDs and hand delivered letters from Scientology .
These indicate that the person receiving the letter is part of Anonymous and that they should cease a decist , or else .
They are n't really clear on what they 'll do , and since we are n't doing anything illegal I would say that their actions are meant entirely as a scare tactic .
Do n't fall for it !
Facts :
Anonymous is doing nothing illegal .
Demonstrating is a first amendment right
If you are n't doing anything illegal , you can't be held responsible for something being done by someone else
Again , Anonymous is doing nothing illegal .
The Church of Scientology 's legal representation is trying to suppress free speech by scaring people with these packages .
They failed , twice , to get an injunction and a restraining order in Clearwater .
If they had a legal grounds to stop you from protesting , those injuction / order attempts would have been successful .
They failed , so these packages they are distributing to people that have gone to protests are misrepresenting the facts .
Long story short , do n't fall for their tricks .
One Outed Member of Anonymous Tells his Story :
My name is Gareth Cales .
My online alias within Anonymous is " Ath , " and sometimes " David
Mudkip . "
Previously , other organizers and some press knew me by the name Ryan .
I no longer have any reason to conceal my identity , and this is my story .
About a day after the anonymous video came out in January , " Message to Scientology , " I saw it on drudgereport.com .
It had been mirrored on breitbart.tv and Drudge had linked to it .
I was immediately interested , as over the years I had heard about Scientology .
There were just a few weird things here and there .
In this case , an eery sounding video led me to want to find out more .
I Googled Anonymous and was surprised at the number of sites that came up .
Somehow I found myself in the " Project Chanology " Wiki page .
This was towards the end of the denial of service Civil Disobedience , and so I found myself looking at more appealing options like " IRL Raids ( protests ) . "
I went on to the IRC server at the time and found myself in #xenu .
There were a number ofpeople consistently talking about the project and I watched as a number of people used their personal computers , without the use of botnets , to use acts of Civil Disobedience to raise awareness of the problem with Scientology .
At no point did I ever take part .
At one point I was asked to assist with some press related things .
This set off a relationship with several other Anonymous who were helping look after other regions .
I discovered that Southern California did not have an adequate " IRL Raid " being planned , so I decided to help work on it .
We created an irc channel , #socal , and recruited Southern California folks in to it from other IRC channels .
We set up a SoCal wiki page with contact information so an e-mail list could be generated .
A Myspace info page was set up as well as two Facebook groups to recruit people .
Ultimately we had a couple hundred emails on the list .
Another Anonymous , Rorschach , who has been a long time channer and veteran Encyclopedia Dramatica member , had also been on another list .
We merged the two together .
SoCal posted on boards , had people out fliering , and recruited from other IRC channels as the
movement began to swell .
February 10th was set as our protest date to coincide with the others , and we made calls to find out about permits and such .
Somewhere in here I was put in touch with Tory Christman , ex-Scientologist and former - OSA handler / operative , who indicated she would attend our demonstration .
We ensured that we needed no permits , and much progress was made towards a successful demonstration .
We held IRC meetings and generated great interest .
Multiple calls to the police from several sources confirmed that we did not need to obtain permits for our demonstration .
On February 3rd we did a scouting run , where Rorschach , myself , Tory Christman , and three other individuals walked around the church 's compound .
Prior to going to the compound , we met at Starbucks , where an OSA operative was present .
They have a very distinct look and she was very obvious about eavesdropping on us .
We had no masks , just beanie caps and shades mostly , and we were followed while on Sunset Blvd and L. Ron Hubbard Way .
As far as we could tell we were not followed away from the compound , but we could n't be sure .
Low - quality video of this scouting is available on Youtube .

I did some fliering with a friend on February 7th in downtown San Diego .
I did a KROQ interview on February 8th , 2008,2 and was in the LA Times : " ... a caller who identifiedhimself as a spokesman for the group Anonymous told a Times reporter that the group was not to blame . "
By this time all Internet - based civil disobedience was at a close .
I am sure some nefarious faxing and calling continued , but that was out of my domain , and out of my sight .
On February 9th , I drove up to Los Angeles with the friend from February 7th and stayed at Rorschach 's house .
We ate at a restaurant near his home and made good conversation with the bartender .
We chatted Online with people and received a number of calls to the " Partyvan " disposable phone that Rorschach had set up .
Everyone was in good spirits .
On Sunday morning , myself and my friend woke up early and went to Breakfast down the street .
We then came home and got dressed for the demonstration .
Rorschach proceeded to the Starbucks in the mall at Hollywood and Highland , and assisted those Anonymous in descending to the demonstration site .
My friend and I went searching for Guy Fawkes masks but were unsuccessful .
Fortunately , two masks were available to us when we arrived at the protest site .
I know for a fact that between those first 30 seconds on which I had no mask , and the February 3rd scouting , they got my picture a number of times .
At the February 10th protest there was an " Ice " van set up for a company that does not exist .
Information about this van can be found on Youtube .

We are not sure who was operating the van , but its presence with tinted windows ( and obvious purpose ) was disturbing .
There was enormous coverage of our event posted on Youtube , including articles in many publications .
The pictures for a front - page article in Radar magazine5 were taken in Los Angeles on 2/10 .
David Sarno of the LA Times wrote an outstanding article6 , which made the front of the Entertainment section , that was based partly on the 2/10 demonstration .
There was very little visible handling at the Hollywood 2/10 raid .
There were a lot of OSA operatives recording protesters and attempting to catch faces .
We proceeded from Sunset and LRH Way to three locations on Hollywood Blvd. , making sure our message got out there extensively .
The only incident of violence that occurred was perpetrated by a Scientology supporter .
The Youtube videos7 8 have the best coverage of this .
The authorities were very cooperative through this whole process , and it is worth mentioning that the church hired no off - duty law enforcement ( though they did have private security ) .
After the protest , Anonymous ' coverage in the media grew extensively .
I answered a number of
commentary requests from the media as did other SoCal anonymous members .
On February 16th , the evening before my 22nd birthday , I met with Graham Berry for the first time .
We discussed potential courses of action .
The same evening , an open party was hosted at which about 20 - 25 Anonymous members attended , as well as Tory Christman and Graham Berry .
This was a masks off situation , and to this day I believe that no one who was openly in our group was a plant .
There may have been a private investigator tailing people , but not openly .
It was at this dinner that I met a number of fellow Anonymous without their masks for the first time , and to this day I am glad that we made that connection as it has built some lasting friendships .
On February 27th , a website called Exscientologykids.com went live , administered by Kendra Wiseman , Jenna Miscavige Hill and Astra Woodcraft .
I was touched by Kendra 's personal story .
Socal Anonymous had a demonstration planned for March 1st outside of a Citizens Commission on Human Rights ( CCHR ) awards dinner .
CCHR is a known front group funded by Scientology , and their name is misleading as to their real purpose : ruining honest Psychiatrists .
It says as much right on their website .9 Kendra Wiseman 's father is the president of CCHR USA , so I made a sign that was specifically for him , to highlight the church 's policy of Disconnection : " Bruce Wiseman , why wo n't you be there to walk Kendra down the aisle ? Exscientologykids.com "
Disconnection is the church 's policy by which anyone who leaves Scientology publicly is forcefully cut off from their family and friends .
During the 3/1 protest , at which we had about 30 people and to which I brought an Anonymous by the alias " NigraJustice " , we identified a black SUV across the street from the Hyatt at which we were protesting .
The Hyatt Century Plaza hotel on Avenue of the Stars was our protest location .
Upon approaching this SUV with another anon with a camera , and one additional protester , the SUV drove off .
The gentlemen put their suit jackets in the windows , rolled the windows up , put their cameras back in the car , and screeched out of the drop - off area .
The police in charge of this jurisdiction were exemplary in every way and deserve to be commended .
Sometime around March 11th , Scientology posted a video labeling Anonymous a terrorist group , and blaming them for every single act of vandalism that had been allegedly perpetrated over the last two months .
Around this same time they also filed for an injunction in Clearwater against Anonymous protesters .
This injunction attempt failed twice , ultimately resulting in a successful 3/15 protest in Clearwater .
They went so far as to make up easily verifiable incidents , such as the egging of a Boston church .
Calls to the Boston PD indicate no such complaint was ever called in .
This lack of credibility coupled with their previous lies over the last 60 years makes it a simply matter to acknowledge that most of their claims are either fabricated , or self - inflicted .
The evening of Tuesday March 11th , Scientology held a " Confidential OSA Briefing . "
Operatives on the inside leaked the occurrence of this meeting in several cities , including New York City , Boston and Los Angeles .
We sent 15 people to welcome the gathering Scientologists .
Rorschach was somewhat rude to the security detail , but all accounts indicate he was just rude and not threatening .
Video allegedly exists that corroborates that account .
On March 12th I went to work from 3 AM - 5 AM for some unusual maintenance , and proceeded
directly to Los Angeles afterwards .
I parked about 2 blocks away from Rorschach 's house and
proceeded to take a nap for about 4 hours .
I woke up at 11:30 or so and began planning my afternoon .
I moved my car to the curb directly across the street from Rorschach 's and parked it at about Noon .
When I left at 1:30 , I noticed very obviously that the two middle air conditioning vents had been tilted all the way up .
This is not something that I , or anyone I have spoken to , will do .
Generally people just turn the A/C off .
I thought I might be a tad paranoid until later .
That same day I was speaking to the class of someone who I knew only as Blvdnights .
I was scheduled to speak to his class at the Art Institute of California , Los Angeles .
Tory Christman joined me and we had a great meeting with the students , all of whom were very interested in what we had to say .
I posted some fliers in their cafeteria area and headed down to the Farmer 's market around Fairfax and 3rd .
I distributed fliers with Blvdnights and another Anonymous , as well as Tory .
Thursday evening , March 13th , three videos went online identifying Southern California members of Anonymous .
The three people who were publicly identified were Rorschach , Blvdnights , and Nigrajustice .
All three are mentioned above , so I had close personal contact with these individuals .
This was my first indication that I was likely no longer safe .
Rorschach was identified as " Sean Carasov . "
Blvdnights was identified as " Ryan Benno . "
Nigrajustice was also identified but I am leaving his name out .
The following day two Anonymous from Clearwater were also named , but I do not have contact with those individuals .
On Friday the 14th , I spoke with Rorschach sometime after lunch and immediately noticed he sounded markedly out - of - sorts .
I asked if everything was okay and he gave me a very choked - up and somewhat irate account of having woken to go into his yard to find and feed the feral cats that he cares for .
He told me that he had found a pool of vomited blood and unidentified matter that looked like tissue - rather than chewed food - next to the dish for his cat Mudkips .
He immediately suspected foul play since the food smelled like ammonia .
This happened the morning after he was publically identified by Scientology on numerous sites .
They have a well documented history of animal and pet abuse used to send critics a " message . "
Sean lives around the corner from a Co$ ' Mission , ' making handling a simple matter .
I later advised Sean that since Mudkips had not returned and he sounded stressed out and angry , he should not come to the demonstration on Saturday , as the Church would no doubt attempt to provoke him .
He reluctantly agreed that his distress could cause a scene if they were to bait him .
Friday evening after work , I drove up to Hollywood and picked up another anon who goes by the alias Cora .
We went to a dinner with several other anon , a documentary crew and a magazine writer .
It was great to meet with everyone and served as a final meal under the premise of normality .
After dinner , I stayed at Cora 's apartment .
The following morning we departed for the demonstration .
The demonstration was already underway when we arrived .
A giant television screen had been set up to face the public , and they had a whole display up .
The church might have even had a few dozen people , possibly a hundred at most at any one time .
There was a 10 foot white tarp up around the entire compound blocking view , which had been there since Tuesday or Wednesday .
There were speakers that , any time a chant would start , the church would crank way up to try and overwhelm our noise .
Sadly for them , 600 people are hard to block out .
Anonymous spoke with Fox11,10 NBC4 , and a Spanish speaking Anon spoke with Telemundo .
We also gave comments to the LA Times , LA Weekly and the aforementioned magazine writer .
At first , the sidewalk on Scientology 's side was blocked off .
The off - duty , Scientology paid cops were also not allowing people over there .
After the true , on - duty police arrived we were permitted to stand over there .
Numerous fliers and pamphlets were passed out to passing drivers , and everyone was in a very good mood , despite the fact that L. Ron Hubbard Way 's sidewalks were illegally closed to us .
At some point , a private investigator or OSA agent with a gun was spotted , called out with a massive sign , and taken aside by some police .
He apparently produced a permit , but my understanding is that he should do a better job of concealing it .
He caused undue stress by having it visible .
Around 1:00 I stated to Sergeant Guillary that we would be taking about 20 people to the south side of the compound .
About 50 people ended up walking down that road with the Subway restaurant on the corner .
Once on Fountain , we walked over to LRH Way and lined up on the curb , such that the sidewalk was not blocked .
Around 1:15
I was standing with a sign held up that I was momentarily holding for another Anonymous , when one of the other Anonymous grabbed me by the shoulder and forced me to look at a sign above my head .
What I discovered were two giant signs that were laid out as such :
" Just for the Lulz . "
" Gareth Alan Cales
" Anonymous No More "
A photo of me with a mask on was juxtaposed with a photo of me without a mask on .
My home address was then listed .
Pictures and video will be included with this document .
Now I have to say , they picked a fantastic picture of me .
I had a sinister look on my face , was talking in a cell phone , and was glancing around to see if I was being monitored .
Clearly I had proper cause for concern about being followed .
Through all of this I remained perfectly calm .
About 2 minutes later I crossed the street to verify the legality of there display of my personal information .
Sergeant Guillary informed me that it was an act of " freedom of expression " that they were performing , and so I let the matter drop .
As I was walking away to contemplate my next move , the Sergeant called me back over .
He stepped out of his vehicle and we spoke privately .
He stated that I may want to work out whatever issues I might have with the church .
I indicated that I had no issues with the church and no prior involvement with them ; my issue would be resolved when they were stripped of their tax exemption .
The Sergeant praised my sense of idealism and made comments about how difficult it can be to change the system .
He then went on to indicate that I might want to call a certain number , because there are two sides to every story .
Some people were going to " call me , " so I might want to call them beforehand to give my side of a story .
I had no idea what he was talking about .
I thanked him all the same and indicated I would call him in the evening .
I stood about 10 feet off to the side of his vehicle , contemplating my revealed identity and deciding on a course of action .
As I stood there for 5 minutes or so , the only time I was alone through the entire demonstration , a male , middle - 40s / early 50s , somewhat out of shape OSA operative said behind me " Hey Gareth , I guess your buddy Sean could n't make it today . "
I replied , " Who ? "
He said " You know who I mean . "
I replied , " I do n't know who you are talking about . "
He then laughed as he walked off .
As I said earlier , Sean 's cat had been poisoned the previous morning .
I assumed that he was talking about this incident , and I was disgusted at how low they would sink .
I texted back and forth with an Anonymous who I needed to meet up with .
I also had an offer for a vehicle to leave the area .
I began making arrangements to depart , as my outing was causing an enormous distraction for the other Anonymous that were present .
As I stood across the street , the two sign carriers remained opposite , but mirroring any moves that I made .
As I crossed back to the LRH side of the street , the two sign carriers approached and fell in step .
I made arrangements to get some room from them and began walking back up to Sunset Blvd .
As I approached , an Anonymous associate obtained his vehicle .
I was escorted by a second associate and a number of other Anonymous .
Ultimately , the sign carriers targeted an individual other than myself ; I had taken my party hat off and I believe I managed to evade their view in the sea of people .
As soon as the associate pulled up , the second associate and I hopped in the car and we took off .
We circled the block once and picked up Cora .
As we took off , a Silver Toyota Sienna began following us .
We made a long circuit , returning once to pick up a final associate .
The five of us left the area with the van still in check .
Thus began a car chase ; our driver ducked in and out of parking lots , weaved through traffic and did other such necessary actions to shake the vehicle following us .
At some point we managed to lose them .
The action was fast paced enough that all we knew at the time was the plate started with the number " 6 " .
As the car chase was still going , I was on the phone with the magazine writer and David Sarno of the LA Times .
They both took notes as far as I know , and advised calling the police .
We spoke with Tory Christman during this event as well , and Graham Berry arranged that if we were to return to the picket the cops there would stop the vehicle following us .
We managed to lose the vehicle before this was necessary .
As a followup note , going back to the sign bearers , I understand that Mark Bunker of XenuTV recorded the individuals holding my signs going back inside the Scientology center .
This confirms that it was indeed Scientologists and not Anonymous demonstrators .
We were headed south on the 101 at this point , and pondering our destination to settle and plot a course of action .
We decided to go to Graham 's home as it seemed he was headed there himself .
Upon arrival , no one was home , so we went to a Denny 's to eat and wait for him .
He arrived at Denny 's at about 4:45 pm .
He took 6 pages of notes on my experience that day ; at the time everything was still fresh in my mind so I was giving him many word for word quotes .
Around 5:00 pm Graham called Sergeant Guillary for me .
Their conversation was apparently very polite and the Sergeant had some words for me .
He proceeded to apologize profusely for our earlier conversation , as he had thought I was Sean Carasov .
He told me that Sean had been arrested and was currently being taken to the Parker Center .
We found out later that he ended up meeting with the " Major Case " squad , which I understand works with the FBI .
His Miranda rights were read to him after he arrived at the Major Case squad , just before he was questioned , and not before .
After they finished with him he went to Parker Center for processing .
We wrapped up our Denny 's meal .
The three unnamed associates left .
Myself , Cora , Graham Berry and " Mr. X " drove down to the station , taking a moment to drive by the protesters at Jefferson Blvd .
which were getting underway .
They looked as though they had about 200 people at that protest , meaning about 2/3 of the Anonymous had predictably gone home .
It also appeared to have showered briefly .
I will leave it for someone else to tell how horrible the police were at the Jefferson Blvd.
event , since I was not there .
On arriving at the police station , Graham and myself went inside .
We were both admitted to the visiting area , but only Graham , as an attorney , was permitted to speak with Sean as visiting hours were over .
He made arrangements for a bail bondsman to come by , and collected as much information from Sean as possible .
Sean 's story is available elsewhere on the net , but he was charged with Felony " Criminal Threats " based on a comment he allegedly made Tuesday ( we still do not know what the threat was ) .
After departing the jail around 6:30 , I called another associate .
While on the phone , one of the people he was with phoned Graham .
Both indicated that they were being chased by a Silver Toyota van .
It turned out to be a Sienna with license plate " 6AUP602 " .
Based on this information , we believe it was the same vehicle that had followed us .
They had two photos of the vehicle chasing them while they were in a cab .
The cab driver attempted to lose the van but was unsuccessful , ultimately dropping them off at Union Station where they hoped to lose the private investigator .
We turned ourselves in the direction of Union Station and headed their way .
5 minutes prior to our arrival , they phoned to let us know that they had been stopped in the Station .
The Private Investigator had told their security that he had good reason to believe that the Anonymous individuals were carrying weapons , a blatant lie .
The Anonymous offered to be searched , but security declined and instead told them they could not proceed with their masks on .
Everyone sat and waited while the Transit Authorities showed up .
Two sheriff 's deputies that were also part of the Department of Homeland Security arrived .
Upon our arrival , Graham , myself and Cora rushed inside .
The Private Investigator had been told to leave and he apparently left quite frustrated .
Graham convinced the deputies that our members needed a safe area to change and remove their masks if they were going to be forced to travel maskless .
They were taken to the back room and courteously monitored as they changed .
After this success , we parted ways and Cora and I ultimately made it back to my vehicle .
I dropped her off and went to stay with another associate .
I got a great night 's sleep , and the following day made calls to a number of press organizations .
I informed them what had happened to me , and that they were now permitted to use my real name : Gareth Cales .
I do not care that Scientology has my identity now ; it also does not bother me that some Anonymous out there will disown my allegiance now that I have a name attached to my alias .
The fact of the matter is I am on the same side , I can do more with a name , and the Church will soon regret the PR Flap that comes as a result of outing the SoCal anons .
I went home in the early afternoon on Sunday and had a night of chuckling over IRC .
The next couple of days were largely uneventful .
I met with HR on Monday and explained my situation to them .
They documented it in full and asked what they could do to help .
Tuesday evening , March 18th , a video was published online exactly like the five previous videos that I mentioned labeling people as members of Anonymous , and by association , " Terrorists . "
This video had my photo and name in it , effectively sealing my outing .
On Wednesday , March 19th , I noticed several things that may or may not have been coincidences .
Some will likely call me paranoid , but I am simply noting these things in the event that any of them turn out to be something more than just odd .
This morning when I went to shave , I noted that the remainder of my shaving gel had been expelled in to a spot next to the shaving gel canister .
It was a small amount and had foamed up like it was done several hours before .
The canister was now empty .
When I went downstairs to my car , I noticed that the gas cap had been opened and unsealed .
I replaced it and went to work .
At around 2:00 pm , I received a call from Facilities .
They said that Security had noted that my gas cap was undone .
I went outside and found it had , and replaced it again .
I had a conversation with our head of security and he had been informed of what was happening to me .
He wished me luck and said he would keep both his and his colleagues ' eyes open .
This is my story thus far .
As it continues I will add further text , but so far it has been very eventful and full of foot - bullets for Scientology .
Anyone interested in contacting me about this story can e-mail hitsut@gmail.com for comments .

February 10th 's protests .
To this day , no Anonymous has ever taken credit ( do n't forget , an anon will always take credit for what [ s ] he does as it is part of our culture ) and so I firmly believe we were not involved .
In the past , the Church has attacked itself to discredit critics , so I would n't rule out that possibility .

See LAist 's previous coverage of " Anonymous . "
In January I did a post on economy “ It ’s the economy , stupid ” mindful of the 1992 Clinton campaign buzzword .
Developments at the stock markets shortly thereafter made me pick up the topic again , here , here and here .
Today ’s record gold price of $ 1’000 per ounce and the unbridled slipping of the US $ against all major currencies .
On top of that a $ 111 barrel oil price , and no end in sight .
I guess it ’s time to revisit the topic .
What ’s on the news today ?
Six Hedge Funds are on the brink , totalling a net worth of $ 4 billion in assets .
Hedge Funds are “ snapping like twigs ” according to a Private Equity executive .
The US retail sector takes a battering .
Consumer spending tumbled and shows clearly , that the US economy is in recession .
Home foreclosures rose 60 % and bank seizures more than doubled in February .
Number of workers on unemployment benefits highest in two and a half years .
What is considered a remedy may in fact even worsen the problem .
Rate cuts are increasing the inflation .
Above all , hover the mindboggling costs for the Iraq war :
Much of the problem , economists say , is that every month of combat adds more than $ 10 billion to a U.S. debt that now tops $ 9 trillion .
(…)
At some point , government debt comes due and the Treasury Department either must pay it off or roll it over and pay more interest , just like a family facing monthly credit card bills .
The issues will increasingly play a role in the next general election .
The Pennsylvania primaries will most likely be about economic issues , too .
Bloomberg takes a look at Senator Obama ’s and Senator Clinton ’s tax plans .
The candidates better be prepared for more scrutiny .
Speaking of the primaries :
It took a dogged blogger to point out to the mainstream media , that they have their delegate numbers wrong .
Barack Obama gained more delegates in California , than reported and add to that Texas , which , as we know was won by Senator Obama , not Senator Clinton , all votes considered .
Speaking of bloggers , our fellow critter “ gorn ” has predicted the Texas outcome a full week before the Best Political Team on TV !
I wish you all a good and healthy day !
Senator Barack Obama gave his speech on race yesterday in Philadelphia .
His audience was the whole country , if not the world .
But it ’s worth considering what effect the speech might have on his immediate audience in Pennsylvania , which holds the nation ’s next primary on April 22 .
The Obama campaign often says it needs to “ introduce ” Mr. Obama to Pennsylvania , which is another way of saying that voters there do n’t know him .
The campaign clearly made a decision that the benefits of introducing him with a high - profile speech assessing the nuances of race in 21st - century America were worth the potential risks .
Those benefits would be most evident among those already supporting him : black voters in Philadelphia and part of Pittsburgh ; affluent white liberals , most of them in Center City Philadelphia and the suburbs ; Independents and possibly moderate Republicans ; and students and other young people , particularly those against the war in Iraq .
These groups form the kind of coalition that Mr. Obama has built in other states and that are likely to form his base in Pennsylvania .
“ He did take a risk , but he saw this as something bigger than his candidacy , bigger than this election , ” said Camille Charles , an Obama supporter who is an associate professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania .
This was an essay I wrote in 2008 for a University class .
A Comparative Study of Corporate Identity Design between the 1970 ’s and the 1990’s .
Corporate Identity in the modern world is a critical part in the success of any business and comparing the complex marketing and branding strategies used by corporations throughout the 70s and 90s , will illustrate how to achieve corporate identity success , and why it is important .
To define ‘ corporate identity ’ is a controversial task , however , for the purpose of this discussion , corporate identity will be defined as ‘ the group of pieces , aspects , ideas , methods and techniques that your brand needs to be identifiable .
Your company ’s corporate identity can be formed by many of the pieces that form a communicational style : logo , letterhead , business cards , folder , inserts , envelope , etc. ” ( Corporate Identity Designer , 2007 )
Without doubt or debate , the most crucial and critical part of any corporate identity is the face of their company – their logo .
As online source ( Magnetik , 2007 ) reveals – “ How your business presents itself to the world can be the difference between success and failure .
Your logo is the central piece of identity that communicates the character of your business .
Its main function is to create and reinforce your brand identity . ”
An annual study by brand consultants , Interbrand and JP Morgan ranked Coca Cola ’s brand in its own right , as the world ’s most valuable at $ 69.6 billion .
( Interbrand , 2005 ) thus proving how meaningful a brand can be .
Exploring and evaluating logo designs from the 70’s and the 90’s , and the evolution of different logo designs from these time periods will give a better understanding of what factors contribute to a successful design .
But first , what makes a good logo design and how can this effect the way logos are designed ?
A Sydney graphic design company by the name of Magnetik ( 2007 ) claims that there are 6 main factors in producing a quality corporate identity logo , as summarized below .
After reviewing these factors , an analysis and comparison of images produced throughout the 70s and 90s will be undertaken , as well as a case study into particular logo designs .
In short , as suggested by Magnetik ( 2007 ) there are six main factors that can contribute to a logo ’s design success which have been interpreted below .
1 . A logo should identify your business :
A logo should convey something essential about a business ’ identity .
The design should reflect a business ’ personality , its attitude , its sense of style , professionalism or fun , or whatever it the business is about .
A well thought out logo will promote those qualities and ultimately people will associate this with the business .
2 . A logo should be recognisable .
A logo must be distinct enough to make it recognizable , however unique enough to avoid confusion with other logos .
To do this , the logo must be easy to read and comprehend and customers must be able to recognize that logo , as that particular business ’ every time they see it .
3 . A logo should be memorable .
A logo design must make a strong impression and be interesting while at the same time , being simple enough to deliver a clear message .
It should leave a positive feeling in customers long after they have seen the logo .
4 . A logo should be adaptable .
A logo must be able to be used across a variety of media , from business cards and letterheads to presentations and packaging .
A good logo must be adaptable enough to work in any situation one encounters .
To meet these needs , a logo should look good in black and white as well as in colour .
In terms of size a logo should be simple enough to look good quite small on a business card , yet interesting enough to be by itself on a poster or billboard .
5 . A logo should be cost effective .
Business ’ logos are printed on all sorts of printed matter ; ( unless they are an online business ) so remember to consider the cost of colour printing .
A logo with a maximum of two colours will keep printing budgets manageable .
Avoid gradients where possible .
6 . A logo should stand the test of time .
A logo should be able to run with your business as your business grows which also contributes to the cost effectiveness .
A logo should not be changed too regularly as this dilutes the hard work the designer has put into branding .
A well - designed professional logo will continue to be representative of a business for years to come .
Analysis and Comparison
One could easily argue that the success of a logo design varies according to the above points as well as a range of other issues .
Some factors that could influence the logo design include : the type of business , the size and financial capability of the business , the culture and perception of different cultures and communities at that particular time , the context in which it is used in , the semiotics ( Chapner , 2007 ) and connotations ( Connotations and Denotations , 2007 ) of the logo as well as the epistemology ( Epistemology , Introduction , 2007 ) behind the design .
Consider a well established brand such as ‘ Apple ’ of Apple Inc , which is a perfect example of a successful corporate identity .
However , this was not always the case , as the company image , brand positioning and logo design has changed quite dramatically between the 70s and 90s .
Initially Apple Computer was a small business run out of a garage , and originally had quite an unsuccessful logo as seen to the left ( Apple Inc , 1976 ) .
Steve Jobs ( 1976 , online ) , co-founder of Apple Computer Inc. considered the 1976 logo design “ too intellectual to represent a brand , too detailed and intricate as a logo and , therefore , also unsuitable for reproduction in small sizes . ”
Apple Computer needed a logo that would be representative of their brand and one that could be reproduced in small sizes .
If an analysis of this logo is compared with the earlier points offered by Magnetik ( 2007 ) , one could say that the 1976 design did identify the business quite well ; however the text on the logo is quite illegible which ultimately would make the whole corporate identity forgettable due to the sophistication of the design .
The original logo from 1976 is also , far from adaptable , as one can only see the details when the logo is blown up to a large size .
Also , when the image is reduced to a small size , ie .
when placed onto a business card , the whole logo becomes totally illegible , which in itself indicates that the 1976 logo was not a success .
Consequently , the opportunity for an enduring brand identity through a cost effective design capable of standing the test of time was lost .
In comparison to this ineffective 1976 design is the ‘ new ’ Apple logo which was designed in 1977 , only one year after the original logo was made .
Steve Jobs recruited the talents of Regis McKenna Advertising agency of Palo Alto , to design a new logo for Apple Computer and in 1977 the new logo was unveiled .
By comparing this design to the 1976 design one can see how much more effective this logo design is .
Rob Janoff ( 1979 ) , creator of the new logo , comments on the design saying “ I think that people responded to the colours and the joke of the shape .
There ’s a little bit of a pun in the way that the shape is designed .
The bite that is taken out of it : it ’s not only the silhouette of an apple you could not take a bite like that out of any other piece of fruit shaped that way but byte is also a computer term . ”
One can effectively summarise the 1977 logo proving that
The logo makes the business recognisable .
The logo identifies the business
The logo is memorable
The logo is adaptive
The logo is cost effective
The logo has definitely stood the test of time
If the logo is then compared to the revamped Apple logo released in 1998 to the one in 1977 , one can see that it has not changed shape nor has anything been added , rather – it has been simplified .
The 1998 logo has had the colours removed and a new ‘ shine ’ glazed over the top of the logo .
By analyzing the new logo design one can see that the 1998 logo also adheres to the 6 factors of successful logo design outlined previously however it has been modernized to continue making the logo stand the test of time .
Shell Logo
Another great example of a successful corporate identity is the red and yellow face of Shell , and similar to the Apple logo , it is clean and simple a logo that represents the company making it identifiable .
Its strong communicational style leaves the responder with a clear image of the company in their head .
Shell has based their whole brand upon just their one red and yellow logo proving just how crucial an effective logo is to any business .
Shell ’s logo has virtually been unchanged for over 100 years which is why when one analyses this particular logo can conclude that it , like the Apple logo is a perfect example of effective corporate identity branding .
Shell Logo Evolution
By exploring an evolution of a logo one can compare the differences between each stage of a logos evolution and become aware of how a logo should change alongside the company ’s corporate identity branding strategy as well as keeping up with the technologies available at any given time .
As seen in the figure above , the shell logo has undergone a number of periodical changes throughout the last century .
Since appearing in the early 1900 ’s , the Shell logo has become increasingly stylized , reflecting the trend towards simplicity in graphic design .
( Hames , 2006 ) .
The logo designed in 1999 , with its bold shape and distinctive colours is still in use today as it easily recognized , memorable , adaptable and cost effective .
The shell logo which was produced in 1971 was used throughout the 70s , 80s and 90’s and was only changed in 1999 when it lost the text all together , thus proving how effective the brand has become .
The simplistic nature of the 1999 design proves that by adhering to the changing nature of the environment and technology around oneself , one can create and maintain a successful corporate identity .
However , one also must remember that it is not just the logo of a business that makes up a business ’ corporate identity ; in fact all things that are attached to a business should be directly related to the business ’s branding strategy .
For example , letterheads , business cards , reports , etc should match the business ’ style and ultimately their brand .
A further example as seen in the screenshot above shows how Apple Inc. has effectively branded all their products with their infamous Apple logo .
Furthermore , all of their products have a similar ‘ sleek and techy ’ style which is also matched by the style of their website .
All businesses should employ this simple , consistent method , along with a successful logo design to ensure that their corporate identity branding strategy is a success .
Bluntly put , to effectively present a business to the world in the most efficient and simple manner , a business should ensure that their corporate identity strategy has a solid and communicative style across the whole face of the business .
Examples of quality business identities have been shown to demonstrate what a successful identity may look like as well as proving that by having a strong and identifiable business branding identity or logo a business can flourish and relish the rewards .

Big Oil Before Congress : Just a Show Trial ?
Oil executives testify about the high cost of gas but change is unlikely .
May 22 , 2008  --
The top executives of the nation 's largest oil companies are once again being summoned before Congress to testify about the skyrocketing cost of gasoline .
But even before they were sworn in , the price of oil started to climb even higher .
Oil spiked overnight Tuesday and traded above $ 133 a barrel Wednesday , up more than $ 4 from yesterday 's close .
Oil prices have doubled in the last year and that has been passed on to Americans at the pump .
The average price of a gallon of regular gas now stands at a record $ 3.79 .
How Are You Dealing With Gas Prices ?
Tell ABC News
Looking for relief ?
Do n't expect thehearing to be any different from the last time the oil chiefs were hauled before Congress .
Or the time before .
Or the time before that .
This is at least the forty - fifth such hearing in the last five years .
Every few years , as rising oil prices hit consumers , the House , the Senate or both decide to call in the oil companies .
They hold grand hearings but then do n't take any action .
The last such hearing was on April 1 , and it started off with a bang .
" On April Fool 's Day , the biggest joke of all is being played on American families by big oil , " said Rep. Edward Markey , D - Mass . , chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming .
Wednesday 's hearing was no different .
" We need to get prices under control and back to competitive levels and we need to do it now , " said Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy , D - Vt .
Sen . Herb Kohl , D - Wis. , added : " The American economy is buckling under the weight of gas prices .
And while consumers and businesses suffer from these price increases , the oil industry seems only to get richer and richer . "
The oil executives blamed the rising prices mainly on supply and demand , while asking Congress to help strengthen American competitiveness by opening up new federal lands for oil exploration and production .
The oil executives were determined to get across the message that the market sets the price for what you buy at the pump .
" The point is that it 's not our profitability in this business that is driving the higher prices that consumers pay , " said J. Stephen Simon , Senior Vice President of Exxon Mobil .
" U.S. oil companies should be viewed as the key to the energy solution , not as scapegoats , " added John Lowe , Executive Vice President for ConocoPhillips .
But that 's exactly what the Senators did .
" You have to sense what you guys are doing to us , " said Sen. Dick Durbin , D - Ill. , who later called the oil companies " unconscionable "
" We 're on the precipice here and about to fall into a recession , " Durbin said .
" Is there anybody here who has any concerns about what you 're doing to this country ? "
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , said : " Apparently you have no ethical compass about the price of gasoline . "
She said the oil executives made it sound like the are the victims .
" I do n't think you are , " Feinstein said .
Election - Year Punching Bags
" The Congress feels the need to signal to voters that they are moving heaven and Earth to reduce gasoline prices and are investigating every single possible idea to do this , " said Jerry Taylor , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute .
While the politicians might endorse an idea in their rhetoric , Taylor said , they " wo n't necessarily vote for it or push very hard to get it adopted . "
The oil executives first appeared as a group before Congress on Nov. 9 , 2005 -- when oil had risen to $ 58.93 a barrel .
Just four months later , they were back testifying before another committee .
By then , oil had climbed to $ 63.10 .
They all last appeared on April 1 , the day oil hit $ 100.98 .
In the seven weeks since , oil has skyrocketed even higher , trading now at nearly $ 130 .
And with rising oil prices have come rising oil profits .
ExxonMobil recently reported $ 10.9 billion in earnings for the first three months of this year .
That 's up 17 percent from the year before .
And they were n't alone .
BP is up 60 percent ;
Shell , 25 percent ; ConocoPhillips , 17 percent ; and Chevron profits rose 10 percent .
The industry says in response to criticism about its profits that , yes , it is making billions of dollars but that it is also spending billions and billions of dollars to bring oil to the gas pump and to invest in finding new sources .
Even with these big profits , there is very little the oil companies can do to reduce the price of oil , which is set on world markets based largely on supply and demand .
As for Congress , Taylor said , " there 's virtually nothing that the Congress is discussing that would actually reduce gasoline prices .
" Politics demand that hearings be held .
Hearings are essentially show trials that politicians put forward periodically to provide compelling theater for voters , " he said .
" It 's an advertisement for the people on the committee for how hard they 're fighting for you -- the working man -- and your dramatic struggle against high gasoline prices . "
Ben Lieberman , senior policy analyst for energy and environment at the Heritage Foundation , echoed those thoughts , saying , " There 's been a large number of hearings about gasoline prices and oil prices , and not much new has come from it . "
" I guess it 's sort of a show trial more than anything else , " he added .
Lieberman said he does not believe that oil companies are manipulating prices .
If they could do so , he said , we would have been paying $ 3.80 for a gallon of gas our whole lives .
Additionally , as big as these companies are , they are tiny compared to the nationalized oil companies that actually control most of the world 's oil .
" To the extent that we are going to berate the oil executives , we ought to at least bring in somebody from OPEC , if they are willing to show up , and give them a little bit of the treatment as well , not that that would do any good , " Lieberman said .
But Josh Dorner , a spokesman with the Sierra Club , said that hearings do have some value .
" I do n't know that anybody is expecting a whole lot .
Hearings are hearings , " Dorner said .
But , he added , " I think it 's always good to get them on the record and ask them the tough questions and see what they are doing to make headway . "
The oil companies are receiving $ 18 billion in tax breaks over a 10 - year period .
The House voted last year and again in February to end those tax breaks and instead use the money to support wind , solar and other renewable energy sources .
The measure has not passed the Senate , and President Bush has promised a veto .
Dorner notes that Congress could push for a more comprehensive energy plan .
While that might lead to higher oil prices in the short term , it could reduce the country 's overall energy costs long - term .
" A hearing is not a solution to a problem , " he said , " but is a valuable tool to getting more information about a problem . "
John Felmy , chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute , was asked that question by a reporter on a conference call Monday : " Do you think having these types of hearings is helpful to the industry or ostensibly they are just there to be beaten up by members of Congress ? "
Felmy responded , " I think it 's helpful for the industry , for us to tell our story .
We 're open and engaged in this . "
It was n't always that way .
When the oil executives first appeared before Congress in 2005 , committee Republicans and Democrats fought over whether the executives would have to be sworn in .
( The oil companies also testified before Congress back in the 1970s . )
Republicans feared that the photo of the CEOs and company presidents with their arms raised would look bad .
When tobacco executives , also under fire , testified , they first had to raise their hands and swear to tell the truth .
That photograph appeared on many newspaper front pages and became a lasting image in the tobacco debate .
Ultimately , the oil executives were sworn in and that image did appear across the country .

The following are some snippets from the most recent issue of the International Forecaster .

US MARKETS ... The " Big Cull " is now underway as all the speculation , fraud , excess and profligacy of Wall Street and millions of unscrupulous borrowers get shoved up our derrieres in the form of hyperinflation and higher taxes .
When the various GSE's , where all the old ( and now new ) toxic waste is being buried , finally go under , it will be like the China Syndrome , a meltdown to hell .
The Fed 's general collateral will be used up by then , which will lead to direct monetization of treasuries and rampant inflation .
As well , the defaulted debts that are absorbed by the FHA , FHLB , Fannie and Freddie will result in much higher IRS bills as the hapless taxpayers are forced to bail out the cataclysmically decimated system .
When , we ask , are the citizens of this country going to have their fill of this bailout tripe ?
Make sure that every single incumbent other than Ron Paul is voted out of office or we will all be pauperized .
We characterized this situation as the " Big Cull " because that is exactly what is in store for the smaller companies in America , Canada , Mexico , Western Europe and Japan .
They will be culled out .
Note how only the large insider - banks are being bailed by the Fed , a private central bank which is owned by some of the very companies they are bailing out .
Talk about a conflict of interest !
Note also how mostly the various transnational conglomerates have any real earnings to speak of due to free trade , globalization , off - shoring , outsourcing , slave labor and a weaker dollar , and even some of these gargantuan concerns are in trouble .
The Fed is only giving money to big elitist insider companies , who are hoarding the cash out of fear , yes , but also they will be selectively withholding their largess from any who do not belong to the " Big Game . "
When hyperinflation from an out - of - control money supply finally hits home fully , consumer spending drops off a cliff and corporate earnings go negative , the Fed will be forced to turn to higher rates to save what is left of the dollar or face being run out of the country which by then will start to resemble Zimbabwe , and the whole system will crash and be purged in the upcoming " Very Large Depression " or , if you prefer , the " Much Greater Depression . "
Select insiders will be bailed out at taxpayer expense , while those insiders and non-insiders that fail will be merged with , or auctioned off at pennies on the dollar to , the surviving insiders .
The elitists have already made plans on which companies will survive and which will fail so they can place their bets accordingly .
The final number of businesses and financial corporations which fail in the upcoming economic devastation could well number in the tens of thousands worldwide .
Few companies will be able to survive the coming catastrophe without help from their governments and / or from the Fed or the other main central banks like the BOE , ECB and BOJ .
Even the Fed itself may be discarded and replaced with a far more malevolent cartel vehicle which is put in charge of everything financial as has been suggested by our " beloved " Treasury Secretary , Hanky Panky Paulson , on loan from Goldman Sachs .
It is all about driving out the competition so the Illuminati can reign supreme .
The President 's Working Group on Financial Markets was created by Executive Order 12631 , signed on March 18 , 1988 by President Ronald Reagan in the aftermath of the Stock Market Crash of 1987 .
Eleven years later , in 1999 , the Glass - Steagall Act ( GSA ) , which for many decades had prohibited a bank holding company from owning any non-banking financial companies , such as investment banks and brokerage houses , was repealed by the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act ( GLBA ) that was signed into law by President Slick Willie Clinton .
The GSA had been in effect since 1933 and was passed due to abuses , which were found to be a substantial contributing factor to the Great Depression .
This wise piece of legislation had kept us out of trouble for over six decades .
Both Executive Order 12631 and the GLBA will go down in history as the most ill - advised and most abused financial orders , laws and regulations ever devised , perhaps in the history of our country .
The Executive Order currently gives the PPT the right to enter any markets to create stability in the face of a crisis , but instead they use this power on a 24/ 7 basis to hide from the public all the damage that has been intentionally or unintentionally done to our economy by various Illuminist schemes , including the abuse of the GLBA which allowed banks to pawn off fraudulently rated toxic waste , which quite often the banks themselves or their subsidiaries had created , on their clients and to hold it for those clients in offshore accounts called SIV's .
There are many other versions of toxic waste out there that are waiting to implode , all of which were enabled by the unwise authorization of these incestuous relationships in the GLBA .
Asset - backed securities are going to be the next shoe to drop as the cash flows from car loans , credit card accounts , mortgages and such esoteric things as aircraft lease payments , which secure these derivative instruments , are interrupted by rampaging , ever - accelerating defaults on the underlying debt as the economy drops off into a hyperinflationary recession .
The PPT hides while the GLBA destroys .
That 's how it works .
These moronic acts by former Presidents and Congresses are what allowed the psychopathic creation of hundreds of trillions in derivatives by way of " financial engineering " in order to absorb the rampant money being supplied by the Fed to fuel financial sector profits in order to cover up the damage being done to the economy by free trade , globalization , off - shoring , outsourcing and illegal immigration .
The money was pumped in through the primary dealers via the repo pool and was loaned out to other foreign and domestic banks and to client dupes like hedge funds , insurance companies , pension funds and other institutional investors in order to purchase the toxic waste , often with maniacal degrees of leverage .
The sales proceeds were then re-loaned to the mortgage companies so they could fund more fraudulent mortgages which could then be securitized into more toxic waste for resale , thus rolling the money over and over , with the Fed 's periodic money injections allowing them to expand the amount of loan money available overall to keep the bubble going .
All caution was thrown to the wind to bring in even the unqualified so that the fees and commissions would keep rolling in .
Note that as of 2006 , the financial sector contributed about 8 % to our GDP , when in 1947 , it was 2.5 % .
That is because the financial sector no longer greases the skids for a healthy economy that produces real goods and services , but has become an industry unto itself , peddling toxic waste instead of funding the production of real goods and services .
It has become a self - perpetuating , gargantuan producer of poppycock and phony bologna , and has become the portal through which the Fed pumps in titanic amounts of money and credit to produce profits in the financial sector that help to offset the damage to US GDP which has been done by the latest incarnation of the British mercantilist system that has beggared our middle class .
This continual pumping of money and credit to cover the damage to our GDP has inexorably moved us toward a weaker dollar and hyperinflation .
The profits generated by this " puff the fluff " smoke and mirrors operation accounts for much of our so - called GDP growth , and also explains the wild growth in derivatives worldwide from about 80 trillion in notional principal in 1999 to today 's 600 trillion plus , with the credit default swaps portion of that total , now about 62 trillion , doubling every three years or so over the past decade .
We feel that Real GDP has been negative on average for almost two decades if you make adjustments for actual , as opposed to official , inflation and especially when you factor in the bogus contribution to GDP that has been made by our quickly deteriorating financial system , some 8 % instead of what used to be about 4 % before we started down this path toward insanity .
A good portion of the fees and commissions that comprise the financial sector 's contribution to GDP over the past decade have been generated by the fraudulent sale of worthless dot.com stocks and toxic waste OTC derivatives .
We ask what value has been added to our economy and what production has occurred when you sell worthless stocks or repackage existing loans that have been made to unqualified buyers , that are supported by inflated appraisals and that have been given fraudulent ratings ?
Where is the value added to the economy when substantial portions of what is produced is either worthless or worth far less than what is paid for it from the very outset .
It 's almost akin to the sale of new automobiles where a car 's value loses multiple thousands of dollars as they are driven off the dealer 's lot by their new owners .
At least with a new car the price is determined by the actual cost of the inputs and an established market value , instead of being valued by reference to artificially low rates of interest along with fraudulent , dreamed - up qualifications and appraisals and arbitrary , often imaginary , market values set by theoretical mathematical models .
We feel that much of the filthy lucre that has been produced by the financial sector over the past decade is nothing more than profits earned on Ponzi - scheme money that is rolled over repeatedly .
How can such profits possibly be attributed to our GDP with any intellectual honesty ?
Note how gold and silver are being held down by sales and leasing as they consolidate for the next move up , while oil is allowed to fly .
As soon as gold and silver start to rally , watch how quickly oil drops .
Large specs should be ready for this move which means nothing because it will be totally contrived .
The fundamentals will be just as strong as ever no matter what they do to oil because inflation and balance sheet destruction are both baked into the cake as our real estate markets and economy drop into the tank .
All those high oil prices are going to take their toll down the line in lower profits or higher inflation , just wait and see .
Also note that any new war adventures will most likely occur after both gold and oil have finished their spring rallies and are at much lower levels for purposes of consolidating what will be their most recent gains .
A hard but pointless pounding from the cartel can be expected for precious metals and commodities ahead of any new war adventure that is planned .
Kosovo , Iran , Lebanon and the Gaza Strip are all possibilities , and these possibilities will keep oil , precious metals and their related shares well bid while the various general stock markets get hammered by the imploding recessionary economy .
If a war does start , get ready for some wild action !
Note that Ron Paul took 16 % of the vote in Pennsylvania 's Republican Primary , beating Huckabee 's 11 % .
Yet we hear nothing about this in the media .
In fact , we do n't even hear it mentioned that Ron Paul is still a candidate .
Our media and our entire elective process are a disgrace .
We are governed by a two party dictatorship .
If any of the miscreants offered by the Illuminati are elected , we 're leaving the country .
Oh , that 's right , we already left !
And you might want to consider doing so also .
Another piece of disinformation appeared in the WSJ this past week .
Harvard Professor and former Chairman of the President�s Council of Economic Advisors , Martin Feldstein tells us the Fed shouldn�t lower interest rates any further because the likely benefit is small compared to the potential damage due to inflation .
This is true and it is part of the theme chanted at the G - 7 meeting .
Lower interest rates mean higher energy and food inflation .
That means riots in the third world and millions starving .
We wish they were concerned but they are not .
This is just a variation on a theme - propaganda .
In Mr. Feldstein�s dissertation nowhere does it refer to the massive increase in money and credit that goes on relentlessly .
If interest rates were raised the US economy would collapse even though they should be raising them not lowering them .
It is more important to save the economy , Wall Street and the banks .
Inflation and hyperinflation can always be lied about .
The other result is the collapsing dollar .
Yes , lower interest rates stimulate economic activity , but they also force wages and prices higher as well .
As we move forward this year and into next year unemployment and a receding economy will not impede monetary inflation .
Lower interest rates will exacerbate the situation , but the inflation is already in the pipeline .
What else can one expect with an 18 % increase in money and credit and lower interest rates that is in the pipeline for the next 18 months and there is no changing that .
The elitists know the solution to the food problem because they created it .
Just stop using food for ethanol .
Mr. Feldstein�s comments are generally true but he refuses to cover the whole subject when he certainly knows the answers we know .
Lower interest rates do tend to induce investors to add commodities to their portfolios , but that in part is offset by higher margin requirements , which exchanges put in place to protect their commercial dealers .
Investors are in commodities and precious metals because they want real assets not paper assets .
Feldstein cites lower interest rates as a cause for higher oil prices and food prices because farmers devote more production toward growing corn for ethanol .
He fails to mention the government�s $ 0.51 per gallon subsidy , which along with higher sales prices is an inducement .
In his dissertation nowhere does the word dollar appear .
The main reason for higher commodity and precious metals prices is a plunging dollar .
It �s a flight to quality and something real .
He also leaves out totally our current account deficits .
What we have is a totally one - sided story .
Not an informational commentary , but a clever piece of propaganda .
He is a mouthpiece for the elitists who planned this whole capper in the first place .
Yes , it is a crime to deliberately starve poor people to death .
Commodities are rising due to American debt , massive monetary increases and now lower interest rates .
It is now not only the US due to the credit crisis , the Fed , Wall Street and the money central banks created , but it is also other nations for the past four years that have also increased monetary aggregates by 14 % .
Again , it is just not interest rates .
Isn�t it an inevitable consequence of massive monetary aggregate expansion worldwide that we�d get inflation and speculation ?
And , lower interest rates are a part of it .
Global reserves have increased $ 2.5 trillion , or 85 % , in just the past two years .
The dollar is now dysfunctional and the entire world monetary and financial system is out of balance .
Again inflation and speculation have to be an obvious conclusion to profligacy .
We can expect nothing less in a world of fiat currencies .
Once the gold backing was removed from the dollar on 8/15/71 it was all - downhill from there and until we return to gold backed currencies the results will be the same � ultimately disastrous .
There is no gold reserve system to restrain monetary expansions .
There is no control and no discipline .
The result has been an historic inflation in dollar financial claims , which has destroyed the global monetary system and now it�s dismantling financial and economic stability .
The destabilizing price movements and myriad inflationary effects are poised to worsen .
Once the foreign buyers of dollar denominated assets have had enough the huge dollar reserves will hit our shores and inundate the system .
The Fed and all central banks are on the run and the credit crisis worsens .
Trillions of dollars and euros , etc. are being fed into the system in order to just keep it afloat .
The world financial system is being nationalized country by country .
There is certainly no end in sight of this monetary expansion .
The mortgage market is being nationalized via Freddie Mae , Fannie Mac and the FHA .
The same has been happening in banking as major investment banking firms too big to fail have been expanding assets by 14 % to 27 % over the past 38 weeks , almost all of that increase coming from the Fed as bank credit expanded 12.6 % .
During that period there was a $ 184 billion , 29 % , increase in foreign custody holdings for foreign central banks at the Fed .
All of these capital injections have for the moment stymied the systemic de-leveraging , but that is for now .
The inflationary implications are enormous and the solution to the problem is not at hand and we do not think there is one .
The outlook for our economy and financial situation looks dreadful .
There has been no solution in nine months and it looks worse than it did in August .
The Fed and ECB have stopped the bleeding for now but there is no solution in sight .
There is nothing ordinary regarding the credit breakdown .
Usually such corrections track economic developments , but not this time .
This time it is different .
The US government has assumed all the risk , which is a precedent in cost and scope for the American taxpayer .
The tide has been stemmed for now but not for long .
As Feldstein says you cannot cut interest rates forever nor can government guarantees continue .
Market manipulation by our government cannot continue forever .
It will eventually lose its effectiveness .
Besides there is nothing government or the Fed can do .
This collapse has to run its course .
The unbalance and maladjustment is simply too great .
Risk is being moved from one place to another .
From the markets to government , which is no solution , unless they want the dollar at 20 on the USDX .
While all this proceeds so will inflation in an over - liquefied global system that is no longer able to handle such a flood of aggregates .
We are in uncharted waters especially if you throw in derivatives .
All we can say is the world has lots of problems .

I ’ve just finished a fortnight ’s holiday which I ( foolishly ) spent mostly in front of a PC developing a never - ending little application .
But unexpectedly , despite the trivial nature of my project , I rediscovered a number of important lessons more usually associated with serious application development .
The software I ’m writing is a just a little Firefox plugin .
I ’ve been fiddling with it for so long we ’re almost onto the second major release of Firefox since I started , and yet it ’s probably not much more than a couple of hundred lines long .
You can see it really is a minor enterprise .
Despite this it ’s been quite a surprise — quite a shock , even — to be reminded of some industrial - strength truths in a small and personal environment .
And they are …
1. Damn , writing software is difficult
What we non-developers know about software we know either by observing or by talking to those who do it .
But anyone who wants to be trusted wo n’t complain about their job or bore you with details they know you do n’t want to hear , and so you ’ll never hear about everything there is to know about software development , even when you ask .
So one thing I discovered — again — is that writing software is really difficult .
Sometimes I was flying , but more often I was crawling : piecing together information from different sources , trying to understand what was possible , learning all kinds of technologies ( Javascript , XUL , XPCOM ) , trying use them well , but more often trying to get them to work at all .
It ’s made me respect all the more the people I work with every day who make it look so easy .
Every line you write is pure logic and needs to work 100 % .
This is not like writing a letter or a sales proposal , where a sentence that ’s only 95 % perfect is more than adequate .
This is like writing a legal contract from scratch for a particularly unpredictable world .
Every line needs to be watertight .
2. Simple design really is difficult
Simple design is another way of saying that the software should be easy to work with and modify .
You ’d think this would be hard to get wrong , particularly with something which is being built as new : surely you just add small , simple pieces one at a time , with each one adding the next feature on the list .
What could go wrong ?
I found out first hand that simple design is difficult to achieve , even in very simple scenarios .
For example , my application has a class which handles the user ’s preferences .
It needs to be initialised for when the application starts , and it needs to take and save the preferences when requested .
All this takes place within a single object .
So I wrote an initialisation function which set up the initial preferences according to how it ’s been configured , I tested it , and all was well .
Then I added some functions to take updated values and save them , tested those , and all continued to be well .
Total : about 20 lines of code over four functions .
Then I ran the whole in an integrated environment and weird errors started occurring .
It took me about two hours to figure out what was going on : it was a strange combination of unexpected start - up values , Firefox calling the initialisation function at unexpected times , and some confusing logic of my own which was supposed to protect double - initialisation .
In the end I decided the best solution was to throw out the whole idea of initialisation .
Now the object just takes and save preferences , and you can do that when the application starts if you want .
Total : 5 lines .
The point of this is that an apparently simple and obvious design was actually too complicated to sustain .
I ’m very pleased that the solution was to delete lines and simplify .
But I could only do this so easily because I had complete control of the code .
In other circumstances there might have been other systems which were relying on that initialisation code ( however flawed it may have been ) , and I might have had to add to the existing complications to solve my problem ; or I might not have had the time to take a fresh look at the code and simply built around the flaws out of a sense of fear of touching the wrong thing .
This is a tiny example from a tiny piece of work , but it showed me how easy it is to go wrong with a design , and how easy it is to produce software that is complicated , hard to understand , and time - consuming to fix and evolve .
3 . Learning a language is more about culture than syntax
I sometimes get CVs from people who claim to know about 10 programming languages , and I ’m always doubtful .
Just because you ’ve written an application in a language it does not follow you ’ve done it well .
Knowing the syntax is only the first step .
You also need to have good knowledge of any libraries , and finally you need to know how to work with the grain of a language .
This means you ’ll use different idioms , and structure your solutions in different ways .
In my own case I ’ve been writing Javascript , but it stinks because I ’ve tried to use it like Java .
I ’ve been stuck in my old Java ways , like creating classes and carving out a deeply - nested namespace .
It ’s Javascript , Jim , but not as we know it .
It works , it makes sense , but it looks clunky and … well , it just feels wrong , dammit .
Javascript is a prototyping language .
I can even tell you what that means , but only with my head , not with my heart .
I use the prototyping as a hoop to jump through to get it to do the Java-y things that I know I should n’t be doing in the first place .
Being a prototyping language does n’t mean Javascript is a second - class language , or a dumbed - down Java .
It means it ’s a different kind of language to Java and should be treated as a first class language with its own ways of getting things done .
It ’s a cultural thing , and you ca n’t claim to really know the language if you do n’t operate comfortably in its culture .
I do n’t really know Javascript .
4 . How did I ever live without automated tests ?
Possibly by not spending my holidays sat in front of a PC .
But aside from that , I continue to wonder at the marvel that is automated testing , and unit testing in particular .
To be able to implement a change and not have to trouble your brain about the consequences is very liberating , allowing you to move ahead with confidence .
It does take some work to set up the environment , but the results are worth it .
That said …
5 . Your automated tests wo n’t cover everything
In one of my functions I unexpectedly found a truck - sized hole which had gone undiscovered despite seemingly comprehensive automated test coverage .
( A loop which had a “ break ” when it should have had a “ continue ” , meaning great swathes of actions got skipped in most circumstances . )
I only discovered this through integration testing ( which is the fancy name I ’m using for what was really “ trying it out ” ) , and found that a quirk in my unit testing setup had caused the mistake to be missed .
Once I had found the cause I adjusted the main code to be more predictable and put in an automated test to trap the error , but it was only discovered through real hands - on testing .
6 . A strong IDE sustains motivation as much as anything
Although I was using Eclipse for development , when working with Javascript it really does n’t offer the comprehensive support you get with Java .
Because Javascript is a dynamic language , and no doubt also because of the state of JSEclipse , there ’s very weak support for code completion , refactoring and so on .
The consequence of this was a loss of code - writing speed , but much more than that I was suddenly able to see how easily a weak IDE allows bad software to be produced .
There were many occasions when I knew that I should tidy up or refactor something , but was then suddenly hit with a premonition of the tedious steps I ’d have to go through : working out which files to pick on , the manual search - and - replace , checking the context before I made a change .
I had to force myself to get on with the tidying up despite knowing how painful it would be , focusing on the long - term results , and safe in the knowledge that for this little personal project I did n’t have a deadline .
It became clear to me that so many people must come under a constant barrage of pressure , with only their current strength of character to defend against the pressures of deadlines and short - term wins .
It ’s inevitable that too often they will give in to those pressures , leaving cumbersome code building up , and ultimately gumming up the works of the system .
A strong IDE removes the barriers to those virtuous tasks of improving design and allows you not only to do your job , but to do it well .
7. Estimation is difficult
Which is just an excuse for the shameful truth : all my estimations were out by a factor of four .
This is embarrassing because it ’s not as if I ’ve never written software before .
In retrospect the mistake I was making was to look at the component parts of a task , guess how long they ’d each take , and add them up .
What I should have done was try to take the forthcoming work , identify similar previous tasks , and from past experience see how long they actually took .
At the end of the day experience is good , but it ’s how you use it that really counts .
8 . You ca n’t know all your requirements up front
This is familiar to anyone who ’s bought into Agile , but it hits home hard when it ’s you who ’s the user setting the requirements .
I ’ve written countless requirements specifications in the past ( in 60 - page documents , on task cards , wherever ) —
I thought I really ought to be clear - thinking enough to know my own requirements up front .
Wrong again .
As the UI came together , as one idea sparked off another , and as I had chances to step away from the code to think about things from a distance , I started to see that my feature set was really rather disjoint — almost random .
These were moments of clarity that on the one hand caused me to add requirements , but in doing so I was recasting the software with a new perspective .
I was starting to see what the software should be doing , which was not quite the same as what I ’d started out on .
Release date
Fortunately I ’ve not sent out a press release announcing a release date , held a press conference , or hired the London Eye for a glitzy media event .
I ’m just writing software for fun , and at this rate it ’s probably not going to ever see the light of day .
But even then , it ’s been startling to find that the germs of some of the Big Ideas of software development are still present in the smallest of projects .

1. Biggest Beer Selection
In 2002 , Dave Alexander of the Brickskeller , Washington , DC , received a Guinness World Record certificate for having the largest selection of beer in the world , a total of 1,072 different beers .
2. Most Beers In One Setting
Since the Guinness Book of World Records no longer tracks drinking records , we ’re not positive this is the record .
But Andre the Giant drank 119 beers ( standard 12 - ounce ) in a 6 hour stretch .
For those keeping track , that ’s one every 3 minutes .
Afterwards he passed out in a hotel hallway and for some reason no one could move the big man .
3. Biggest Beer Collection
Ron Werner of the USA was bestowed a certificate in 2002 for his collection of 11,644 different beer bottles accumulated since 1982 , including 7,128 that remain unopened .
Among this collection are 1,704 brands .
He has sampled almost every one of these brands .
4. Fastest Liter
On June 22 , 1977 , Steven Petrosino broke the World Record for drinking 1 liter of beer in 1.3 seconds at the Gingerbreadman in Carlisle , Pennsylvania , USA .
The previous record was held by Peter Dowdeswell of the United Kingdom , who drank 1 liter in 2.3 seconds .
5. Fastest Beer Mile
Jim Finlayson of Victoria , British Columbia , Canada holds the record time of 5 minutes , 09 seconds , set on 08 December , 2007 for completing the fastest Beer Mile .
Competitors must consume a 355 ml can of beer before running each lap , for a total of 4 laps , or 400 meters .
The fastest time wins .
A penalty lap must be run if the competitor vomits before completing the 4 - lap requirement .

Transcription and bolding by Super G .
HOST : ... Dr. Hirsch is a senior energy advisor at Management Information Services and Dr. Hirsch , thank you for joining us this morning .
HIRSCH : My pleasure .
HOST : You know , we 've been talking all morning long about energy prices .
Watching crude oil prices touch above $ 127 for the first time overnight leads a lot of people to start wondering about peak oil and the peak oil theory .
You 've been writing about peak oil for some time , so did you see this coming ?
HIRSCH : Yes we did .
Not quite the way it 's turned out , but this is not a surprise .
HOST : You say , " not quite the way it 's turned out " .
What 's happened that 's different from what you were predicting ?
HIRSCH : Well , I was n't particularly predicting .
I'm a student of this and have focused on what we do about the problem after it really hits .
Peak oil -- the idea is that it would hit a sharp peak and then production in the world would hit a sharp peak then drop off .
And what 's happened is that we hit plateau in world oil production , and that plateau has been ongoing since about the middle of 2004 .
HOST : Dr. Hirsch , there are a lot of people when we talk about peak oil who say there are going to be technologies that are always developed .
There will be new ways to get oil , whether it 's from coal , whether it 's from the oil shales , and they say that means we will never actually hit peak oil .
What do you say to those people ?
HIRSCH : They 're incorrect , and the reason that they 're incorrect is that they do n't understand the magnitude of the problem and how long it 's going to take to bring substitute liquid fuels on and to introduce energy efficiency on a massive scale .
That 's something that we analyzed and it takes decades .
And the reason , simply , is that the magnitude of the problem is enormous .
[ McTeer says we should drill more . ]
HOST : Dr. Hirsch , what do you say to that -- the idea that we should be drilling in places like ANWR and drilling offshore .
Would that solve this problem of a plateau in oil production ?
HIRSCH : There 's no single thing that 's going to solve this problem because it's as massive as one can possibly imagine .
And the prices that we 're paying at the pump today I think are going to be the good old days because others who watch this very closely forecast that we are going to be hitting $ 12 and $ 15 per gallon .
And then , after that , when world oil production goes into decline , we 're going to talk about rationing .
In other words , not only are we going to be paying high prices and have considerable economic problems , in addition to that , we 're not going to be able to get the fuel when we want it .
Oh my God !
I do n't care that Splatterhouse 2 was one of the most frustrating gaming experiences of my life -- any title that features telekinetic hanging fetus zombies that you chainsaw to death is the pinnacle of videogame achievement .
The news that a current - gen Splatterhouse game is actually being made has caused me to become so excited , I might just puke , here and now , all over my hands and keyboard .
EGM will have an exclusive first look at this retro revival , as one of old school gaming 's most blood - soaked franchises gets a fresh coat of paint for the current generation .
To whomever may be responsible for resurrecting this game , if you are reading this , let it be known that I will have your babies -- morality and biological impossibilities be damned !
There 'll be plenty of time for cynicism later , but right now , in my overexcited state , let me declare that this is going to be the GREATEST GAME EVER MADE !
[ Thanks , DarkTravesty ]

In November , 2004 , when he was nineteen years old , a marine I ’ll call Travis Boyd found himself about to rush the roof of the tallest building in the northern end of Falluja in the midst of a firefight .
Boyd , whose first assignment in Iraq was to the security detail at Abu Ghraib prison , had been patrolling the city with his thirteen - man infantry squad , rooting out insurgents and sleeping on the floors of abandoned houses , where they ’d often have to remove dead bodies in order to lay out their bedrolls .
With Boyd in the lead , the marines ran up the building ’s four flights of stairs .
When they reached the top , “ the enemy cut loose at us with everything they had , ” he recalled .
“ Bullets were exploding like firecrackers all around us . ”
Boyd paused and his team leader , whom he thought of as an older brother , ran past him to the far side of the building .
Moments after he got there , he was shot dead .
Within minutes , everyone else on the roof was wounded .
“ We had to crawl out of there , ” said Boyd , who was hit with shrapnel and suffered a concussion , earning a Purple Heart .
“ That was my worst day . ”
It is in the nature of soldiers to put emotions aside , and that is what Boyd did for three years .
He “ stayed on the line ” with his squad and finished his tour of duty the following June , married his high - school girlfriend , and soon afterward began training for his second Iraq deployment , not thinking much about what he had seen or done during the first .
Haditha , where he was sent in the fall of 2005 , was calmer than Falluja .
There were roadside bombs , but no direct attacks .
Boyd was now a team leader , and he and his men patrolled the streets like police .
When drivers did not respond to the soldiers ’ efforts to get them to stop , he said , “ we ’d have to light them up . ”
He was there for seven months .
With one more year of service left on his commitment , and not enough time for a third deployment , Boyd was separated from his unit and assigned to fold towels and clean equipment at the fitness center of his Stateside base .
It was a quiet , undemanding job , intended to allow him to decompress from combat .
Instead , he was haunted by memories of Iraq .
He could n’t sleep .
His mind raced .
He was edgy , guilt - racked , depressed .
He could barely do his job .
“ I ’d avoid crowds , I ’d avoid driving , I ’d avoid going out at night , ” he told me the first time we spoke .
“ I ’d avoid people who were n’t infantry , the ones who had n’t been bleeding and dying and going weeks and months without showers and eating M.R.E.s .
I ’d have my wife drive me if I had to go off the base .
A few times , I thought I saw a mortar in the road and reached for the steering wheel .
I was always on alert , ready for anything to happen at any time . ”
Eventually , as part of a standard medical screening , Boyd was diagnosed as having chronic post - traumatic stress disorder .
P.T.S.D. , which in earlier conflicts was known as battle fatigue or shell shock but is not exclusively war - related , has been an officially recognized medical condition since 1980 , when it entered the American Psychiatric Association ’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders .
( In an earlier edition , it was called “ gross stress reaction . ” )
P.T.S.D. is precipitated by a terrifying event or situation — war , a car accident , rape , planes crashing into the World Trade Center — and is characterized by nightmares , flashbacks , and intrusive and uncontrollable thoughts , as well as by emotional detachment , numbness , jumpiness , anger , and avoidance .
Boyd ’s doctor prescribed medicine for his insomnia and encouraged him to seek out psychotherapy , telling him about an experimental treatment option called Virtual Iraq , in which patients worked through their combat trauma in a computer - simulated environment .
The portal was a head - mounted display ( a helmet with a pair of video goggles ) , earphones , a scent - producing machine , and a modified version of Full Spectrum Warrior , a popular video game .
When Travis Boyd agreed to become a subject in the Virtual Iraq clinical trial , in the spring of 2007 , he became one of about thirty - five active - duty and former members of the military to use the program to treat their psychological wounds .
Currently , the Department of Defense is testing Virtual Iraq — one of three virtual - reality programs it has funded for P.T.S.D. treatment , and the only one aimed at “ ground pounders ” like Boyd — in six locations , including the Naval Medical Center San Diego , Walter Reed Army Medical Center , in Washington , D.C. , and Weill Cornell Medical College , in New York .
According to a recent study by the RAND Corporation , nearly twenty per cent of Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are suffering from P.T.S.D. or major depression .
Almost half wo n’t seek treatment .
If virtual - reality exposure therapy proves to be clinically validated — only preliminary results are available so far — it may be more than another tool in the therapists ’ kit ; it may encourage those in need to seek help .
“ Most P.T.S.D. therapies that we ’ve seen do n’t seem to be working , so what ’s the harm in dedicating some money to R. & D. that might prove valuable ? ”
Paul Rieckhoff , the executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America , said last November .
In January , his group issued a lengthy report called “ Mental Health Injuries : The Invisible Wounds of War , ” which cited research suggesting that “ multiple tours and inadequate time at home between deployments increase rates of combat stress by 50 % . ”
Rieckhoff went on , “ I ’m not someone who responds to sitting with some guy , talking about my whole life .
I ’m going to go in and talk to some dude who does n’t understand my shit and talk about my mom ?
I ’m the worst of that kind of guy .
So V.R. therapy , maybe it will work .
We ’re a video - game generation .
It ’s what we grew up on .
So maybe we ’ll respond to it . ”
Strictly speaking , using virtual reality to treat combat - related P.T.S.D. is not new .
In 1997 , more than twenty years after the Vietnam War ended , researchers in Atlanta unveiled Virtual Vietnam .
It dropped viewers into one of two scenarios : a jungle clearing with a “ hot ” landing zone , or a Huey helicopter , its rotors whirring , its body casting a running shadow over rice paddies , a dense tropical forest , and a river .
The graphics were fairly crude , and the therapist had a limited number of sights and sounds to manipulate , but Virtual Vietnam had the effect of putting old soldiers back in the thick of war .
Ten combat veterans with long - term P.T.S.D. who had not responded to multiple interventions participated in a clinical trial of Virtual Vietnam , typically lasting a month or two .
All of them showed significant signs of improvement , both directly after treatment and in a follow - up half a year later .
( P.T.S.D. is assessed on a number of scales , some subjective and others based on the observation of the clinician . )
As successful as it was , though , Virtual Vietnam did n’t catch on .
It was an experiment , and when the experiment was over the researchers moved on .
Like Virtual Vietnam , Virtual Iraq is a tool for doing what ’s known as prolonged - exposure therapy , which is sometimes called immersion therapy .
It is a kind of cognitive - behavioral therapy , derived from Pavlov ’s classic work with dogs .
Prolonged - exposure therapy , which falls under the rubric of C.B.T. , is at once intuitively obvious and counterintuitive : it requires the patient to revisit and retell the story of the trauma over and over again and , through a psychological process called “ habituation , ” rid it of its overwhelming power .
The idea is to disconnect the memory from the reactions to the memory , so that although the memory of the traumatic event remains , the everyday things that can trigger fear and panic , such as trash blowing across the interstate or a car backfiring — what psychologists refer to as cues — are restored to insignificance .
The trauma thus becomes a discrete event , not a constant , self - replicating , encompassing condition .
This process was explained to me by JoAnn Difede , the director of the Program for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Studies at Weill Cornell , when I visited her in her office , last fall .
Difede , a tough - minded New Yorker , began using virtual - reality exposure therapy with patients from the hospital ’s burn unit in the nineteen - nineties .
She treated victims of September 11th with a program called Virtual W.T.C. , which she designed with the creators of Virtual Vietnam , and is currently running a Virtual Iraq clinical trial as well as supervising therapists at other study sites .
Difede says that therapists have been slow to adopt exposure therapy , because they worry that it might be cruel to immerse a patient in a drowning pool of painful memories .
It ’s a worry that , she believes , misses the point of the therapy .
“ If you suddenly become afraid of the staircase because you had to walk down twenty - five flights of stairs to get out of the World Trade Center , the stairs went from being neutral to being negative , ” Difede explained .
“ What we should be doing is extinguishing the cues associated with the stimuli , which should allow for a more complete remission , as well as mastery of the experience .
It also should allow for greater emotional engagement .
Because numbing and avoidance are symptoms of P.T.S.D. , you ’re asking the person to do in treatment the very thing their mind is avoiding doing .
That ’s quite a dilemma . ”
It ’s this dilemma that makes virtual reality especially attractive to clinical psychologists like Difede .
Because the traumatic environment is produced in a computer graphics lab , and its elements are controlled by the therapist , virtual reality can nudge an imagination that is at once overactive and repressed .
“ Voilà , you ’re there ! ” Difede said .
“ You do n’t have to do any work .
You do n’t have to engage in any mental effort .
We ’ll do it for you .
We ’ll bring you there and then , gradually , we ’ll let you get involved in the experience in sensory detail . ”
When Travis Boyd was first asked to consider enrolling in the Virtual Iraq clinical trial , he was hesitant .
He had already decided not to talk to his division therapist , because “ I did n’t want to have it on my military record that I was crazy , ” he said .
And he was a marine .
“ Infantry is supposed to be the toughest of the tough .
Even though there was no punishment for going to therapy , it was looked down upon and seen as weak .
But V.R. sounded pretty cool .
They hook you up to a machine and you play around like a video game . ”
Telling his buddies that he was going off to do V.R. was a lot easier than telling them he was seeing a shrink .
Before he was introduced to Virtual Iraq , the therapist asked him to close his eyes and talk about his wartime experiences .
Without much prompting , he was back on the roof in Falluja , under fire , stalled at the top of the stairs , watching his friend and team leader run past him and die , and then he was dragging out his friend ’s body , looking at his messed - up face .
When Boyd was finished , the doctor asked him to tell the story again .
And , when he was finished that time , to tell it again .
As he did , she asked him what he was smelling , and if the enemy was on the roof opposite or on the roof next door , and if there were planes overhead .
She wanted to learn the details of his narrative and determine which moments were most troubling to him — she called them “ hot spots ” — and to figure out how she was going to use the sensory variables embedded in Virtual Iraq .
Boyd was introduced to the V.R. program in the third session .
( There were twelve sessions in all , each about two hours long , over a period of six weeks . )
Virtual - reality exposure therapy immerses the patient gradually ; that first time Boyd just sat there with the V.R. gear on , looking at an Iraqi street scene , getting acquainted with the virtual world .
Sound , which psychologists believe may stimulate memory more effectively than sight does , was added next , and , with it , touch .
“ I ’m talking about the firefight and she turns on this vibrating thing so you feel like you ’re in a shaking building , ” Boyd said .
“ Each time she added something , like an I.E.D. going off , or a plane flying over , I ’d become more emotional .
We ’d do it over and over , and it would become easier , and then she ’d add something more and the same thing would happen .
I ’d talk for forty minutes about this one five - minute thing .
When it ’s only visual , it ’s not really real — it ’s just a video game — but when the ground starts vibrating and you smell smoke and hear the AK - 47 firing , it becomes very real .
I ’d be shaking .
When it was over , I ’d go home and cry . ”
The inventor of Virtual Iraq is Albert Rizzo , a clinical psychologist at the University of Southern California , who goes by the nickname Skip .
Rizzo , who is fifty - three , has thinning black hair that ’s down to his shoulders when it ’s not pulled back in a ponytail , a stud earring , and a nose that looks like it has met a boot or two — he plays rugby .
Rizzo rides a Harley 1200 Sportster ( “ It ’s not a girl ’s bike , no matter what anyone tells you ” ) , plays blues harmonica ( he taught himself a couple of years ago , in order to reduce stress when he was commuting daily in L.A. traffic ) , and has an affable , jeans - and - untucked - shirt way about him that is particularly noticeable when he walks through Walter Reed or the Naval Medical Center San Diego alongside his starched military counterparts .
In 2003 , not long after the United States invaded Iraq , Rizzo , who had been designing virtual - reality systems to diagnose attention deficits in children and memory problems in older adults , and was affiliated with the Institute for Creative Technologies , a U.S.C. offshoot that he likes to call “ an unholy alliance between academia , Hollywood , and the military , ” had a hunch that , if the war went on for very long , its veterans were going to come home with serious emotional problems .
“ I thought we should be on this so we do n’t have another Vietnam , with all these guys suffering from P.T.S.D. , ” he told me one day last fall at Walter Reed , before he was to give a presentation to senior military officers .
“ I was working on a talk about virtual reality , just sniffing around the Internet , and I saw this link for the video game Full Spectrum Warrior . ”
The game had , in fact , originated as a training device that the Institute had developed for the Department of Defense .
“ I said , ‘ Oh , my God , that ’s Iraq ! ’
It was instant .
I thought we should take this game and run it in a head - mounted display right out of the box , for therapy . ”
Rizzo got in touch with Jarrell Pair , who had been the programmer on Virtual Vietnam , and convinced him to sign on to his as yet unfunded venture .
By February , 2004 , he and Pair had built a prototype of Virtual Iraq on a laptop , using a single street in an Iraqi market town which they had recycled from Full Spectrum Warrior .
To this they added a few alternate realities that a therapist could insert with a keystroke — a change from day to night , for example , or a switch from a deserted street to one where burka - clad shoppers strolled down the sidewalk .
“ That was our demo , ” Rizzo said .
“ We applied for money and we got nuked .
Then the Hoge article comes out and everything changes overnight . ”
“ All dogs go to Heaven , because we ’re not the ones who screwed up . ” Facebook

The article to which Rizzo was referring was written by Charles Hoge and his colleagues in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Walter Reed and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine that summer .
It was the first assessment of mental - health problems emerging from service in Iraq and Afghanistan , and even its conservative estimate — that around sixteen or seventeen per cent of those who fought in Iraq and eleven per cent who served in Afghanistan were suffering from P.T.S.D. symptoms ( an estimate that four years later has been revised dramatically upward ) — caught the public and the military by surprise .
Then Rizzo got a call from somebody in the Office of Naval Research .
“ He says , ‘ I hear you ’ve got a prototype of Full Spectrum Warrior for P.T.S.D. , ’ ” Rizzo recalled .
“ ‘ We ’re going to try to get it funded . ’ ”
The money came through in March , 2005 , and by the next fall , right around the time that Travis Boyd was being deployed to police Haditha , the first patients were recruited to try it out .
Before Skip Rizzo started designing virtual - reality systems , he was a conventional clinical psychologist , schooled in a variety of therapeutic methods .
Rizzo grew up just outside Hartford , attended the University of Hartford as an undergraduate , received a doctorate from Binghamton University , and did his internship at the V.A. hospital in Long Beach , California , not far from where he now lives .
Then he took a job as a cognitive - rehabilitation therapist at a hospital in Costa Mesa , working with people who had suffered traumatic brain injuries .
“ A lot of young males are in that population , ” he said .
“ The high - risk - takers .
The drunk drivers .
Gang members — all of that .
With that population , it was sometimes hard to motivate them to do the standard paper - and - pencil drill and practice routines .
Then , in the early nineteen - nineties , Game Boys came on the scene , and it seemed to me that all my male clients , at every break , at every meal , had become Tetris warlords .
It showed me that they were motivated to do game tasks , and that the more they did them the better they got , and it hit me that there could be a link between cognitive rehabilitation and virtual reality . ”
Rizzo left his job , and accepted a postdoc at the Alzheimer Disease Research Center at U.S.C. , where he began to design rudimentary virtual - reality systems with the help of programmers in the computer - science department .
At the end of the postdoc , he moved to the engineering school at U.S.C. and started “ building this stuff like crazy . ”
To make Virtual Iraq , Rizzo started with two basic scenarios : the market - town street scene and a Humvee moving along an Iraqi highway , where all the exit signs are in Arabic and the road cuts through sand dunes .
Then he gave therapists a menu of ways — visual , aural , tactile , even olfactory — to customize them .
At the click of a mouse , the therapist can put the patient in the driver ’s seat of the Humvee , in the passenger ’s seat , or in the turret behind a machine gun , and the vehicle moves at a speed determined by the patient .
Maybe the gunner in the turret is wearing night - vision goggles — the landscape goes grainy and green .
A sandstorm could be raging ( the driver can turn on the windshield wipers and beat it back ) ; a dog could be barking ; the inside of the vehicle could be rank .
Rizzo ’s idea is that giving the therapist so many options — dusk , midday ; with snipers , without snipers ; driving fast , creeping along ; the sound of a single mortar , the sound of multiple mortars ; the sound of people yelling in English or in Arabic — increases the likelihood of evoking the patient ’s actual experience , while engaging the patient on so many sensory levels that the immersion in the environment is nearly absolute .
“ Tell me what you want me to add , anything , ” I overheard Rizzo asking a therapist at Walter Reed in February , a few days after she had completed a fourteen - session Virtual Iraq protocol in three months with the first soldier at the facility enrolled in the trial .
( The patient did n’t think he had got much better , though he was able to ride the subway again and no longer avoided large crowds . )
“ You ’re the one in the trenches hearing the stories .
We ’ll keep evolving this to make it more relevant .
What do you think about adding the smell of burning hair ? ”
Rizzo was sitting in a tiny , windowless room in front of a table ringed by a cloth skirt that partly hid the electrodes and other equipment that monitor a person ’s blood pressure , respiration , heart rate , and stress level during treatment , and were connected to two computers .
He had flown in the night before to install the latest software upgrade , which he was introducing to the therapist , a slight young woman in her thirties .
“ O.K. , ” Rizzo said as he clicked the computer mouse rapidly , “ this is really cool . ”
On the screen was the basic Virtual Iraq market scene : a few nearly empty vender stalls in the middle of a plaza and a row of small , ground - floor shops in dun-colored buildings lining the sidewalk .
“ You walk to the end of this street ” — the sound of footsteps could be heard — “ it ’s market east .
Now , let ’s see if this works .
Let me blow up this car . ”
He clicked again and a small car about the size of a Toyota Corolla , which had been parked at the curb , burst into flames .
“ It ’s a good effect .
Now , when you blow up the car , put in ‘ add stunned civilian . ’
One more thing — you have to learn where the R.P.G. guys are . ”
He was referring to figures toting rocket - propelled grenades .
“ There ’s one here , ” he said , and on the screen there was another explosion .
“ Now we ’re going to head over there , ” he said , moving forward — more footsteps — toward a set of stairs .
“ Here ’s the deal with going up the stairs .
You ’ve got to hit it square on , otherwise you ’ll get caught up in the collision barrier .
It just breaks the presence .
You ’ll have to guide them .
From here , there ’s a variety of things you can do .
First off , you ’ve got the insurgent on the roof over there .
The insurgents just pop up .
You have to learn where they are , too . ”
The therapist looked over Rizzo ’s shoulder while he brought a Black Hawk helicopter in for a flyover and then blew up another car on the street .
“ One thing I have to be careful about is not hitting something by accident , ” she said .
“ One time , I mistakenly clicked my mouse and all of a sudden a bullet came flying out , and I had to tell the patient that I was sorry and did n’t mean to do that . ”
The first time I put on a head - mounted display and headphones and entered Virtual Iraq had been in this same room , at Walter Reed , a few months earlier , after Rizzo presented preliminary results from a study site to a small gathering of military officials .
Rizzo was having trouble linking his laptop ’s PowerPoint presentation to the Walter Reed audiovisual system , and he had to speak without notes , often from a crouch behind the podium as he picked through a jumble of cables searching for one that was live .
“ The last one hundred years , we ’ve studied psychology in the real world , ” Rizzo told the group .
“ In the next hundred , we ’re going to study it in the virtual world . ”
He threw out some numbers .
Of the five subjects who had completed treatment , four no longer met the diagnostic criteria for P.T.S.D. A fifth soldier showed no gain .
( To these he would add , a few months later , the results for ten others , eight of whom had got better .
Of the six research sites , San Diego was the first to have preliminary results . )
After talking more generally about the features of Virtual Iraq , Rizzo invited everyone present to the fourth - floor psychiatric wing to try it out .
Although I had seen Virtual Iraq in one dimension on a computer monitor , encountering it in three dimensions , with my eyes blinkered by the headset and my ears getting a direct audio feed , was different .
It still felt like make - believe , but I was fully engaged .
Rizzo placed a dummy M4 rifle in my hands , and guided my fingers to a video controller fixed to the barrel .
( By design , patients who use Virtual Iraq do not fire weapons ; the M4 is a mood - setting device , for verisimilitude . )
One toggle moved me forward , another moved me back , and a third sped me up or slowed me down .
Because the display tracked with the orientation of my head , whichever way I moved determined not only what I saw but where I went .
I pressed the forward button and strolled down the market street and , at Rizzo ’s instruction , turned at a doorway and entered a house .
Inside were two insurgents , one on his knees , with his hands tied behind his back , the other dead on the ground .
A baby was crying .
I moved on .
The next time I put on the headset was in Marina del Rey , California , at an Institute for Creative Technologies lab space called FlatWorld , most of which was given over to life - size “ mixed reality ” worlds that could be negotiated without special equipment .
( It was so realistic that when a virtual insurgent popped up across the virtual street from the virtual building in which I was standing , his bullets made successive holes in the virtual wall behind me and seemed to shower plaster dust through the air . )
The Virtual Iraq design team , two artists and a programmer , worked out of FlatWorld , and it was their system , with the most recent improvements and additions , that I was using .
This time , Rizzo sat me in a chair placed over a bass shaker , which is also known as a tactile transducer , a device that transmits the feel of sound .
I slipped on the display and the headphones , and Rizzo pressed some keys on his computer and made me the driver of a Humvee , with a soldier in desert fatigues sitting next to me and another in the back .
( Because the gunner was in the turret , when I looked in the rearview mirror I saw only his boots and his pant legs . )
As soon as I started up the vehicle , the floor under me began to vibrate and my ears filled with the hum of tires on pavement .
Suddenly , a gunman appeared on the overpass above me and started to shoot .
Off to my right , a car burst into flames .
Half a second later , the explosion entered my body through my feet and ears .
It was startling , the way any unexpected loud noise is , but it was n’t frightening .
Even when the guy in the seat next to me was shot , and his shirt sprouted a red bloom , it was n’t frightening .
I had never been to Iraq .
I had never been to war .
The scene did not conjure any memories for me , traumatic or otherwise .
It was , as JoAnn Difede said of stairs on September 10th to a person who worked in the World Trade Center , neutral .
Since the momentous events of Sept. 11 , 2001 , countless news stories , TV commentaries , and books have speculated on the causes of terrorism , the attitudes of Muslims , and a purported clash of civilizations between Islamic societies and the West .
What has not been available is any reliable measure of the viewpoints of ordinary Muslims , who constitute 20 percent of the global population .
That is no longer the case .
Through an ambitious six - year project that involved hour - long , face - to - face interviews with residents in nearly 40 nations , Gallup has plumbed the perspectives of Muslim men and women – urban and rural , educated and illiterate , young and old .
The Gallup Poll of the Muslim World surveyed a representative sample of 90 percent of the world 's 1.3 billion Muslims , the most comprehensive study ever done .
The findings are explored in the new book " Who Speaks for Islam ? " by John Esposito , Islamic studies professor at Georgetown University ; and Dalia Mogahed , executive director of the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies in Washington .
Here are some of the key results , which frequently counter conventional wisdom :
SAN FRANCISCO —
As the sluggish economy continues to bog down state budgets across the country , California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a longtime foe of one solution — raising taxes — has decided to give voters here a dramatic choice .
To close the state 's $ 17 billion budget shortfall , Schwarzenegger proposed yesterday that voters either approve his new plan to borrow $ 15 billion from Wall Street lenders in exchange for a three - year cut of the state 's lottery revenue — or face a 1 percent increase in the state 's sales tax .
" Our crisis is real and it's very serious , " Schwarzenegger said at a press conference announcing the proposal .
" We need additional revenues , and we 've got to get creative without raising taxes . "
California is far from the only state grappling with a looming budget gap , but the size of its shortfall — and , as of yesterday , the governor 's proposed remedy — make it a special case .
Last month , a report by the National Conference of State Legislatures found at least 22 other states are facing budget gaps next year because of slowing revenue .
All of those shortfalls combined add up to just over $ 15 billion .
" California 's budget gap is larger than most states ' overall budgets , " says Corina Eckl , director of fiscal affairs at NC SL .
Even Schwarzenegger , a man who came into office wrapping himself in the mantle of an antitax crusader , seems to be acknowledging that the time has come for drastic measures .
Since taking office in 2003 , he has never budged from his opposition to raising taxes .
His first act as governor was to repeal the state 's unpopular " car tax , " which had tripled annual vehicle registration fees , a move that saved the average driver a little more than $ 200 a year .
Over the past few months , as the slowing economy has begun to eat into state revenues , Schwarzenegger has n't budged .
In his initial budget proposal in January , he proposed a 10 percent cut across all state agencies , which he said would require closing 48 state parks , releasing early from prison as many as 22,000 nonviolent offenders , and trimming $ 4 billion from next year 's K - 12 budget .
Political experts described the proposal — which some saw as an attempt to pave the way politically for a tax increase — as a deliberate strategy of shock and awe .
" He [ wanted ] to create as much of an emergency as possible , " said Daniel Mitchell , a professor of public policy at UCLA 's Andersen School of Management , " He was trying to get people 's attention . "
It worked .
Lobbyists swarmed Sacramento this winter , pleading for reduced cuts .
But while the rest of the state has been moving in one direction , the governor yesterday said he wanted to move in another .
" When we had our budget deficit in January , I was convinced we could do without additional revenues , " Schwarzenegger said yesterday , " When we saw the budget getting worse and worse and worse , I saw we needed some . "
His new spending plan promises not just to tap into new — albeit borrowed — revenue , but to clean up the budget mess , at least in the short term , in one quick swipe .
While Schwarzenegger still intends to reduce spending — his plan includes more than $ 12 billion in cuts — he has walked away from his plans to close state parks or dramatically reduce prison and education budgets .
His new budget proposal , experts say , amounts to one big swing for the fences .
Schwarzenegger plans to ask voters this fall to allow him to securitize the state 's roughly $ 3 billion lottery , keeping California running by borrowing against its future earnings .
( The lottery , which the governor calls an " underperforming asset , " will have to grow by several billion dollars in the next few years for this plan to work . )
Schwarzenegger is willing , apparently , to use the specter of a tax increase to get his way .
Should voters reject the lottery proposal , which could appear on the ballot as early as November , the plan includes a " trigger " that would boost the state 's sales tax — already among the highest in the country — by 1 percent , so lenders can recoup their investments .
A similar solution to the state 's budget woes in the 1980s was enacted by Gov. George Deukmejian , but the state 's revenues picked back up again before voters ever had to pay the tax .
A handful of other states , like Illinois , have proposed privatizing their lotteries in recent years , but none have borrowed against anticipated growth in revenue — a far riskier proposition .
Before voters here have their say , Schwarzenegger 's proposal will have to fight its way out of Sacramento .
When the first details of his plans were released , several Republican lawmakers said the threatened tax hike was something they would never support .
Democrats , meanwhile , who control both houses of the state legislature , are also skeptical of the governor 's solution .
" It sounds risky , almost like a Rubik 's cube budget , not a long - term , structurally balanced budget , " says Karen Bass , the new speaker of the State Assembly , who was sworn in yesterday .
" We 're going to put this under a microscope and make sure we protect education and the most needy Californians . "

When I meet the Conservative MP Nadine Dorries she is clearly in triumphal mood , striding in late , complaining that her " tongue is sticking to the top of my mouth because I 've done so many interviews " .
She immediately breaks off to take a five - minute phone call .
She is a woman on a mission , her blue eyes intense when we finally get to talk .
The subject is late - term abortion , and specifically her current drive to bring the time limit for procedures down from 24 weeks to 20 .
She has tabled an amendment to the human fertilisation and embryology bill to this affect , on which MPs will have a free vote in the House of Commons tomorrow .
When I ask what result she is expecting , she forcefully replies : " a win .
Well over 200 MPs are supporting it . "
Most significantly , David Cameron is among them .
Dorries has been waging a high - profile campaign - 20 Reasons for 20 Weeks - that has been supported by both the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph .
As its name suggests , the campaign is a long list of reasons for a reduction in the time limit on abortion , many of them highly contentious .
She suggests , for instance , that there are " inevitably financial vested interests " in keeping a longer time limit , and suggests that only foreign doctors will perform late - term abortions : " almost all doctors performing late abortions in the UK , in British Pregnancy Advisory Service ( BPAS ) clinics , are from overseas " .
Many of her main points hinge on viability ; so , for example , she mentions baldly that there have been " high - profile cases of babies surviving well below 24 weeks " , which is true , but a ) is arguing on the basis of highly unusual cases ( a recent report found that of those born at 23 weeks , fewer than 10 % left hospital and many were severely impaired ) , and b ) is n't the point of this debate .
The point is that a woman has the right to control her own body .
The authorative and definitive report , EPICure2 , published just last month , and produced by a study group of neonatal experts , found that there had been no significant improvement whatsoever in the survival rates of babies born before 24 weeks in the past 10 years .
I ask Dorries why she thinks that the British Medical Association , the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology , the Royal College of Nursing and the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee support the current limit , and she immediately unleashes a rant about the way in which the BMA reached their decision , saying that doctors were n't given a proper chance to vote for a reduction .
I call the BMA , whose spokesperson reads out the motion from their annual conference in 2005 : " this meeting holds that the upper limit for legal abortion should be reduced in the light of new evidence of foetal developments and advances in neonatal care " .
That motion was roundly rejected .
Over the past few years , Dorries has become the public face of the anti-abortion movement in parliament , but she is by no means the only MP to have tabled an anti-choice amendment .
In fact , a raft of them will be voted on tomorrow , in the biggest challenge to abortion rights in almost two decades - a multi- pronged attack that , aside from Dorries ' proposed amendment , is taking place almost without comment .
So , for instance , MPs Edward Leigh ( Conservative ) , Claire Curtis - Thomas ( Labour ) and Ann Widdecombe ( Conservative ) have tabled an amendment to bring the time limit down to 12 weeks .
There are also separate proposals , all being voted on tomorrow , to bring it down to 14 weeks , 16 weeks , 18 weeks and 22 weeks .
It 's a classic tactic - a range of proposals are put forward , some extreme , others apparently less so , and suddenly a vote for a reduction to 20 weeks looks like a brilliant , liberal solution .
" The point is to confuse people , " says Anne Quesney , head of advocacy at Marie Stopes International .
" You focus attention on 12 weeks and 14 weeks - which are not likely to be attainable - and because parliament is a place of compromise , 20 weeks suddenly sounds reasonable , and 22 weeks sounds even more reasonable ...
It 's really quite worrying , because although the government is strong on the 24 - week limit , there 's also this sense that the Labour government is running scared .
Labour MPs who have got small majorities : will they vote , will they abstain ? "
The Crewe and Nantwich by - election is on Thursday , which gives MPs a good cover for any absence - they can simply say that they were out of London , campaigning .
" That 's what we 're worried about , " says Quesney , " that people will not be in the house to vote , and stand up and be counted .
The government does n't want to lose this , because I think it would look bad for them , but they want to keep as low a profile on it as possible . "
The pro-choice Labour MP Emily Thornberry is also worried .
The range of proposals " is immensely confusing for MPs , " she says , " and particularly when people are not used to voting without whips ... members of parliament do n't necessarily want to engage with this issue , because it 's highly emotive , you get some very nasty letters , so why would you get involved ?
What I 'm fearful of is that , because the arguments have been put forward on the basis of viability , MPs who have not had this issue as their primary focus have heard all the noise , they have n't stopped to see that it 's a load of nonsense , and that all the medical groups unanimously state that viability has not changed since 1990 [ when the limit was reduced from 28 weeks to 24 ] , and so they think , ' There must be something in it , I 'm sure I heard of a baby that survived at 22 weeks , so therefore let 's play safe , let 's cut it back for a couple of weeks ' ...
I was given a list of generally pro-choice , but soft pro-choice people to speak to , and I was very alarmed by how soft they are . "
A 20 - week limit may sound perfectly reasonable ; a good compromise , in fact .
After all , late - term abortion is a highly emotive , divisive subject , which is exactly why the anti-abortion lobby focuses on it - narrow the debate down to late - term abortion ( after 20 weeks ) , a procedure that makes up only 1.45 % of all terminations , and you very effectively skew the argument , and undermine women 's right to choose in general .
There are several reasons to be very worried about the current campaign .
One is that behind many of the proposals for reductions of a few weeks seem to lie long - term ambitions for much more stringent reductions .
While Dorries tells me that she is committed to the notion of a 20 - week limit , she admits that , " I think what I would like to see is the European average of 13 weeks . "
In the comments section of an article that she wrote for the Spectator website last October , someone going by the name Nadine Dorries remarked that , " I do want to go lower than 20 weeks - I would settle for the European average of 13 weeks , but would prefer nine . "
In that same comment , she says that she does " not stand at zero weeks " , and she emphasises to me that she is neither pro-choice nor anti-abortion , yet my suspicions are raised when she refers to a late - term abortion that she recently observed as " murder " and refers to abortion in general as " taking a life " ( when I challenge her on this she says that she meant " taking a potential life , a life , or a potential life " ) .
As our conversation continues I begin to find her position more and more disturbing .
Does she really support abortion up to 13 weeks , or nine weeks , whichever it is ?
Or does she see abortion as morally abhorrent - " taking a life " - under any circumstances ?
I 'm none the wiser .
Over the past few years , it has been incredible to watch how women 's voices and experiences have been excluded from the mainstream abortion debate , replaced by 4D images of foetuses - which are clearly emotive , but do n't change the argument - and comments such as this , from Dorries ' campaign , that " babies are now undergoing surgery in the womb under 24 weeks " .
That sounds great , I 'm very glad about it - it is also completely irrelevant .
As one woman said to me , it now seems that the argument runs , specifically , " the foetus , the science , and finally the woman " .
Dorries tells me that she has spoken to about 200 women who have had abortions ( as a side note , she says that every single one " felt that she was coerced by somebody into her abortion , whether it was a partner , a parent , a teacher " , which is unlike the experience of anyone I 've ever known ) , and so I am surprised by her reply when I ask how many women she has spoken to who have had late - term abortions .
" I have n't spoken to that many , " she says , " apart from on radio chat shows , that kind of thing " .
It 's a shame she did n't talk to more women who have had late - term abortions - if you had tabled an amendment which could significantly change the course of someone 's life , would n't you seek out the stories of those it would affect ?
With the way in which the late - term abortion debate is framed by politicians and the media , it is understandable to balk at the subject , understandable to find it problematic - until you begin to speak to women who have gone through the procedure later than 20 weeks .
Many of those who have late - term abortions are the most vulnerable : teenagers who did n't realise that they were pregnant until five months ' gestation ; women with learning disabilities ; those using methadone in drug rehabilitation programmes , which puts a halt to your periods .
Women like the one I read of recently , whose partner started beating her up when she became pregnant , and who feared she would never be able to escape him if she had his baby .
( In more than 30 % of domestic violence cases , the abuse started during pregnancy . )
Women who have suffered a severely traumatic episode - the death of a partner , or a child , for instance - who fear that the stress might affect foetal development .
The BPAS has just published a 28 - day audit of late - term abortion requests , to be distributed to MPs .
The stories include that of a woman with two small daughters from a previous marriage , who had an unplanned pregnancy with her current partner , which he urged her to continue .
She then found out that he was abusing her daughters .
As Ann Furedi of BPAS says , the stories " provide a really stark contrast to the abstract , philosophical and rather sterile discussion about viability and not viability .
What this does is to take it woman by woman .
The challenge that we 're putting to MPs is to look at this and think about it - what makes you think that the lives of these women would have been better if they 'd had to continue their pregnancy ?
We 're talking about women who , by their own admission , are saying , ' I can not cope with having this child ' . "
When I ask Dorries why she thinks women have late - term abortions , she boils it down to " procrastination ... when someone goes past a 12 - week barrier and they 're still thinking about whether they 're going to or not , there seems to be an element of procrastination that comes into that .
" Everyone looks on terminations as this life - liberating thing that women go through , " she says .
I ask who has described abortion specifically as " life - liberating " to her , and she says " Oh God , well , a lot of the pro-choicers who I argue with do .
They say , ' Get your hands out of my uterus , women have fought for this liberation for years ' . "
She laughs for the first time in the interview .
I am feeling extremely bleak , but can't help myself : what does she think of feminism ?
" I do n't even know what feminism is , to be honest with you .
You know ; what is it now ?
We 're in a post - feminist age : what has been achieved for women now ?
We 're still not on equal pay , in many areas of life . "
But we 're much further towards equal pay than we 've ever been .
" Possibly , possibly , " she says , clearly unconvinced .
" Would we have been anyway though , now that we have so many more women getting into senior positions ? "
( I do n't even bother to query this last point , or the fact that it might just have something to do with feminism itself . )
" I do n't know .
The feminist discussion is just not something that I major in .
But I know personally , I look at my daughters who pay half when they go out [ on a date ] with someone and I think , ' They never did that in my day ' .
I 'm purely selfish about this , to be honest with you . "
This is the main insight that she makes on feminism : outrage that her daughters have to go dutch .
Of course , we all hope that we will never have to have an abortion - let alone a late - term abortion - but any woman could find herself in that situation ; one in three women has an abortion , and 76 % of the population support that right .
As Quesney says , " It 's real women we 're talking about , not just case studies .
This is an issue that has defined women 's equality with men - if you take away abortion rights , or family planning , you take away the key to women 's equality with men .
It 's that important , and people are about to compromise it . "
The campaign group , Abortion Rights , is staging a protest outside Parliament as the MPs go in to vote tomorrow night ; there 's also the option of writing a last - minute letter to your MP , countering what Thornberry calls the anti-abortion " background chatter " that has been influencing MPs " without them even realising that they 're being influenced .
" People do n't want to think about abortion , " says Thornberry .
" The woman or the man on the street does n't want to think about abortion .
They may think that women have a right to choose , and they may be perfectly happy with that , but they do n't really want to engage , because it 's a horrible subject .
And then the crisis appears for them .
A very large number of women find that they need an abortion .
Our first principle has to be to defend what we have " .
In 1965 , Mancur Olson wrote a classic book called “ The Logic of Collective Action , ” which pointed out that large , amorphous groups are often less powerful politically than small , organized ones .
He followed it up with “ The Rise and Decline of Nations . ”
In that book , Olson observed that as the number of small , organized factions in a society grows , the political culture becomes more divisive , the economy becomes more rigid and the nation loses vitality .
If you look around America today , you see the Olson logic playing out .
Interest groups turn every judicial fight into an ideological war .
They lobby for more spending on the elderly , even though the country is trillions of dollars short of being able to live up to its promises .
They ’ve turned environmental concern into subsidies for corn growers and energy concerns into subsidies for oil companies .
The $ 307 billion farm bill that rolled through Congress is a perfect example of the pattern .
Farm net income is up 56 percent over the past two years , yet the farm bill plows subsidies into agribusinesses , thoroughbred breeders and the rest .
The growers of nearly every crop will get more money .
Farmers in the top 1 percent of earners qualify for federal payments .
Under the legislation , the government will buy sugar for roughly twice the world price and then resell it at an 80 percent loss .
Parts of the bill that would have protected wetlands and wildlife habitat were deleted or shrunk .
Google ( again ) Opposes Anti-Censorship and Human Rights Proposals
Let ’s say you run an internet company whose primary function is to help individual locate and access information available on the World Wide Web .
Let ’s say your mission is “ to organize the world ’s information and make it universally accessible and useful , ” and you ’re very good at it , processing over half of every Web search performed in the United States .
Now , let ’s also note that you are good people , always trying to do the right thing , not be evil , and so on .
As such , you likely recognize the following statements as being sound and reasonable :
freedom of speech and freedom of the press are fundamental human rights , and free use of the Internet is protected in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which guarantees freedom to “ receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers ”
the rapid provision of full and uncensored information through the Internet has become a major industry in the United States , and one of its major exports , and
political censorship of the Internet degrades the quality of that service and ultimately threatens the integrity and viability of the industry itself , both in the United States and abroad
some authoritarian foreign governments such as the Governments of Belarus , Burma , China , Cuba , Egypt , Iran , North Korea , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Tunisia , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan , and Vietnam block , restrict , and monitor the information their citizens attempt to obtain
technology companies in the United States such as Google , that operate in countries controlled by authoritarian governments have an obligation to comply with the principles of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights
technology companies in the United States have [ often ] failed to develop adequate standards by which they can conduct business with authoritarian governments while protecting human rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression
If you accept these premises , and you ’re a company dedicated to making the world ’s information accessible and useful to all citizens — while not being evil — it would be appropriate for you to take certain measures to “ develop adequate standards by which they can conduct business with authoritarian governments while protecting human rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression . ”
To accomplish this , you might reasonably institute policies to help protect freedom of access to the Internet , which would include the following minimum standards :
Data that can identify individual users should not be hosted in Internet restricting countries , where political speech can be treated as a crime by the legal system .
The company will not engage in pro-active censorship .
The company will use all legal means to resist demands for censorship .
The company will only comply with such demands if required to do so through legally binding procedures .
Users will be clearly informed when the company has acceded to legally binding government requests to filter or otherwise censor content that the user is trying to access .
Users should be informed about the company ’s data retention practices , and the ways in which their data is shared with third parties .
The company will document all cases where legally - binding censorship requests have been complied with , and that information will be publicly available .
Seems reasonable , and the right thing to do .
Now , given all of this , it is apparent your company is concerned with how your policies and practices might impact human rights across the globe .
So , even if you ’re not comfortable committing yourself to the above standards ( which would be surprising given your philosophy ) , you certainly would want to at least :
form a Board Committee on Human Rights , provide said committee with funds for operating expenses , adopt regulations or guidelines to govern said Committee ’s operations , empower said Committee to solicit public input and to issue periodic reports to shareholders and the public , at reasonable expense and excluding confidential information , including but not limited to an annual report on the implications of company policies , above and beyond matters of legal compliance , for the human rights of individuals in the US and worldwide
That seems reasonable .
Of course , you might be concerned about how such a committee might impact company business decisions , so you would be sure to note that the formation of a Board Committee on Human Rights would n’t restrict the power of the Board of Directors to manage the business and affairs of the company .
Simply put , the Board Committee on Human Rights would review and make policy recommendations regarding human rights issues raised by the company ’s activities and policies .
It could be an effective mechanism for addressing the human rights implications of the company ’s activities and policies as they emerge anywhere in the world .
These two proposals — taking a stance against Internet censorship and forming a Board Committee on Human Rights — seem reasonable , right ?
Especially for a company pledged to not be evil ?
Well , two shareholder proposals suggest Google take these very actions : Proposal 4 offers the anti-censorship language outlined above , while Proposal 5 suggestions the formation of a Board Committee on Human Rights with the duties and restrictions I note here .
Google is recommending that shareholders vote AGAINST each proposal .
( This is the second time Google has opposed the anti-censorship proposal . )
I urge all shareholders in Google Inc. to vote FOR these reasonable and ethical proposals when they receive their proxy statements .
Simon Bunce 's credit card details were stolen while online shopping
By Marc Sigsworth
With ID fraud on the rise , the assumption is you 'll lose money which can be claimed back .
But Simon
Bunce lost his job , and his father cut off contact , when he was arrested after an ID fraudster used his credit card details on a child porn website .
Simon Bunce used to be a keen internet shopper , delighted to escape the hordes and have goods delivered to his door .
Wary of fly - by - night operators , he bought only from big name retailers with secure websites .
But then , four years ago , he was astonished to find himself embroiled in Operation Ore , the UK 's largest ever police hunt against internet paedophiles .
He was arrested on suspicion of possession of indecent images of children , downloading indecent images of children and incitement to distribute indecent images of children .
Hampshire Police took away his computer and data storage devices including flash drives , CDs and floppy disks , as well as examining the computer and storage devices that he used at work .
The effect was devastating .
When his employers became aware of the reason he had been arrested , he was abruptly dismissed from his £ 120,000 a year job , and close members of his family disowned him .
FIND OUT MORE ... Identity Fraud : Outnumbered is on BBC One on Thursday , 3 April , at 2100 BST Catch up at BBC iPlayer " I made the mistake of telling my father , and he cut me off , " Mr Bunce says .
" He then told all my siblings and they also cut us off . "
Suddenly deprived of his income , Mr Bunce had to consider selling the family home .
But his wife , Kim , stuck by him , and supported his mission to clear his name .
Mr Bunce knew he was innocent - he had never downloaded indecent images , and so he knew that the police would not find any evidence on the computers or storage devices they had taken away .
But the police 's computer technicians take several months to examine these , and Mr Bunce could not afford to wait to repair the damage done to his reputation .
" I knew there 'd been a fundamental mistake made and so I had to investigate it . "
Identity fraud occurs when personal information is used by someone else to obtain credit , goods or other services fraudulently .
Recent surveys suggest that as many as one in four Britons have been affected by it .
In 2007 more than 185,000 cases of identity theft were identified by Cifas , the UK's fraud prevention service , an increase of almost 8 % on 2006 .
Tarnished name Operation
Ore targeted suspected paedophiles believed to have been downloading indecent images of children , those whose credit card details had been used to buy pornography via an American portal called Landslide - the gateway site and central credit card handler for hundreds of websites .
OPERATION ORE 7,272 UK residents targeted Including Robert del Naja of Massive Attack and The Who's Pete Townshend , who was given a caution
In many cases , suspects had had their card details stolen Hundreds of successful prosecutions ensued , with extensive media coverage given to high profile suspects , including actor Chris Langham of The Thick of It .
As Landslide was based in the United States and under investigation there , Mr Bunce was able to use the US Freedom of Information
Act to obtain a complete copy of all of the relevant material , including databases , access logs and credit card information , together with detailed information of the webmasters , which allowed him to find out how his credit card details had been used .
Each computer has a unique internet protocol number , or IP address , which identifies the specific computer and its geographic whereabouts whenever it is used to access the internet .
Mr Bunce discovered that the computer used to enter his credit card details was in Jakarta , Indonesia , and the date and time that his credit card details were entered onto the Landslide website was at a time when he could prove that he was using the same card in a restaurant in south London .
" I can't be in two places at once , so somehow my data had got to the man in Indonesia . "
He was also able to discover that his credit card details had been obtained from a popular online shopping site , but he does n't know how these came to be in the hands of a criminal .
The man responsible for using his credit card details hid behind the online name " Miranda " - a webmaster who hosted and produced pornographic websites and received a commission from Landslide for subscriptions to his website which were paid by credit card .
" Miranda " had used Mr Bunce 's credit card details - without his knowledge - to take out a subscription to one of his websites .
Cash convert
In September 2004 , the police told Mr Bunce they would not proceed with any action against him .
They had not found indecent material , and accepted that it was n't him who had entered his credit card details on the Landslide website .
Simon Bunce no longer shops online
It took another six months before he got another job , earning a quarter of the salary he 'd earned before his arrest .
Mr Bunce has also reconciled with his family , having explained to them how he came to be implicated and then cleared .
Are bygones bygones ?
" I 've forgiven them [ my family ] - there 's no point in bearing a grudge . "
Four years on , he is bringing a High Court action against the shopping website for allowing his personal details to be compromised .
So no more internet shopping ?
" No , no , no .
Once bitten , twice shy , " says Mr Bunce , who now sells encryption services .
" I would n't say that I live in the cash economy now , but I 'd rather go to the bank to withdraw money to buy petrol , as you hear of card details being harvested at garages .
I 'm paranoid about data security .
I shred everything , I never use credit cards anymore .
" Being arrested and accused of what is probably one of the worst crimes known to man , losing my job , having my reputation run through the mud , it 's a living nightmare . "
Marc Sigsworth is the producer of BBC One 's Identity Fraud : Outnumbered .
Below is a selection of your comments : Despite forwarding my mail after moving , a statement from the credit card company got delivered to a previous address .
The new tenant managed to get a card issued & started withdrawing large amounts of cash .
The company spotted it in a couple of days & I eventually lost nothing more than a little time whilst it was sorted .
But what concerned me the most was the complete absence of interest on the part of the police , despite clear evidence of who the culprit was , where he lived & even CCTV evidence of the halfwit using a cashpoint less than a mile from my old flat .
As long as they know there is almost zero chance of getting arrested then the criminals will keep on doing it .
David , Maldon , UK
Since having my bank account defrauded last year , through no fault of my own , I have gone back to almost always using cash .
I also only draw money out from a machine within a bank 's premises .
So far I 've not found this any inconvenience .
Martin K , London , England I am a fervent supporter of our police force , particularly with regard to their efforts to combat crimes against children , but I am deeply troubled by the apparent ham - fisted way in which Mr Bunce was treated .
There can be no excuse for incompetence leading to the destruction of an innocent person 's standing by the state or employer .
I trust that , quite apart from the action detailed in the report , he receives appropriate apologies and compensation from both the police and his previous employers .
Steven , Shaftsbury , Dorset I too have been a victim of card theft .
TWICE .
In both cases , I did nothing out of the ordinary and had not shopped online in a while .
However , in the most recent case , I did use my credit card when shopping at an outlet mall in North Georgia .
Shortly after that , all kinds of electronics were charged against my card in Japan ... a place I have never visited .
The policy of the card companies needs to change .
They will reimburse anything up to $ 5000 .
The criminals know this , so they charge up to this amount .
There is n't even an investigation unless the charge is excessive .
By law , the card companies need to be made to investigate all of these .
If any company such as an online retailer is found to be the source , then they need to pay the cost of the investigation as well as reimburse the bank for the loss .
Perhaps then they will take security more seriously .
I too now shop on a cash basis only .
Perhaps this is the way to make the credit card companies take notice .
Gillian , Atlanta , US A little technical warning : just because you are using a secure site , does not mean you are safe .
The vast majority of credit card details being stolen online , are not from the site , but via malware on your PC .
A quick guide to staying safe :
1. Install and KEEP UP TO DATE anti-virus software , there are free ones out there
2. Install and KEEP UP TO DATE anti-spyware software , the two are NOT the same
3 . Never , ever follow links in e-mails .
Always type the website yourself
4 . Do n't run e-mail attachments you are not sure of , even if they appear to be from friends , it is easy to fake a sender
5 Do n't visit websites you are unsure of .
Never install or run programmes from site you are not 100 % confident are legit
These simple steps will help keep your card safe .
Stu , Birmingham Many employers are in a Catch 22 situation though .
Suppose you consider schools or police or doctors .
If they do n't act , and the case is found to be true , then they have put children at risk .
If they do act , and the case is found to be unfounded , they have devastated an innocent 's life in many ways .
Also many employers either do n't have , or worryingly very often do n't want to use the resources to put someone on suspension .
There should be a compensation scheme for this type of injustice that never reaches a court , a statement of " innocence " from the police to aid his recovery of self - respect , and " innocence until proven guilty " upheld in the community more .
Rob , Swansea
My medical card has my photo on it .
My driving licence - which I updated recently took exactly one week to be sent to me - over the Easter Weekend and has my picture and my address on it .
You have to carry two unrelated items in the UK and there is no proof that the picture is of the holder of the licence .
There is nothing similar in the UK to prove who you are .
I use credit cards on the net all the time .
Our credit cards are limited and we HAVE to pay them off at the end of each month .
Debt is not an option .
Perhaps that is why we have less of this type of fraud and also why the euro is so strong .
Di Chapman , Aynac , France
Have also been told this week by my credit card provider that my card has been cloned .
Yet only using it on " big name " sites .
Just goes to show no matter what the company and the level of internet security , no one can say for sure that 100 % of their staff are honest and one of them may not be out there selling your details to criminals .
Paul Ewen , Bedford UK
Aside from the ID fraud , which is bad enough , I think this story highlights some of the key problems with our justice system .
Mr Bunce was all but found guilty immediately by family and employer .
The police need to properly investigate people before making arrests - either that or it should be illegal to sack someone until they have been found guilty and not just arrested on suspicion .
Society also has to think about the modern day witch hunt where the topic of paedophilia is concerned .
Jacqueline , Barnet , UK
This is a clear case of wrongful dismissal - your employer should never sack you for something which you have not been convicted .
It seems fair to suspend someone pending prosecution , but firing them is illegal .
In this case , Simon should have clear grounds for compensation .
Martin , UK
It is exactly for this reason that those accused of sex crimes should remain anonymous until proven guilty .
The so called " innocent until proven guilty " guarantee is a travesty .
This case also proves the huge gulf between American FOI and the abysmal UK version .
Mark , Derby , UK
The real purpose of this story is to try and sell the idea of ID cards to the British public .
" If you do not take an ID card , you could be branded a paedo " , is what this article is saying .
The BBC has constantly been used to sell the idea of ID cards as a means to protect identity , and articles like this are a classic example .
The fact of the matter is that if everyone is put into the ID database , then cases of mistaken identity will skyrocket .
This man had his information stolen because he used a credit card .
If he did not have a credit card , no one would have been able to impersonate him .
That is the real message behind this story ; if you have a card that identifies you , someone can impersonate you from anywhere in the world .
If you do not have a card then you are far safer .
Alexander De Large , London I myself have twice been victim of credit card hacking where someone used my card abroad while I was in UK .
Fortunately my card company called me and the transactions were nullified and my cards replaced , however I do n't think that the criminals were ever caught or even any attempt was made to catch them .
Sometimes I wonder if the industry is doing enough to protect identity .
I wish success to Mr Bunce in his lawsuit against the concerned shopping site .
More cases like this and we would return to old cash economy .
Devendra Damle , Kenilworth , Warcs
This is a product of our on - going tabloid - fuelled paedophilia hysteria and everyone 's knee - jerk reaction to the subject , and I hate how this happens time and time again , not just to famous celebrities that we hear about ( Mathew Kelly comes to mind ) but also to everyday honest folks .
People should learn to get over their hysteria , stop being manipulated by the pack mentality and look at the facts .
Anyone can be accused of anything , anyone can be investigated for anything , anyone can point a finger at anyone and it could happen to any of us at any time .
But the point is to get to the truth , and people should learn to accept the outcome as the truth , not the gossip , and stop ruining innocent peoples ' lives over nothing .
I hope this article goes some way to clearing this poor man 's reputation .
WiL , Leeds , UK
What an appalling story .
If Mr Bunce was able to find out that someone in Indonesia had misused his details on a certain date , what a pity the police could n't have armed themselves with this information prior to his arrest .
Surely a simple " where were you on ...? " could have cleared all this up and saved Mr Bunce his job , family and a lot of stress .
I sometimes wonder how technologically adept our Boys in Blue really are .
Mark , Warwick
An extremely unfortunate story , but all credit to Bunce who has recovered well when many would have collapsed .
The time is upon us where massive overhaul to the system is necessary , biometrics even DNA can and should be used , with the credit card companies footing at least some of the bill for research and initiation .
They do not do enough to protect their customers ( us ) as it is simply cheaper to let it go on and compensate in some ( but not all ) cases .
Chip and pin too has not been the success we all hoped , merely papering over the cracks .
Neil , UK I hope he is , or has , successfully sued his previous employers - they should be named and shamed .
Whatever happened to presumed innocent until proven guilty ?
Jon , Manchester I feel great sympathy for Mr Bunce .
It only goes to show how we can sometimes jump to conclusions before finding out what the truth really is .
If I were an employer and my employee has been accused , I will wait for the jury 's verdict before I take action and this will be the same if I were to be a family member of an accused .
Andrian Harsono , Sunbury , UK Is n't the answer to this to check your credit card statements every month , and to complain if there is an error ?
The article does not say if Mr Bunce checked his statement every month , but surely if he had this would not have happened ?
David , Glasgow , Scotland
It is unfortunate that the true criminals find ways to throw the scent off of them and onto innocent people .
Actions that involve child pornography are indeed the worst crimes known to man , if you ask me , but what is upsetting is that " innocent until proven guilty " does n't seem to apply with them ; his family and his employers disowned him , assuming he was guilty of the reasons of his arrest .
Proving his innocence took six months , but clearing the tarnish from his name will take a lifetime .

What are these ?

Lordy , lord , it 's been a mean season , has n't it ?
And a long one , too .
We human beings ( those bipeds lucky enough not to have been born a conservative or killed by one , that is ) have suffered through the endless depravity , stupidity , duplicity and incompetence of the radical right for what now seems like forever .
It 's been awful , and it 's been depressing , and that 's putting it mildly .
To have had even a fraction of a heart this last decade means to have lived in Hell .
Finally , though , the end is nigh .
The signs are all there .
The regressive right is cracking up , a complete and utter victim of its own success at winning power and of its own absolute failure in wielding it .
The markers are everywhere , bubbling just below the surface .
Here are sixteen of them , sure signs if ever there were that the era of destructive government is ( nearly ) over :
* FOLLOW THE MONEY :
If you know anything about how American politics has been played over the last century , you know that the concept of Democrats out - fundraising Republicans is about as likely as likely as George W. Bush getting an honorary degree from anybody besides Bob Jones U .
It could happen , to be sure ( especially in some freaky parallel universe ) , it 's just that it just ain't very likely .
But guess what ?
It 's happening now , and it's a sure sign of the regressive apocalypse ( where do I order tickets for that party ? ) .
What is even more telling than empty GOP coffers is that even the big corporate money is going to Democrats .
Imagine Enron contributing to Al Gore 's campaign , and you 'd just about have the picture .
Is it possible that the healthcare industry had a recent change of heart and decided that guaranteed national healthcare is now more important than corporate profits , after all ?
It would be possible ( though massively improbable ) , if they had ever had a heart to begin with .
A much more plausible explanation is that the lobbyists for these fat - cats who are paid to sniff out power can see which way the wind is blowing , and that it ain't to the east anymore , ladies and gentlemen .
Even the finance , insurance and real estate industries are funneling more money to Democrats than to the Reprobatlicans .
( Talk about your truly bizarro parallel universes !
This is the stuff of science fiction novels . )
House Democrats have $ 28 million in the bank right now , while the GOP has $ 1.6 million for its congressional races ( no , that 's not a typo ) .
When did that ever happen ?
* KEEP FOLLOWING THE MONEY :
Has there ever been an economy this precarious for this long without throwing a rod or seizing an engine ?
Given how reviled Bush and his clones already are now , can you imagine how sour the public mood will be if there is a recession or worse in the coming year ?
When you start seeing stories about roving gangs of furious soccer moms beating up random Republicans caught without their Blackwater guards on K Street , you 'll know why .
Just watch the American flag pins start flying off of lapels .
Stay tuned for more on this one .
Gasoline is now selling for five bucks a gallon in parts of California , and that was being headlined by the Drudge Report , that bastion of anti-regressive journalism .
I smell a twenty - first century Whiskey Rebellion a - brewin ' .
* FOLLOW THE LEADER : Everybody 's talking about him on the presidential campaign trail .
It 's just that they all happen to be Democrats .
Republicans desperately want to pretend that Bush never existed ( though not as much as they will want to after another year of his follies ) .
So much , in fact , that they do n't even mention his name in their debates or on the stump .
The New York Times just reported that Democrats mentioned the lil ' Bush feller 47 times in their last debate .
Republicans ?
Twice , with one being a critique by Ron Paul .
And this is while they 're campaigning for conservative , pro-Bush votes , mind you .
Did you know that Ronald Reagan ( or , more accurately , the myth of Ronald Reagan ) was still alive and in the White House ?
Neither did I , but if you listen to these bozos for more than five minutes you could certainly walk away with that impression ( not to mention tinnitus and a whopping good brain hemorrhage as well , but that 's another matter ) .
It 's a sure sign that your movement is in deep trouble when you can't say the name of the sitting president who so completely exemplifies its principles , for fear that doing so will destroy your candidacy .
* FOLLOW TUCKER : Right out the door , in fact .
Woo - freakin ' - hoo .
Was there ever an unctuous little bow - tied twit of a punky spoiled brat that you just wanted to slap silly more than Tucker Carlson ?
Well , guess what ?
His ratings are doing it for you .
Seems that nobody is terribly interested anymore in what the young master debater has to say , and MSNBC is getting ready to pull the plug on him , bow - tie and all .
Bummer , dude .
Maybe you could become a liberal now !
Or , hey , if you 're looking for a job , maybe you could get Bush to appoint you as ambassador to Smarmiland ?
* FOLLOW KEITH :
The reason MSNBC is getting ready to untuck the wee Carlson is because they want to make room for what viewers are actually interested in , which is more progressive politics , like the regular savagings of the rabid right by Keith Doberman .
Here comes Rosie O'Donnell into the line - up , with a show that could make Keith look like a nice puppy by comparison .
Apparently , even Joe Scarborough - fingers and toes all in the wind - is talking like a liberal these days .
What was that Dylan line about not needing to be a weatherman ...?
You could almost come to love the free market , after all , eh ?
* FOLLOW JON : Stewart , that is .
And Stephen Colbert .
Every night , incessantly , they do what sometimes seems like the only rational thing imaginable given the inanities of regressive politics in our unfortunate time .
They mock it mercilessly .
The good news is that for many people , especially young folk , this is their sole source of news about current developments .
Is that a pretty serious indicator of the tragic state of the American polity ?
You betcha .
But it could be a lot worse .
People could be getting their ' news ' from Fox , the Wall Street Journal , the Washington Times , or even CNN or NBC .
I think a very serious argument can be made that you learn more about the real world we actually inhabit from Stewart and Colbert than from the more subtle comedy shows presented every day by the mainstream disinformation media in the guise of ' newscasts ' .
Brian Williams may be a more honest source of information than was Baghdad Bob , but not by much .
Until The Nation becomes required reading and Democracy Now !
the most watched news broadcast on television , Comedy Central may be the best alternative we 've got .
* FOLLOW THE KIDS : Speaking of the young folk , they are becoming as scarce in the Republican Party as a good vowel in Kyrgyzstan .
And why not ?
Who wants to be in the party that 's wrecking your environment , spending your future earnings , killing your friends for lies and telling you who you can sleep with ?
( Hint : You can't sleep with anybody .
Unless , of course , you 're a television preacher or a blow - hard regressive politician , in which case you can sleep with everyone .
And everything .
Baaaah . )
What a fun bunch to hang with , eh ?
The even better news is that there is pretty strong evidence that people tend to stick for life with the party affiliation they adopt when they 're young .
As in so many other ways , therefore , George W. Bush will be the gift that keeps on giving .
Thirty years from now , when regressives are an extinct species visible only in dusty museum showcases , we may wonder why we were n't as happy as little clams at a mollusk orgy to have had the Bush Leaguer around , doing a better job than we ever could have of smashing his ideology to bits .
* FOLLOW DOBSON : Please .
Somebody get this destructive demon of the religious right into the home for doddering Precambrians where he belongs .
As it happens , he might be taking care of it himself .
It seems that Ol ' Jimmy is outraged that none of the Republican front - runners are as obsessed with controlling other peoples ' sexuality as his custom bible tells him they should be .
He is therefore threatening to run a third - party candidate , thus ripping asunder the GOP , in which case I might just be forced into believing in god , after all .
( Even better would be if McCain also launches a desperate last - call shot at the presidency with his own independent bid after losing the GOP nomination .
Splitting the Halloween set vote three ways is definitely my version of heaven on earth . )
Meanwhile , all indications are that the entire religious right is in complete disarray ( oh , so that 's what they mean by " Hallelujah ! " ) .
Loads of its troops are disenchanted with politics , disenchanted with regressivism , disenchanted with the GOP candidates , and otherwise just generally reeking of betrayal , rage and a large dose of your garden - variety steroid - enhanced mass surliness .
This does not a successful political movement make .
* FOLLOW THE POLLS :
Which have been showing for a long time now that Americans are really pissed off about what has happened to their country , and in record numbers .
That 's not exactly what you wanna hear when you 're an incumbent running for reelection , or trying to keep your party in power .
It gets better yet , though .
As Paul Krugman noted this week , political research is now showing that the American public is not just aimlessly angry , but is more liberal in its attitudes than it has been since the early 1960s .
And the Baby Boomers have n't even retired yet !
Something tells me that killing stem - cell research and gutting Social Security , coupled with homophobia , environmental destruction , reckless aggression abroad and bankruptcy at home are not going to be big vote - getters in the coming decades .
Call me crazy , but I 'm going to go ahead and make that wild prediction .
* FOLLOW THE RUDE DUDE : Giuliani's popularity in the GOP indicates that even those nuts have turned away , however reluctantly , from their own social conservatism .
And now the nuttiest of them all , Pat Robertson , has just endorsed this nasty little Rottweiler with the sorta liberal social policies .
There 's really only one viable explanation for that .
Sex - obsessed pseudo - Jesus regressivism is a completely spent force , and the Pat Robertsons of this world have only two remaining choices :
They can either jump on the bandwagon of sheer hypocrisy ( Remember Robertson 's post - 9/11 rant about the abortionists , and the lesbians , and the feminists , etc . ?
Remember how he once sued a certain mayor of New York City to block the latter 's support for gay marriage ? ) , or they can demonstrate their utter irrelevance .
Ol '
Pat has made his choice .
He did both .
* FOLLOW MOVE -ON : Sure , they 're not perfect , but they may be the best thing happening on the left these days in terms of real work with a real chance of success .
More importantly , they 've already shown that they know how to play hardball , and now they 're learning how to play sophisticated hardball .
In many ways , they 're copying the playbook that the right adopted in the decades since the Goldwater ocean liner had its encounter with the proverbial iceberg , bringing the GOP back to the drawing board .
Regressives have been winning for so long in part because they 've been fighting smart , and in part because nobody was fighting back .
The Democrats , of course , are still doing neither .
But they 're not the only ones with fists .
Look for the right to crumple like any schoolyard bully the minute somebody stands up to it , just as Move - On is now doing .
* FOLLOW THE RETIREMENTS : Republican politicians are retiring in droves now .
There are 14 so far who are quitting their House seats , including Ohio's Deborah Pryce , one of the top members of the GOP leadership .
Who wants the pleasure of defending the Republican record in next year 's election cycle , followed by a drubbing and an ignominious pink slip ?
Or , if you 're lucky enough to survive the tsunami , a lonely gig kicking around in forgotten wilderness of the mega-minority ?
* FOLLOW THE NUMBERS :
As if the gods were n't angry enough ( perhaps at Robertson for backing the pro-gay rights Giuliani ? ) ,
Republicans will have to defend twice the number of Senate seats up for election next year as will Democrats .
That may seem like sheer coincidence , but there is actually a perverse irony here .
This is the fruit of the GOP 's pyrrhic victory in 2002 , when they used the Iraq war vote and general security hysteria to pummel hapless Tom Daschle - like Democrats .
Now those very seats are up again , only this time the chicken has since come home to roost , and it 's an angry little fowl .
That 's some awfully nasty karma to be carrying on your ledger , man .
You might call Election 2008 the Revenge of Max Cleland .
* FOLLOW THE CONVERSIONS : Just as might be expected , Republicans are starting to change their party affiliations , even in places like Missouri and Kansas ( really ! ) .
And , just as also might be expected , you 're hearing the classic ( and true ) explanation for their move : " I did n't leave the Republican Party , the Republican Party left me " .
Sorry Ronnie Raygun , but what comes around ...
Watch for a whole lot more of this , especially after November 2008 .
* FOLLOW THE FOOD CHAIN :
They 're eating their young now .
Predictable , to be sure , but still so much fun to watch .
Did you hear that five conservative authors - including one of the Swift Boat hatchet - men , no less - are now suing their publishing house , Regnery ( did they actually mean to call it ' Degeneracy ' but it just got by the spell - checkers somehow ? ) , and its parent company , Eagle Publishing ?
It seems they 're a little upset that Eagle " orchestrates and participates in a fraudulent , deceptively concealed and self dealing scheme to divert book sales away from retail outlets and to wholly owned subsidiary organizations within the Eagle conglomerate " , and thus rip the authors off of royalties owed to them .
No kidding - really ?
I 'm sorry , guys , but just who exactly did you think you were dealing with here ?
Look in the mirror !
You cut a deal with a conservative press to publish your fraud , deception and self - dealing and you expected them to treat you better than George Bush did when he gave the gift of freedom and democracy to the Iraqis ?
And what 's up with your wanting fair treatment and fair pay for your labor ?
You guys are starting to sound like a bunch of whiney socialists , fer crissakes !
And tort - reform - needing litigious ones , at that !
This is America , Dudes .
Your America .
Get used to being scammed by people who are richer than you .
* FOLLOW THE FALLOW :
The right 's agenda is not only bankrupt of real policy ideas , but nowadays it 's even bankrupt of effective red-herrings as well .
Yesterday 's tried - and - true tropes no longer have that old magic anymore .
" Terrorism , terrorism , terrorism .
Gays , gays , gays . "
Yawn , yawn , yawn .
" Honey , have you seen the remote ?
I really need to change the channel .
And what time are we supposed to pick up Johnny from Little League practice ? "
Ho .
Hum .
This show is over .
Regressives would like to thank everyone in the audience for their participation .
Unfortunately , neither your wallets nor your articles of clothing are available for return to you at this time ...
If the signs of the looming conservative apocalypse get any clearer , even blind cave fish will be reading them .
These guys are getting ready to crumble like a poppy seed muffin six days past its sell - by date .
It certainly could n't happen to a nicer bunch , could it ?
I hope they get every little thing that is coming to them .
Except , of course , their Regnery royalties .

Pacific Gas & Electric today will announce a deal to buy as much as 900 megawatts of electricity .
It will be enough to power 540,000 California homes each year , and involve the construction of five solar power plants during the next decade .
The company to build the solar - thermal power plants in the Mojave Desert is BrightSource Energy .
“ From what I know , this is the biggest commitment ever in the history of solar , ” said John Woolard , BrightSource Energy ’s chief executive officer and president .
“ It ’s a fairly significant undertaking on both sides . ”
Building all five plants in the Mojave will cost $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion , Woolard said .
The project , which faces regulatory and financing hurdles , could mean 2,000 construction jobs , and employ about 1,000 workers to operate the plants .
BrightSource ’s founder and chairman is Arnold Goldman , whose now - defunct Luz International built nine solar plants in the Mojave Desert between 1984 and 1990 .
They ’re still operating .
BrightSource uses what it calls distributed power towers , or DPTs , in which sunlight from thousands of movable mirrors are concentrated to heat water to more than 1,000 degrees in a boiler to make steam .
That steam feeds a turbine that makes electricity .
BrightSource will begin the first demonstration of its technology at a small - scale plant in Israel in April .
It anticipates the first of its five California plants for PG&E , a 100 - megawatt facility , to be up and running “ as early as 2011 , ” Woolard said .
That plant , and a larger 200 - megawatt plant scheduled to begin operation in 2012 - 13 , will be built on the Ivanpah dry - lake bed in San Bernardino County .
Three other BrightSource 200 - megawatt solar plants also are planned , to be built from 2014 to 2016 at the Broadwell dry lake , about 100 miles southwest of Ivanpah .

“ At most , you could blame four to five people , ” Dr. Primorac said , for wearing Ustashe regalia , or giving the Nazi salute during the concert .
He emphasized , too , that Croatia was a good friend of Israel and pointed to a photograph on his mantelpiece of himself with the Israeli elder statesman Shimon Peres as evidence .

At a recent concert in Zagreb , some fans of the Croatian rock star Marko Perkovic wore the black caps of Croatias World War II Nazi puppet government , known as Ustashe .

Over the last three years the conservative prime minister , Ivo Sanader , has to some extent managed to shed the country ’s image as a nationalist state that once harbored war criminals .
The effort has been successful enough that Croatia is a favorite to join the European Union .
What was seen for much of 1990s as a war - torn nation is now widely perceived as a prime tourist destination , with 10 million tourists a year and visitors flocking to its Adriatic coast .
Photographs and memorabilia from the Ustashe period are no longer sold openly in Zagreb ’s city center .
Restaurants no longer display photographs of Ustashe units on their wall .
But souvenir shops do still sell key rings and baseball caps with the Ustashe U , as well as the slogan used in Mr. Perkovic ’s concerts , “ Za Dom : Spremni ! ” or , “ For the Homeland : Ready ! ”
And many Croats still display an insensitivity to Holocaust issues .
Mr. Perkovic ’s public affairs manager , Albino Ursic , has a large poster that he designed in 1994 on the wall of his office with the words “ final solution . ”
The poster shows a package of cigarettes marked with a large Swastika and labeled “ Adolf Filters , ” poking out of a black leather jacket .
“ It ’s an antismoking picture , ” he said .
“ It won an award in Lisbon , ” he added , emphasizing that he viewed himself as left of center .
As for Mr. Perkovic ’s performance , Mr. Ursic said , the fascist salute is made by soccer hooligans across Europe who have little understanding of it .
“ It is just teenage rebellion , ” he said .
Mr. Perkovic ’s patriotic — and sometimes violently nationalistic — songs first became popular here during the Balkan wars , when he fought in the Croatian Army .
Most Croats know him better by his stage name , Thompson , given to him during the war , when he carried the submachine gun of the same name .
He , too , has recently sought to distance himself from the Ustashe association .
In an interview , the soft - spoken singer said he had never raised his own arm to make a fascist salute .
Nor , he said , did he encourage people to wear Ustashe uniforms .
As for the Ustashe slogan he uses , he claims it is a traditional Croatian salute that predates World War II .
Mrs Clinton is telling supporters that all votes count
Clinton at rally US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has rejected calls by supporters of her rival , Barack Obama , to abandon her campaign for the Democratic nomination .
Senator Patrick Leahy , an influential Democrat and Obama supporter , had said that by remaining in the race she was helping the Republican party .
Mrs Clinton told supporters she had no intention of abandoning the race .
The New York senator is trailing Mr Obama in the number of delegates needed to obtain the nomination .
But the latest opinion polls suggest that she is leading Mr Obama by more than 10 points in the next major primary in Pennsylvania on 22 April .
My attitude is that Senator Clinton can run as long as she wants - her name 's on the ballot and she is a fierce and formidable competitor
Barack Obama
" There are some folks saying : ' Well , we ought to stop these elections ' , " she told a crowd at a high school in Indianapolis , Indiana .
" I did n't think we believed that in America .
I thought we of all people knew how important it was to give everyone a chance to have their voices heard . "
Former President Bill Clinton said those calling for his wife to pull out of the race should " just relax " .
" Everywhere I go , all these working people say , ' Do n't you dare let her drop out - do n't listen to those people in Washington ' , " he said during campaigning in Pennsylvania .
Mrs Clinton also made a campaign stop in Kentucky , where her main theme was jobs and the economy .
Race for delegates Mr Obama was in Pennsylvania , where he distanced himself from Mr Leahy 's comments .
DEMOCRATIC DELEGATE RACE BARACK OBAMA : 1,623 States won : 25
HILLARY CLINTON : 1,499 States won : 16
Delegates needed to secure nomination : 2,024 .
Source : AP at 0804 GMT 30 March " My attitude is that Senator Clinton can run as long as she wants .
Her name 's on the ballot and she is a fierce and formidable competitor , " the Illinois senator said .
" I think that she should be able to compete , and her supporters should be able to support her , for as long as they are willing or able . "
Mr Leahy , who chairs the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee , said in a statement on Friday that Mrs Clinton " has every right , but not a very good reason , to remain a candidate for as long as she wants to " .
" As far as the delegate count and the interests of a Democratic victory in November go , there is not a very good reason for drawing this out , " he said , arguing that she had scant chance of winning the nomination .
Mr Obama currently leads by 1,623 delegates to the party convention in August to Mrs Clinton 's 1,499 .
To secure the nomination , the winner must secure 2,024 delegates - which correspondents say neither candidate will be able to do on the basis of delegates won in the remaining primary elections alone .
If Mrs Clinton manages to win a larger share of the national popular vote , it is thought that she may secure the backing of the so - called super - delegates who could tip the balance .
Analysts say a bitter , drawn - out fight between the two contenders , going right up to the Democratic convention in August , could damage the eventual nominee 's chances of beating their Republican rival , John McCain .

What are these ?
( CNN ) -- Despite Sen. Barack Obama 's commanding lead in the delegate count , Sen. Hillary Clinton campaigned hard Sunday , telling voters she 's " running for the toughest job in the world . "
Sen .
Hillary Clinton has vowed to stay in the race until all states have a say .
Clinton spent her weekend in Kentucky , which , along with Oregon , holds its Democratic contest Tuesday .
Clinton is favored in Kentucky , while polls show Obama with a comfortable lead in Oregon .
Speaking in Bowling Green , the senator from New York said it was a " treat " to have the whole state to herself since Obama would not be returning there .
Clinton has faced calls to drop out of the race since she trails Obama across all fronts -- pledged delegates , superdelegates and the popular vote .
Clinton has recently been claiming a lead over Obama in the popular vote , a debatable claim , especially because the Democratic National Committee does n't count the votes of Florida and Michigan , which Clinton does .
Watch why she says she 's ahead »
Florida and Michigan were stripped of their delegates for scheduling their primaries too early , and Clinton was the only top - tier candidate whose name was on the ballot in Michigan .
Clinton 's campaign also excludes the caucus states in their popular vote count .
According to CNN 's latest count , Obama leads Clinton in total delegates 1,904 to 1,717 .
A candidate needs 2,025 to clinch the Democratic nomination .
Clinton encouraged her Kentucky supporters to vote in the upcoming primary , saying Sunday , " If we get everybody turned out , it 's going to send a great message to our country that you do n't stop democracy in its tracks . "
" You do n't tell some states that they can't vote and other states that have already had the opportunity that they 're somehow more important , " she said .
In considering who to vote for , she told the crowd to " think about this as a hiring decision . "
" Come out and vote for me on Tuesday , I 'll work my heart out for you , " she said .
Meanwhile Obama , who 's been campaigning in Oregon , focused his attacks on Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee .
Obama on Sunday suggested that McCain has n't received the kind of scrutiny that he 's received throughout the campaign .
" It is very understandable that the press focus has been on myself and Sen. Clinton because this has been a pretty exciting race on the Democratic side .
I would expect that the press will submit him to the same scrutiny that they are submitting me , " he said at a senior center in Gresham .
Watch Obama speak in Oregon »
In Gresham , Obama detailed his plans to strengthen Social Security .
Part of his plan includes eliminating income taxes for seniors making less than $ 50,000 per year .
Obama made low - key campaign stops this weekend , hitting a street festival in Keizer and stopping for ice cream in Eugene .
The last time Oregon had much weight in the primary season was in 1968 , when Robert Kennedy was campaigning for the Democratic nomination .
The prolonged primary season comes to an end June 3 .
Puerto Rico weighs in on June 1 , and South Dakota and Montana bring the season to a close the following Tuesday .
CNN 's Jim Acosta , Suzanne Malveaux and Alexander Marquardt contributed to this report .
All About Hillary Clinton • Barack Obama
* Photo : Thomas Hannich * Tobacco
Thanks to nicotine , this plant may be mildly hallucinogenic .
It can be chewed , brewed , smoked , or , as some South American shamans prefer , enjoyed as an enema .
Paper
Tobacco firms are very secretive about their products ' myriad ingredients , but we do know that about 10 percent of any given smoke is simply cellulose and a thin strip of adhesive .
Ammonium Hydroxide
Essentially ammonia in water .
There is some evidence that ammonia reacts with tobacco to free the nicotine , making it more accessible to the bloodstream ( manufacturers dispute this ) .
Of course , the Material Safety Data Sheet warns that inhaling ammonia vapors , whatever the source , may damage the upper respiratory tract .
Castoreum
Commonly found in the secretions of a beaver 's castor glands ( located near the animal 's genitals ) , this substance when processed gives your cigarette a sweet odor and smoky flavor .
In 1991 , Phillip Morris used just 8 pounds of the pungent stuff to make 400 billion cigarettes — proving that a little genital secretion goes a long way .
2 - Acetyl-3- Ethylpyrazine
According to tobacco - industry documents , this pyrazine ( an aromatic ringed compound ) provides an " earthy depth of flavor . "
Funny , when the same compound is used in food preparation , it 's described as tasting like potatoes .
Copaiba Oil
One way that Brazil intends to make itself hydrocarbon - independent is with the oleoresin of the copaiba tree , which is so flammable it can practically fuel a diesel engine without any refining at all .
Why is it in cigarettes ?
One possibility is that ammonium hydroxide decreases combustibility , so manufacturers have to counteract it with a nontoxic accelerant .
Perhaps , but copaiba oil is also used as a folk remedy for prostate tumors ( and gonorrhea ) .
Phenyl Methyl Ketone ( Acetophenone )
C 6 H 5 COCH 3 is a major component of tear gas , which should come as no surprise to anyone who 's hung out in a smoke - filled bar .
Here it may act as a low - level narcotic .
Gamma- Heptalactone
This compound is a mild inhibitor of the CYP 2 A 6 enzyme , which helps break down substances — including nicotine — in the bloodstream .
By slowing this process , heptalactone may help keep the precious nicotine in your body longer .
Sugar
Burning sugar releases acetaldehyde ( as does fermenting alcohol ) , which at least one study says has a narcotic effect .
It 's also a positive reinforcer when combined with nicotine — each amplifies the other 's effect on your brain ( and the likelihood you 'll want to keep smoking ) .
Levulinic Acid
This crystalline substance desensitizes the upper respiratory tract , creating a perception of smoothness or mildness .
It 's also another way of juicing tobacco 's high — levulinic acid enhances the binding of nicotine to the appropriate receptors in the brain , giving you more bang with each puff .
L- Arginine
Smoking tobacco causes monocytes ( specialized white blood cells ) to stick to the endothelial cells on the inner walls of arteries and veins .
This buildup , like all circulatory blockages , can lead to heart attack and stroke .
Arginine , a common amino acid , may reverse some of this accumulation when taken orally .
So , in a sense , maybe cigarettes are n't so bad after all .

6月の転職を機にメインの作業環境をGentooLinuxに変更して快適なLinuxライフを送っていたのだが、ちょっとわけあって一時的にXPに戻す事になった。今年の初めから５月末まではOSXだったから、久々のWin環境。
何でもかんで もConsole + zshって環境に慣れた今、scpでファイルひとつコピーするにもWinSCPを起動する現状は非常に面倒。ファイルもエクスプローラーで・・・ってのがとてつもなくだるい。いちいちフォルダの横の + とかクリックしてられるか！っと。
かといって、DOS窓は非常に使い勝手が悪い。文字でかいしコピペしづらいし。Cygtermを改造してcmd.exeをPuTTY経由で操作するようにもしてみたんだが、なんかリピートがおかしかったりで今ひとつ。
素直 にCygwin使えよって声が聞こえてきそうだが、以前から使ってはいたものの、実はCygwinってあんまり好きじゃない。Winを使うからには別に/じゃなくc:\でいいんだよね。じゃないとFirefoxでDLしたファイルをデスクトップからいちいちc:\homeに移動したり、レジストリいじくってデスクトップの位置を変更したりとかしなきゃならない。
そもそもネイティブのFileSystemが/cygdrive/c/とか以下に出るのがなんとも。
cd /cygdrive/c/Documents \ and \
Settings / hideden/デスクトップ
とか個人的になんか気持ち悪い。
そんな中、そもそもcmd.exeの代替となるものはないのか？っと思って検索してたところ、ckwというのがとても便利だと見かけた。が、、、配布元が404・・・。
・・・っと、前置きがえらく長くなったが、結論としてarchive.orgにあるミラーからソースのみ取得することが出来た。
配布元によるとライセンスはGPLらしいので、いくつか気になった点を改造した。
設定ファイル名を ckw.txt → ckw.cfg に変更 ( 個人的な好みです。 )
Makefileか らCygwin依存のシェルスクリプトをbatに書き換え、VCでコンパイルできるようにした
カレントディレクトリを指定する-cd ,-- chdir を追加 -e cmd.exe / K cd c:\とかでも行けるが、他シェル等でも楽にするため。
実行シェルを設定ファイルに記述できるようにした -eオプションで指定できていたが、ショートカットをいじるのが面倒だったため。
タイトルを指定するオプション-tl , --titleを追加 cmd用とnyacus用を見分けやすくしたくて。
フォントサイズを標準のDOS窓より小さく設定すると、最大化や窓リサイズで一定以上の大きさになるとウィンドウサイズがおかしくなってしまう不具合を修正(多分)
MS Gothic
12で最大化するとなんかタイトルバーのみの小さな窓になってしまっていた。
こんな所。一番の問題は最大化で窓が極小になってしまうところ。どうやらオリジナルのDOS窓でのフォントサイズと画面解像度から算出された縦横の文字数を超えるとおかしくなっていた模様。XGAだと横125文字以上になるとおかしくなる。
で、kernel32.dllにあるSetConsoleFontなる隠しAPIを使って、非表示にしてあるDOS窓のフォントサイズを極小に設定することで回避。
元々C/C++は見よう見まねでやってるので、挙動がおかしい部分があればぜひ指摘していただければ。
って事で、オリジナルソースのmirrorとオリジナルのバイナリ、改造版のバイナリ・ソースをうｐっておく。GPLだし問題ないと思うが、なんか問題があればコメントとかnowa経由等でご指摘ください。コンパイルはVC8(VisualStudio2005 )で行った。

それにしてもこのソフト便利。PuTTYライクな選択でコピー、右クリックでペーストが出来るだけでなく、コンソールじゃないから普通に日本語を通常のIMEから入力できる。日本語入力をONにするとカーソル色が変わったりするのもいい。
何より、nyacusと組み合わせると最強。長くなったのでこれについてはまた後日。

Summary of Findings
The videos of Rev. Jeremiah Wright ’s controversial sermons and Barack Obama ’s subsequent speech on race and politics have attracted more public attention than any events thus far in the 2008 presidential campaign .
A majority of the public ( 51 % ) said they heard “ a lot ” about the videos , and an even larger percentage ( 54 % ) said they heard a lot about Obama ’s speech , according to the weekly News Interest Index .
Most voters aware of the sermons say they were personally offended by Wright ’s comments , and a sizable minority ( 35 % ) says that their opinion of Obama has grown less favorable because of Wright ’s statements .
However , the Wright controversy does not appear to have undermined support for Obama ’s candidacy .
The latest nationwide survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , conducted March 19 - 22 among 1,503 adults , finds that Obama maintains a 49 % to 39 % advantage over Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination , which is virtually unchanged from the 49 % to 40 % lead he held among Democrats in late February .
Obama and Clinton continue to enjoy slight advantages over John McCain in general election matchups among all registered voters .
The new polling suggests that the Wright affair has not hurt Obama ’s standing , in part because his response to the controversy has been viewed positively by voters who favor him over Clinton .
Obama ’s handling of the Wright controversy also won a favorable response from a substantial proportion of Clinton supporters and even from a third of Republican voters .
More than eight - in - ten supporters of Obama ( 84 % ) who have heard about the controversy over Wright ’s sermons say he has done an excellent or good job of dealing with the situation .
Reactions from Clinton supporters , and Republicans , are on balance negative ; however , 43 % of Clinton voters and a third of Republican voters who have heard about the affair express positive opinions about Obama ’s handling of the situation .
The survey finds that , in general , Obama has a highly favorable image among Democratic voters , including white Democrats .
But while Obama ’s personal image is more favorable than Clinton ’s , certain social beliefs and attitudes among older , white , working - class Democratic voters are associated with his lower levels of support among this group .
In particular , white Democrats who hold unfavorable views of Obama are much more likely than those who have favorable opinions of him to say that equal rights for minorities have been pushed too far ; they also are more likely to disapprove of interracial dating , and are more concerned about the threat that immigrants may pose to American values .
In addition , nearly a quarter of white Democrats ( 23 % ) who hold a negative view of Obama believe he is a Muslim .
Less educated and older white Democrats , who have not backed Obama in most primary elections , hold these values more commonly than do other Democrats .
These patterns suggest the potential for future reverberations from the Wright controversy if Obama wins the Democratic nomination .
More conservative beliefs about equal rights and race are not only related to negative opinions of Obama among Democrats , suggesting the potential for defections among Democratic voters , but also are associated with negative views of him in the electorate at large .
An analysis of the survey finds that holding conservative positions on political and social values is associated with a greater likelihood of supporting McCain over Obama among Republicans , Democrats and independents , and all demographic groups .
In contrast , however , this pattern is much less apparent in the Clinton - McCain matchup , excepting views about women in leadership roles .
One of the few negative trends for Obama following the Wright affair is that a larger number of conservative Republicans hold a very unfavorable opinion of him in the new poll than did so in February .
The survey also finds that Obama no longer enjoys the favorable image rating advantage over McCain among independents that was apparent in previous polls .
Large majorities of white Democratic voters view Obama as honest , inspiring , patriotic , and down - to - earth .
Obama ’s personal image surpasses Clinton ’s on almost every personal attribute tested in the survey , except patriotism .
In addition , roughly twice as many white Democrats say the word “ phony ” describes Clinton than say it describes Obama ( 30 % vs. 16 % ) .
And the gap is even larger in perceptions of likability ; 43 % of white Democratic voters say the phrase “ hard - to - like ” describes Clinton , while just 13 % say it describes Obama .
Gender makes a significant difference in personal perceptions of Hillary Clinton .
Democratic women voters are much more likely than their male counterparts to view Clinton as honest and down - to - earth , and they more often report that Clinton makes them feel proud and hopeful .
However , Democratic women voters are about as likely as Democratic men to say the descriptors hard - to - like and phony apply to Clinton .
Views of Obama More Tied to Voters ’ Emotions
White voters ’ views of Barack Obama are more influenced by how he makes them feel than by specific characteristics voters attribute to him .
Saying that Obama makes them feel hopeful and proud are the strongest predictors of the ratings white Democrats give him .
And of the personal traits tested , “ inspiring ” is more closely linked with views of the Illinois senator than any of the others .
On the other hand , views of Hillary Clinton among white Democratic voters are more influenced by perceptions that she is phony than by any other trait or emotion tested .
But saying that Clinton makes them feel proud and hopeful also are significant predictors of how these voters rate her .
Interestingly , while sizable minorities of white Democratic voters say Clinton is hard - to - like ( 43 % ) , this opinion does not have a significant impact on her favorability ratings .
McCain Out of the Spotlight
Opinions about John McCain are mostly unchanged in the current survey .
In part , this may be explained by his low level of public visibility .
In the current weekly News Interest Index survey , just 3 % mentioned McCain , unprompted , as the candidate they had heard most about in the news .
That compares with 70 % who named Obama and 15 % who named Clinton as the candidate they had heard most about .
More positive for McCain , however , is that a growing proportion of Republican voters say that the GOP will solidly unite behind the Arizona senator ; 64 % express that view currently , up from 58 % in late February .
Along with this expression of increased partisan unity , the survey finds that by a considerable margin ( 52% - 37 % ) , independent voters say that if McCain is elected , he will take the country in a different direction rather than continuing Bush ’s policies .
This comes at an opportune time for the GOP candidate .
Bush ’s job approval rating has slipped to 28 % , the lowest of his presidency .
In addition , just 22 % express satisfaction with the way things are going in the country .
This , too , is about as negative an evaluation of the course of the nation as measured in nearly 20 years of Pew surveys .
It ’s the Inflation , Stupid
Americans have grown steadily more negative about the national economy over the past three months .
Just 11 % of the public rates the economy as excellent or good , down from 17 % in early February , and 26 % in January .
Judgments about the national economy are now as negative as they were during the recession of the early 1990s .
In August 1993 , 10 % of Americans rated the economy as excellent or good in a Gallup survey .
However , deepening concern about the national economy has so far not translated into more dour assessments of personal finances .
As has been the case for some time , Americans are roughly divided between those who rate their personal finances as only fair or poor ( 51 % ) and those who say they are excellent or good ( 47 % ) .
In December 1993 , just 39 % rated their personal finances positively , while 60 % viewed them negatively .
Rising prices are clearly the public ’s top personal concern .
Nearly half ( 49 % ) say that rising prices are the economic issue that most worries them .
In contrast , just 19 % name the job situation , 14 % cite problems in the financial markets , and 12 % cite declining real estate values .
Inflation is the primary concern for people at all income levels , although worries about financial markets and declining real estate values register more strongly with Americans with household incomes of $ 100,000 or more .
In contrast , the job situation is a relatively major concern for people with the lowest household incomes .
Other important findings include :
Apparently , Planet X ( a.k.a. Nibiru ) was spotted by astronomers in the early 1980 ’s in the outermost reaches of the Solar System .
It has been tracked by infrared observatories ; seen lurking around in the Kuiper Belt and now it is speeding right toward us and will enter the inner Solar System in 2012 .
So what does this mean to us ?
Well , the effects of the approach of Planet X on our planet will be biblical , and what ’s more the effects are being felt right now .
Millions , even billions of people will die , global warming will increase ; earthquakes , drought , famine , wars , social collapse , even killer solar flares will be caused by Nibiru blasting through the core of the Solar System .
All of this will happen in 2012 , and we must begin preparing for our demise right now …
As investigated in my previous article “ No Doomsday in 2012 “ , a lot of weight had been placed on the end of an ancient Mayan calendar , the “ Long Count ” .
According to this calendar and Mayan myth , something is going to happen on December 21st , 2012 .
Now the world ’s Planet X supporters seem to have calculated that this hypothetical , deadly planet will arrive from a highly eccentric orbit to wreak gravitational havoc on Earth , sparking geological , social , economic and environmental damage , killing a high proportion of life … in 2012 .
Related 2012 articles :
I ’m sorry , but the “ facts ” behind the Planet X / Nibiru myth simply do not add up .
Do n’t worry , Planet X will not be knocking on our door in 2012 and here ’s why …
Nibiru and Planet X
In 1843 , John Couch Adams ( a British mathematician and astronomer ) studied the orbital perturbations of Uranus and deduced that through gravitational interactions , there must be an eighth planet , tugging at the gas giant .
This led to the discovery of Neptune , orbiting at a distance of 30 AU from the Sun .
There have been numerous occasions where this method has been used to deduce the existence of other bodies in the Solar System before they were directly observed .
Neptune was also experiencing orbital perturbations , and on the discovery of Pluto in 1930 , it was thought that the aptly named “ Planet X ” had been discovered .
Alas , Pluto ’s mass was tiny , and once the orbit of Charon ( Pluto ’s moon ) was analysed it was found that the mass of the Pluto - Charon system was far too small to affect the orbit of Neptune .
The hunt for Planet X continued …
After years of speculation and historic research , it was believed that a huge body astronomers were looking for was a huge planet or a small star , possibly a companion to our Sun ( making the Solar System a binary system ) .
The name “ Nibiru ” was unearthed by the author Zecharia Sitchin , on researching the possible intervention of extraterrestrials in the early history of mankind .
Nibiru is a hypothetical planet as taught in ancient Sumerian culture ( the Sumerians existed from around 6,000 BC to 3,000BC , predating Babylon , in the current geographic location of Iraq ) .
There is very little archaeological evidence to suggest this mythical planet has anything to do with Planet X .
But since this dubious connection , Planet X and Nibiru are now thought by doomsayers to be the same thing , an ancient astronomical body that has returned after a long orbit beyond the Solar System .
OK , so the Nibiru / Planet X connection might be a bit ropey already , but is there any solid evidence for the modern - day Planet X ?
Infrared observations = Planet X
There is much emphasis placed on the 1983 “ discovery ” of a mysterious heavenly body by NASA ’s Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) on the outskirts of the Solar system , some 50 billion miles ( 540 AU ) away .
Naturally the world ’s media will have been very excited by such a discovery and began making noises that perhaps this was Planet X ( the most popular accessible resources for Planet X advocates is the Washington Post article published on December 31st 1983 titled “ Mystery Heavenly Body Discovered “ ) .
In actuality , astronomers were n’t sure what the infrared object was ( the clue is in the word “ mystery ” ) .
Initial media reports postulated that it could be a long - period comet , or a planet , or a far - off young galaxy or a protostar ( i.e. a brown dwarf ) .
As soon as the last possibility is mentioned , suddenly this became the “ discovery ” that Planet X was in fact a brown dwarf orbiting in the outer reaches of our Solar System .
“ So mysterious is the object that astronomers do not know if it is a planet , a giant comet , a nearby “ protostar ” that never got hot enough to become a star , a distant galaxy so young that it is still in the process of forming its first stars or a galaxy so shrouded in dust that none of the light cast by its stars ever gets through . ”
– Thomas O’Toole , Washington Post Staff Writer , December 30th 1983 ( from text on the Planet X and Pole Shift website )
So where did the Washington Post get its story ?
The story was published in response to the research printed a paper titled “ Unidentified point sources in the IRAS minisurvey ” ( by Houck et al , published in Astrophysical Journal Letters , 278: L63 , 1984 ) .
Dr. Gerry Neugebauer , co-investigator in the IRAS project , was interviewed and strongly stated that what IRAS had seen was not “ incoming mail ” ( i.e. the results did not suggest there was an object approaching Earth ) .
On reading this interesting research , I was especially drawn to the paper ’s conclusion :
“ A number of candidate identifications have been considered including near - solar system , galactic , and extragalactic objects .
Further observations at infrared and other wavelengths may provide additional information in support of one of these conjectures , or perhaps these objects will require entirely different interpretations . ” – Houck et al , Astrophysical Journal Letters , 278:L63 , 1984 .
Although these IRAS observations were seeing mysterious objects , at this stage , there was no indication that there was an object ( let alone a brown dwarf ) powering its way toward us .
But the rumours had already begun to flow .
When follow - up papers were published in 1985 ( Unidentified IRAS sources – Ultrahigh - luminosity galaxies , Houck et al. , 1985 ) and 1987 ( The IRAS View of the Extragalactic Sky , Soifer et al. , 1987 ) , there was little if any media interest in their findings .
According to these publications , most of the IRAS observations in the 1984 paper were distant , ultra - luminous young galaxies and one was a filamentary structure known as “ infrared cirrus ” floating in intergalactic space .
IRAS never observed any astronomical body in the outer reaches of the Solar System .
Orbital perturbations = Planet X
In addition to the 1983 “ discovery ” of the Planet X brown dwarf , the 1992 Planet X claim goes something like this : “ Unexplained deviations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune point to a large outer solar system body of 4 to 8 Earth masses , on a highly tilted orbit , beyond 7 billion miles from the sun , ” – text from an un-cited NASA source on the “ Planet X Forecast and 2012 Survival Guide ” video .
Pulling up the discovery of planets using orbital perturbation measurements , Planet X advocates point to a NASA announcement that in 1992 , there were indirect measurements of a planet some 7 billion miles from Earth .
Alas , I cannot find the original source for this claim .
The only huge discovery NASA announced along these lines was the discovery of the first major trans -Neptunian object ( TNO ) called 1992 QB 1 ( full details of the discovery of this “ cubewano - class ” object can be found in the original announcement transcript ) .
It has a diameter of 200 km and is confined to the Kuiper Belt , a zone of minor planets ( where Pluto lives ) and asteroids from 30 AU to 55 AU , just outside Neptune ’s orbit .
Some of these bodies ( like Pluto ) cross the path of Neptune ’s orbit and there therefore designated as a TNO .
These TNO ’s pose no threat to the Earth ( in as much as they wont be leaving the Kuiper Belt to pay us a visit in 2012 ) .
Since then , any Neptune orbital perturbations have been put down to observational error and have since not been observed … so there does n’t appear to be any obvious object any bigger than the largest Kuiper Belt objects out there .
Still , to keep an open mind , there could be more large bodies to be discovered ( that might explain why there is such a steep drop - off of Kuiper Belt objects at the “ Kuiper Cliff ” , the jury is out on that idea ) , but there is no evidence for a massive body approaching from the vicinity of the Kuiper Belt .
Even the strange Pioneer anomaly that the Pioneer and Voyager probes are experiencing cannot be attributed to Planet X .
This anomaly appears to be a Sun - ward acceleration , if there was a massive planet out there , there should be some gravitational effect beyond what has been predicted by the other known objects in the Solar System .
4 - 8 Earth masses = a brown dwarf ?
It must be Planet X .
Probably the most glaring inconsistency in the Planet X hypothesis is the Planet X advocates assertion that the 1984 IRAS object and the 1992 body are one of the same thing .
As announced on many websites and online videos about Planet X , the 1984 IRAS observation saw Planet X at 50 billion miles from Earth .
The 1992 NASA “ announcement ” put Planet X at a distance of about 7 billion miles from Earth .
Therefore , the logic goes , Planet X had travelled 43 billion miles in the course of only eight years ( from 1984 to 1992 ) .
After some dubious mathematics , Planet X is therefore expected to reach the core of the Solar System in 2012 .
( Although many believed it should arrive in 2003 … they were obviously wrong about that prediction . )
Well , I think we might be clutching at straws here .
For starters , for the 1984 object to be the same as the 1992 object , surely they should be the same mass ?
If Planet X was a brown dwarf ( as we are led to believe in the IRAS observations ) , how can it possibly weigh in at only 4 to 8 Earth masses eight years later ?
Brown dwarfs have a mass of around 15 - 80 Jupiter masses .
As Jupiter is about 318 Earth masses , surely the object hurtling toward us should have a mass of somewhere between 4,770 and 25,440 Earth masses ?
So I am going to go out on a limb here and say that I reckon the 1984 object and the 1992 object ( if either object actually existed that is ) are not the same thing .
Not by a very long shot .
If there is no evidence supporting Planet X , it must be a conspiracy
If it can be this easy to cast the fundamental “ scientific ” theory behind Planet X into doubt , I see little point in discussing the historical reasons ( mass extinctions , volcanic activity , earthquakes etc. ) as to why the doomsayers believe Planet X should exist .
If there is no renegade planet out there of significant mass , how can Nibiru be a threat to us in 2012 ?
They will have us believe there is a global conspiracy of international governments hiding the facts from us .
NASA is involved in the cover - up , hence the lack of evidence .
In my opinion , simply because there is no evidence , does n’t mean there is a conspiracy to hide the truth from the public .
So why would governments want to hide a “ discovery ” as historic as a doomsday planet approaching the inner Solar System anyway ?
To avoid mass panic and pursue their own , greedy agendas ( obviously ) .
As it turns out , this is the only strength behind the Planet X myth .
When confronted with scientific facts , the Planet X advocates reply with “ … governments are sending out disinformation and covering up the true observations of Nibiru . ”
Although I enjoy a good conspiracy theory , I will not support anything in the name of Planet X .
If the basic science behind what we are led to believe are the foundation of Planet X existing is wrong , it seems a poor argument to say “ the government did it ” .
Therefore , the story that Planet X will arrive in 2012 - 21 - December is , in my view , total bunkum ( but it helps to sell doomsday books and DVDs by scaring people ) .
Nibiru will remain in the realms of Sumerian myth .

If you recently lost your job , take a look at Wise Bread 's collection of tips and resources for the recently laid off . ]
I worked at a non - profit - - a local nature center - - over the summer of 1979 .
After we wrapped up our main task , those of us who wanted to were allowed stay on for the few weeks before we went back to college , doing things like trimming branches on the hiking trails , repainting the lines in the parking lot , and working around a very old house that was to be turned into an exhibit on settlement - era homesteads .
It was work that was worth doing .
Unemployment was pretty high that summer , and there was a government program called CETA that employed people who could n't find real jobs .
Non-profits could get free labor from CETA , and the nature center did .
Of course , free labor is often worth what you pay for it .
Throw in the costs of hiring and managing your free workers , and it 's easy to come out behind .
CETA was structured to try to avoid those problems -- the government did the hiring and the managing .
The workers arrived every morning in a government van with their own manager .
We were just supposed to to have to let them know what needed doing .
One morning , I was trying to clear brush from around the foundation of the homestead .
It had already been cut ; I was just hauling the branches over to a brush pile over on the edge of the property .
It was n't hard , but sometimes the branches got snagged on one another , and at one point I asked one of the CETA workers to help me with some tangled branches that two people could just haul together , rather than untangling and hauling separately .
The guy said no .
I asked him why , and he said he did n't want to waste his energy .
There may have been a mechanism for getting the CETA people fired , but there was n't any point to doing so : the nature center got them for free .
If they did any work at all , the nature center was ahead of the game .
So , I just shrugged and kept on hauling brush as best I could , yanking on branches to separate the tangle .
My example seemed to shame the guy a little , because he relented and helped me haul the rest of the tangle .
Working together gave us a few minutes to talk .
He asked how much we ( non -CETA workers ) were making .
I said I was n't sure , but it was less than the minimum - wage that they were getting paid .
( Those of us who 'd stayed on from earlier in the summer were not technically " employees . "
I do n't know what we were exactly , but instead of wages we were paid a stipend -- not as much money as we could have made if we 'd gotten ordinary jobs , but enough that we could afford to spend the summer doing work that was worthwhile instead .
The nature center had simply continued our stipend for those extra few weeks . )
He could n't understand that at all , and I did n't have the words to explain it to him .
It 's only been in the last few years that I began to understand the difference between work that 's worth doing and work that is n't .
I had n't thought about those CETA workers for a long time until I came upon the fascinating article Doing More with Less by Franklin Schneider .
He makes the case for refusing to slave away at a soul - destroying job , choosing instead an intriguing alternative : Provide for your needs by taking full advantage of unemployment insurance and living in squalor .
When those means fall short , he suggests that fraud and theft can postpone the dreaded return to work , perhaps indefinitely .
Let me quickly deplore the theft and fraud -- crimes that are morally wrong , harmful to everyone , and can ruin your life if you get caught -- because I 'm much more interested in grappling with the underlying assumption Schneider makes :
That the only jobs that exist are pointless , unrewarding ones .
If you really believe that , then milking every last cent of your unemployment benefit makes perfect sense , and finding a new job is crazy :
Given a choice between getting a check every week for doing nothing and getting a check every week for flushing 40 hours of the prime of their lives down the toilet , they chose the latter .
I mean , what kind of self - hating , masochistic Protestant bulls *** is that ?
The fascinating thing to me is the huge fraction of the population that simply accept it as given that jobs are crappy .
It 's so sad that there are so many people -- that entire CETA work crew , for example -- who do n't know that there is work worth doing .
Hang out with working - class folks and you 'll find endless variations on the theme that jobs suck , bosses suck , and that the only two good things about their job are quitting time and payday .
Their goal to put in the absolute minimum effort to keep from getting fired -- and once they qualify for unemployment , they might very well choose to cut back on the effort level and see if they can't manage to get fired and milk that unemployment check once again .
It 's easy to see this as a class thing , but I do n't think it is .
Middle - class and upper - class folks also find themselves in crappy jobs for one reason or another , and among them you can find this attitude in full measure .
Frankly , it 's not an unreasonable attitude .
If your work is n't worth doing , it is n't worth doing well .
I 've always been sorry that I did n't have the words to explain to the CETA guy that there is work worth doing -- work that is n't a waste of your energy .
There are lots of ways that work can be worth doing .
It 's worthwhile to make something that 's useful or beautiful .
It 's worthwhile to help people or teach people or entertain people or comfort people .
Some work is worth doing entirely in its own right , and other work is primarily worth doing as part of some larger project that gives it meaning .
The way we structure work in our society makes it easy to lose sight of this .
Schools are a big part of the problem :
Most schoolwork is not worth doing .
It 's an imitation of real work designed to teach some skill or another .
But giving children nothing but mock work for 12 or 16 years makes it a lot harder for them to understand that there is real work out there -- work that 's worth doing .
I think parents also do their kids no favors when they encourage them to take low - skill , part - time jobs to earn pocket money .
( Sometimes they do so with the explicit motivation that it will teach their kids the value of work ! )
Kids will be far ahead of the game if they 're taught how to identify work that 's worth doing , and how to find a job doing that work .
Among other important reasons , it 's good to keep them away from the Franklin Schneiders of the world who can't imagine a job that is n't soul - destroying drudgery , at least until they 've got some personal experience to teach them otherwise .
It 's possible to shake yourself free from those ideas .
Start by keeping clear the distinction between work and a job .
A job is something that pays the bills .
Reserve the word " work " for work that 's worth doing -- whether you get paid for it or not .
Over time , increase the amount of work you do .
That will sound like crazy talk if you 're still stuck in the notion that work is the stuff that 's so awful that no one would do it unless they were getting paid .
But it comes naturally , once you find work that 's worth doing .
If you can increase the amount of work you do within the context of your job , that 's great .
If you can't , look for another job where you can .
If you can't find work within the context of a job at all , do work for yourself .
Think about what makes work worth doing , and look for those traits in the tasks you perform anyway -- much of that work is worth doing .
If some of it is n't worth doing , try to do less of that to free up time to do more of the other .
Whether or not work is worth doing seems to have little to do with how much you can earn doing it .
Plenty of crappy jobs pay low wages .
Plenty of high - income occupations require that you spend large amounts of time and effort on tasks that provide no benefit to anybody .
It takes effort to understand what work is worth doing .
It takes effort to find that work .
It takes effort to arrange your life so that work worth doing becomes a larger part of it .
The thing is , after your family , having work that 's worth doing is very possibly the most important factor determining whether you 're happy or not .
It 's worth some effort .
One might even say , it 's worth some work .
BAE set for rough time in the arms of Justice
The sudden detention of BAE Systems boss Mike Turner and non-executive director Sir Nigel Rudd by US authorities probing bribery allegations is an alarming development for every British business with interests in America .
It 's also a scary sign of just how powerful the US Department of Justice has become post -Enron .
Turner and Rudd arrived separately in America last week to be greeted by officials from the DoJ who led them into small rooms , searched their laptops and BlackBerrys and interrogated them about supposed corruption on £ 80 billion of Saudi Arabian arms deals .
It 's not clear how the DoJ knew the pair were arriving .
Rudd was n't on BAE business , and even directors of arms manufacturers are allowed to travel without being watched by the US government .
In Britain we are impressed with the DoJ 's success at securing fraud convictions against major businessmen , usually comparing it to the Serious Fraud Office 's much less aggressive approach .
In the UK , it 's hard to get a major fraud conviction , but perhaps it should be .
The American approach seems to start from a presumption of guilt and work backwards .
While the DoJ is investigating , anything remotely embarrassing that emerges during the inquiry gets listed in lawsuits or leaked to the press .
There 's no way the laptops would have contained revelations relating to the case ; let 's assume that , if Turner and Rudd were crooks , and there 's no evidence they are , they are n't stupid ones .
The point of this invasion was to act threatening and create insecurity .
If the US DoJ decides it is going to get you , there is nowhere you can hide , as the NatWest Three discovered .
When a case gets to court , the DoJ will put up a hundred charges - some of them wildly inflated - in the knowledge that a jury is bound to conclude the government would n't be making such a fuss if the accused had n't done something very wrong .
The department boasts a success rate of more than 90 % - even dictators do n't claim that many votes .
For other BAE staff lower down the chain , a trip to America now looks like a risk not worth taking .
Hard but not fair : the US Spirit of Liberty turned nasty on Mike Turner of BAE
In other high - profile US fraud cases , minions who just happened to be in the room when skulduggery supposedly occurred found themselves under intense pressure .
They were subpoenaed by the DoJ and greeted with a talk that goes something like this : ' Your career is over .
But if you tell us incriminating things about your bosses that coincide with our version of events , we 'll keep you out of prison .
Sign here .'
If the DoJ can so casually interrogate people as powerful as Turner and Rudd , imagine what they could do to the rest of us .
Those lawyers in the Justice Department are an extraordinary breed , far removed from government solicitors in the UK who are doing public service because a ) they had no choice or b ) they prefer the hours .
These guys do a few years crushing whatever comes into their path , before they either join Wall Street or run for election .
A string of top fraud convictions against big business people is almost a required part of the CV for lawyers - turned - politicians , a nod to the public that they are on their side .
To say that the NatWest Three deserved what they got , or that BAE remains worthy of further pursuit misses the point .
You can't have fair trials only for people who are innocent , in the same way that you can't have free speech only for people you agree with .
Justice ?
Nothing like it .
Urban Outfitters is a triumph of marketing - a hugely successful business that has disguised the gap between what it is and what its customers suppose it to be .
Walk into the store on Kensington High Street and be convinced you have entered a world run by a new breed of hippies - cooler and more sarcastic than the originals , and with better dress sense .
The staff look like students because many of them are , and everything in the shop blares detachment - a major attraction to twentysomethings who just can't resist an ironic T - shirt and thirtysomethings still trying to pull off the old look .
The stores have already conquered New York and London .
Ireland is next .
Quiet man :
To expand , Richard Hayne needs to stay in the background
It seems unlikely that many of the staff or the customers know much about the owner and boss of Urban - a brilliant retailer called Richard Hayne whose views would be a serious risk to sales were his profile to rise .
Hayne started the business in the 1970s , taking it public in 1993 and bringing it to Britain in 1998 .
He is still the biggest shareholder and a seriously rich man - a billionaire by some estimates .
You only have to look to see that there is nothing remotely hip about him .
There is surely a bigger gulf between Hayne and his customer base than any other High Street retailer .
Shopping in Urban makes you feel like you are somewhere radically Left - wing , an antidote to the corporate blandness of The Gap .
But Hayne is a stanch conservative who donates money to Republican politicians , not least Rick Santorum , a now failed Senator whose views on homosexuality are both bizarre and old - fashioned .
Hayne does n't give many interviews precisely because he 's afraid that college slackers who get to know him will suddenly realise that buying his clothes is like giving cash to George Bush .
Once described as projecting a " Dick Cheney - esque aura of no-nonsense grayflannel gravitas " , Hayne must be the only retailer whose expansion plans depend on no one finding out who he really is .
Despite the strife in the sector , Urban just beat Wall Street profit expectations yet again .
So far , the illusion is holding up perfectly .
Let 's make tax a status symbol to brag about
The other week Italian authorities posted on the internet the 2005 tax returns of all 40 million of the country 's taxpayers .
Before howls of complaint led to the site being shut down , some interesting information was gleaned .
For one , it was disclosed that Giorgio Armani then paid a handsome € 19 m ( £ 15 m at today 's prices ) on income of € 44 m - healthy figures that show the fashion designer at least pulling his weight .
How many top earners in the UK could boast similar ratios ?
Personal income is a sensitive subject ( painfully so ) , but in the public interest the government could surely justify disclosing who are , say , the top , 200 individual taxpayers .
Maybe it could herald a new approach to taxpaying by the very rich , who mostly prefer to hire good accountants and then write cheques to charity when it suits them .
Rather than disappearing off into tax havens and bragging to each other about how little they hand - over to the government , tycoons would battle to be that year 's top taxpayer .
Sir Philip Green , competitive type that he is , would want to ensure he was higher in the list than the other knights of retail , Sir Terry Leahy of Tesco and Sir Stuart Rose of M&S .
Instead of comparing wives and cars , investment bankers would show off by boasting , ' Did you see the size of my tax return ? '
Okay , I 'm hallucinating .
AT THE Nomad Café in Oakland , California , Tia Katrina Canlas , a law student at the nearby university in Berkeley , places her double Americano next to her mobile phone and iPod , opens her MacBook laptop computer and logs on to the café 's wireless internet connection to study for her class on the legal treatment of sexual orientation .
She is a regular here but does n't usually bring cash , so her credit - card statement reads “ Nomad , Nomad , Nomad , Nomad ” .
That says it all , she thinks .
Permanently connected , she communicates by text , photo , video or voice throughout the day with her friends and family , and does her “ work stuff ” at the same time .
She roams around town , but often alights at oases that cater to nomads .
Christopher Waters , the owner , opened the Nomad Café in 2003 , just as Wi -Fi “ hotspots ” were mushrooming all around town .
His idea was to provide a watering - hole for “ techno - Bedouins ” such as himself , he says .
Since Bedouins , whether in Arabian deserts or American suburbs , are inherently tribal and social creatures , he understood from the outset that a good oasis has to do more than provide Wi-Fi ; it must also become a new — or very old — kind of gathering place .
He thought of calling his café the “ Gypsy Spirit Mission ” , which also captures the theme of mobility , but settled for the simpler Nomad .
As a word , vision and goal , modern urban nomadism has had the mixed blessing of a premature debut .
In the 1960s and 70s Herbert Marshall McLuhan , the most influential media and communications theorist ever , pictured nomads zipping around at great speed , using facilities on the road and all but dispensing with their homes .
In the 1980s Jacques Attali , a French economist who was advising president François Mitterrand at the time , used the term to predict an age when rich and uprooted elites would jet around the world in search of fun and opportunity , and poor but equally uprooted workers would migrate in search of a living .
In the 1990s Tsugio Makimoto and David Manners jointly wrote the first book with “ digital nomad ” in the title , adding the bewildering possibilities of the latest gadgets to the vision .
But all of those early depictions and predictions of nomadism arguably missed the point .
The mobile lifestyles currently taking shape around the world are nothing like those described in the old books .
For this the authors cannot be blamed , since the underlying technologies of genuine and everyday nomadism did not exist even as recently as a decade ago .
Mobile phones were already widespread , but they were used almost exclusively for voice calls and were fiendishly hard to connect to the internet and even to computers .
Laptop computers and personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) needed fiddly cables to get online , and even then did so at a snail 's pace .
Reading and sending e-mail on a mobile phone — not to mention synchronising it across several gadgets and computers to create one “ virtual ” in - box — was unheard of .
People took photos using film .
There was no Wi -Fi .
In short , there were gadgets , but precious little “ connectivity ” .
Astronauts and hermit crabs
Without that missing piece , several misunderstandings took hold that now require correcting .
One had to do with all those gadgets .
The old mental picture of a nomad invariably had him — mostly him , at that time — lugging lots of them .
Since these machines , large and small , were portable , people assumed that they also made their owners mobile .
Not so .
The proper metaphor for somebody who carries portable but unwieldy and cumbersome infrastructure is that of an astronaut rather than a nomad , says Paul Saffo , a trend - watcher in Silicon Valley .
Astronauts must bring what they need , including oxygen , because they cannot rely on their environment to provide it .
They are both defined and limited by their gear and supplies .
Around the turn of the century , as some astronauts , typically executive road warriors , got smarter about packing light , says Mr Saffo , they graduated to an intermediate stage , becoming hermit crabs .
These are crustaceans that survive by dragging around a cast - off mollusc shell for protection and shelter .
In the metaphorical sense , the shell might be a “ carry - on ” bag on wheels , stuffed full of cables , discs , dongles , batteries , plugs and paper documents ( just in case of disc failure ) .
These hermit crabs strike fear into the hearts of seated airline passengers whenever they board , because their shells invariably bang into innocent shins all the way to their seat .
They carry less than astronauts — and are thus more mobile — but are still quite heavily laden with gear , mostly as a safeguard against disasters .
Urban nomads have started appearing only in the past few years .
Like their antecedents in the desert , they are defined not by what they carry but by what they leave behind , knowing that the environment will provide it .
Thus , Bedouins do not carry their own water , because they know where the oases are .
Modern nomads carry almost no paper because they access their documents on their laptop computers , mobile phones or online .
Increasingly , they do n't even bring laptops .
Many engineers at Google , the leading internet company and a magnet for nomads , travel with only a BlackBerry , iPhone or other “ smart phone ” .
If ever the need arises for a large keyboard and some earnest typing , they sit down in front of the nearest available computer anywhere in the world , open its web browser and access all their documents online .
Another big misunderstanding of previous decades was to confuse nomadism with migration or travel .
As the costs of ( stationary ) telecommunications plummeted , it became fascinating to contemplate “ the death of distance ” ( the title of a book written by Frances Cairncross , then on the staff of The Economist ) .
And since the early mobile phones were aimed largely at business executives , it was assumed that nomadism was about corporate travel in particular .
And indeed many nomads are frequent flyers , for example , which is why airlines such as JetBlue , American Airlines and Continental Airlines are now introducing in - flight Wi -Fi .
But although nomadism and travel can coincide , they need not .
Humans have always migrated and travelled , without necessarily living nomadic lives .
The nomadism now emerging is different from , and involves much more than , merely making journeys .
A modern nomad is as likely to be a teenager in Oslo , Tokyo or suburban America as a jet - setting chief executive .
He or she may never have left his or her city , stepped into an aeroplane or changed address .
Indeed , how far he moves is completely irrelevant .
Even if an urban nomad confines himself to a small perimeter , he nonetheless has a new and surprisingly different relationship to time , to place and to other people .
“ Permanent connectivity , not motion , is the critical thing , ” says Manuel Castells , a sociologist at the Annenberg School for Communication , a part of the University of Southern California , Los Angeles .
This is why a new breed of observers is now joining the ever - present futurists and gadget geeks in studying the consequences of this technology .
Sociologists in particular are trying to figure out how mobile communications are changing interactions between people .
Nomadism , most believe , tends to bring people who are already close , such as family members , even closer .
But it may do so at the expense of their attentiveness towards strangers encountered physically ( rather than virtually ) in daily life .
That has implications for society at large .
Anthropologists and psychologists are investigating how mobile and virtual interaction spices up or challenges physical and offline chemistry , and whether it makes young people in particular more autonomous or more dependent .
Architects , property developers and urban planners are changing their thinking about buildings and cities to accommodate the new habits of the nomads that dwell in them .
Activists are trying to piggyback on the ubiquity of nomadic tools to improve the world , even as they worry about the same tools in the hands of the malicious .
Linguists are chronicling how nomadic communication changes language itself , and thus thought .
Beyond technology
This special report , in presupposing that a wireless world will soon be upon us , will explore these ramifications of mobile technology , rather than the technologies themselves or their business models .
But it is worth making clear that technology underlies all of the changes in today 's nomadic societies , so that its march will accelerate them .
Wireless data connections , in particular , seem to be getting better all the time .
Cellular networks will become faster and more reliable .
Short - range Wi-Fi hotspots are popping up in ever more places .
And a new generation of wireless technologies is already poised to take over .
Regulators have grasped that the airwaves are now among society 's most important assets .
America , for instance , has just auctioned off a chunk of spectrum with new rules that require the owner to allow any kind of device and software to run on the resulting network .
Devices , too , are on a steep trajectory .
Just as Sony's Walkman once planted the notion that music can be mobile , the BlackBerry by Research In Motion ( RIM ) , a Canadian firm , has since 1999 made e-mail on the go seem normal .
And just as the personal - computer era entered the mainstream only in the 1980s with Apple 's commercialisation of the “ graphical user interface ” , the mobile era arguably began only last summer when the same firm launched the iPhone , with its radically new and user - friendly touch interface .
As a result , Google , for instance , has received 50 times more web - search requests from iPhones this year than from any other mobile handset .
Cumulatively , all of these changes amount to a historic merger , at long last , of two technologies that have already proved revolutionary in their own right .
The mobile phone has changed the world by becoming ubiquitous in rich and poor countries alike .
The internet has mostly touched rich countries , and rich people in poor countries , but has already changed the way people shop , bank , listen to music , read news and socialise .
Now the mobile phone is on course to replace the PC as the primary device for getting online .
According to the International Telecommunication Union , 3.3 billion people , more than half the world 's population , now subscribe to a mobile - phone service ( see chart 1 ) , so the internet at last looks set to change the whole world .
To people in early - adopter countries such as South Korea and Japan this will come as no surprise .
( Five of the ten bestselling novels in Japan last year were written on mobile phones . )
Nor will it come as a shock to people in their teens and twenties elsewhere who have never known life without text messages ; or to itinerant salesmen and executives who have for years been glued to their BlackBerries day and night .
By contrast , many older people will strain to recognise themselves in the behaviour patterns described in this report , and indeed may never adopt them .
But the lesson of history is that what the geeks and early adopters do today , the rest of us will probably end up doing tomorrow or the day after .
It is the pioneers that set the direction ; the mainstream will follow in time .
The most wonderful thing about mobile technology today is that consumers can increasingly forget about how it works and simply take advantage of it .
As Ms Canlas sips her Americano and dives into her e-mail in - box at the Nomad Café , she gives no thought to the specifications and standards that make her connection possible .
It is the human connections that now take over .
Since humans , as Sigmund Freud put it , must arbeiten und lieben , work and love , in order to find fulfilment , this report will start off by examining how they will work .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
The occasion is celebrated all over the world You may be celebrating St Patrick 's Day today as normal , but , at least according to Catholics and Anglicans , you 're making a slight mistake .
Why is that ?
St Patrick 's Day is on 17 March every year .
It 's an opportunity for Christians around the world to recognise the life of the patron saint of Ireland .
But the feast day is also characterised by parades and boisterous revelry .
Traditionally a major event in Ireland , the festival has spread around the world with the movement of Irish immigrants and is now even celebrated in locations like Moscow and Tokyo , which have no significant Irish populations .
This year the extremely early arrival of Easter has forced changes to St Patrick 's Day .
THE ANSWER
Easter week is early this year and takes precedence over St Patrick 's Day in the religious calendar The Catholic Church in England and Wales says St Patrick 's Day is simply not on the calendar of feast days this year .
This week is known as Holy Week in the church and takes precedence over all saint 's days .
Any saint 's feast day that clashes with it is omitted from the calendar .
But the position is different in the Republic of Ireland , where St Patrick 's Day was observed on Saturday 15 March , instead of Monday 17 March .
Holy Week Rev Martin Long , a spokesman for the Irish Bishops , said it was a " very , very unusual " step but due to the early Easter , the Church was celebrating the feast on Saturday , two days early .
" The reason the solemnity of St Patrick was moved from 17th to the 15th is because it happens to fall this year in Holy Week , " he says .
" And the liturgy of Holy Week ranks above all others so St Patrick had to be moved to another date .
The Catholic Church of Ireland purposefully decided to celebrate it on the 15th so it was as close as possible to the civic celebration , which is on the 17th . "
For the Church of England , St Patrick 's day is celebrated as a " lesser festival " and where that falls between Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday it is normally omitted .
But the church 's rules allow individual ministers to stage a celebration on the next available day , where " there is sufficient reason " .
Many revellers also celebrated on Saturday instead of Monday
The crux of the problem is the way the date of Easter is calculated , something that has been controversial since the birth of Christianity .
In Western churches like those of the British Isles , Easter is taken to be the first Sunday after the full moon that follows the ( northern hemisphere ) spring equinox .
But this is based on a centuries - old method of predicting the full moon ( or equinox ) .
It does not absolutely correspond with the lunar cycle .
In reality , the equinox can fall before 21 March , but in the religious calendar it is fixed as 21 March .
The absolute earliest date for Easter is thus 22 March .
Prof Andrew Louth , a historical theologian at Durham University and a Russian Orthodox Church priest , explains the date of Easter is linked to Passover , with the name for Easter , Pascha , marking this in much of the rest of the world .
In Jewish ritual , the actual observation of the moon would start the festival , but the complicated rituals of the Christian church required more notice and therefore required a calendar that could predict Easter far in advance , he says .
" The answer to why there has been so much dispute is that working things out calendrically is an imperfect art .
It is enormously significant if ritual is a very important part of your religion . "
With the Eastern churches applying a different calculation to Easter , there can be vast differences in timing such as this year when it falls on 27 April .
The fixing of a date for Easter is still a massive topic of debate in the global ecumenical movement , but no conclusion has yet been reached .
With many countries having public holidays tied to the religious festival , the wide range of movement in the date can cause problems .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
There was an act passed in Parliament in 1928 to fix " Easter Day " as the first Sunday after the second Saturday in April .
But this , despite occasional brief moments of debate , has never come into force .
In 2005 , speaking for the government , Lord Sainsbury of Turville said : " We have no plans to amend the Easter Act 1928 .
It remains on the statute book but the act requires that before a draft order is laid before Parliament ' regard shall be had to any opinion officially expressed by any church or other Christian body ' .
" At this time , the churches have not expressed a desire or willingness to move to a fixed Easter . "
Here is a selection of your comments .
The article is rather misleading in that it implies that east and west have always been divided when in fact it was the new calculation of Easter introduced by Rome with the Gregorian calendar reform which divided our once common date - east and west agreed from the 4th Century up until that point .
Of course , for us Orthodox it still is St Patrick 's day today , but then I do n't believe that we drop saints from the calendar if they fall during Holy Week in any case .
James ,
Aylesbury , UK Bring the Easter act into force , yes give regard to " the church or any other Christian body " , but also give regard to the atheist majority who do n't care about the reasoning , but do like their Easter eggs and school holidays at predictable times .
Let 's be honest : there 's no place or right for the church as a minority to have such a strong influence .
Mark , Buckingham , England
The working out of Easter goes back to the meeting of the churches bishops with Constantine at Nicaea in about 325AD .
Things had been getting a bit mad with each kingdom celebrating Easter on different days and this needed to change .
I have the page long calculation needed .
I cheated and put it all into a spreadsheet so it is automatic .
Chris Whitehead , Reading
So , it seems that Ramadan is not the only religious festival that is surrounded by slight confusion , nay anticipation .
I feel that religious festivals should be tied to nature rather than following a fixed calender .
Makes for an exciting build - up too , no ?

Thousands are said to have fled the areas under attack
Massoud Barzani said he " vehemently condemned " the bombardments , which he said had killed innocent people .
His remarks came as US President George W Bush and Turkey 's PM Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed the unrest by phone .
Turkish jets have carried out three strikes on Kurdish targets and one ground foray over the past eight days .
Turkey blames rebels from the Kurdistan Workers ' Party ( PKK ) for launching attacks on Turkey from bases in Iraq .
Ankara approved cross - border raids on PKK bases in October , saying the Iraqi government and its US backers were not doing enough to halt attacks .
Formal complaint
" The bombing targeted safe and secure areas and innocent people , " Mr Barzani told a news conference in the northern city of Suleimaniya .
MOUNTING BORDER TENSION 7
Oct PKK rebels kill 13 Turkish troops near Iraqi border 17 Oct - Turkish MPs allow military operations in Iraq 21 Oct - 12 Turkish troops die in PKK ambush near Iraqi border 30 Nov - Turkish cabinet backs PKK pursuits in Iraq 13 Nov - Turkey shells PKK targets in Iraq , Baghdad says 1 Dec - Turkish army targets rebels in Iraq , inflicting " heavy losses " 16 Dec - Turkish jets bomb PKK targets in Iraq for the first time 18 Dec - Some 300 Turkish troops cross over into northern Iraq 22 Dec - Turkish jets bomb PKK targets in Iraq a second time 23 Dec - Turkish planes strike for a third time
" Several people were either killed or wounded .
We held consultations with [ Iraqi ] President Jalal Talabani and we will continue our consultations with other concerned parties to put an end to these aggressions and put an end to the shelling of villages . "
Mr Talabani - also a Kurd - was standing beside Mr Barzani as he delivered the condemnation .
He said his government had lodged a formal complaint with Turkey - but that he did not want to worsen tensions over the issue .
Turkey 's ambassador to Iraq has been summoned to the foreign ministry to hear a formal complaint , reports the BBC's Humphrey Hawkesley in Baghdad .
Up to 10 people are reported to have been killed in the strikes - it is not known whether they are rebels or civilians .
As many as 2,000 people have fled the areas under attack .
US support
In a telephone conversation with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday , US President George W Bush reiterated his backing for Turkey 's operations against PKK rebels , said a White House spokesman .
They discussed " the importance of the United States , Turkey and Iraq working together to confront the PKK " , said national security spokesman Gordon Johndroe .
Last month at a meeting in the White House , Mr Bush told Mr Erdogan the US would share its intelligence to help Turkey fight the rebels based in northern Iraq .
A co-ordination centre has now been set up in the Turkish capital , Ankara .
Washington has previously urged the Turks to show restraint in their policies , fearing large - scale incursions across the border could destabilise the entire region .
The PKK - which is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey , the US , and the EU - is thought to have about 3,000 rebels based in Iraq .
For decades , it has been fighting for a Kurdish homeland separate from Turkey .
It ’s the end of an era for the friends of General Services Administration chief Lurita Alexis Doan , who resigned from her post Tuesday following years of allegations of corruption and other inappropriate uses of power .
Doan ’s reign over the government ’s chief contracting agency was riddled with contract handouts and examples of using her appointed position for political ( read Republican ) purposes .
The Washington Post :
At the request of the White House , General Services Administration chief Lurita Alexis Doan resigned last night as head of the government ’s premier contracting agency , ending a tumultuous tenure in which she was accused of trying to award work to a friend and misusing her authority for political ends .
“ It has been a great privilege to serve our nation and a great President , ” Doan said in a statement released this morning by the agency .
Doan ’s resignation came almost a year after Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Calif. ) , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said he believed Doan could no longer be effective because of the allegations about her leadership .

WASHINGTON 
After six years of stumbling against the euro , the dollar may be showing signs of getting back on its feet .
Two weeks ago , the dollar hit a new low of $ 1.60 for the euro amid expectations of lower interest rates in the United States and possibly higher rates in Europe .
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and other European leaders expressed alarm over the dollar ’s decline and its devastating effect on Europe ’s exports .
Since then , the dollar has strengthened  it closed at $ 1.55 Tuesday  and some economists say that even if it creeps down slightly , the dangers of a precipitous fall , at least against the euro , have subsided .
Economists point out that American policy makers , particularly Ben S. Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , have begun to voice concern about the dollar ’s fall and its inflationary effect in the United States , where a weak currency has increased the cost of oil and other imports for the American consumer .
( CNN ) -- A U.S. soldier who deserted to Canada will not face persecution if he returns to the United States , Canada 's refugee agency ruled Wednesday .
National Guard Sgt. Corey Glass , 25 , says he fled to Toronto in 2006 after serving in Iraq because he did not want to fight in a war he did not support .
" What I saw in Iraq convinced me that the war is illegal and immoral .
I could not in good conscience continue to take part in it , " Glass said Wednesday .
" I do n't think it 's fair that I should be punished for doing what I felt morally obligated to do . "
Glass , who 's still on active duty and is considered absent without leave , applied for refugee status at the Canadian border in August 2006 on the grounds of objection to military service .
But Canada 's Immigration and Refugee Board denied his application for refugee status Wednesday , prompting the Canadian Border Services Agency to issue a June 12 deportation order .
The agency says it evaluates each case on its own merits to determine whether the applicant faces a " well - founded fear " of persecution or cruel and unusual punishment if he returns to his home country .
" All refugee claimants have a right to due process , " said Danielle Norris , a spokeswoman for Customs and Immigrations Canada .
" When they have exhausted all legal avenues , we expect them to respect our laws and leave the country . "
Glass , of Fairmont , Indiana , says he joined the National Guard believing that he would be deployed only if the United States faced occupation .
After he returned from his first tour of duty , he said , he tried to leave the Army but was told that desertion was punishable by death .
Penalties for desertion range from a demotion in rank to a maximum penalty of death , depending on the circumstances , said Maj .
Nathan Banks , an Army spokesman .
" The first thing we try to do is rehabilitate and retrain the soldier to see if we can keep him , " he said .
" Remember , we 're at war , so everybody counts .
When you decide to desert , you let everybody down . "
Banks said that it is up to the deserter 's commanding officer to decide on an appropriate punishment if the soldier refuses to return .
Members of War Resisters Support Campaign in Canada , which is providing transitional support to Glass and at least 13 other deserters in Canada , are holding out for a political avenue of appeal through the Canadian House of Commons .
In December , the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration adopted a motion calling on the Canadian government to initiate a residency program for conscientious objectors who have left military service " related to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations . "
The motion has yet to receive approval from the entire House of Commons .
Norris says the agency has received about 40 applications for refugee claims from U.S. deserters since the Iraq war began in 2003 .
Of the claims that have been addressed in public , only five have made it to the country 's Federal Court of Appeals , a venue of last resort .
All five appeals were rejected , according to Norris .
The high court has yet to rule on its sixth challenge of this kind from Army combat engineer Joshua Key , who fled to Saskatchewan with his wife and four children in 2005 .
" This has been our home for three years now .
It 's a lot like the U.S. , and it's as close to the U.S. as you can be , " said Key , who served on the front lines in Falluja before he returned to the United States in 2002 .
Key said that fleeing to Canada was a difficult but obvious choice when faced with returning to Iraq .
" There was nothing but violence and innocent civilians dying in our hands for no justification , " Key said .
" We became the terrorists . "

OTTAWA — The Canadian government is said to be ready to declare as toxic a chemical widely used in plastics for baby bottles , beverage and food containers as well as linings in food cans .
A person with knowledge of the government ’s chemical review program spoke on the condition he not be named because of a confidentiality agreement .
He said the staff work to list the compound , called bisphenol - a , or B.P.A. , as a toxic chemical was complete and was recently endorsed by a panel of outside scientists .
A public announcement by Health Canada may come as early as Wednesday but could be delayed until the end of May .
Canada would be the first country to make a health finding against B.P.A. , which has been shown to disrupt the hormonal systems of animals .
The department ’s decision was first reported in The Globe and Mail , a Toronto newspaper , on Tuesday .
Also on Tuesday , a draft report from the United States Department of Health and Human Services ’ National Toxicology Program endorsed a scientific panel ’s finding that there was “ some concern ” about neural and behavioral changes in humans who consume B.P.A .
" The man who located the wreck of the Titanic has revealed that the
discovery was a cover story to camouflage the real mission of inspecting the wrecks of two Cold War nuclear submarines , " the Times of London and others report .
“ I could n’t tell anybody , ” he said .
“ There was a lot of pressure on me .
It was a secret mission .
I felt it was a fair exchange for getting a chance to look for the Titanic ...*
Dr. Robert Ballard , an oceanographer , has admitted that he located and inspected the wrecks for the US Navy [ in 1985 ] in top secret missions before he was allowed to search for the Titanic ...
He was told that the military were not willing to spend a fortune on locating the liner , but they did want to know what had happened to their submarines .
The military were anxious to know how the nuclear reactors had been affected by being submerged for so long .
*
During the 1980s , the nuclear submarine fleet was reduced after the Salt II
( strategic arms limitation talks ) agreement and one option was to sink unwanted reactors at sea ...*
The oceanographer was given the funding to embark on two expeditions , one to find the wreck of Thresher in 1984 off the eastern coast of the US
and another to find * Scorpion * in the eastern Atlantic .
*
Thresher* , the US Navy ’s most advanced attack submarine at the time , sank with all her 129 crew in April 1963 while undergoing seaworthiness tests after dockyard repairs ...*
Scorpion * disappeared with 99 crew in 1968 , and there had been speculation that it was sunk by Soviet forces .
Dr Ballard ’s visual examination of the wreck site showed that the most likely cause of its destruction was being hit by a rogue torpedo that it had fired itself .

Update : McCain rejects Hagee 's endorsement David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Print This Email This One McCain endorser says Hitler was doing " God 's work " while another gains reputation for wanting to destroy Islam Presidential candidate John McCain has been embarrassed in the past few weeks by the statements of right - wing Pastor John Hagee , whose endorsement he actively sought and still said he was glad to have .
But on Thursday he finally rejected the pastor 's endorsement , CNN reports .
Hagee has called the Catholic Church " the great whore " and has said that Hurricane Katrina was sent by God to punish New Orleans for an intended gay pride parade .
Now newly revealed audio tapes of sermons from the 1990's show Hagee claiming that Hitler was doing " God 's work " by forcing the Jews to return to Israel .
Hagee has denied that his remarks constitute approval of Hitler any any way and claims he is being mischaracterized .
" I obviously find the remarks and others deeply offensive and indefensible and a repudiate them , " McCain said in a statement released late Thursday afternoon .
Referring to the Hitler comments , McCain denied foreknowledge of them , but also used his statement to differentiate his " pastor problem " from Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
Barack Obama's .
McCain 's statement continues , " I did not know of them before Reverend Hagee 's endorsement .
I feel I must reject his endorsement as well .
I 've said I do not believe Senator Obama shares Reverend Wright 's extreme views but let me also be clear Reverend Hagee was not and is not my pastor or spiritual advisor and I do not attend his church .
I did not attend his church for 20 years .
I have denounced statement he made immediately upon learning of them and I do again today . "
Abrams : McCain should say enough is enough MSNBC's Dan Abrams was outraged by the reluctance of the media to call out McCain on his ties to Hagee .
" Should n't John McCain finally say enough is enough ? "
Abrams asked .
" Why is n't much of the mainstream media playing John Hagee 's clips even a fraction of the amount that they played Jeremiah Wright 's clips ? "
Former Bush Assistant Press Secretary Reed Dickens acknowledged to Abrams that " this is going to haunt [ McCain ] " and that " of course he 's got to denounce [ Hagee ] . "
However , Dickens rejected any suggestion that the media is giving McCain a free pass when compared with Obama , noting that Hagee is not McCain 's friend or mentor and calling it a " very flawed premise ... that something Hagee says is on equal footing ... with Jeremiah Wright . "
Former Romney Press Secretary Kevin Madden was also quick to describe Hagee as " somebody who John McCain hardly even knows . "
However , Roy Sekoff of the Huffington Post was in full agreement with Abrams .
" It is a complete double standard , " he insisted .
" For some reason , the media remains in rapture to John McCain , the ' maverick straight - talker ' of 2000 .
But that 's not what we 're seeing .
...
He worked for a year to get this endorsement . "
Dickens also repeatedly attempted to paint McCain as having innocently stumbled because of his unfamiliarity with evangelicals .
" McCain does n't understand the evangelical world enough to know which evangelicals to go after , " he stated .
" The real story here is how awkward and uncomfortable McCain is within this sector of the party .
...
There 's a lot of evangelicals that he needed to go get their endorsement .
...
This was not the guy . "
Sekoff , however , suggested that McCain knew very well what he was doing , and that he deliberately " went searching for Hagee so he could prove his bona fides to the right . "
Hagee is not McCain 's only embarrassing endorser .
Pastor Rod Parsley , whom McCain has called " one of the truly great leaders in America , a moral compass , a spiritual guide , " is becoming widely known in the Muslim world as a hatemonger , Parsley has stated , " Islam is an anti-christ religion that intends through violence to conquer the world .
...
America was founded in part with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed . "
Newspapers and websites in the Muslim world are now running stories with headlines like " McCain 's spiritual advisor calls for the destruction of Islam . "
This is undercutting McCain 's own stated goal " to win the hearts and minds of the vast majority of moderate Muslims . "
A McCain spokesman told ABC that McCain rejects Parsley 's statements .

TULSA , Okla .  School is out , and Aaron Stallings , his junior year of high school behind him , wanders the air - conditioned cocoon of the Woodland Hills Mall in search of a job .
Mr. Stallings , 18 , says he has been looking for three months , burning gasoline to get to the mall , then filling out applications at stores selling skateboard T - shirts , beach sandals and baseball caps .
He likes the idea of working amid the goods he covets .
But so far , no offers .
“ I ’m going to go to Iraq and get a job , ” he says acidly .
“ I hear they ’ve got cheap gas . ”
He grins .
“ I ’m just playing .
But I ’ve been all over , and nobody ’s hiring .
They just say , ‘ We ’ll call you tomorrow . ’
And no one ever calls back . ”
As the forces of economic downturn ripple widely across the United States , the job market of 2008 is shaping up as the weakest in more than half a century for teenagers looking for summer work , according to labor economists , government data and companies that hire young people .
Last month I took a photo of an honor payment system at a bookstore in Ojai , California .
On a related note , here 's an article about the City Café Bakery in Kitchener , Ontario , which uses an honor payment system and almost never gets cheated .
( Photo from MyWorldReviews.com ) City Café does n't have Interac or accept credit cards .
Neither will you see a cash register in the bakery .
Instead , customers add up how much they owe themselves and drop their money into a fare box from an old bus .
" I liked the idea of simplifying things and … the honour system made a whole lot of sense , " [ owner John ] Bergen says .
" What irritated me about going into Tim Hortons , for example , was waiting in line for something as simple as getting a donut and a coffee .
So the thought was , someone can pour his own coffee , grab his own bagel , cut it himself , throw the money in , and walk out .
We do n't touch 60 per cent of the transaction . "
Because it is up to the customers to total their purchases , Bergen has simplified the cost structure .
" Everything is rounded off to the nearest quarter with taxes included where applicable , " he says .
" So every desert is $ 1.50 ( tarts , brownies , and date squares ) , every pizza lunch is $ 5 , every beverage is $ 1.25 , every loaf of bread is $ 2.75 ( Italian sourdough , multi- grain , and raisin bread on weekends ) , croissants are $ 1 each , and bagels are three for $ 2 ( plain , sesame , and multi- grain ) . "
The bakery conducts audits every six months and Bergen says only once did things come up short .
" Our theory is that two per cent of our sales are being ripped off .
' Ripped off ' in the sense that there are people who forget to pay or they make a mistake in paying , and then there are people who deliberately do n't pay .
And every so often we have to kick somebody out that we know has n't been paying , " he says .
" But at the same time we figure we 're being overpaid by three per cent .
Some people come in and want a $ 2.75 loaf of bread , but they see we 're busy so they throw $ 3 in and walk out .
Or , although we discourage tips , some people still give them to us .
But because the staff is paid well ( the average wage is $ 15.50 an hour ) , the tips go into the general pot . "

Cheney caught napping at emergency cabinet meeting

Vice President Dick Cheney was caught dozing off on live television during an emergency cabinet meeting called on Wednesday to coordinate federal efforts to deal with the devastating California wildfires .
" I believe the effort is well - coordinated , " President Bush told reporters after the meeting , emphasizing that his administration is working to avoid the mistakes made with Hurricane Katrina .
Cheney was previously spotted napping in April 2006 , during a press briefing by President Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao .
Although he insisted he had merely been looking down at some notes , photographs clearly showed him asleep , and there was speculation that he might be preparing to step down for medical reasons .
Cheney was seen sleeping again during a meeting on Iraq in May 2006 .
As one local Washington station suggested , " Perhaps even the vice president needs a power nap once in awhile . "

Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails have been taking turns giving the music industry the finger .
The British band made headlines last October for releasing In Rainbows without the support ( read : control ) of a record label , and Trent Reznor 's group followed suit with last month 's Ghosts I - IV .
The two bands have also been busy one - upping each other with their innovative promotion strategies .
We were tempted to let the groups coexist peacefully at the forward edge of digital distribution until Nine Inch Nails ' Trent Reznor accused Radiohead of betraying fans by selling them low - quality files .
In light of Reznor 's accusations , we put together a 10 - round , voting - enabled smackdown to find out which band is really blazing the trail of innovation .

The young men who rule Drew Street have survived countless convictions , injunctions , evictions and deportations .
Over the years , they have called themselves the Cypress Assassins , the Pee Wee Gangsters , the Brown Crowd Youngsters .
They are as much clan as gang , deeply interconnected by family , with decades in their Glassell Park neighborhood .
Police have tried to crush them for years , but for all the law enforcement rained upon the shabby two blocks of wrought - iron fences and stucco apartments , homeboys still command the street , as evidenced by the wild shootout Thursday in Northeast Los Angeles .
The gun battle , which followed a drive - by attack near an elementary school , prompted police to shut down dozens of blocks , stranded thousands of residents and left two people dead .
The Drew Street crew is just one clique of the notorious Avenues gang that has tenaciously retained control over a wide swath of Northeast L.A. , defying both the forces of gentrification and heavy crackdowns by police and federal agents .

The gang , deriving its name from the avenues that cross Figueroa Street , took root in the 1950s and has wreaked havoc ever since .
The insignia tattooed on many members ’ bodies speaks to their virulent history : a skull with a bullet hole , wearing a fedora .
The city attorney hit the Avenues with a gang injunction in 2002 , making it illegal for known members to congregate or ride in cars together throughout much of Highland Park , Glassell Park , Cypress Park and Eagle Rock .
And in 2006 , the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles won hate - crime convictions against five members for a murderous campaign to force African Americans out of their turf .
But even though the Avenues ’ presence in many neighborhoods has diminished in recent years -- currently , there are about 400 members -- it remains one of the most powerful gangs in the city .
And it retains strong ties to the Mexican Mafia , known as the Eme -- a dominant force in California prisons .

“ They are fully entrenched in the northeast community , ” said U.S. Atty .
Thomas P. O’Brien , who led the hate - crime case and prosecuted members of the gang earlier in his career , as a deputy district attorney .
“ This is one of those older street gangs that are generational .
You have youngsters who are 10 or 11 years old jumped in to the same gang claimed by their grandfathers . ”
The Drew Street clique is run by five interrelated families , police say .
The layout of the small neighborhood -- cut off by San Fernando Road , backed up against Forest Lawn Memorial Park -- serves as a perfect redoubt .
The area has long been a source of income for the Mexican Mafia , as Avenues members have taxed local drug dealers and paid a cut to the prison gang , according to Tony Raphael , author of “ The Mexican Mafia . ”
A prominent member of the Eme , Javier “ Gangster ” Marquez , grew up on Drew Street , and drugs from Mexico would land there before being distributed .
Raphael said a recent uptick in violence stems from a renewed push by the Avenues to collect taxes from smaller gangs in Cypress Park and Glassell Park .
Police said the Thursday shootout began when gang members opened fire on 36 - year - old Marcos Salas near Aragon Elementary School as he held the hand of his 2 - year - old granddaughter .
The girl was whisked away , but Salas later died .
As the gunmen drove off , several people who apparently knew the victim started firing at them .

Minutes later , police converged on Drew Street , 10 blocks away .
They pulled over a white Nissan sedan , and three men jumped out and opened fire , police said .
The officers fired back , wounding one man and hitting another , who was wielding an AK - 47 .
Daniel Leon , 22 -- a heavy in the Drew Street crew -- died on the asphalt he and his brothers ruled .
The wounded man , Jose Angel Gomez , was taken to a hospital and is being held on suspicion of killing Salas .
Another gunman , Guillermo Ocampo , was later caught by police and booked for investigation of murder .
Police identified all three as members of the Avenues .
Leon was one of 13 children of Maria Leon , who lived at 3304 Drew St. until the city shut down the home last year with a narcotics abatement lawsuit .
City Atty .
Rocky Delgadillo called the home the gang ’s “ mother ship . ”
More than 40 arrests were made there in 2006 , and the city attorney was attempting to ban Daniel Leon from the neighborhood before he was killed .
His family is one of the five that control drug sales in the area , LAPD Deputy Chief Sergio Diaz and other sources said .

“ This clique is bound by close family ties , ” said Diaz .
“ It goes back generations . ”
Like hundreds of residents in the neighborhood , the Leons originally hailed from the village of Tlalchapa , in Guerrero , Mexico , neighbors said .
That shared history breeds loyalty .
Several residents interviewed Friday said they supported the Avenues .
“ I ’ve been here 25 years and they ’ve never disrespected me , ” said Modesta Hernandez .
“ On the contrary , they protect us .
They help us . ”
They depicted the police as hostile and corrupt , and several said the shooting of Daniel Leon was unprovoked , although one neighbor said he clearly saw Leon raise the assault weapon at the officers .

Leon had a history of violence .
He was arrested for killing a drug buyer at the house in 2004 and was ultimately convicted of being an accessory to murder .
In 2005 , he was arrested in a case in which prosecutors alleged “ he brutally beat and robbed a 43 - year - old man . . . as his wife looked on . ”
The wife would not speak to prosecutors out of fear of retaliation .
This fear is the continuing obstacle in authorities ’ attempts to break the gang ’s grip .
Witnesses do n’t believe police will protect them .
And gang members who flip on their brethren are instantly “ green - lighted ” -- marked for execution .
David “ Mousie ” Cruz testified in 2001 against an Avenues member who was accused of taking part in the killings of two black men .
Cruz was then deported to El Salvador , where he was stabbed 22 times in retaliation , but he survived .
FBI Special Agent Jerry Fradella recalled trying to pressure the least culpable defendant in the hate - crime case to testify against his codefendants in exchange for leniency .
Fernando “ Sneaky ” Cazares was known to have been inside a van listening to a police scanner while other defendants carried out a killing outside .
But he would n’t betray them .

“ He was loyal to the end , ” Fradella said .
“ And he got triple life just like the other guys . ”
Compounding the problem , potential informants often cannot envision a life after snitching -- no longer safe in their neighborhoods , which are often all they know of the world .
And in prison , they would have to be held in protective custody .
“ They ’re just so unfamiliar with whatever else is out there , they want to stick to what they know , ” Fradella said .
The silence is unbearable for the victims ’ families .
Luisa Prudhomme ’s son
Anthony was shot twice in the head as he lay in bed in his apartment in Highland Park on Nov. 3 , 2000 .
He had no gang affiliation and worked at a Pier 1 .
Advertisement
His slaying was part of the hate - crime case that led to the conviction of the five men .
But the actual shooter is still at large .
Police believe they know his identity , but no one will talk .
“ I want the person who murdered my son to be brought to justice , ” Prudhomme said .
“ The guy who pulled the trigger .
He used a pillow , but he must have gotten some of my son ’s blood on him .
He knows what he did .
God knows what he did . ”

NEARLY a third of Hong Kong 's households watch television via the internet , according to a new report from Telecommunications Management group , a consultancy .
Because internet protocol television ( IPTV ) uses the same technology as that which links computer networks , smaller countries with high broadband penetration tend to have more subscribers .
As well as plain old programmes , viewers can also enjoy other services such as on - demand video .
So far , Europe accounts for over half of the world 's subscribers .

Angela Wright has a vivid recollection of her teenage daughter , Gemma , returning home one night and telling her she was " dating a Trowbridge . "
His name was Glyn , he was 19 , and his father Nigel had been at school with Mrs Wright .
" I remember thinking : ' Oh no , I do n't think so , ' Angela recalls .
" I 'd known the Trowbridges a long time and they were n't the most trustworthy family .
I did n't want my daughter to get involved . "
Scroll down for more ...
Lisa Wright was a bright student who planned to study psychology at university
Little did she know that Gemma 's relationship would be the least of her troubles : three years after that uneasy mother - daughter chat , the Trowbridge name has caused far , far more angst .
Angela Wright admits allowing her daughter to have sex when she was just 14
Last month , Angela 's youngest daughter , 16 - year - old Lisa , ran away from home to be with Glyn 's father , Nigel , who , at 46 , is precisely 30 years her senior .
Lisa was due to sit her GCSEs this week and was expected to achieve a succession of As and A*s .
Nigel Trowbridge is an unemployed father of five - including a daughter who is a year younger
than Lisa - and would not strike you as a particularly ideal catch for anyone , let alone a girl who is meant to be taking her GCSEs .
To say Angela is horrified is an understatement .
This , after all , is a man she had welcomed into her home as an extended member of the family .
Despite Angela 's reservations , her daughter Gemma had indeed settled down with Glyn Trowbridge , and three months ago their first child was born .
After the arrival , Angela and Nigel Trowbridge enjoyed a mutual toast as the baby 's grandparents .
" Now I look back on that and feel sick to my stomach , because I 'm convinced that Nigel was already wooing Lisa , " says Angela .
It is an unholy mess , no doubt about it .
To date , Lisa has been missing from home for more than three weeks , and you only need to glance at the
photos of a smiling young girl in school uniform dotted around the comfortable living room of the family home in Dagenham , East London , to realise quite how young she is .

Nigel Trowbridge , who is 30 years older than Lisa , wooed her with love tokens and gifts
" I feel completely helpless , because there 's nothing I can do , " Angela says .
" As a mother , you feel you should protect your children , but I can't do that - it makes me feel so useless .
I just do n't want Lisa to throw her life away .
" I am disgusted and furious with Nigel , of course I am - he has betrayed everyone in the worse possible way .
But I can't blame just him .
Lisa has played her part and she must take responsibility for her actions , too .
" The whole thing is sheer madness .
I can only hope and pray she will come to her senses before it 's too late . "
The signs , it must be said , are not promising : aside from the occasional call from her mobile phone , and a brief visit home last weekend , Lisa has refused to contact her mother , and will not reveal where she is staying .
And while police are concerned , at 16 Lisa is not under-age .
Unless she can be shown to be in danger , there is little they can do to intervene .
It is an agonising situation for her mother - and a sorry reflection of a society in which young girls are sexualised at an increasingly young age .
Angela admits that Lisa was sexually active at 14 with her then boyfriend , so perhaps in this misguided girl 's mind it is not such a big step to run away at 16 with a man not far off his 50th birthday .
Angela , a 45 - year - old dental nurse , says she has done her best to provide a stable family environment for her daughters , despite being separated from Lisa 's father .
The couple remain friends and she says her husband David , a forklift truck driver , has proved himself a hands - on father , one who is equally horrified by the fate that has befallen his youngest daughter .

Lisa as a young child
Angela met David while they were next - door neighbours in Barking , East London , and they married in 1988 after a year - long courtship .
By doing so , David took on the care of Angela 's elder daughter Vicky , now 25 , from a previous relationship , and the couple had two further children , Gemma , now 19 , and Lisa .
" Vicky and Gemma were very outgoing , but Lisa was always a shy little girl , " Angela recalls .
" She was so shy that she used to hide behind the sofa when we had visitors , particularly if they were men .
Sometimes she would actually growl , which was her way of saying she was frightened . "
She was also , Angela recalls , a solitary soul .
" The three girls would all play together but , as she got older , Lisa was much more the one who would go upstairs and amuse herself , listen to music or read .
She was happy doing her own thing . "
Always a bright girl , Lisa did well at primary school and , as she entered adolescence , Angela insists she was strict with her - as she was with her other daughters .
" I like to think I was a disciplinarian , which makes what has happened all the harder , " insists Angela .
" I brought all my daughters up to know the meaning of respect , and I 'm not ashamed to say that on occasions I would administer a smack to the kids
when I thought it was needed .
Not that Lisa was particularly difficult . "
This dedication to her family , however , did not extend to her marital relationship , which broke down three years ago .
" We 'd had problems for some time and eventually we both decided it would be best if he moved out , although we remain friends , " says Angela .
It is impossible to say quite how much her parents ' separation affected the emotional state of the then 13 - year - old Lisa , although , in fairness , it certainly did not affect her schoolwork .
At her new school , teachers reported her as a bright student who , if she continued to apply herself , was on course for a hatful of A and A*- grade GCSEs .
In discussions with her mother , Lisa would excitedly talk of her plans to study psychology at university .
Those plans are now presumably on hold : Lisa was meant to be taking the first of her GCSEs this week , but so far has failed to show up for any of them .
Angela admits that Lisa 's early sexual experiences should have made her more watchful .
Two years ago , Lisa introduced to her mother a boy who she claimed was 16 years old .
Yet Angela soon learned that he was , in fact , 18 - which Lisa had known all along .
" She had lied to me because she knew I would n't approve of the age gap - and she was right .
I was furious when I realised , " Angela said .
" My daughter Gemma had her suspicions , so I went to the records office and found out his date of birth . "
That , however , does not alter the fact that Angela also knew Lisa was sleeping with her boyfriend from early on in their relationship .
Regardless of whether the boyfriend was 16 or 18 , Lisa was only 14 .
Had Angela not tried to dissuade Lisa from such early sexual activity ?
" I 'd always spoken to all my daughters about sex education - my belief was that if they were going to get involved , I 'd rather they were informed , " she says awkwardly .
" Of course , I would have preferred her not to , but I was happier she felt she could be honest with me rather than going behind my back . "
As it was , the relationship fizzled out after a year or so , and for a time calm prevailed .
Lisa seemed to focus on her studies , and , indeed , after Angela suffered a heart attack last year , was full of concern for her mother .
" I think my ill health scared her a bit .
She was very upset , " Angela says .
Perhaps Lisa might have been taking her all - important exams this week were it not for the fact that her elder sister Gemma , then aged 16 , had bumped into Glyn Trowbridge at a party , and the two had started dating .
By coincidence , Glyn's father Nigel had been to school with the girls ' mother .
" Nigel was a really good friend at school , although we 'd lost touch a bit , " says Angela .
" I saw him from time to time and we would always pass the time of day .
" But I was a bit wary of the family - I knew his brother Mark was in prison for murder , so I was n't thrilled when Gemma came home saying she had started dating Nigel 's son . "
Yet she found Glyn a " nice , easygoing boy , " and on the basis of his blossoming relationship with Gemma , it seemed entirely natural for Angela to rekindle her friendship with Nigel , who was separated from his wife .
" We met up for a drink and reminisced about old times , " Angela recalls .
" We were never going to be bosom buddies again , but it was perfectly nice . "
When , two years later , Gemma announced she was pregnant , it seemed entirely natural that Nigel would pop round throughout her pregnancy , apparently excited by the arrival of a grandchild .
" I actually cooked for him a couple of times because I knew he was living on his own , and even offered to do his washing , " Angela recalls .
" I was extending a helping hand to a friend . "
But she is now cursing her kindness , convinced the real reason for Nigel 's visits was a growing fascination with her daughter Lisa - visits which increased in frequency when Angela was hospitalised again over Easter , this time with a kidney infection .
" I was away for a few days and , because Gemma had just given birth and was staying at my house , Nigel was around a lot , " Angela says .
" When I came home , Gemma said to me she thought something was going on with him and Lisa .
She said they always seemed to be whispering and were very cosy together , but I told her not to be ridiculous .
I told her he was an old man - I simply did n't believe it . "
Perhaps she should have paid more heed .
A couple of weeks later , at the start of April , Lisa returned home late on a school night , and was dropped off by Nigel .
Angela says : " When I confronted her and asked what she was doing in his car , she said there had been some trouble on the bus and she had phoned Nigel for help because he lived close by .
I asked her why she had n't called me and she just shrugged . "
Even this , however , was not enough to set alarm bells ringing - that only started when a friend mentioned that she had seen Lisa visiting Nigel 's flat more than once .
" Suddenly , suggestions that had seemed preposterous turned into a horrible fear that this man had seduced my daughter , " Angela says .
" I went round to his flat immediately and Lisa was there .
I told her to get
home and told him to stay away from her .
I felt sick .
" I asked Lisa if she was sleeping with him , and she refused to give me a straight answer .
We had an enormous fight and I told her she would not be seeing him again .
" I grounded her for a time at home , and she seemed to accept it .
I thought she had just been pushing the boundaries , hanging out with an older man , a little rebellion . "
But it was clearly more serious than that .
On the last night before Lisa disappeared , mother and daughter bonded over a girlie evening in , eating strawberries and ice cream on Angela 's bed .
" I remember she said to me : ' It 's all coming to an end is n't it , Mum ? ' " says Angela .
" I asked : ' What do you mean ? '
She said she was talking about her exams and this phase of her life .
" I agreed , but told her there was an exciting new chapter ahead of her .
Now I know what she was planning - to run away with Nigel - it makes me feel so sad .
I thought she was talking about a real future , full of hope - not one with this man . "
The following morning , Lisa left for school as normal , and Angela had no reason to be suspicious - until a phone call later that day from school revealed that Lisa had not turned up .
Nor was it the first time she had missed her lessons .
" When I met with the school , they told me that she had n't really been there for weeks , " says Angela .
" I just felt a deep sense of betrayal and anger as I took the news in .
I realised she 'd been completely deceiving me . "
In the bewildering hours that followed , she desperately tried to contact her daughter , but Lisa 's mobile phone was switched off .
After searching Lisa 's bedroom , meanwhile , she discovered love tokens and gifts from Nigel , including a Leona Lewis album with romantic lyrics underlined and a message scrawled beside which read : " This is how I feel about you . "
Angela called the police , who forced their way into Trowbridge 's flat and found some of Lisa 's clothes and a bottle of her perfume .
Today , three weeks on , Angela is no closer to knowing where her daughter is , although she does know she is with Nigel .
She recently found a photograph of him in one of Lisa 's handbags , along with a love
letter to him in which she declares : " I 'm willing to become Mrs Lisa Veronica Trowbridge for you ... I love you with all my heart , my soul , my body and my mind . "
A week ago , Lisa finally made contact with Angela to tell her she was " OK , " and also made a brief return visit home last weekend to pick up fresh clothes .
" I gave her something to eat and begged her to stay .
I said there was nothing that had happened that could n't be sorted out , " Angela says .
" But she would n't listen .
She said she was desperately in love , and we would n't understand .
She would n't tell me where she was staying , even though I was begging her to .
" She was rude and defiant , not like the Lisa she once was .
In the end , short of locking her up in her room , I had to let her go .
I felt completely helpless .
I wanted to know what had happened to my sweet little girl . "
What has happened , of course , is a depressingly familiar tale of a
sexually aware girl 's head being turned by a middle - aged man who should know much better .
Perhaps Lisa will grow out of her infatuation before any real damage is done - though failing to sit her GCSEs will certainly compromise her future .
In the meantime , a despairing Angela Wright can only sit and wait at home for her errant daughter to come to her senses .
We rarely remember things as they actually happened .
Rather , as memories are encoded , they are altered in order to be made compatible with our existing knowledge ; upon retrieval , memories are reconstructed rather than reproduced .
Because the extent to which this reconstruction occurs can vary , some memories are very accurate while others are a mixture of fact and fantasy .
Yet others – claims of highly implausible events such as alien abduction and reincarnation , for example – are completely fabricated .
Maarten Peters and his colleagues , of the Department of Experimental Psychology at Maastricht University in the Netherlands , investigated the propensity for memory errors in people who make implausible claims .
I n many cases of false memories , it is very difficult to determine whether or not the perceived events actually occurred – that is , the “ ground truth ” can not be established .
The experimental group was therefore chosen on the basis of a highly implausible claim – the group consisted of 11 women and 2 men , all of whom claimed to have recollections of a previous life .
The performance of this group on a memory task was compared to that of a control group .
It was found that people who claim to have lived past lives were more prone than the control group to memory errors .
The findings were published recently in the journal Consciousness and Cognition .
The researchers used a modified version of a well established laboratory procedure for eliciting false recall of words .
Participants were first asked to read aloud a list of 40 names of non-famous people .
Two hours later , they were presented with another list , containing the old non-famous names ( those that had been included in the previous list ) , new non-famous names , and the names of well - known actors , writers and politicians .
They were then asked to make “ fame judgements ” on the names in the second list ; that is , they were asked to determine whether or not each of the people on the list was famous or not .
Those in the experimental group were found to be more susceptible than the control group to the “ false fame illusion ” – they were about twice as likely to identify the old non-famous names as famous names more than those in the control group .
How might such false memories form ?
In the study by Peters et al , the misidentification of names occurs because the previous encounter with the non-famous names is mistakenly taken as an indication that those people must be famous .
This is an example of what is called a source monitoring error .
Recollection of an event involves using information from various sources – one ’s own memory , for example , and other peoples ’ accounts of the event .
When source monitoring is impaired , one has difficulty attributing where and how information was acquired , but the origins of unreliable pieces of information are unquestioned nevertheless ; the unreliable information is therefore easily incorporated into a memory .
Clearly , people can , to a greater or lesser extent , be influenced by the suggestions of others .
If one becomes convinced that a suggested event is plausible , one may start to believe that the event has actually taken place .
Reiteration of the false memory leads to what is known as the “ illusion of truth ” .
Furthermore , such claims can seem even more realistic when corroborated by other people .
Hence , a group of people who share in common claims of an implausible event – such as being abducted by aliens , for example – will be convinced that their claims are real , because they will corroborate each other .
The use of leading questions can also result in the inadvertent planting of false memories in people undergoing interrogation or cross-examination .
Psychopathology is another cause of false memories ; it is well documented that schizophrenics are prone to source monitoring errors in memory and other cognitive processes ; thus , schizophrenics believe that the auditory or visual hallucinations they experience are real .
It is now also acknowledged that false memories can be deliberately planted .
Psychiatrists have been known to implant completely false memories in their patients during therapy .
Most commonly , these false memories are of events such as childhood sexual abuse or participation in Satanic rituals .
In some cases , psychiatrists have been sued for malpractice , and defendants have been awarded millions of dollars in damages for the traumas they have experienced as a result .
Peters and his colleagues did not deliberately implant false memories in their participants , but other researchers have shown how easy it is to distort peoples ’ recollections of real events , or to coax people into “ remembering ” entire events that did not happen .
In one experiment , led by Elizabeth Loftus , a professor of psychology at the University of California , Irvine , a false memory of a plausible and mildly traumatic event – getting lost in a shopping mall or a large department store as a child – was falsely implanted in experimental subjects .
The subjects were asked to recall childhood events that had been recounted to them by their parents , older siblings or other close relatives .
A booklet containing a paragraph about each of the recalled events , and one false memory ( of being lost in a shopping mall ) was then prepared for each of the participants .
The participants were then asked to read each story in their booklet , and to write down what they remembered about each event .
It was found that 5 out of the 24 subjects thought that they had experienced the false event ; some claimed to remember it only partially , while others reported that they remembered it fully .
Work by other research groups shows that memories of highly implausible events , and even impossible events , such as alien abduction and reincarnation , can be planted just as easily .

In October 2006 , Dr. Claudia Henschke of Weill Cornell Medical College jolted the cancer world with a study saying that 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could be prevented through widespread use of CT scans .
Small print at the end of the study , published in The New England Journal of Medicine , noted that it had been financed in part by a little - known charity called the Foundation for Lung Cancer : Early Detection , Prevention & Treatment .
A review of tax records by The New York Times shows that the foundation was underwritten almost entirely by $ 3.6 million in grants from the parent company of the Liggett Group , maker of Liggett Select , Eve , Grand Prix , Quest and Pyramid cigarette brands .
The foundation got four grants from the Vector Group , Liggett ’s parent , from 2000 to 2003 .
Dr. Jeffrey M. Drazen , editor in chief of the medical journal , said he was surprised .
“ In the seven years that I ’ve been here , we have never knowingly published anything supported by ” a cigarette maker , Dr. Drazen said .
An increasing number of universities do not accept grants from cigarette makers , and a growing awareness of the influence that companies can have over research outcomes , even when donations are at arm ’s length , has led nearly all medical journals and associations to demand that researchers accurately disclose financing sources .

TOMBSTONE , Ariz ( Reuters ) - Gunslinger Bob Krueger blasts away at his outlaw rivals at a tourist show in this storied Old West town , although rising ammo costs may force him to choose his shots .
Gun shop owner Lynn Kartchner holds a round of Russian made .223 caliber ammunition at his shop in Douglas , Arizona May 14 , 2008 .
The domestically made version of this round is the predominant ammunition used by the U.S. military and is used in AR - 15's , M - 16's and M - 4 rifles according to Kartchner .
Millions of shooters , hunters and even lawmen across the United States feel the pinch as sky - high metals prices and demand from wars abroad are driving up the price of bullets .

Krueger and his gnarly band of pistoleros are among millions of shooters , hunters and even lawmen across the United States feeling the pinch as sky - high metals prices and demand from wars abroad are driving up the price of bullets .
Ammo prices for many popular guns have more than tripled in the last three years , driven in large part by surging demand for metals in rapidly industrializing China .
As the Asian giant becomes wealthier , millions of tons of copper , lead and zinc , which are also used to make bullets and brass shell - casings , are being snapped up .
Shooters , gun dealers and sheriffs say the impact has been further aggravated by competition for limited ammo stocks with the U.S. military , currently fighting wars on two fronts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ Everybody is feeling it , ” said Krueger , a Stetson wearing cowboy whose show blasts through hundreds of rounds of blank ammo each week at Six Gun City in Tombstone .
“ If things get bad enough , we may all just get one bullet each , ” he said , to laughter from his grizzled buddies .
HUNTING FOR AMMO
Dealers complain that the cost of rifle ammunition has doubled and even tripled in the past two years , with similar increases for some hand gun ammunition .
Slideshow ( 4 images )
Lynn Kartchner , a gun shop owner in nearby Douglas , Arizona , says he now pays $ 250 for a case of 1,000 rounds of assault rifle ammunition , up from $ 80 two years ago , while a box of popular 9 mm shells has jumped to $ 17 from $ 10 .
“ Price rises have been accompanied by scarcity for certain kinds of ammo , ” Kartchner told Reuters in his shop , which is packed with rifles , pistols and shooting paraphernalia .
“ There is n’t as much variety , and a lot of people snap up whatever they can get their hands on , ” he added .
Increased costs and competition for ammo is also being born by police forces across the United States , among them the sheriff ’s department in Cochise County on the Arizona - Mexico border , which faces incursions from armed smugglers and even bandits from south of the line .
Last year the department faced a four - month delay acquiring rifle cartridges and had to dip into ammo reserves , rousing the concern of Sheriff Larry Dever .
“ We do face people in this environment down here who are heavily armed , sometimes with higher capacity armaments than we carry , ” Dever said .
“ The last thing we want do is find ourselves in a situation where we are not training sufficiently so that ( deputies ) can maintain those very important proficiencies , ” he added .
HOARDING , RELOADING
Demand for metals is tipped to stay strong in China for the next decade .
Cowboy shows and lawmen aside , high ammo prices are being shouldered by millions of target shooters and hunters across the United States , many of them working people on a limited budget .
“ If you have three of four children , and they all go out on a hunting trip , the cost of ammo can be a bit of a burden , ” said Luis Hernandez , a keen deer , bird and varmint hunter from Douglas .
To keep costs low , many hobby shooters are now scouring gun shows , gun shops and the Internet in search of cheap ammunition , which some then buy in bulk and hoard against further price rises .
Others either shoot less , switch to smaller caliber ammunition such as .22 which is cheaper , or are increasingly turning to reloading their old shell cases .
“ The main saving is in the brass casing , which is the most expensive part , ” said Hernandez , who reckons on saving up to $ 20 on a box of some premium rifle cartridges by reloading .
Other shooters and dealers are holding out hope that ammunition manufacturers will develop cheaper alternatives .
“ High cost drives innovation , ” said Kartchner .
“ There has been some interest in plastic or aluminum cartridge cases in the past , so I ’m hopeful they will come up with something .
We ’ll just have to see . ”
SAN FRANCISCO --( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- In 1848 , the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo officially ended the Mexican - America War ( 1846-1848 ) .
With the signing of this treaty , the United States gained control of what was to become the Golden West , including California , Arizona , Utah , Nevada and parts of Colorado and New Mexico .
Today , SKYY ®
Vodka , the number - one vodka produced in the United States , spoke out against suggestions by Absolut® Vodka to disregard that treaty , as well as the joining of Texas to the Union in 1845 , as depicted in Absolut ’s recent advertising .
“ Like SKYY Vodka , the residents of states like California , Texas and Arizona are exceptionally proud of the fact that they are from the United States of America , ” said Dave Karraker , SKYY Vodka .
“ To imply that they might be interested in changing their mailing addresses , as our competitor seems to be suggesting in their advertising , is a bit presumptuous . ”
In the ad , an “ Absolut World ” is depicted where the map of North America is re-drawn with Mexico claiming much of the Western United States , negating the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , as well as the Gadsden Purchase ( 1853 ) , and the independence of Texas ( 1836 ) .
“ Do n’t get me started on the Gadsden Purchase , ” continues Karraker .
“ I think the folks in Tucson and Yuma would be rubbed the wrong way if they hear this landmark deal was somehow nullified as suggested by Absolut , a Swedish - owned brand . ”
SKYY Vodka was founded in San Francisco in 1992 and continues to be produced in the United States .

When Oklahoma State Representative Sally Kern gave her now - infamous homophobic rant before a group of fellow Republicans , she remarked that “ The very fact that I ’m talking to you like this here today puts me in jeopardy . ”
It may have been the truest thing she said that day .
Normally , I would dismiss this particular remark as a pathetic religious - right sympathy ploy .
It ’s hard to take seriously the persecution complex of a group that wields so much power , especially in places like Kern ’s home state .
In jeopardy for making homophobic comments in front of Oklahoma Republicans ?
Please .
Thanks to the marvel of YouTube , however , Kern ’s rant received a much wider audience than she anticipated .
Listeners all over the country heard Kern claim that “ the homosexual agenda is destroying this nation , ” that gays are indoctrinating our children , and that homosexuality poses a bigger threat to America “ than terrorism or Islam , which I think is a big threat . ”
Kern later claimed , rather implausibly , that her comments were taken out of context , and that she was talking about gays around the country who were contributing money to pro-gay candidates in Oklahoma and elsewhere .
I look forward to joining that group of gays .
More precisely , I look forward to sending a big fat check to whatever decent candidate aims to unseat Kern in the next election cycle .
I ’m sure I ’m not alone in that plan .
So Kern ’s remark about her speech putting her in jeopardy may have been surprisingly prescient .
One can hope .
Unfortunately , Kern ’s speech offered little else in the way of insight , unless we ’re talking about insight into the fears , lies and stereotypes that dominate the religious right ’s thinking about gays .
Kern claimed that “ studies show no society that has totally embraced homosexuality has lasted , you know , more than a few decades . ”
I do n’t know what “ studies ” Kern is referring to , but the claim is nonsense on its face .
Can you name a now - extinct society that “ totally embraced ” homosexuality ?
Me neither .
Kern added that “ This stuff is deadly and it ’s spreading and it will destroy our young people ; it will destroy this nation . ”
I share Kern ’s concern for our young people , which is one reason I ’m eager to unseat her .
I remember what it was like to hear such stereotypes as a teenager and to think , “ No , no , no–that ca n’t be me . ”
I remember how ugly myths about homosexuality exacerbated my coming - out struggle .
I do n’t want other youths to suffer that .
Kern also claimed that homosexuality “ has deadly consequences for those people involved in it ; they have more suicides , they ’re more discouraged , there ’s more illness [ and ] their lifespans are shorter . ”
Again we have unsubstantiated myths and outright falsehoods , this time mixed with a grain of truth .
Who would n’t be “ discouraged ” in the face of attacks like Kern ’s ?
Should anyone be surprised that in Kern ’s world , gay people–and especially , gay youth–find that their lives are more difficult than others ’ ?
In this respect , Kern behaves like a bully who punches a kid on the playground and then justifies his attack by saying that he ’s troubled by his victim ’s bleeding .
Yes , Rep. Kern , gay youth are at a higher risk for suicide .
But their problem is not homosexuality .
Their problem is people like you .
I realize that such accusations of “ bloody hands ” do n’t do much to promote dialogue .
I have no doubt that Sally Kern is sincere in her beliefs .
What ’s more , some of those beliefs may even stem from virtuous motives –respect for tradition , concern for future generations , love of country and so on .
But virtuous motives do n’t make such beliefs any less false , ugly , or dangerous .
I ’m particularly irritated –though by no means surprised –by Kern ’s attempt to cloak her homophobia in religion .
At one point in her original screed she opines that “ Not everybody ’s lifestyle is equal–just like not all religions are equal . ”
She ’s right about that , too .
I ’d say that any religion that permits spreading lies or demonizing people because of whom they love is scarcely worthy of respect .
In the wake of this fiasco , Kern has complained that her critics want to deny her free speech .
“ Obviously , you have the right as an American to choose that lifestyle , ” she said , “ but I also have the right to express my views . ”
Yes , Rep. Kern , you do .
But free speech does n’t give anyone a free pass to say stupid things without repercussions .

By rights we should be covered on the career development front .
From executive coaching to transition coaching , career mentoring to career rehabilitation , Myers - Briggs tests to the Strong Interest Inventory to the Work / Life Values Checklist , there have never been more ways to establish the color of your parachute .
Problem is , parachutes are merely nylon .
Our vocations ?
A far more mystical blend .
Follow your dreams , we 're told , chase down that passion , listen to your heart -- hardly the stuff of earthly solutions .
Never fear , career wanderers , you can now buy employment advice from out of this world .
Welcome to Human Design , where the I Ching , Hindu chakras , the Kabbalah , quantum physics , biochemistry and astrology merge conveniently to reveal your true personal nature -- and deliver you a roadmap to professional success , if that 's what your personal nature is into .
The minute you were born , a squad of inconspicuous neutrinos shot down from the stars and into your being , conferring on it a mode of existence that can finally be uncovered .
Turns out all your stress , uncertainty and general career ennui is merely the result of you fighting your nature .
Learn your true Human Design and everything will fall into place .
" It 's your blueprint , and it's a decision - making process . "
Carol Zimmerman told me .
" If you were a program , this would be the tool that shows you how the program works .
It tells you how you were designed to operate in the world , so that you 're going with the flow rather than against it . "
Note the language -- blueprints , programs , tools .
Human Design may sound soft and New Agey , but it presents itself as a thoroughly data - driven " system of knowledge . "
I drove down to Zimmerman 's beautiful Los Gatos home office for some of this data not long ago ; she 's been working there as a Human Design guide , and general life coach , for the past few years .
For over two hours , we wandered an ornate realm of hexagrams and amino acids , activations and DNA codes , zodiac symbols and neutrino streams beamed down from above .
Guiding us was my bodygraph , a vaguely scientific - looking illustration of a human torso , crisscrossed with colorful pathways connecting assorted Human Design hubs .
Cough up a precise birth time and place , plus $ 150 , and you can have one , too .
Zimmerman did n't always do this .
Over the course of her career she 's gone from elementary school teacher to education publishing , then on to marketing , then a series of tech industry jobs , including one at Oracle as it went public .
She was successful and burned out .
In 2000 she took what she 'd planned to be a brief sabbatical .
Seven years later , she 's happily absent from the corporate world .
She lives her dream of working at home with her dog curled up in the corner , and she helps others achieve their dreams , too .
Your sacral frequency tells me you 're curious how distant planets and unrelated ancient texts manage to get at those dreams .
I do n't know .
I listened careful and took notes and later read everything I could get my hands on .
Zero comprehension .
Given the years of study and the financial investment it takes to become a full Human Design analyst , I think I 'm supposed to sit back and let the experts explain me to me :
I 'm really busy , Human Design informed me .
My wife Amy , the environmental reporter ?
Naturally curious .
Are we close , Amy and me ?
Yes ?
Well , the sun and the Earth were in the same gate when we were born , very rare .
The data tended to be flattering : I like to get to the bottom of things .
I 've got a deep sense of love , and a certainty about who I am .
I 'm not shaken easily .
My mind is " open , " as opposed to " defined , " and guess who else had this condition -- Einstein !
As with horoscopes and psychics and your better fortune cookies , the Human Design data had a ring of accuracy -- it 's true , I am opinionated ! -- while also happening to apply to just about anyone on the planet .
Even when specifics were ventured , they struck me as statistically safe bets :
Amy does prefer an earlier bedtime than I , but women also tend to go to bed earlier than men .
On the occasion that a reading seems off , it can always be seen from another angle :
When I disputed Zimmerman 's assertion that I 'm a " natural leader , " she informed me it just has n't kicked in yet .
Parts of Human Design are blandly commonsensical .
Of course we should seek out our inner desires and inclinations .
But the system also strays into murkier territory at times .
At one point , when I suggest that maybe our " design " is more malleable than the literature suggests , Zimmerman pushed back : " No , it ca n't be thwarted . "
A big pill to swallow if you 're turned off by the idea of fate or inevitability .
I 'm picking at my mandala -- and possibly offending a kind and compassionate - seeming Los Gatos woman -- because it 's hard not to .
( Or because I 'm a naturally skeptical " 5/1 profile , " as Zimmerman explained when I voiced my doubts . )
To sit and hear that my life was designed one June morning according to the positions of some distant planets -- I can't begin to imagine how that would work .
I 'm generally open to all things -- for all I know , breakfast this morning was the dream of a butterfly .
But I have my suspicions , and anyway I 'm okay putting faith in the scientific method .
A longitudinal study released in 2003 was just one of the latest to debunk the fundamental claims of astrology .
When Stephen Hawking took it on too , my inner Gemini felt fairly won over .
* * *
Easy enough to chip away at astrology - based career diagnostics .
Harder to understand why they seem to work for a number of people .
" I so appreciated it .
It was monumental , " said Elizabeth Mollner , a career nurse in Northern California and one of Zimmerman 's clients .
" It was mind - boggling .
I feel so much more confident in my life . "
Mollner recently took a bold step into self - employment , starting a business as a biofeedback practitioner .
She says Zimmerman helped her see that this was the right decision , and that being her own boss " totally fit my design . "
Donna Bach , a florist in Brisbane , Australia , says Zimmerman 's work allowed her to see her potential as a photographer .
What she learned about her design gave her the confidence to charge ahead , and she 's now working with a photo agent .
What about all that neutrino stuff ?
Does it make sense to Zimmerman 's clients ?
Should n't everyone born at the same minute in the same place end up with the same personality ?
Are n't upbringing and , I do n't know , candy intake the things that shape us ?
" I do n't get hung up on the belief part of it , " Mollner said .
" I prefer living from a place of possibility . "
Bach agrees .
She admits she can't get her head around the why or the how of Human Design , but she sees no reason to argue with so accurate a system .
To poke holes in Human Design -- neither Mollner nor Bach are entirely certain of the birth times they gave Zimmerman , for instance -- is to miss the point : Programs like this come into being because there 's a hunger for them .
At no point in history have humans faced such anguish over the simple decision of how to spend the work day .
No longer do we automatically inherit the blacksmithing operation , or follow the college major unquestioningly through to its related profession .
We dig deep for inner vocational truths .
The decision can seem downright cosmic , and so it 's tempting to ask a cosmically connected stranger for direction .
And why look on mountaintops when you can just take the freeway down to Los Gatos ?
It seems plausible that the vast and varied coaching field will only continue to grow -- laterally , upward to the stars , wherever .
As Zimmerman herself noted , more and more people are confronting employment angst of one kind or another .
Changes in the economy mean more of us have to think more creatively about how we make a living .
Maybe Human Design is n't about the answers so much as taking a step -- any step -- forward in this daunting project .
There are times , after all , when spinning the globe and jabbing at a random country can get you moving far faster than endless deliberation .
Of course I 'd say that , though .
I 'm a Generator .

TOKYO  Japan is running out of engineers .
After years of fretting over coming shortages , the country is actually facing a dwindling number of young people entering engineering and technology - related fields .
Universities call it “ rikei banare , ” or “ flight from science . ”
The decline is growing so drastic that industry has begun advertising campaigns intended to make engineering look sexy and cool , and companies are slowly starting to import foreign workers , or sending jobs to where the engineers are , in Vietnam and India .
It was engineering prowess that lifted this nation from postwar defeat to economic superpower .
But according to educators , executives and young Japanese themselves , the young here are behaving more like Americans : choosing better - paying fields like finance and medicine , or more purely creative careers , like the arts , rather than following their salaryman fathers into the unglamorous world of manufacturing .
The problem did not catch Japan by surprise .
The first signs of declining interest among the young in science and engineering appeared almost two decades ago , after Japan reached first - world living standards , and in recent years there has been a steady decline in the number of science and engineering students .
But only now are Japanese companies starting to feel the real pinch .
Two weeks ago , I shared two of my personal favorite money saving appliances – the crockpot and an upright freezer .
It is no secret that cooking at home makes you feel healthier and saves money .
With the right money saving appliances , cooking at home can be easier and less time consuming .
Here are three more money and time saving appliances everyone should have in their kitchen .
2. Counter Top Conventional
Oven : I hate to turn on the oven to do a lot of cooking , especially in the middle of summer .
I found a very decent replacement for a full sized oven with the Breville Compact Smart Oven .
This oven heats up quite a lot of food in less time .
Of course , since the oven is smaller , I do have to use a regular oven to bake large amounts of food .
However , I have been able to cook pizzas , chickens , and pies in the conventional oven .
How Does This Save on Your Grocery Bill : Counter top conventional ovens , or smart ovens , take less than five minutes to heat up to 400 - degrees , and they also cook foods faster because of the smaller size .
This saves money on energy costs in the long run .
Since a counter top oven heats items so quickly , I can usually whip up a simple dinner , such as a chicken and cheese sandwich melt , in less than five minutes .
Quick meals like this make takeout and fast food unnecessary .
How to Get a Counter Top Conventional Oven for Less : Look for a good counter top conventional oven during Black Friday or through Craigslist .
This type of oven can replace your toaster and microwave too , therefore , you can consider not buying those appliances as money saved .
3. Bread Machine :
The bread machine had a very popular boom about fifteen years ago .
Now , it seems that either people love them or hate them .
The main purpose I use my bread machine is for doing all the hard work of bread making , without actually baking the bread .
Of course , many people love the way bread machines bake bread , but I personally do not enjoy the hole that is left in the bread .
So instead , I will make rolls , breads , and even pizza dough from scratch and have the bread machine do all of the mixing , kneading , and rising for me .
I just set it on the “ dough ” option .
After the bread machine does all of the work , I just have to put the dough in bread pans and bake or separate the dough into rolls and bake .
How Does This Save on Your Grocery Bill : Homemade bread and baked goods can definitely take a good portion of your grocery budget , especially if you have a large family .
With the right recipes , you can bake your own bread , bagels , rolls , pizza dough , and more .
Buy flour and yeast in bulk and make extra baked goods to store in the freezer to save time in the long run .
How to Get a Bread Machine for Less :
It seems that everyone has an unused bread machine at their yard sale or even sitting in their homes .
Ask around and search local yard sales to score a great bread machine for less than $ 20 .
4. Multi-Use Rice Maker :
Think a rice cooker can only cook rice ?
Think again !
Just recently , I bought the Aroma 3 Quart Rice Cooker and Food Steamer , and I was amazed at how many things I can cook in it .
Since this type of rice cooker has many heating options , I can cook rice , steam vegetables , and slow cook other meals , such as soup or meat .
I have even cooked beans on the slow cook option .
Even though the heating option says “ slow cook ” , it cooked my raw beans in about three hours .
So it cooks faster than a slow cooker , but its small size is not idea for large recipes .
How Does This Save on Your Grocery Bill :
The size of this rice maker is large enough to make a large batch of rice or soup / chili for a family of four .
Since it is smaller , it heats faster and uses less energy in less amount of time .
Buying bulk rice ( such as the 10lb bags of white or brown rice from Sam ’s Club or Costco ) and adding them to your meal frequently will save you money on food .
Brown rice is also more healthful and less expensive per pound than pasta .
Use rice as a side , in salads , in bakes , and in burritos .
Try cooking lentils or other grain , such as quinoa in the rice cooker too .
How to Get a Rice Maker for Less :
While this specific rice maker is more than $ 45 on Amazon , it cost less than $ 30 at Costco , depending on the store .
Other rice makers may be able to slow cook and steam ( with the use of a steam basket ) , so if you already have a rice cooker , put it to the test .
5. Ice Maker :
The average ice maker actually increases energy consumption by 12 % to 20 % when it ’s on — which for most people is all the time .
It ’s not the freezing that does it — your freezer ’s going to be cold whether you have an automatic ice maker or not — it ’s the motor that dumps the ice in to the tray , you can get the best chest freezer in the market .
Since it operates inside a freezer , it actually has its own little heater inside to keep the mechanism from freezing ( is this sounding silly yet ? ) , and heating elements require power .
While these appliances are great for saving time and money in the kitchen , they will not reduce your grocery bill unless you actually use them !
Use these appliances to cook meals from scratch , instead of buying the processed or canned versions .
What are your favorite money saving appliances ?
Europa , that icy moon of Jupiter , is famous for its odd surface features  long lines , pits , domes , spots and the occasional crater .
Though the origin of some of these features has been explained , many mysteries remain .
Among the puzzles are several arc - shaped troughs , first noticed in images from the Voyager missions .
Three of them have been seen .
Two appear to form parts of a circle roughly 1,400 miles across , centered near the equator .
One is part of a circle of the same diameter on the moon ’s opposite side .
Europa has plenty of troughs , but these are unusual because they are so circular and concentric , said Paul M. Schenk of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston .
“ Nature is not supposed to work that way , ” he said .
Image Large , circular markings on Europa may be from a surface shift .
Now Dr. Schenk and his colleagues have come up with an explanation for why these troughs formed .
At some point , they say in a paper in Nature , the surface of Europa shifted , so that the poles neared the equator , and vice versa .
David Mach , a sculpture and installation artist , creates art from wire coathangers .
The way he makes these is to first make a mold of the figure and then create a hard plastic form around which the coathangers can be formed .
On his website he says , " When I have ideas I want to make them , and not just some of them , but all of them .
As a result of that my sculpture covers a multitude of sins .
I like to work in as many different materials as possible .
It 's no understatement to say I am a materials junkie - jumping from highly - painted realistic cast fibreglass pieces to sculpture with coathangers , to a thatched barn roof laced with fibre - optics to designs for camera obscures ( or at least the buildings to house them ) and layouts for parks . "
He has also created a piece called Spaceman , which is based on an image of Neil Armstrong when he landed on the moon .
Every hour it rises slowly up and down inside a glass atrium .
" The work is made up from hundreds of standard metal coathangers , welded to each other around a plastic positive later removed , and then silver nickel plated .
What does it cost to send a man into space , to make him walk on the moon ?
I am fascinated by the effort of that , the science , the brainpower , the sheer physical power of the rockets .
Billions of dollars spent over decades , invested in the best minds , and here I am , using the cheapest , throwaway nothing object , a coathanger , to portray that . "
Imagine the time involved to create these works of art .
He uses everyday materials that we do n't even think twice about .
If only I could do this with the thousands of coathangers I have laying around .
David also creates works of art from matchsticks , such as this :

The View : Lying about war worse than oral sex ?

When the panelists on ABC's The View took up the question of " What kind of flaws are acceptable in a candidate , " most of the attention was focused on former President Bill Clinton , until host Whoopi Goldberg turned the conversation to " lying to the country about going to war . "
" The reason I brought this up is that I was at this dinner party Saturday night , " began comedian Joy Behar .
" They were talking about Bill Clinton and his little ... escapade . ...
The men seemed to be much more against and angry about what he did , and the women -- how shall I put this ?
-- they blew it off .
...
Then I said , well is that a worse flaw than , let 's say , John McCain supposedly has anger issues .
... How many flaws will we tolerate ? "
" I think we should look at them kind of like as if you 're dating them , " commented former reality show contestant Elisabeth Hasselbeck .
" Are there deal - breakers in a relationship ? "
" If you are willing to lie and keep things from your partner , and that 's a commitment that you made before God ... then what makes me think as a person who nominated you into that office that you 're not going to lie and keep things from me ? " asked actress Sherri Sheperd .
" Would you say that lying to the country about going to war sort of balances that out ? " asked host Whoopi Goldberg .
" There were no weapons of mass destruction and -- I 'm sorry -- Osama bin Laden was not in Iraq . "
" But is that a lie ? " Hasselbeck asked .
" Yes , it 's a lie , " replied Golderg .
" I do n't believe it .
I do n't think there was , " insisted the reliably pro-administration Hasselbeck .
" I think that there was a response based on intelligence that was appropriate at the time , and everybody felt that way at the time "
But Goldberg would n't accept the claim that " everybody felt that way . "
She pointed out that she herself was all gung ho to go after al Qaeda following 9/11 but " we did n't go where he said we were going .
... I woke up the next morning , we were in Iraq . "
This video is from ABC's The View , broadcast March 10 , 2008 .
Lou Genise , a compact man with a shorn head and Fu Manchu mustache , sat propped up on a mattress in a hospital room tucked away on the fifth floor of Harbor - UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles .
Wearing an eyeshade and listening to music through a headset , he was oblivious to the two psychiatrists sitting nearby , quietly monitoring his every move .
Worry and nausea had been the 37 - year - old performance artist ’s constant companions during his treatment for metastatic colon cancer that was diagnosed a year earlier .
Yet the shroud of negativity lifted under the influence of psilocybin , the psychoactive ingredient in the hallucinogenic mushrooms used in sacred Native American rituals .
Early one morning last July , Genise had taken a little white capsule containing the psychedelic as part of a medically supervised study to test whether it could ease the mental anguish of people with terminal cancer .
He had checked into the hospital the afternoon before , and Charles Grob , the UCLA psychiatrist who is conducting the study , reviewed with him the issues he wanted to confront .
Genise said he had developed a Pavlovian aversion to hospitals after all he had been through and would get nauseated in anticipation of getting treatment .
He was also having trouble accepting his separation from a former girlfriend , who had come to Los Angeles to care for him when he fell ill .
“ I had dealt with the big , earth - shattering problems , but the day - to - day anxieties were the hard part , ” Genise recalled five months later , sipping tea in his home in the L.A. neighborhood of Echo Park .
“ But following the session , I had two startling epiphanies .
First , here I was in a hospital having a pleasurable experience , which immediately cured my anxieties .
And it suddenly clicked in my head that I did n’t need to cling to my ex .
It was a spectacular experience , because in a short time I was able to work through some serious issues on a very deep level . ”
At a handful of sites across the country , after a four - decade hiatus , psychedelic research is undergoing a quiet renaissance , thanks to scientists like Charles Grob who are revisiting the powerful mind - altering drugs of the 1960s in hopes of making them part of our therapeutic arsenal .
Hallucinogens such as psilocybin , MDMA ( better known as Ecstasy ) , and the most controversial of them all , LSD , are being tested as treatments for maladies that modern medicine has done little to assuage , such as post - traumatic stress disorder , drug dependency , obsessive - compulsive disorder , cluster headaches , and the emotional suffering of people with a terminal illness .
While Grob ’s study is not complete — he has tested 11 out of a projected 12 volunteers — patients seemed to have positive experiences .
“ No one had a bad trip , and most derived some benefit , ” he says .
“ It lowered their anxiety , improved their mood and disposition , and imbued them with a greater acceptance of their situation and capacity to live in the moment and appreciate each day . ”
Other early test results are equally encouraging .
University of Arizona scientists recently fed psilocybin to nine volunteers whose obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) was so disabling that many could not hold down a job or leave the house ; they would observe elaborate cleaning rituals or shower for hours until they felt comfortable .
Conventional treatments such as psychotherapy and medication had failed .
In each of the nine patients in the study , psilocybin drastically diminished or melted away their compulsions for up to 24 hours , and several remained symptom - free for days .
In another ongoing study , psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer of Charleston , South Carolina , is testing MDMA ( 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ) on people suffering from severe post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , including rape victims and Iraq War veterans who have not gotten any relief from conventional treatments such as antidepressants and therapy .
PTSD is normally triggered by a terrifying incident — combat , childhood sexual abuse , physical abuse , a serious accident , rape , or a natural disaster — in which people feel their lives are in danger but are powerless to defend themselves .
Sometimes PTSD can be triggered by growing up in a harrowing environment where a child is at the mercy of a cruel parent or parental figure .
To survive such horrific circumstances , sufferers often numb themselves to their pain .
The cornerstone of PTSD treatment involves reliving the trauma in a way that enables patients to process their fears in a rational way .
But by definition , revisiting the experience can be frightening , and people often become locked in the grip of intense anxiety .
The drug MDMA , a chemical cousin of mescaline and methamphetamine , can kindle intense euphoria or sublime seren­ity , creating a calming therapeutic environment in which to revisit trauma .
Eighteen out of a projected 21 patients in Mithoefer ’s study have already been treated , and in many cases just two sessions dramatically diminished symptoms , which is remarkable because PTSD in this group of subjects has been resistant to other types of treatment .

One of the study participants spent more than two decades in therapy in a futile attempt to heal the deep wounds inflicted by a violent and emotionally abusive stepfather .
She ran away from home , was raped twice by men who picked her up hitchhiking , and ricocheted from one abusive relationship to another .
The patient , a 51 - year - old woman from South Carolina , coped by deadening herself emotionally .
“ I knew I was messed up , but I sealed up all those feelings because they were so overwhelming , ” she recalls .
“ They were like the monster that is locked behind a three - foot - thick steel door . ”
Under the influence of MDMA , she was able to let go of the blockage that had stunted her emotionally .
“ The drug opened the door and removed that fear of feeling , ” she says .
“ I never cried about those experiences before , but now I can and I welcome it .
I no longer feel like I ’m holding back the Red Sea . ”
Success stories like these explain why psychedelics never lost their appeal for Grob and a handful of other academic scientists .
Despite their promise , however , it is still difficult to get such studies off the ground .
Psychedelics are classified as Schedule 1 drugs by the Drug Enforcement Administration , which outlaws their use outside a research setting .
Exceptions are made for Native American church­goers , who are allowed by law to use peyote in prayer meetings , and members of a branch of a Brazilian - based church in Santa Fe , New Mexico , who have won court battles for the right to use the hallucinogenic tea ayahuasca in their religious rituals .
In the current climate , the main source of funding for studies of hallucinogens are two private philanthropies : the Heffter Research Institute in Santa Fe , which was founded in 1993 by academics and mental health professionals to finance scholarly research , and MAPS ( Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ) , which has dispensed more than $ 10 million since it was launched in 1986 by Rick Doblin , a drug reform activist in Boston with a Harvard University Ph.D. in public policy .
But it is not just social taboos that have scared off government funders and pharmaceutical companies .
Critics worry that this research will legitimize reckless recreational use , especially among impressionable young adults .
“ That danger needs to be considered before we open a Pandora ’s box , ” says Glen Hanson , a pharmacologist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City and former acting director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse .
“ So much emotion is tied up with this research that it often gets in the way of critically analyzing the risks . ”
Still , mainstream psychiatrists like Herbert Kleber , director of the Division on Substance Abuse at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City , hope these experiments will chip away at institutional resistance .
“ They have therapeutic potential for crippling mental maladies , especially for OCD , PTSD , and drug and alcohol addictions , which have such a high relapse rate , ” says Kleber , a former deputy director for the Office of National Drug Control Policy at the White House .
“ These are not easy drugs to work with , and some of the side effects are unpredictable .
But they are all absolutely worthy of research . ”
With his salty beard , wire - frame glasses , khaki pants , tie , and sport jacket , Charles Grob , a 57 - year - old professor of psychiatry , does n’t look anything like a wild - eyed rebel of the ’60s .
He squeezes in psychedelic research on weekends because his workdays are filled overseeing a large clinical program that handles 400 to 500 patients a year and supervising the child psychiatry fellows , residents , interns , psychology postdocs , and social workers in training who rotate through his department at UCLA .
Grob ’s fascination with the medicinal powers of hallucinogens began in 1972 , when he was babysitting dream - research experiments at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn , where his father , David Grob , was chief of medicine .
Having dropped out of college and with little to do but read , he dug into the library of his psychologist boss , Stanley Krippner , and was astonished to learn that after World War II scientists were achieving what seemed like miracle cures by treating once - intractable mental ills with psychedelics such as LSD .
“ They were at the cutting edge of psychiatric research , ” Grob says .
While peyote and other plant hallucinogens had been used in shamanistic rites for centuries , the modern era of hallucinogenic research began in April 1943 .
At Sandoz Laboratories in Basel , Switzerland , chemist Albert Hofmann accidentally dosed himself with LSD , a rye ergot fungus he had been working with , and suddenly saw the world through kaleidoscope eyes .
That first acid trip sparked an explosion in experimentation by psychiatrists , intellectuals , artists , spiritual seekers , and even Nobel Prize–winning scientists including physicist Richard Feynman and Francis Crick , who reportedly admitted before he died in 2004 that he had visualized the double - helix structure of DNA while under the influence of LSD .
In the heady postwar years , hundreds of promising studies were conducted in the United States , Canada , and Europe on the use of LSD and other psychedelics , like peyote , to treat such psychiatric maladies as schizophrenia , autism , drug addiction , alcoholism , and chronic depression .
“ People do n’t realize today how valuable these studies were and how enthusiastic the reception was within psychiatry , which was then locked in a rigid Freudian orthodoxy , ” Grob says .
“ Investigators were getting very rapid , positive , and transformative changes in patients . ”
By the early 1960s more than 1,000 studies on LSD and other hallucinogens discussing the experiences of 40,000 patients had been published in reputable medical journals .
“ It was a medicine of remarkable power , ” Stanislav Grof says .
The Czech - born psychiatrist conducted dozens of government - sanctioned LSD experiments in the ’50s , ’60s , and early ’70s on heroin addicts , alcoholics , and terminal cancer patients in his native Prague and later at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center , a mental health facility in Catonsville , Maryland , where he was chief of psychiatric research .
“ The results were quite impressive , particularly in some of those categories that are very resistant to treatment , such as heroin addiction , ” recalls Grof , who is now 76 .
“ It could also frequently relieve pain , even pain that did n’t respond to narcotics .
I found the studies with cancer patients to be the most moving , to see how their attitudes toward death changed . ”
During the 1950s and early ’ 60s , research in Canada by psychiatrists Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond using mescaline and LSD on patients with severe alcohol addictions became the stuff of legend .
“ Alcoholics Anonymous believed many alcoholics do n’t do well until they become deeply motivated by ‘ hitting bottom , ’ ” says Hoffer , who at 90 still sees patients .
“ We thought we could use a whip to frighten alcoholics and drive them away from a desire to drink by giving them a bad trip .
After giving it to five patients , we realized that instead of hitting bottom , they were having a beneficial , pleasurable experience .
It opened their minds , they developed some insights , and they began to see things they never had seen before , ” which made them more receptive to psychotherapy .
This prompted Osmond to coin the term psychedelic ( from the Greek , meaning “ mind manifesting ” ) to describe the drugs ’ capacity for mental enrichment .
When combined with talk therapy , just one or two daylong LSD sessions blunted the desire to drink , even in alcoholics written off as hopeless .
Psychedelics became part of treatment in Saskatchewan ’s five treatment centers and were administered in 100 - to 800 - microgram doses — many times the strength of a street dose and potent enough to conjure up visions .
In follow - ups two and three years later , researchers found that more than half the patients — and , in some instances , up to 90 percent — remained sober , according to Erika Dyck , a medical historian at the University of Alberta in Edmonton and author of an upcoming book on psychedelic psychiatry .
Many patients said the sessions saved their lives .
But these potent potions soon became a symbol of the dark side of the ’60s counterculture .
Unhinged people on bad acid trips who had taken bootleg or adulterated street drugs began showing up in emergency rooms in the throes of severe panic attacks or psychotic breakdowns .
Psychedelics , and LSD in particular , were held responsible for suicides , permanent brain damage , and cult thrill killings .
In response to the hysteria , Sandoz stopped supplying researchers with LSD in 1965 ; a year later the drug was outlawed in the United States , and by 1972 legitimate scientific research had ground to a halt .
Lack of scientific standards in many of the early studies compounded the problem .
Often the reports were based on anecdotal evidence , or the studies failed to give any participants dummy pills as a basis for comparison .
Nor were the tests blinded .
In a blinded test , researchers do n’t know whether they are giving patients the drug being tested or fake medicine .
That is an important control ; other­wise , personal biases and expectations can muddy test results .
At the time , though , Charles Grob thought the setbacks were only temporary .
After hearing a lecture by Grof in the 1970s about his studies with the terminally ill , he decided that pursuing this line of research was what he wanted to do with his life .
“ His research was inspiring , ” Grob recalls .
“ The hospice movement had n’t occurred yet , and these patients were often pushed off into a corner of a sterile hospital .
But when I told my father , he said no one would listen to me unless I had credentials . ”
Grob headed back to college , earned his medical degree in 1979 , and , after completing a child psychiatry fellowship , began teaching at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1984 .
“ Almost overnight , the field had gone into deep hibernation , ” he recalls .
Still , he never gave up on the drugs ’ tantalizing potential .
When UCLA wooed him away from the University of California at Irvine in 1993 , where he was teaching and practicing after leaving Johns Hopkins , he told his future boss about his secret passion .
“ I hope I ’m not too crazy for you , ” Grob told him .
The research climate was changing once again .
In 1990 Rick Strassman , a psychiatrist at the University of New Mexico in Albu­querque , got federal clearance to do the first psychedelic studies on humans in nearly two decades .
Several factors helped pry open the regulatory doors , Strassman says .
The countercultural excesses were a dim memory , a new regime at the FDA was more open , the little - known psychedelic he proposed to test — DMT — did n’t have the baggage of LSD , and he was persistent .
“ It took two years , ” Strassman says .
“ They never said no , so I thought until they did , I would continue working on getting approval . ”
Over the next five years , he injected 65 healthy adult volunteers with DMT ( dimethyltryptamine ) , a powerful hallucinogen derived from plants that induces a trancelike state .
Many of the subjects , all of whom had taken psychedelics before , reported having out - of - body and near - death experiences and felt the sessions were among the most intense episodes of their lives .
Not long after , Grob witnessed the salutary effects of psychedelics when he was invited by a colleague to do a privately funded investigation of the emotional health of people who regularly ingested these substances as part of their religion .
In the summer of 1993 , he traveled to Manaus , Brazil , a major port city in the Amazon rain forest , to study members of the Centro Espirita Beneficente União do Vegetal ( UDV ) church .
Founded in Brazil in 1961 , the 8,000 - member religion mixes traditional Christianity with indigenous beliefs .
Central to the UDV rituals is drinking ayahuasca , a tea brewed from two plants that grow in the Amazon basin .
One contains DMT ; the other contains an alkaloid that prevents DMT from being degraded in the stomach .
Grob did a psychiatric and neuropsychological inventory comparing 15 long - term users of ayahuasca with 15 matched controls and found the church members were physiologically and psychologically healthier .
They were more cheerful , confident , relaxed , even - tempered , and orderly and scored better on memory and concentration tests — and there was no evidence of deterioration of their personalities or their mental acuity .
When Grob quizzed them about their personal lives , many UDV members described themselves as angry , impulsive reprobates hell - bent on self - destruction before they entered the church .
Some had unsavory histories of violence and spousal abuse and were severely alcoholic or addicted to drugs .
“ I was amazed because these were responsible , high - functioning pillars of the community , ” Grob recalls .
“ They all unequivocally credited ayahuasca , when taken in the controlled setting of the church , as the catalyst for their evolution into upstanding citizens . ”
Emboldened by Strassman ’s success , Grob applied to the FDA for permission to test MDMA on dying cancer patients .
The agency insisted that safety studies be completed first on 18 healthy volunteers to ensure that the drug did n’t trigger damaging side effects .
In 1994 he administered the first dose of MDMA to a test subject .
But after completing the pilot study , he abandoned the drug in favor of the less controversial psilocybin .
After Grob made the switch , the FDA gave him the go - ahead , and he recruited his first terminal cancer patient in 2004 .
But the real turning point was a 2006 Johns Hopkins study using psilocybin in 36 healthy adults who were spiritually inclined but had never done psychedelics .
They all received both psilocybin and an amphetamine - like compound ( Ritalin ) , which has some psychoactive effects , such as increasing heart rate and increasing concentration .
Some received psilocybin first ; others received Ritalin first .
In follow - up interviews two months later , four out of five said that the psilocybin experience had improved their well - being and satisfaction with life , about 70 percent rated the experience as among the most spiritually significant events of their lives , and nearly 70 percent called it one of the most personally meaningful events , comparable to the birth of a first child or the death of a parent .
These beneficial effects persisted more than a year , when the volunteers were interviewed again .
“ Many of these people had a genuine mystical experience , which was transformative in a profound way , ” says Roland Griffiths , a behavioral psychopharmacologist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the study ’s lead investigator .
Especially significant was the experiment ’s rigorous design , which proved that this type of research can be safely done under scientifically standardized conditions .
Perhaps even more important , Herbert Kleber says , is that Griffiths is new to the field and “ not a true believer . ”
What are the drugs doing to create such powerful effects ?
At the chemical level , psilocybin , LSD , and DMT — which are classified as tryptamines — are structurally similar to serotonin , a powerful chemical messenger that expedites the transmission of nerve signals in the brain .
Tryptamines work by mimicking the action of serotonin , which is responsible for controlling an array of functions , including mood , sexual desires , sleep cycles , memory , and appetite .
MDMA is a phenethylamine ; it taps into the neuronal reservoirs of the key brain chemicals serotonin , dopamine , and norepinephrine ( adrenaline ) , boosting their levels in the brain .
Mescaline , although it is classified as a phenethylamine , works more like LSD or DMT .
While no one knows why psychedelics exert powerful positive effects or why they transform perceptions , progress in brain imaging has allowed researchers to discover where these drugs act in the brain .
Extensive animal studies and PET scans on humans reveal that tryptamines such as psilocybin stimulate an array of brain structures : the prefrontal cortex , which is the center of executive functioning ; limbic regions such as the amygdala that govern our emotional life and the formation of memories ; the striatum , which plays a role in cognitive functions ; and the thalamus .
Scientists suspect that one of the key areas especially affected is the thalamus , a walnut - size structure at the base of the brain that is the gateway for sensory information — taste , touch , vision , and hearing .
The thalamus normally acts as a filter , winnowing out extraneous sensory information before relaying data to the cerebral cortex , the seat of memory , attention , language , and consciousness .
Under psychedelics , the sensory overload may overwhelm the thalamus , leading to delusions , hallucinations , thought disturbances , feelings of persecution , and loss of coherent ego experiences .
“ The cortex basically takes all the information coming in and synthesizes it into reality , ” says David E. Nichols , a professor of medicinal chemistry at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana , who has done animal research on hallucinogens .
“ When you alter that circuitry , you ’re essentially changing your perception of reality . ”
That ’s why scientists stress the importance of taking these powerful substances in a pleasant and well - supervised environment , rather than in the uncontrolled settings of recreational drug use .
Psychedelics amplify whatever is going on around you and within you , Nichols says .
“ Taken in haste , without proper regard for their effects and in chaotic conditions , the effects can be really awful and frightening .
But with the proper preparation , in a proper setting , with the right controls , the experience can be wonderful . ”
Annie Levy , a participant in Grob ’s study , agrees .
The 54 - year - old neuropsychologist underwent her psilocybin session at UCLA last May , shortly after her ovarian cancer had come roaring back in spite of two rounds of intensive chemotherapy .
Overwhelmed by dread , Levy says she was “ plagued by obsessive thoughts that I would suffer horribly while going through the dying process . ”
A few days before her treatment , Levy says , “ I had felt somewhat anxious about participating in the study , but meeting the treatment team helped calm my fears . ”
And once the psychedelic took hold , her despair disappeared .
She was able to come to terms with her eventual death , concentrate on all the joy in her life , and stop ruminating about all the awful things that might happen in the future .
The drug ’s influence endured for about six months .
“ I wish I could go in for another session , ” Levy says , “ like a booster . ”
Despite such glowing testimonials , some researchers worry about the potential for serious psychic damage if these compounds are used by hundreds of therapists on thousands of patients , instead of by a small cadre of dedicated scientists testing carefully screened volunteers in tightly controlled situations .
“ The idea of turning [ these drugs ] loose makes me uncomfortable , ” says University of Utah pharmacologist Glen Hanson , who is also director of the Utah Addiction Center there .
“ Before we make them available by prescription , there needs to be compelling evidence that they ’re unique and that a large population would derive substantial benefit . ”
Eventually , though , this research may lead to more precisely targeted therapeutics for the disorders psychedelics seem to help , such as OCD and other compulsive ills , like bulimia and anorexia .
In animal studies , repeated dosages of psilocybin diminish the number of 2A serotonin receptors , which dampens their expression .
This is a process known as downregulation .
“ We suspect that physiologically , this is what happened in the OCD study — that psilocybin downregulates the activity of these receptors , ” says Franz X. Vollenweider , a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich , Switzerland , who conducted many of the imaging studies and has done psychedelic research for more than a decade .
“ We ’ve done a lot of basic research , ” he adds .
“ Now we want to use the tools we ’ve developed to see what is going on in real patients .
If we could convincingly demonstrate hallucinogens alter these receptors , then we can find other compounds that have similar mechanisms but are less frightening . ”
Will these studies finally open the door to acceptance ?
David Nichols says psychedelics researchers keep a low profile “ because everyone lives in fear that some administrator will kill their project . ”
Roland Griffiths of Johns Hopkins , for example , who has been doing pharmacological research for more than three decades , never had a project scrutinized as thoroughly by his institution ’s review board and the FDA as his 2006 psilocybin study was .
Throughout the study he worried that negative publicity might halt the research .
Charles Grob is more hopeful .
“ Sure , it ’s been Sisyphean because of the cultural stigmas , and it has taken years to go even little baby steps , ” he says .
“ But people are making dramatic progress working with the hardest cases .
We ’re on the threshold of opening up an exciting new field . ”
The entire courtroom was sent to the cells during a domestic violence hearing when the judge , Robert Restaino , 48 , " snapped " and - according to a review of his actions - " engaged in what can only be described as two hours of inexplicable madness " .
The State Commission on Judicial Conduct recommended his removal from the bench , saying Restaino acted " without any semblance of a lawful basis " and behaved like a " petty tyrant " .
The bizarre episode began on March 11 2005 , when the judge was presiding at Niagara Falls City court over a slate of domestic violence cases .
A mobile phone rang and , furious at the intrusion , Restaino demanded to be told who owned it .
" Every single person is gong to jail in this courtroom unless I get that instrument now , " he said .
" If anybody believes I 'm kidding , ask some of the folks that have been here for a while .
You are all going . "
A security officer was posted at the door while other officers tried to find the phone , but failed .
Finally , the judge scrapped plans to release the defendant in the dock and set bail for all 46 people present at $ 1,500 ( £ 750 ) .
One man , according to the report , told the judge : " This is not fair to the rest of us . "
To which the judge replied : " I know it is n't . "
Everyone in the courtroom was a defendant , attending court as part of a programme in which domestic violence offenders agree to undergo drug testing and counselling , instead of jail time .
Participants make weekly appearances in court to have their progress monitored and are usually released after each appearance unless they have violated the programme 's terms .
All the defendants were taken to the city jail .
Fourteen people who could not raise their bail money were shackled and bussed to the county jail .
After receiving inquiries from the local media , the judge ordered their release in the late afternoon .
Restaino , who has worked as a full - time judge since 2002 , told the commission he had known that he had no legal basis for his actions and that they had been " improper and inexcusable " .
He told the panel he had been under stress in his personal life at the time of the incident .
In the state commission 's ruling yesterday , its administrator Robert Tembeckjian said : " The fundamental rights of 46 people were deliberately and methodically violated . "
Restaino now has 30 days to appeal the commission 's decision .
His lawyer told the Associated Press he plans to do so .
During an appeal he would remain in office .
Kristol : McCain may pick Lieberman as running mate David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday May 21 , 2008

Print This Email This Neocon commentator Bill Kristol told the hosts of Fox & Friends on Wednesday that Sen. John McCain 's vice - presidential pick could be a significant factor in the campaign .
" It 's going to be a tough year for Republicans , " Kristol stated .
" He 's got to run a bold and strong campaign , make an interesting VP pick . "
" After seeing Joe Lieberman 's speech Sunday night , I really wonder whether he will pick Joe Lieberman , " continued Kristol .
" Joe Lieberman or Bobby Jindal , the governor of Louisiana .
Either a Democrat or a young guy . "
Kristol has been pushing the idea of a McCain - Lieberman ticket for some time .
He told a conservative Jewish audience in February that Lieberman " was McCain 's preferred running mate , " and in March , Kristol suggested , " Perhaps the most obvious way McCain could upend the normal dynamics of this years election would be a bold vice presidential choice .
He could pick a hawkish and principled Democrat like Joe Lieberman . "
Recently , Lieberman 's name has appeared less often in vice - presidential speculations .
Two weeks ago , Kristol wrote that " in separate conversations last week , no fewer than four McCain staffers and advisers mentioned as a possible vice - presidential pick the 36 - year - old Louisiana governor , Bobby Jindal .
They re tempted by the idea of picking someone so young , with real accomplishments and a strong reformist streak . "
However , in a recent Wall Street Journal op - ed , adapted from the speech to which Kristol referred , Lieberman strongly criticized the Democratic Party for not having " embrace [d ] the basic framework the president had advanced for the war on terror as our own . "
" Sen. Obama stands in stark contrast to John McCain , who has shown the political courage throughout his career to do what he thinks is right  regardless of its popularity in his party or outside it , " Lieberman wrote .
" John also understands something else that too many Democrats seem to have become confused about lately  the difference between America 's friends and America 's enemies . "

US Media Trivializes Campaign 2008
Every four years , during U.S. presidential elections , the same thing happens , except it ’s always a little bit different .
Bookmark
Digg Email

Some clever political operative injects “ oppo ” into the campaign – some little “ scandal ” that supposedly speaks to the “ character ” of a candidate – and the press corps obsesses on this marginal issue nearly to the exclusion of all substantive matters .
This all - consuming event distorts the campaign , turning the targeted candidate into a laughingstock or someone who is n’t quite American enough .
Pundits pile on with criticism that the guy should have reacted faster or slower or answered this way or that .
Millions of voters become convinced , amid this intense negativity , that they simply can’t vote for this loser and the outcome of the election changes .
Then , in the election aftermath , the American press corps goes through a period of self - reflection ; some excellence - in - journalism group issues a scathing report about the superficiality of the news coverage ; political journalists vow that in the next election they wo n’t get suckered again .
Then , the process – which dates back at least to 1988 and Lee Atwater ’s savaging of Michael Dukakis – begins anew , albeit always with some slightly new twist .
All this might be quite funny if one does n’t consider the consequences for the Republic .
When historians try to figure out how the most powerful nation on earth managed to end up under the control of someone as unfit as George W. Bush for eight years , they will have to take note of this media phenomenon .
In 2000 , Al Gore was transformed from a thoughtful , even far - sighted government official into a delusional braggart who claimed “ I invented the Internet ” ( though he really did n’t say that ) , a traitor who sold nuclear secrets to China ( though he did n’t ) , and a phony who wore earth - tone sweaters and cowboy boots .
John Kerry also had many strong points – as a genuine Vietnam War hero ( a decorated Swiftboat captain in the Mekong Delta ) and a gutsy investigator ( Nicaraguan contra drug trafficking and BCCI ) – but saw his war heroism smeared by the misnamed Swiftboat Veterans for Truth and his Americanism mocked because he “ looked French . ”
At key moments in these campaigns , the press let the “ oppo ” define Bush ’s opponents and thus millions of Americans went to the polls believing fiction was truth , up was down .
( For details , see Neck Deep : The Disastrous Presidency of George W. Bush . )
Going to Be Different
In 2008 , however , the conventional wisdom was that the pattern would be different .
America could no longer afford the silliness – with the United States bogged down in two wars ( Iraq and Afghanistan ) , with the dollar sinking and the federal debt rising , with global warming requiring urgent attention and gas prices soaring , with America ’s image in the world shattered by Bush ’s policies of preemptive wars and torture .
This time , the campaign press corps would keep its focus on what really mattered .
Or at least , it would not wander too far off course .
But it did n’t turn out that way .
With Hillary Clinton ’s campaign playing the “ oppo ” role filled before by Republican operatives like the late Lee Atwater and Karl Rove , the attacks on Barack Obama ’s “ character ” gradually took hold .
Especially , during the six - week lull before the key Pennsylvania primary , the American people got a steady dose of this “ oppo , ” especially the guilt by association that sought to define Obama by the comments of his former pastor Jeremiah Wright and by his tenuous connection to Vietnam War-era radical William Ayers .
There also was the furor over the fact that Obama often did n’t wear an American flag lapel pin ( though Hillary Clinton and John McCain did n’t either ) .
One might have thought the obsession with Wright and with the lesser themes of Ayers and the flag pin would have soon disappeared as just little blips on the campaign ’s radar , but that would have required the exercise of some judgment and self - control by prominent national journalists .
Instead , the old pattern reasserted itself .
So , on April 16 in the first prime - time debate on a major network , ABC News moderators George Stephanopoulos and Charles Gibson hammered away at these “ oppo ” themes for nearly the first half of the debate : Wright , Ayers , flag pins .
By the time many Americans had given up or flipped the channel to Fox ’s “ American Idol , ” they had n’t heard a single question about issues that affect them directly .
Though Obama appeared damaged by the pounding , ABC also got roughed up by critics of the debate , which was denounced as the most disgraceful debate ever .
Another Chance So , on May 4 , the Sunday before another important round of primaries , one might have expected something better or at least different when NBC News Washington bureau chief Tim Russert interviewed Obama for a full hour .
But that ’s not how this process works .
Russert opened up “ Meet the Press ” with a steady barrage of questions about Rev. Wright – a dozen all told – most of which had been thoroughly plowed previously .
Russert : “ What has the controversy over Reverend Jeremiah Wright done to your campaign ? ” “ You 're still a member of the church ? ” “ Why do you think he re-emerged ? ” “ What did you learn [ about Wright ] in those [ past ] five weeks that you did n't know in March ? ”
“ The critics have said he [ Wright ] can attack the United States of America , he can do all sorts of things that divide the country , but only when he made it politically uncomfortable for you did you finally separate himself [ sic ] from him . ”
“ Reverend Wright was going to give the invocation [ at Obama ’s campaign launch ] , he was disinvited . …
So you knew in ' 07 , this guy 's a problem . ”
“ Why did n't you just say then , ‘ You know , Reverend , we 're going on different paths because this country does not believe in white supremacy and black inferiority ’ ” ?
“ He said in a letter to The New York Times , he suggested that you apologized for not letting him do the invocation .
Is that true ? ” “ Is it fair for people to raise questions about your judgment for misjudging Reverend Wright ? ” “ You 're done with him ? ” “ If you 're elected president , you wo n't seek his counsel ? ”
“ Could you have handled this better , differently , by severing your ties earlier ? ”
“ What 's the most important thing you 've learned from this ? ”
Russert then pivoted into a reprise of Obama ’s supposed lack of patriotism , mentioning Wright ’s comment , “ God damn America , ” and the criticism of Obama for not wearing a flag pin – with the question framed as a question from Democratic superdelegates about Obama .
Russert : " How is he going to defend or define his patriotism ? "
Serious Issues
It was almost halfway through the program before Russert touched on a question that actually related to the lives of Americans , a question about whether or not the government should suspend the gas tax for the summer driving months .
Russert : “ Why are you against giving taxpayers in Indiana , North Carolina , a relief from federal gasoline tax this summer ? ”
Only in the second half of the hour did the interview address some substantive questions about U.S. policy in the Middle East , before Russert ended the interview with a flurry of questions about what might happen in the campaign depending on the outcomes in Indiana and North Carolina .
Given the amount of time devoted to Rev. Wright and political tactics , what was striking was what was n't discussed .
Russert did n’t ask a single question about President Bush ’s policies on torture , his stretching of his constitutional authority as the “ unitary executive , ” the sub - prime mortgage crisis , the possible recession , the declining dollar , the federal budget deficit or a host of other important issues .
Since Russert is an icon to many Washington journalists , he was spared the kind of criticism that Stephanopoulos and Gibson encountered after the April 16 debate .
But Russert ’s obsession with political trivia was arguably worse than theirs .
When the post mortems on Campaign 2008 are written , Obama – like Dukakis , Gore and Kerry before him – will be faulted for failing to figure a way out of the “ oppo ” trap .
But the bigger question confronting the American people will be how they can escape this recurring nightmare of a silly news media trivializing and distorting the selection of the President .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A Miami jury has awarded almost $ 253 million in a wrongful death case against Cuba , the biggest such penalty to date against the communist government , local media reported on Saturday .
The Miami Herald said the Miami - Dade circuit court jury delivered its verdict on Friday after a civil trial that began on Wednesday .
The decision was not available on the court ’s Web site on Saturday .
The Cuban government chose not to be represented in the courtroom , the Miami Herald said .
The case involved Rafael del Pino Siero , a U.S. citizen who was a friend of Fidel Castro but turned against him after the bearded revolutionary took power in 1959 , the Herald said .
It said Del Pino Siero , who broke with Castro over suspicions he was a communist , was captured while trying to help a Cuban escape to Miami in July 1959 .
He died in his Cuban prison cell 18 years later at age 51 , leaving behind in Miami two children , Rafael del Pino Jr. and his sister Milagros Suarez .
The jury award for Del Pino Jr. and Suarez was the largest such award handed down in the United States against Cuba since a court awarded $ 188 million to the relatives of three people killed when two Brothers to the Rescue airplanes were shot down in 1996 by a Cuban fighter .
The del Pino relatives are unlikely to be able to actually get their hands on much money as Cuban assets frozen in the United States have dwindled to almost nothing .
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton unveiled new negative television ads and attacked each other personally from the stump this weekend ahead of Tuesday 's Pennsylvania primary , stoking more worries among Democrats that the party 's eventual nominee will head into the general election badly damaged .
The rising vitriol is prompting more Democrats to demand that party leaders do something to end the battle .
But no single leader or clique exists within the fractious party to end the fight , and those with influence insist voters must ...

Most people have come to know the time that John Lennon and I spent together as The Lost Weekend .
I am always surprised by how many people are under the impression that our time together lasted only a single weekend .
John and I were together " officially " for 18 months , but our relationship actually spanned ten years - from December 1970 to December 1980 .
My association with the Lennons began as a working relationship .
For three years , I had a dream job : personal assistant and production co-ordinator for John and Yoko .
Scroll down for more ...
A typical day would consist of the mundane ( such as brewing the morning coffee ) , to calling the likes of Jackie Onassis or Andy Warhol , to co-ordinating recording sessions .
Each day would hold a surprise .
But the biggest surprise of all came in the summer of 1973 as I was organising media coverage for Yoko 's new album Feeling The Space and sessions for John 's upcoming album Mind Games .
One morning , Yoko came to my office in their apartment at the Dakota building , New York , and told me that she and John were not " getting along " , which was n't exactly surprising news to those of us who worked alongside them .
Yoko said John would start seeing someone new and she wanted it to be " someone who would treat John well " .
I now sensed a bombshell coming .
I was thinking : " If they split , who will I be working for ? "
Yoko continued : " You do n't have a boyfriend . "
I dropped my pad and pen .
Did I just hear right ?
I assured her I was n't interested in John , if that 's what she was thinking , but Yoko did n't stop there : " I think you should go out with him . "
Scroll down for more ...
I was dumbfounded and kept telling her no , but apparently her mind was made up .
" If John asks you out , you should go ! "
Yoko announced , making it sound a little stronger than a suggestion .
For the next two weeks , all was quiet .
Recording was put on hold and I assumed John and Yoko had worked out their differences .
When John resumed recording Mind Games , I prepared to accompany him to the studio .
The moment we got into the lift at the Dakota , my world changed .
John grabbed me and kissed me and said : " I 've been waiting to do that all f****** day . "
As we drove to the studio , I sat in silence while John kept assuring me that " it 's OK , do n't be frightened , everything will be all right " .
After the recording session , John told me he was coming home with me .
I just could n't deal with it , so I ordered the car to take him to the Dakota .
After a couple of nights of trying to come home with me and getting rebuffed , he sent the car away during a session without my knowledge .
Scroll down for more ...
" We 're getting a cab and I 'm coming home with you , " he declared .
I was n't going to argue on the streets of New York at 2 am .
And so our relationship began .
Shortly after Mind Games was completed , Yoko flew to Chicago for a feminist seminar .
On the spur of the moment John decided we should go to Los Angeles with his lawyer , Harold Seider .
I hardly had time to pack and tell my mother .
I threw a few things together and grabbed my Nikkormat 35 mm camera .
John later bought me a new Polaroid SX - 70 for my birthday ( as well as my first cool car , a 1968 Barracuda ) .
In LA , we saw old friends and made new ones .
We also began taking road trips because John wanted to experience America .
He encouraged me to capture our times together .
Photography had always been a hobby for me , so this was natural .
He " really liked my eye for taking pictures " and felt I captured him in ways that no one else had because of his comfort level with me .
Of course , I was flattered .

In those days , nobody thought of taking photos all the time - we always thought there would be tomorrow .
Many of what are now considered historic events , such as John and Paul McCartney 's only jam session after The Beatles split up , were n't photographed .
I 'm surprised I captured as many moments as I did .
There were times I was a bit reticent in taking out my camera , particularly when friends stopped by .
I did n't want to intrude on these moments , but John insisted .
For years , only my closest friends got to see these photos , which I kept in a shoe box in my closet .
They were surprised these images did not convey the John portrayed in the Press during our time together .
In fact , the photos showed a side of John seldom seen .
Every photograph holds a special memory for me , especially the ones I took of John with his then ten - year - old son , Julian .
When John laid eyes on him for the first time in four years , he was shocked to see " a little man " and not the small child he remembered .

They spent a lot of time getting reacquainted as father and son , playing the guitar and making music .
They were both good swimmers , which I was not , enabling me to capture some rare moments of togetherness .
As I started going through my photos , memories of our time together came back , opening up a floodgate of emotions - from happiness to sadness and back to happiness .
The best part is that I feel these images bring John back to life .
Here , I share with you John Lennon . . . through my eyes .
THE BEACH HOUSE
Although some people are under the impression that John and I spent our entire year - and - a - half together in LA , we spent only about seven months there , from September 1973 , with many long breaks back in New York .
The most infamous place we called home in LA was a rented beach house in Santa Monica .
It was built by film producer Louis B. Mayer , was quite " Hollywood " in design and had been a hotspot for movie royalty .

It was later owned by the actor Peter Lawford , who continued the tradition by hosting fellow Hollywood luminaries as well as his brothers - in - law , John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy , on many occasions .
Allegedly , Marilyn Monroe had been a frequent visitor , which greatly piqued John 's interest .
When John decided to produce Harry Nilsson 's Pussy Cats album , he thought it would be a great idea to have everyone who was working on it living under one roof .
John and I took the master bedroom .
When we first saw it , he said : " So , this is where they did it , " referring to John F. Kennedy and Monroe .
The other five bedrooms were occupied by Keith Moon , Harry , Hilary Gerrard [ Ringo Starr 's business manager ] and Klaus Voormann , the artist who had designed the cover for The Beatles ' album Revolver .
The library , complete with official portrait of President Kennedy on the wall , was converted into a bedroom for Ringo .
Although we could still see remnants of the home 's historic splendour , the new owners obviously did n't feel the need to preserve the original decor .
They had sealed up the huge projection screen installed by Mayer and covered expensive parquet floors with a hideous Seventies shag carpet .

IN THE DESERT
In early October 1973 , John and I went to Las Vegas for a few days .
We flew there from Los Angeles on a shuttle booked by our friend Elliot Mintz , who came with us .
Our seats were in the middle of the aircraft .
Everybody was going nuts over John , who looked at Elliot and said : " Why are we back here in the middle of all this ? "
When Elliot explained there was no first - class section , John snapped : " Please think before putting me in this situation again ! "
Once we'd had enough of Vegas , we drove back to LA .
On the way , we came across an abandoned mining town called Calico , a real slice of Americana , right out of a history book or a Western .
In my pictures of John in Calico , you can see embroidery on his jeans - that 's because they were mine .
One morning , John woke me up by saying : " I 'm wearing your jeans ! "
" So I see , " I said .
" Why ? "
" Because they fit .
I love them ! "
He never gave them back .
I thought it wise to remove the butterflies and flowers I had sewn on them - remember , this was the Seventies .
As we wandered around Calico , John kept eyeing a Harley trike , so finally I said : " Just go over to it and I 'll take a picture . "
I took only a single shot which , fortunately , came out pretty well .
After I took the photo , John joked in a Bogey - esque drawl : " Hop on , kid , let 's blow this joint . "

MAJOR AND MINOR
One day while John was recording , the studio receptionist brought in a litter of kittens .
John knew what I was thinking .
" No , we can't , we 're travelling too much , " he said .
I picked up a black one and put him over my shoulder .
John rolled his eyes and said : " Now you 've done it ! " I had a moment of doubt but when John came over , he started stroking the kitten and said : " Well , I guess we have to have a cat . "
At the end of the day when we were leaving the studio , John asked if there were any left .
Only one remained - a white one that no one wanted because she was so loud - so we took them both home .
John called them Major and Minor and said they reminded him of his days with Aunt Mimi , whom he playfully referred to as the Cat Woman .
FULL ENGLISH BREAKFAST
John had a voracious appetite .
We had a tradition every Sunday : at 11 am I 'd fetch the New York Times , some of the British papers , and coffee ( John gave up tea in America because it was decidedly British ) .
I would then make a big English breakfast of bacon and eggs , beans , toast , tomatoes , chips and sometimes black pudding , after I discovered a local Irish butcher who sold it .
I did n't know how to cook it at first , so I asked John , who said : " Just fry it up . "
The pudding really made the kitchen stink but he loved it .
John also loved Chinese food , especially my mum's .
When we were home in New York , she would bring over her speciality : fried rice and spare ribs .
As unconventional as John was , he was also old - fashioned .
Because of the nature of our relationship , John felt uneasy and never met my mum , which he later regretted .
He would hide behind the door until she left .
THE FINAL CONTRACT
At the end of 1974 , after three years of court battles and acrimony , the final dissolution of The Beatles was about to happen .
The meeting was scheduled for December 19 at New York 's Plaza Hotel - ironically , this was the first place the group stayed in America in 1964 .
George Harrison was in New York on his Dark Horse tour .
Paul and Linda McCartney came in , and of course John and I were already in the city .
Only Ringo was missing , but he had signed the documents in England .
Julian was with us for the Christmas holiday and all was calm , all was bright .
John was even planning to join George on stage during his concert at Madison Square Garden .
Gathered around a huge table were George , his lawyer and business manager ; the McCartneys , with Paul 's in - laws and lawyers ; Ringo 's lawyer and business manager ; Neil Aspinall , of Apple , with two sets of company lawyers ( one for America and one for Britain ) ; and John 's lawyer Harold Seider and his team .
Harold told me that after a while , George said out loud what everyone was thinking : " Where 's John ? "
" Good question , " replied Harold .
Harold left the room to call John , who would n't come to the phone .
I was with John and it was up to me to tell Harold he had decided not to attend the meeting .
Although John was concerned with shouldering a major tax burden because he lived in the United States , I could sense there was a bit more on his mind .
His official reason for not showing was ' the stars are n't right ' .
George , already in a dour mood because his tour was getting poor reviews , went ballistic .
He started yelling at Harold , as did all the other lawyers in the room .
Then George picked up the phone and called John .
I answered and asked if he wanted John , but he barked , " No !
Just tell him whatever his problem is , I started this tour on my own and I 'll end it on my own ! " before slamming down the receiver .
John was listening over my shoulder .
George 's rage did n't last long .
Julian went to George 's concert the next day and returned home with a message saying : " All 's forgiven , George loves you and he wants you to come to his party tonight . "
We did go to the party at the Hippopotamus Club , where George , John , and Paul all hugged .
John , Julian and I left New York the following day to spend Christmas in Florida .
On December 29 , 1974 , the voluminous documents were brought down to John in Florida by one of Apple 's lawyers .
" Take out your camera , " he joked to me .
Then he called Harold to go over some final points .
When John hung up the phone , he looked wistfully out the window .
I could almost see him replaying the entire Beatles experience in his mind .
He finally picked up his pen and , in the unlikely backdrop of the Polynesian Village Hotel at Disney World , ended the greatest rock ' n ' roll band in history by simply scrawling John Lennon at the bottom of the page .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- U.S. investigators are looking into accusations that a company hired by the U.S. military supplied corroded and decades - old Chinese ammunition to the Afghan Army and police .
Efraim Diveroli , 22 , is president of AEY Inc. , an arms dealer suspended by the Defense Department .
The U.S. government has suspended AEY Inc. of Miami , Florida , for violating its contract , according to U.S. Army documents obtained by CNN .
The Army and House Oversight Committee identified the president of AEY Inc. as Efraim E. Diveroli .
He is a 22 - year - old whose father started the company as a small printing company , according to WFOR - TV , a CNN affiliate in Miami .
Watch father describe ' boy genius ' »
The government is conducting a criminal investigation into allegations that AEY Inc. knowingly misrepresented what the company would provide the Afghan security forces .
Under the contract , AEY said it would supply ammunition manufactured in Hungary .
But an investigation by the Army found most of the bullets were made in China , a violation of the contract , according to the Army documents .
U.S. regulations bar companies from purchasing weapons or ammunition from a Chinese military company directly or indirectly , according to U.S. military officials .
U.S. government investigators took numerous photographs of the ammunition showing that it was improperly packaged and corroding , according to the Army documents .
The Department of the Army , the contracting authority for the government , sent a letter to Diveroli on Wednesday informing him that he and his company were suspended from contracting with the U.S. government until the investigation is complete .
The Army documents show that since 2004 the company entered agreements with the U.S. government that totaled about $ 10 million .
The papers also reveal the company struck it big in 2007 with contracts totaling more than $ 200 million to supply ammunition , assault rifles and other weapons to the Afghan National Army and Police .
When that ammunition arrived in Afghanistan , U.S. officials were contacted because of its unsatisfactory condition .
Army criminal investigators were sent to look at the packages in January .
They took hundreds of pictures showing ammunition dumped in deteriorated and broken cardboard boxes and wrapped in plastic , according to the Army documents .
The documents also reveal ammunition was corroded and made in China from 1962 through 1974 .
According to U.S. government regulations , the alleged misrepresentation by AEY could bring a fine , five years imprisonment or both .
Additionally , if AEY is found in violation of the contract the company will be permanently barred from doing business with the U.S. government .
The House Oversight Committee plans to hold a hearing into the matter on April 17 .
" The hearing will examine the company 's financial history , past performance and compliance with U.S. law and government contracting regulations , " the committee said in a statement late Thursday .
The hearing also will examine " the federal government 's efforts to investigate allegations that AEY may have violated U.S. law and government contracting regulations , " the committee said .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Just when you thought energy companies could n't get any richer , they may get another boost from an overhaul in the way they report their oil and gas reserves .
The rules , undergoing their first revision in 25 years , could add billions of dollars ' worth of untapped fossil fuels to their official regulatory filings in the not - too - distant future .
One change being considered would allow oil giant Chevron CVX , - 2.74 % to more formally disclose its roughly 436 million barrels of crude trapped in oil sands in Canada -- a massive trove of petroleum potentially worth $ 40 billion or more under today 's record - high crude prices .
While Chevron openly mentions the oil sands in presentations to Wall Street , it takes a meticulous search of the company 's corporate filings to find specific figures attached to them .
Why ?
Partly because oil sands are still officially classified as mineral assets , even though oil companies are rapidly stepping up the volume of crude they squeeze from the oil - laden sands of Alberta , Canada .
That classification may soon change , however , as the industry , joined by the Securities and Exchange Commission , Wall Street firms , trade associations and accounting specialists , inches closer to completing a far - reaching update of the way it tallies precious fossil fuel resources .
The stakes have never been higher , as oil prices continue to hit new highs , world demand increases and petroleum resources grow more expensive to find and develop .
For oil and gas companies , reserves accounting is comparable to bank deposits , though far trickier to prove .
Meanwhile , investors keep a close eye on whether companies manage to fully replace the reserves pumped out of the ground each year .
Stocks have been known to plunge if a company misstates its reserves .
David Hobbs , head of research for Cambridge Energy Research Associates -- the consulting firm that has taken a lead in making the case for the overhaul -- said the new rules wo n't likely result in any huge new caches of fossil fuel coming to light since the oil majors already talk about significant resources that fall outside the scope of their formal disclosures .
But the update could result in a more level playing field by acknowledging progress the industry has made identifying reserves through better seismic readings and other technological advances .
" Updated rules ... would allow energy companies to recognize reserves earlier in the life cycle of the asset , " Hobbs said .
" That is what will be of interest to investors and companies raising money alike .
And it will also allow a better apples - to - apples comparison of people 's disclosures . "
Deutsche Bank Analyst Paul Sankey said the stock market already includes oil sands and other resources in its valuation of Chevron and other companies , but the SEC rules need to catch up .
" The oil and gas industry has already moved on , " he said .
" The changes amount to a reclassification , but to the average person on the street , it wo n't mean much .
There 's not a lot of controversy that some kind of update is needed . "
Still , oil and gas players are scrambling to take part in the effort , with nearly all of the 70 players that posted official comments on the SEC's Web site favoring an update of the regulations , which have n't been changed since 1982 .
Since then , the industry has made huge strides in its ability to map and measure underground reserves and bring them to the surface .
Deepwater exploration and enhanced production technology , including directional drilling and the injection of steam or gas into reservoirs to coax more oil to the surface are among the industry 's bigger recent accomplishments .
At the same time , reserves once considered too costly to extract are financially viable with oil now fetching $ 110 a barrel .
Changing with the times
" In the decades that have passed since the adoption of these rules , there have been significant changes in the oil and gas industry , " the SEC said in its concept release on the topic .
" Some commentators have expressed concern that the commission 's rules have not adapted to current practices and may not provide investors with the most useful picture of oil and gas reserves public companies hold . "
Berne Mosley of the Federal Energy Regulatory Division said in a comment to the SEC that although about 15 % of U.S. natural gas production now comes from shale formations and coalbeds , both are excluded from the SEC 's classification of " proved reserves " -- an omission he argues should be rectified .
Deutsche Bank's Sankey said in a note to the SEC that an update to reserves accounting would improve comparability between companies with " relatively minor changes . "
But Andy Oram , senior credit officer at Moody's , urged caution in any changes to the rules , saying companies should n't get a big boost in their net worth as a result .
" Are valuations of oil and gas companies suffering because of the regulations ?
I do n't think so , " he said .
" Reserves are about capital per unit of production .
A company can triple its reserves , but it 's production that determines cash flow . "
Roots in 2004
Reserves reporting moved to the front burner in 2004 when Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A , - 1.68 % disclosed that an internal audit showed it had artificially pumped up its reserves by at least 20 % .
The news dealt a severe blow to its share price and left shareholders grumbling that they no longer had a true sense of the company 's worth .
During that time , Cambridge Energy Research Associates released a report titled " In Search of Reasonable Certainty " and submitted it to the SEC .
Gearing up its efforts last fall , the SEC appointed W. John Lee , an Academic Petroleum Engineering Fellow , head of the commission reviewing the reserves rules .
His term ends this August .
Lee , a petroleum engineer at Texas A&M University , specializes in unconventional resources , reservoir management and gas reservoir engineering .
He declined an interview for this story .
SEC spokesman John Nestor said no formal action has been scheduled on the reserves rules by the full commission .
The SEC's John White , director of the division of corporation finance , tapped Lee to help the agency assess " new technologies that companies use to evaluate current , and identify new , reserves " through a recommendation to the commission , the SEC said in October .
Joining the industry chorus for the update : Cambridge Energy Research Associates , the Society of Petroleum Engineers , and the American Petroleum Institute .
Other government agencies have also voiced support for changes , including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy 's Energy Information Administration .
Independent auditors , credit ratings agencies , and oil and gas groups also weighed in by a Feb. 15 deadline to comment on the SEC 's concept release , which solicits opinions and views from experts and the public on possible regulatory actions .
Producers also weighed in , including Apache Corp. APA , - 7.10 % , EnCana ECA , +3.44 % , Exxon Mobil XOM , - 2.91 % , Total SA TOT , - 1.36 % , BHP Billiton Petroleum BHP , - 2.16 % and Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A , - 1.68 % .
Reserves and resources
For now , oil companies lump their fossil fuel reserves into to groups : conventional and unconventional .
Energy that fits the traditional guideline -- crude oil or natural gas -- is classified as " reserves " ; everything else falls under the banner of " resources . "
For examples , ConocoPhillips COP , - 3.70 % on March 12 disclosed existing resources with an energy content equivalent to 50 billion barrels of oil , while its reserves came in at 10.6 billion barrels .
During Chevron 's presentation to Wall Street last month , one analyst asked about the impact of the company 's 20 % interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Alberta , Canada , which ranks as one of the largest development projects on the planet , and whether a rule change would boost its official reserve figures .
George Kirkland , executive vice president of Chevron 's global upstream and gas division , said Chevron would get a " substantial bump " in reserves if allowed to include the Athabasca Oil Sands .
" We have got the base business , the first development , and we have got Expansion 1 , so both of those would become reserves from that sense , " he said .
Chevron CEO
Dave O'Reilly said the company is glad the SEC looking into it .
" There are some changes , but we do n't see the changes being radical , " O'Reilly said .
" I mean , the issue for us is we have this opportunity to move a lot of resources into proven reserves by current definition ...
" Obviously , the big projects that we have in our queue help us a lot , but we are also -- getting these projects where we have already booked some reserves , but have not yet booked most of the reserves on line , so we can demonstrate them I think is very important . "

A large majority of Muslim - Americans voted for George W Bush on the road to the White House eight years ago .
Community leader Khalid Samad is campaigning for Mr Obama
Among them are the 60,000 Muslims of the economically depressed Cleveland area .
They are mostly middle - class naturalised citizens , disappointed with the Bush administration 's record and with a powerful sense that their religion has been misrepresented in the years since 9/11 .
The city boasts
Ohio 's largest mosque , based around a large prayer hall that would sit comfortably in the capitals of the Middle East .
A group of men from the mosque , led by the centre 's president , Faud Hamed , spoke to BBC News after evening prayers .
There was exasperation at the on - going war , and a sense that social justice - a central tenet of Islam - is being ignored : " We all know that in the US Constitution it calls for peace and justice , but if we look around the world do we see any peace and justice ? "
I 'd vote for Obama - he has some new ideas
Mohammad Assar
Shiite Unity Center
Uneasy about being publicly critical , most asked not to be identified .
" We are sometimes given the short end of the stick but in general we 're treated fairly ...
I agree with the brothers [ that ] if you look at the cost of the war in Iraq so far , how much of these billions could have saved lives in the US alone , " said one .
Further out , in the Cleveland suburbs , lies the Shiite Unity Center , a building that until a few years ago was a Christian church , complete with a wooden spire .
" Republicans think there are more votes from other sources , so they forget and ignore , " said one of the Mosque 's leaders , Mohammad Assar , a placard - carrying Bush supporter in the past .
" I 'd vote for Obama .
He has some new ideas . "
Identity politics
The fact that Mr Obama has Muslim roots on his Kenyan father 's side , despite being a committed Christian , clearly makes him the most intriguing candidate for many here - though maybe less so for second - generation immigrants .
Mohamed Farukhi , who runs a multi-million - dollar electronics business , says Mr Obama may be his choice this time round , but hopes that his son's generation will be able to escape identity - politics altogether .
When you 're making prayer , regardless of whether you 're a doctor , lawyer , multi-millionaire or king , you 've got to stand shoulder - to - shoulder
Khalid Samad
Youth leader
" Most of the Muslims in America have become independents now , which in a sense is probably better for them because they need to get more active in politics , " he says .
The unifying nature of Islamic values is well - illustrated in Cleveland by the close ties that exist between upwardly mobile immigrants and the self - described indigenous Muslim converts .
" When you 're making prayer , regardless of whether you 're a doctor , lawyer , multi-millionaire or king , you 've got to stand shoulder - to - shoulder , " says Khalid Samad , an African - American Muslim convert , who works with inner-city youths .
He does acknowledge , however , that the historical concerns of Muslim African - Americans are different from , say , a newly - arrived doctor from Pakistan .
Mr Samad is actively campaigning for Barack Obama , and trying to bring minority groups together , including the local Latino voting bloc .
' Media demonisation '
Building common - cause coalitions is one of the ways that Muslim activists believe they can make their votes - and their issues - count more .
That is certainly the view of another convert , who is playing a central role in educating Cleveland 's Muslim population about the voting process .
Julia Shearson 's ancestors may have arrived in the first wave of English settlers to America , but now she is dressed like millions of other Muslim women around the world , and running the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) office in the city .
She is well aware of CAIR 's role as a lightning rod for criticism from right - wing advocacy groups who regard it as a cloak for so - called Islamofacism .
Julie Shearson thinks Islamophobia is a daily threat for US Muslims
She rejects the conspiracy theories completely , but contends that Islamophobia - stoked by media demonisation - is a daily threat to all American Muslims .
" We should be drafted as advisors and policy experts , as people who can help understand and help mediate this horrible crisis between America and the Muslim world , " she said .
" Exactly when our help could be most utilised , we 've been effectively marginalised and stymied and stifled ...
But at the same time it will never work .
A people can never be kept down . "
CAIR is not endorsing specific candidates , but she sees the move towards Mr Obama , by the young in particular , as part of a wider awakening .
" What we see happening in the Muslim community is that our young people who before used to go into medicine - their parents are now saying , we have enough doctors - they 're all going into journalism , political science , and law . "
" It 's wonderful to see them really stand up and try and protect their families from these horrible civil rights abuses . "
SHANGHAI ( Reuters ) - La Compagnie Financiere Edmond de Rothschild Banque plans to buy a 15 percent stake in Chinese fund house Zhonghai Fund Management
Co for more than 100 million yuan ( $ 14 million ) , two sources close to the negotiations said on Tuesday .
The deal , part of the French boutique bank ’s strategy to expand in Asia ’s fast - growing wealth management markets , follows more than a year of talks with several Chinese shareholders on a possible stake purchase , the sources said .
If the deal is completed , LCF Edmond de Rothschild will become the first foreign private bank to hold a stake in a mutual fund manager in China , where more than 30 Sino - foreign fund ventures have already been established .
An investment arm of state - owned Yunnan Tobacco , which owns 15.385 percent of Shanghai - based Zhonghai Fund , recently agreed to sell its stake to LCF Edmond de Rothschild , although no legally binding documents have yet been signed and the deal is still subject to Chinese regulatory approvals , the sources said .
The Yunnan Tobacco unit is a founding shareholder of Zhonghai Fund , which has about 30 billion yuan of assets under management , and paid about 20 million yuan for its stake in early 2004 , the sources said .
“ Obviously , it ’s not a cheap deal , although Rothschild is very keen to expand in China ’s wealth management market , ” said one of the sources .
They declined to be identified before an official announcement is made , while senior executives at Zhonghai Fund declined to comment .
FINANCIAL INVESTOR
A representative for LCF Edmond de Rothschild , wholly owned by Baron Benjamin de Rothschild and his family and one of the oldest private banks in Europe , could not be immediately reached for comment .
Other shareholdings in Zhonghai Fund , including those of a unit of CNOOC Group , China ’s third - largest oil company , and Guolian Securities Co , would not be affected by the sale .
The CNOOC unit controls the fund house with a 46.923 percent stake , while Guolian Securities owns 37.692 percent .
Foreign banks such as HSBC Holdings Plc HSBA .
L0005.HK and JPMorgan JPM.N have also set up fund ventures in China , and about half of China 's 60 fund houses are joint ventures .
Many foreign firms , especially European and U.S. fund managers , seek to play an active role in management when they invest in Chinese fund houses , although government rules prevent overseas investors from owning a controlling stake .
The sources said LCF Edmond de Rothschild would be purely a financial investor in Zhonghai Fund with no right to appoint board members or senior executives at the firm .
Zhonghai Fund will tap LCF Edmond de Rothschild ’s expertise and networks when it launches fund products investing in overseas markets , especially European bond and stock markets , the sources said .
LCF Edmond de Rothschild operates a representative office in Shanghai and has a Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor license , which allows it to invest in Chinese capital markets , with an investment quota of $ 100 million .

Morning all , I have to admit it ’s a bit painful watching the Champions League semi-finals .
United were fairly rubbish against Barcelona last night but Barcelona were pure Arsenal at their worst .
Lots of nice passing with hardly a shot in anger .
And the Gods ignored my pleas so that if United were to get through to the final then at least Ronaldo would be suspended or something .
Pffff .
Tonight ’s it ’s the ‘ smashers v Cuntski .
I have to say from a news point of view Liverpool v United in Moscow could be fun , those KGB fuckers would have great fun when the two sets of fans started killing each other .
We shall see .
Arsene Wenger reckons losing the game at Old Trafford was the one that cost us the title .
He says :
I feel we were one game away in this championship .
If we win at Old Trafford , we are champions .
It ’s just one game , and in that game we were 1 - 0 up and we had two or three chances to score the second goal , so you cannot say we had a bad season .
I would have to disagree with the manager there .
I think it was three games that really cost us .
Birmingham away , Boro home , Wigan away .
Those three came as part of a sequence of four draws – the other was against Villa which , given their position in the league , you ca n’t say is a bad result .
With all due respect to those teams we should have won those games , not easily , but we should have won them .
Even losing to United and Chelsea if we ’d done that we ’d now be sitting two points clear at the top of the table .
I can see where the manager is coming from with his assertion , but even had we won at Old Trafford we ’d be two points clear of United but one behind Chelsea .
Emmanuel Adebayor has warned title rivals that we ’ll learn from this year and come back stronger next , saying :
This season we may end up with nothing , but it will not look the same this time next year .
That ’s the kind of spirit you need in the squad .
I ’ve said it before that often the pain of coming close and losing is as great a motivator as you ’ll get as a footballer .
There ’s no doubt this season will have hurt this squad , their pride will be dented and I suspect they wo n’t look back on the Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge results half as much as they will to the games at St Andrews and the JJB and the Boro game at home .
Hopefully lessons will be learned .
Speaking of Adebayor the boss says he scored twice as many goals as he expected him to this season .
Which must be a nice surprise .
He ’s challenged him to show a ‘ mark of class ’ by repeating it next season and frankly I ’m a little worried about how people will react if he does n’t .
Anyway , that ’s by the by .
You get the feeling Arsene thought that with the sale of Henry we ’d become less reliant on one player for our goals .
Maybe he thought they ’d be spread about more but with only Cesc really getting any from midfield and injuries to van Persie ( whose removal , no , not that kind of removal , against Derby was merely precautionary ) and Eduardo it meant the responsbility fell to the big man and for the most part he stepped up and took it .
Eduardo ’s injury was the real downer , I think .
He ’d just settled in , got used to the pace of the English game , and with 12 goals up to that horrible day had begun to start scoring regularly .
People were comparing him to Robbie Fowler and I sincerely believe that had he been fit he would have scored the goals which made the difference in the those drawn games .
He might have prevented the losses against United and Chelsea too .
So fuck you Martin Taylor , you big , clumsy cunt .
Lukasz Fabianksi says his goal for next season is to be Arsenal ’s number 1 .
The young Pole says :
I am not here just to be the second goalkeeper , I want to be the main goalkeeper .
Manuel and Jens are fine goalkeepers and we all get on well but I will be fighting to be ahead of them .
He ’s set to start the final league games of the season as the manager gets to look at him in a more pressured environment than the Carling Cup .
He was ok against Derby , I thought , made a couple of good saves but he needs to be more dominant and decisive in the area .
Let ’s see how he goes .
Today is the day that Arsene Wenger put a deadline on Mathieu Flamini ’s new deal .
There ’s a contract on the table from Arsenal and the manager says he still does n’t know if the player is leaving or not .
I do n’t think you need to be a genius to work out that if he was going to sign for us he ’d have done it by now .
With crazy Bosman money on offer elsewhere I think it ’s now safe to assume that he ’s going .
Which is a shame but there you go , we ’ll just have to find someone else to replace him .
Right , that ’s about it .
Do n’t forget the competition to win the classic 80s shirt from Toffs , the very difficult question is on yesterday ’s blog .
You have until midnight tonight to get your entry in and the two winners will be announced tomorrow .
Until then .
The ban will be implemented across London 's entire transport network Plans to ban the drinking of alcohol on London 's transport system have been unveiled by new mayor Boris Johnson .
He joined London 's transport commissioner Peter Hendy to set out a timeline for bringing in the measure .
The ban , starting on 1 June , on the Tube , buses , trams and Docklands Light Railway is one of his election pledges .
But the Rail Maritime and Transport Union said the policy appeared " not to have been thought through very well " and could make matters worse .
It is part of Mr Johnson 's wider strategy to tackle anti-social behaviour .
New posters were also unveiled advising passengers of the no-alcohol policy .
Serious crime
The mayor said : " I firmly believe that if we drive out so - called minor crime then we will be able to get a firm grip on more serious crime .
" That 's why from 1 June the drinking of alcohol will be banned from the Tube , tram , bus , and Docklands Light Railway . "
The ban on the London Overground will take longer , as Transport for London has to apply to the Department for Transport for permission to enforce the bar on the consumption of alcohol .
Don Shenker , chief executive of Alcohol Concern , said : " Public drinking and the behaviour sometimes associated with it can , and does , deeply affect people 's ability to enjoy public spaces .
Perhaps the mayor will come out with his underpants on over his trousers like Superman one Saturday to show us how it should be done , and maybe tell a crowd of Liverpool supporters that they can't drink on the train
RMT 's Bob Crow " Taking a firm approach to public drinking in this way sends a strong message that public drunkenness is socially unacceptable . "
But the Rail Maritime and Transport ( RMT ) Union 's leader Bob Crow said : " We are in favour of any measure that will make our members ' lives safer and curb anti-social behaviour , but it appears that this really has n't been thought through very well and could well make matters worse .
" We are being told that it will be our members who will have to approach people drinking and ask them to stop - but the mayor has n't asked us what we think .
" Perhaps the mayor will come out with his underpants on over his trousers like Superman one Saturday to show us how it should be done , and maybe tell a crowd of Liverpool supporters that they can't drink on the train . "

What are these ?
The Obama campaign calls its " Vote for Change " voter registration drive a mere voter registration drive .
Nothing to see here , folks , except for ordinary people helping ordinary people gain the franchise .
But it 's more than that .
The Vote For Change program will lay the foundation for Obama 's general election get - out - the - vote efforts .
Obama aides wo n't say much more , but I gather that the campaign is constructing an incredibly elaborate online interface to allow its more than a million donors and volunteers to directly persuade their neighbors through a variety of media .
Names gathered from the voter registration effort will be merged with names gathered through Obama 's primary efforts and the names off of the Democratic Party 's integrated voter file as well as lists purchased from outside vendors .
On election day , Obama might have more than a million individuals volunteering on his behalf .
That should scare the beejeesus out of the McCain campaign and the RNC .
The latest Obama campaign release is after the jump .
Obama Campaign Announces Vote for Change Co-Chairs
50 - state voter registration drive kicks off on Saturday
CHICAGO , IL — Senator Barack Obama today announced the national co-chairs of Vote for Change , the Obama campaign ’s 50 - state voter registration drive .
The fourteen co-chairs — leaders in government , the labor movement , the arts , and the faith community — will oversee the program ’s efforts and act as surrogates to boost participation across the country .
“ Barack Obama started his career as a community organizer in Chicago , working with communities devastated by plant closings , and after law school he returned to those neighborhoods to register new voters , ” co-chair Melissa Etheridge said .
“ From the beginning of his career , he ’s made change happen by enfranchising people at the grassroots , and that ’s what Vote for Change is all about . ”
“ I ’ve seen what can happen when everyday people feel like they have a stake in something bigger than themselves — and that they have the power to bring about real change , ” co-chair Maria Elena Durazo said .
“ If we ’re going to overcome the challenges we face as a nation , we ’re going to need every American to participate in the process . ”
“ Everywhere I go , people feel the same urgency to get this country back on track , ” Governor Deval Patrick said .
“ We need to restore some sense to our tax code .
We need to end our dependence on foreign oil and help relieve the burden of soaring energy prices .
And we need to end this misguided war .
The larger our coalition in November , the stronger our mandate for change will be . ”

IRS STAFFING REBOUNDS IRS STAFFING REBOUNDS Enlarge By Tim Dillon , USA TODAY
The IRS filed a $ 1.5 million tax lien against Bill Clinton 's former political adviser in 2003 .
The state of Connecticut reports Dick Morris owes $ 452,367 in back taxes and penalties .
Enlarge By Earl Gibson III , AP Singer Dionne Warwick owes $ 2.7 million in state taxes , according to the California Franchise Tax Board , which collects the state 's income tax .
Real estate developer Jack Blumenfeld went bankrupt in 1991 , leaving millions of dollars in unpaid taxes and loans .
Today , New Jersey lists him as the state 's sixth - biggest tax delinquent , owing $ 1.1 million .
An Internal Revenue Service tax lien says Blumenfeld owes more than $ 1.6 million in federal taxes .
RELATED : IRS cuts back on audits of large companies
Where is Blumenfeld today ?
The 81 - year - old developer lives in the same oceanfront home near Atlantic City where he 's lived since his glory days .
He has asked local authorities for permission to build a two - story addition and swimming pool to the 5,400 - square - foot home , now valued at $ 1.8 million , according to local tax records .
Blumenfeld says he 's broke ; the house is owned by a management company run by his son .
Every month , he says , the IRS takes $ 200 out of his Social Security check .
The IRS estimates that 21 % of federal individual income taxes go unpaid each year — about $ 300 billion last year .
States lost about $ 60 billion in such taxes , $ 6.5 billion in California alone .
As Tuesday 's tax deadline approaches , Americans are settling accounts on $ 1.5 trillion in federal and state income taxes for 2007 .
But what about those who do n't pay ?
Who are they ?
Do they get away with it ?
USA TODAY examined the cases of several hundred major tax delinquents — those who owe $ 100,000 or more — to analyze who they are , why they have n't paid and whether the money is collectible .
Among them are celebrities , investment bankers , lawyers , doctors , embezzlers , car dealers and many seemingly successful business people who continue to operate publicly as if all is well .
MORE : Tax delinquents encounter varying outcomes
The IRS declined to provide a list of the federal government 's largest tax delinquents , citing privacy rules .
However , the names and the amounts owed are scattered across the nation in 4,100 courthouses and town halls , where tax liens are filed .
The IRS files more than 600,000 tax liens every year .
USA TODAY examined the federal tax liens filed in several wealthy ZIP codes , including those for Beverly Hills and Malibu , Calif. , and Greenwich , Conn .
Hundreds of seemingly wealthy people — company presidents , former soap opera stars , top - selling real estate agents — live in multimillion - dollar homes yet have huge tax problems .
" What amazes me is how many people put themselves forward as pillars of the community and great philanthropists , yet they do n't pay their taxes , " Georgia Revenue Commissioner Bart Graham says .
How it gets started
For some , the trouble starts with divorce or gambling or a business mistake .
For others , it 's a love of money and hatred of taxes .
Graham was an Atlanta banker before becoming Georgia 's chief tax collector .
He knows some tax debtors personally and is familiar with their lifestyles , homes , second homes and other assets .
" People will do almost anything to make sure friends do n't see a change in lifestyle , and that ' anything ' includes not paying taxes , " he says .
Why do n't rich people pay ?
" They realize they owe taxes , " says Dennis Brager , a Los Angeles tax lawyer .
" It 's just that from their perspective , they have more pressing obligations . "
Tax delinquents often blame the government for part or all of their problems .
Penalties and interest on unpaid taxes are so punitive , they say , that it 's almost impossible to dig out of a hole .
William Livingston , an immigration attorney who specializes in mail - order brides , says a $ 20,000 tax problem from 20 years ago has swelled to nearly $ 300,000 owed to California today .
" There 's no reasoning with these people , " the San Dimas , Calif. , resident says of state tax collectors .
His business — bringing brides here from Russia and Ukraine — is struggling .
His own mail - order marriage did n't work out , so he 's a single parent living in a small apartment with a son , he says .
" Most of my stuff is out of the country , anyway , where ( tax collectors ) can't touch it , " Livingston says .
" I can retire abroad , and California can put me on any ( tax delinquent ) list they want . "
' Doing all we can '
Tax prosecutions are rare : 1,423 federal indictments last year ; 235 million tax returns were filed , the IRS reports .
Tax collectors rely mostly on automation : garnishing wages , seizing bank accounts and filing tax liens on property .
" We 're doing all we can , " says Kathy Petronchak , IRS commissioner for small business collections .
She says the IRS is collecting more money with fewer employees than a decade ago .
The IRS collected $ 32 billion in back taxes and penalties in 2007 , up from $ 21 billion in 1998 .
" We use our resources as efficiently as possible , " Petronchak says .
Today , houses are seldom seized .
The IRS sold country singer Willie Nelson 's home and possessions in 1991 to help settle a $ 16.7 million tax bill .
But a 1998 law , designed to curb abuses , made it harder for the IRS to seize property .
Property ownership can be hard to prove , too .
People in tax trouble often transfer assets to relatives and trusts .
Even if the transfers can be challenged , the process is expensive and time - consuming .
Jack Blumenfeld 's beachfront house is now owned by EB Realty Management Corp. , run by his son Eric .
In sworn testimony before the local planning board last year , Jack Blumenfeld testified he had lived in the house since 1964 .
In an interview , Blumenfeld says he gave the house to his children many years ago , long before he filed for bankruptcy .
His son pays the taxes , he says .
The developer says he went broke when a plan to build a hotel and casino in Atlantic City fell apart .
" I lost everything , " he says .
" The bankruptcy judge absolved me of all debts , except taxes . "
Blumenfeld blames the bankruptcy trustee for not paying the tax bill .
" He had enough dollars to pay the taxes , but he chose not to do so , " Blumenfeld says .
" The bottom line is , I honestly think I do n't owe them . "
He says the government mean - spiritedly pursues him because it believes that he 's hiding assets .
" They 've examined me upside , inside out and never found anything .
They think I did something underhanded , which I did not . "
Attorney Michael Zindler , who represented the trustee , says the developer had many assets in sons ' names .
" They fought us every step of the way , " Zindler recalls .
The trustee recovered most assets — but not the beachfront home , next to the boardwalk in Ventnor City , N.J. , Zindler says .
" We tried to get the house , but the judge would n't give it to us . "
Some high profiles
Many tax delinquents live openly and prosperously for years , even decades , while owing millions of dollars in taxes .
Singer Dionne Warwick owes $ 2.7 million in state taxes , according to the California Franchise Tax Board , which collects the state 's income tax .
The IRS has placed more than $ 1 million in tax liens against her for unpaid federal taxes .
Public records show that her tax troubles started in 1990 or earlier .
Since then , Warwick has hosted a popular infomercial for the $ 3.99 - per-minute Psychic Friends Network from 1993 through 1998 .
She maintains a busy recording and concert schedule , including tours this year in Europe and South America .
In January , she was robbed of jewelry worth more than $ 100,000 in a hotel room in Rome .
She performed Saturday near Dallas , her website says .
Why is the government unable to collect all taxes due from a five - time Grammy winner generating significant cash flow ?
The IRS and the state of California declined to comment , citing privacy rules .
Her manager , Henry Carr , said : " I ca n't talk about it .
Very sorry . "
Warwick did not respond to a letter requesting comment .
Other well - known delinquents : • Dick Morris
— The former political adviser to Bill Clinton is a Fox News analyst .
The IRS filed a $ 1.5 million tax lien against him in 2003 .
The state of Connecticut reports Morris owes $ 452,367 in back taxes and penalties .
Morris says he 's reached an agreement with Connecticut and his name will be removed from the next delinquency list .
He says he is committed to paying his taxes : " Following a difficult period in my life , I fell into arrears .
But since then , I have paid almost $ 3 million in state and federal taxes . "
• Sinbad — The comedian and actor — whose full name is Sinbad Adkins — owes $ 2.1 million to the state of California , according to the California Franchise Tax Board .
The IRS filed a $ 416,870 tax lien against him in 2006 .
Other tax liens against him date to 1994 , when he starred in The Sinbad Show on the Fox Network .
His recent gigs include performing at last year 's Wal - Mart shareholders meeting and Saturday at the Hilton Casino in Atlantic City .
Sinbad declined to comment .
• Catalina Vásquez Villalpando
— The former treasurer of the United States — her signature appears on paper currency printed during the administration of the first President Bush — owes $ 168,000 in taxes to Washington , D.C. , the city reports .
She was convicted of tax evasion in 1994 for hiding income while in office and served four months in prison .
She did not respond to a request for comment .
• O.J. Simpson — The ex-football star , who lives in Florida , owes $ 1.5 million in California taxes , the state says .
Yale Galanter , an attorney for Simpson , says he has n't been notified of the debt .
" Nobody has ever contacted me from the state of California , " his attorney , Yale Galanter told The Associated Press .
He says Simpson owns no property or assets there .
Tax collection agencies are not permitted to discuss individual cases .
They say they are doing the best they can to collect taxes .
" Our collectors are out there every day trying to get this money , " says John Barrett , spokesman for the California Franchise Tax Board .
He says the state can't seize income earned outside the state .
" If someone performs in Lake Tahoe ( Nev. ) , we can't garnish the money , " he says .
" If they perform in San Francisco , we would be there waiting . "
Dionne Warwick moved from Beverly Hills in the 1990s , and in recent years reported living in her mother 's home in Orange , N.J .
That home was sold in 2006 after her mother 's death .
Warwick 's current residence could n't be determined .
California tax liens report Sinbad 's mailing address as an office building in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park Ill .
IRS tax liens list his residence as a multimillion - dollar home in Hidden Hills , Calif. , owned by his brother , Michael Adkins .
On April 7 , California reclassified more than 100 large tax debts as uncollectible and removed the delinquents from its published list .
Those taken off the new list : Warwick , Sinbad and Livingston , the immigration attorney .
Trying new tactics
In an effort to shame tax delinquents into paying , 15 states — California , Colorado , Connecticut , Georgia , Illinois , Kentucky , Maryland , New Jersey , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , South Carolina , Virginia , Washington and Wisconsin — and the District of Columbia have started publishing the names of people the governments say owe large amounts of taxes .
The inexpensive tactic has worked .
Wisconsin collected more than $ 8 million after sending letters warning delinquents that their names would be posted on the Internet .
In Connecticut , 70 % of the state 's top 100 tax delinquents reached payment agreements after getting such a letter .
Individuals and companies that prize respectability respond swiftly .
JPMorgan Chase sent a $ 115,000 check to Wisconsin the day after USA TODAY called about an unpaid tax bill .
The banking giant had a defunct partnership that Wisconsin said owed $ 5 million .
" We owe some taxes and penalties but not $ 5 million , " bank spokeswoman Christine Holevas says .
" This tax issue fell through the cracks , but we will work promptly to settle it . "
The partnership was removed from the state 's list after the $ 115,000 check arrived .
Real estate developer Kent Hoggan of Stockton , Calif. , says he amended his tax return Jan. 15 after appearing on California 's list as owing $ 5.8 million in back taxes .
" I 've had losses that would eliminate this tax liability , " he says .
Some tax delinquents say they have no way to pay what they owe .
Disbarred attorney Michael Bledsoe of Elk Grove Village , Ill. , is his state 's fifth - largest tax delinquent , owing $ 224,260 .
He served time in prison for mishandling clients ' money and tax evasion .
Now , he 's trying to rebuild his life .
After prison , he lived with his father and at a friend 's house .
He 's trying to start a career in sales .
" I lost everything , " he says .
" How do I pay this ? "
Sometimes they are just wrong
The size of tax debts on the published lists can be overstated — or plain wrong .
Dinah White of Fort Atkinson , Wis. , says she owes $ 300,000 , not the $ 1.3 million the state claims .
" Where they got that number , who knows ? " she says .
Even innocent people have a hard time getting off the list : • Al Copeland , founder of the Popeyes fried chicken chain , was listed as Georgia 's second - largest tax delinquent , owing $ 5.5 million .
The giant accounting firm KPMG tried for more than a year to get Copeland off the delinquent list .
Copeland , a flamboyant New Orleans icon , died of cancer March 23 .
Georgia mistakenly thought the life - long Louisiana resident lived in Georgia during the 1990s , says Grant Coleman , his tax attorney .
After an inquiry from USA TODAY , the state reviewed the case , removed Copeland 's name and canceled his tax liens .
• Bruce McNall is the former owner of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and a movie producer ( Weekend at Bernie's ) .
He pleaded guilty in 1994 to defrauding $ 236 million from banks .
The California Board of Equalization says he owes $ 7.3 million for unpaid sales tax on horses .
" That 's an old debt that I thought was released in bankruptcy , " McNall says .
Bankruptcy trustee Todd Neilson says McNall is right — and the state is wrong .
The trustee says the state was awarded $ 250,000 after a trial to settle the tax debt , and that amount has been paid .
• Molly Wotring , a part - time elementary school worker in Hodges , S.C. , typed her name in Google for fun last month .
She was surprised to learn she was the fifth - biggest tax delinquent in South Carolina .
The state claimed she owed $ 225,253 in income taxes for the years 2000 to 2004 , when she lived in Ohio .
She says she got a cold reception when she called the taxpayer assistance hotline .
" I tried to tell the lady on the phone .
She was n't very nice , " Wotring says .
On April 4 , she went unannounced to the local tax collection office , armed with her old Ohio tax returns .
An auditor apologized , she says .
She is now off the list .
Enlarge USA TODAY Real Estate developer Jack Blumenfeld lives in this $ 1.8 million Ventnor , N.J. home .
The state says he owes $ 1.1 million in back taxes .
Mixed reaction : Did Clinton hedge on Obama rumor ?
Clinton says Obama Muslim rumor false 'as far as I know '
A widely debunked smear campaign attempting to convince voters that Barack Obama is Muslim maintains a foothold among some rural Ohio voters , 60 Minutes found in a segment aired Sunday .
When CBS correspondent Steve Kroft asked Obama 's opponent , Hillary Clinton , about the untrue rumors she seemed to hedge her response :
 You do n't believe that Senator Obama 's a Muslim ? 
Kroft asked Sen. Clinton .
 Of course not .
I mean , that , you know , there is no basis for that .
I take him on the basis of what he says .
And , you know , there is n't any reason to doubt that ,  she replied .
 You said you 'd take Senator Obama at his word that he 's not a Muslim .
You do n't believe that he's ,  Kroft said .
 No .
No , there is nothing to base that on .
As far as I know ,  she said .
That last line -- " as far as I know " -- was criticized by some , who said Clinton should have given a definitive " no " and left it at that .
Earlier in its broadcast , 60 Minutes spoke to an Ohio voter who believed the Obama rumors .
" I do n't know about you but this seems pretty shady to me , " wrote one blogger at the liberal MyDD.com .
" When asked repeatedly if she believed that Obama was a Muslim , Clinton used a number of phrases that made it seem like her denial was based more on a lack of evidence rather than a sincere belief that Obama has never been Muslim .
As if she just hadnt gotten those e-mails yet , " read another post at Trainwreck Politics .
" She could have simply said , ' No , Barack Obama is not a Muslim and has never been a Muslim .
This is a case of ridiculous rumors versus demonstrable facts . '
Others were more willing to give Clinton the benefit of the doubt :
" This is about 95 percent the correct and proper answer .
... I doubt this was about anything more than verbal sloppiness , " Michael Crowley wrote at The New Republic .
" But particularly given the way people see a conspiracy behind every Clinonite utterance , Hillary should have dispatched this question with one crisp sentence saying it 's just not true . "
" For me it 's on the edge .
And I find it surprising she would leave it on the edge , " Josh Marshall observed at Talking Points Memo .
" Why the 'as far as I know ' line ?
On the other hand , at other points , she seems pretty unequivocal . "

ROCHESTER , Minn .
-- Mayo Clinic researchers have found that mild cognitive impairment , a disorder considered a strong early predictor of Alzheimer 's disease , is prevalent among the elderly and increases with age and fewer years of education .
Findings from this study , funded by the National Institute on Aging , will be presented Tuesday , April 4 , at the American Academy of Neurology meeting in San Diego .
The researchers randomly selected 3,957 people from the general population of Olmsted County , Minn. , home of Mayo Clinic , for participation in this study .
The researchers set out to find how many of those who did not have dementia might have mild cognitive impairment .
To date , 1,116 people without dementia in the study have been evaluated .
The findings suggest that 12 percent of 70 - to 89 - year - olds in Olmsted County , Minn. , have mild cognitive impairment .
The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment increased with age , affecting 9 percent of those 70 to 79 and nearly 18 percent of those 80 to 89 .
The prevalence of mild cognitive impairment also varied according to years of education , ranging from 25 percent in those with up to eight years of education , 14 percent in those with nine to 12 years , 9 percent in those with 13 to 16 years , and 8.5 percent in those with greater than 16 years .
The researchers suggest that the increase of mild cognitive impairment with age found in this study parallels the risk elevation with age seen in previous studies of Alzheimer 's disease .
" This means that 12 percent to 20 percent of the entire population of those over age 70 may have either mild cognitive impairment or dementia , which is quite significant , " says Ronald Petersen , M.D. , Ph.D. , Mayo Clinic neurologist and study investigator .
" These data have major implications for the future of the health care system and the aging of America . "
Dr. Petersen adds that the increased risk for mild cognitive impairment with fewer years of e

The protesters are targeting the BBC and other media organisations Hundreds of Chinese students have gathered in Manchester and London to protest at the Western media 's portrayal of the Free Tibet movement .
More than 1,000 people , wearing " I love China " t- shirts , gathered outside BBC Manchester and about 300 were outside the Houses of Parliament in London .
Protest organiser Tian Yang said : " All we want is more people to listen to our voice and Chinese people 's voices . "
The BBC said , despite restrictions , its coverage had been " fair and balanced " .
It added : " The same is true of our reporting of the Olympic torch relay and the protests that have accompanied it . "
Mr Yang added : " The BBC is the national broadcaster , so we aim at them , but also the Western media in general .
Students held hands in the silent protest " The way they frame the story is biased .
There is only one side of the story .
" They take their views from Tibetan government and the Western petitions .
" All we want is more people to listen to our voice and Chinese people 's voices because they are only interviewing the Tibetan separatists . "
Protesters held a two - hour silent demonstration outside the BBC in Manchester before they read out an " open letter to BBC " at 1230 BST .
Torch relay
The letter , addressed to director general Mark Thompson suggests the BBC is " tarnishing and demonising China " .
The letter is signed " from the Chinese community in Manchester " .
An hour later , protesters marched to Manchester Town Hall and spoke to the media about promoting the spirit of the Beijing Olympics .
In London , protester Becky Qin told BBC News 24 she thought its coverage of the torch relay was mainly about the pro-Tibet demonstrators .
She said : " When I went back to Cambridge - and when I saw the recorded version of BBC News 24 - we were disappointed to see nothing about a supporting group at all .
" It was as if the torch was just struggling its way through London and how it was all about how people were so resentful of it , and how people were trying to grab the torch or stop the torch relay . "

Update !
I 've taken some of your suggestions and feedback and written part 2 of Amazing Geological Oddities !
See it here : Amazing Geological Oddities Part II
Moving Rocks at the Racetrack Playa , Death Valley California .
The Richat Structure , or " Eye of the Sahara . "
The driest place on Earth , Atacama Desert .
The Naica Mine , Cave of Crystals , Mexico .
The Curtain of Fire , Hawaii .
Sinkholes
Stone Forest , Southwest China .
Death Valley in California is home to rocks that seem to move on their own .
Pebbles to Boulders are found scattered around the " racetrack " with trails that turn , loop , and zigzag behind them .
Some of the Rocks move , others do n't .
It was thought for some time that magnetic forces were the cause of the phenomena .
Scientists now believe that the cause is wind .
When there has been enough water to soak the flat clay , and temperatures lower below freezing , it causes tiny ice crystals to form .
When the surface of a rock is slick enough in these conditions wind will actually have enough power to move them around , leaving a trail .
This spectacular landform in Mauritania in the southwestern part of the Sahara desert is so huge with a diameter of 30 miles that it is visible from space .
The formation was originally thought to be caused by a meteorite impact but now geologists believe it is a product of uplift and erosion .
The cause of its circular shape is still a mystery .
The Atacama Desert receives less than 1 mm of rain per year , and at one point not a single drop of precipitation landed on its dry surface for 400 years .
It 's caused by the Andes rainshadow ; meaning that the trade winds moving east along South America lose all moisture when they slam against the steep slopes of the Andes Mountains .
The Atacama Desert is found nestled up against the western slopes of the mountain range .
Interestingly , several thousand miles south the winds change direction , and the deserts are then found on the eastern side of the Andes , such as the Monte Desert in Argentina .
These caverns found in a mine in Chihuahua Mexico are home to some of the largest crystals ever discovered and are an impressive sight .
The crystals are made mainly of Gypsum , and under these extremely rare conditions were allowed to grow unimpeded .
These amazing lava fountains erupted during the first stage of the Puu Oo eruption in January , 1983 .
The lava created a wall of magma 100 - 160 feet high along a fissure along the Eastern Rift of Mount Kilauea .
What could be more terrifying than the earth opening itself and swallowing your entire home ?
Among other places , this can become a reality in the Southeastern United States .
Sinkholes are found in regions of Karst Topography , where pockets of loose sedimentary rock found under the surface can be eroded by groundwater , leaving behind caverns and caves , some of which collapse .
The Shilin ( Chinese for stone forest ) is an impressive example of karst topography .
The rocks are made of limestone and are formed by water percolating the ground 's surface and eroding away everything but the pillars .
Osama Bin Laden ’s widely publicized video address to the American people has a peculiarity that casts serious doubt on its authenticity : the video freezes at about 1 minute and 36 58 seconds , and motion only resumes again at 12:30 .
The video then freezes again at 14:02 remains frozen until the end .
All references to current events , such as the 62nd anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Japan , and Sarkozy and Brown being the leaders of France and the UK , respectively , occur when the video is frozen !
The words spoken when the video is in motion contain no references to contemporary events and could have been ( and likely were ) made before the U.S. invasion of Iraq .
The audio track does appear to be in the voice of a single speaker .
What I suspect was done is that an older , unreleased video was dubbed over for this release , with the video frozen when the audio track departed from that of the original video .
The video may be downloaded as a 677 mb MPEG file here .

While the idea of hacking a primary election ballot seems attractive , the EXIT polls that I read seem to bear out the election results .
Two factors played a huge roll : ( 1 ) reportedly neo -conservative groups have been urging their folks to say they are voting for Obama to either discredit him at the polls or in an effort to herd people to vote for him , as reported on several websites ; ( 2 ) women turned out in far greater numbers than men , and voted for Clinton .
The crack in her veneer the other day really rallied women to support her .
I recommend that you rely less on pre-election polls and look at exit polls .
It was the Florida exit polls in 2000 that were the real sign of election fraud there .

M Holt -
And which Exit Polls would those be ?
The ones adjusted to match the election results ?
( The only ones that are publicly available , to my knowledge ) .
If you happen to get access to the RAW , pre-adjusted data , please let us know .
Until then , all we 're asking for is some transparency here .
Pretty please ?
If all is well , there should be no problem in actually counting those ballots so we can actually know that without having to resort to " faith - based " voting .
Again .

Did you hear Matthews on Hardball report on the raw exit poll data ?
He just said that he was shown the raw data at 5:30 last night and it showed Obama with a " substantial victory " and matched the earlier polls .
He gave that info because he wanted to figure out why people lied to the exit pollsters .

Now , this makes more sense to me .
Could not understand how Sen.
Obama had record crowds , spoke until he lost his voice , had the Iowa win ( bounce ) , almost single handedly responsible for the youth vote , and had record turn - out ; but , lost the election .
Something just was not right .
I truly believe there is a Clinton connection to Diebold .
This clearly explains the " come back kid " factor .
My mother always told me , " IF YOU LIE , YOU WILL STEAL " , and we all know Bill and Hillary are notorious liars .
So , why can't we ban these machines from further use ?

This photo says a lot , when combined with her statement that the Iraq war will be have to be " ended properly " .
She was not concerned with " starting it properly " , so since the military industrial complex is funding her , the " surprise win " is understandable .
It is the :
Rubin Carter was falsely tried .
The crime was murder " one , " guess who testified ?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers , they all went along for the ride .
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool 's hand ?
To see him obviously framed
Could n't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game .
( story of the hurricane ) , including but not limited to , Katrina , which is emerging .
The MSM does not get it do they ?
In Amurka , " you are doin a heckuva job EVM's " is an absolute .
In Amurka , forget questioning the machine , question the integrity of voters instead .
Like Paul Simon said , " They have all gone to look for America " , but I can't seem to get past Big Brother 's Amurkan MSM .

He mentioned that late deciders broke evenly which means that all polls were all wrong about the Dems before the last 36 hours or something else is going on .

The MSM has it 's troubles , and so do mainstream progressive sites online .
Take MoveOn , for instance .
They sent out a pitch for paper ballots today with a twisted reference to New Hampshire .
MoveOn apparently does n't get it that , even where there is paper , if that paper goes uncounted , we will rely on Big Media ( untransparent Exit Polls ) to tell us who wins our elections .
Here 's my open letter to MoveOn : Dear MoveOn :
In today 's petition drive for paper ballots , you raise the following question : " Imagine if yesterday 's New Hampshire primary had been decided by insecure electronic voting machines instead of paper ballots .
With polls saying one thing and ballots another — and a thin margin deciding the winner — the results could be forever in doubt . "
Please explain how yesterday 's primary was determined by paper ballots ?
For 81 % of the precincts , the paper was fed into Diebold optical scan technology that is notoriously insecure .
There was no manual recount or audit , so New Hampshire is no better off than Georgia , Maryland or any number of other paperless jurisdictions .
Why was n't there a call for a manual recount or audit in NewHampshire ?
The answer to that is easy , is n't it ?
There was no call for a manual recount or audit because the ( publicly released ) media exitpolls substantiated the electronic results .
In other words , we do n't need paper after all - - we'll just continue to let the media tell us who won .
The problem is , if there 's one thing less transparent and more poisonous to democracy than a Diebold electronic voting machine it's CNN / NBC / CBS / ABC / PBS / AP/NYTimes / WashingtonPost .
I 'm sorry MoveOn , but shifting the vote counting from Diebold to Big Media is NOT a step in the direction of legitimate elections .

2004/2006 : US elections run on diebold computer voting systems are proven to be inaccurate , hackable , and used to altered election results .
2008 OUTCOME :
Thes same voting company with ties to the elected criminals who stole the previous elections are allowed to count the votes in secrecy and even use the same hackable machines .
Results are then parroted by the corporate mass media .
Sort of makes me want to enlist in bush / cheney 's military force to take control of the Iraqi oil reserves i mean spread our form of democracy to Iraq and around the world .
Pathetic treasonous 1 % er liers who have infiltrated all 3 branches of government and own and operate the corporate mass media now will completely stay the coarse until everything on this planet is either destroyed or killed off through careless mismanagement .
Do n't worry about anyone with ties to the terrorist bush / cheney crime family liers who sells nuclear secrets to Pakistan and others countries for cash deals because they are taken care of and they are completely insulated from conviction of any and all wrongdoing .
7 % of a population can create a movement and it's not about us and them .
Do n't ever forget it 's all about us .. we the people and what we want .

Brad , thank you for keeping on this .
The blogs I frequent have not picked up on this yet .
I wonder if people even realize the Diebold machines are being used in primaries .
Over and over tonight shows are discussing how nine polls could be so wrong specifically for the Dems , but spot on for the Repubs .
They are n't even considering the optical scanners could be a problem - again .
Is this why the Dems in power have n't responded to concerns about the machines , because they hoped to use them to their advantage some day ?

Will we see another Ohio 2004 or Florida 2000 where the candidate bends and subcombs to political pressure ?
More and more people understand how these machines can't be trusted .

Arrest made in search of Texas polygamist compound Arrest made as search of polygamist compound continues

The group was relocated to San Angelo .

ELDORADO — State police said they have arrested one person during their search of a compound built by polygamist leader Warren Jeffs .
Department of Public Safety spokesman Tom Vinger said the person arrested was not Dale Barlow , the man listed in warrants related to the marriage of an underage girl .
But Vinger said he had no other details .
While authorities say church members have been cooperative , there have been tense moments as troopers have searched the temple and other buildings on the grounds .
Child welfare and law enforcement authorities were searching for a fourth day for any children and documents at the nearly 1,700 - acre compound in Eldorado .
Officials were struggling today to persuade children to give them any information about the goings - on inside the breakaway Mormon compound south of San Angelo , in West Texas .
Despite removing more than 200 women and children from a polygamist compound outside of town , state child welfare officials have not found a 16 - year - old girl whose abuse complaint last week triggered the massive raid .
" I 'm confident the girl exists and the allegations she brought are accurate , " said Marleigh Meisner , a spokeswoman for Child Protective Services in a Sunday afternoon news conference at the local high school .
" We did not have face - to - face contact .
It was a telephone call with limited information , " she said of the complaint of abuse .
Since being removed from the compound near Eldorado , the women and children had been sleeping in rooms crowded with cots in facilities in Eldorado , including the civic center and First Baptist Church fellowship hall .
" They huddled together .
It was very obvious they were scared .
They were non-responsive .
They looked like deer caught in the headlights , " said church leader Helen Pfluger , 59 .
She estimates she spent at least 30 hours with the women and children over the weekend but said communications never rose above the most basic level .
" I felt like I was from Mars , that I was alien to them .
There was not one thing we had alike , except that we were female and had children , " she said .
Pfluger said the children dressed in 19th - century garb , did not know what crayons or breakfast cereal were , and that they were not accustomed to some of the food they were offered .
" Our food made some of the children sick .
They are used to drinking raw milk and they asked for it , " she said .
" When they had clothing needs , it was impossible to give them what they needed .
Where are you going to find a long - sleeve , high - neck , loose - waist , long dress for a 3 - year old girl ? " she asked .
On Sunday , they were taken in buses 40 miles north to San Angelo 's Fort Concho .
The historic site has facilities to rent for social and business gatherings , and it also has a state office building that a tour guide said includes a child welfare office .
Saturday standoff
After three days of searching , officials have n't been able to find the girl who first called one week ago seeking help or determine whether she is one of 159 children they have removed from the complex .
Law officers entered the sect 's sacred temple after a Saturday standoff over whether authorities could search it for children to be questioned about possible abuse .
Fearing a worst - case scenario , officers on Saturday had called ambulances to the compound after leaders refused to allow authorities to search the temple .
Later , a stream of ambulances and law - enforcement vehicles left the compound without incident .
Officials said there had been some tense moments , but everyone remained calm and peaceful .
A prosecutor said there are concerns for the safety of the girl , who said that she was 16 and had a baby and an older husband .
" Certainly I have a concern for her health and well - being , certainly a concern for her safety , " said Allison Palmer , first assistant district attorney for the 51st judicial district , which includes Schleicher County , where the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints complex is located .
Search for suspect
Officers and child abuse investigators did n't enter the ranch until Thursday , when a search warrant was signed allowing them to search for records relating to the pregnancy of the girl and marriage to a man identified in the warrant as Dale Barlow .
Authorities believe the girl , who has an 8 - month - old daughter , was 15 when she was married .
A 2005 change in state law , prompted by concern about the sect , raised the legal age for a girl to marry to 16 from 14 .
Palmer said Barlow has been located in another state and that he is wanted on a charge of sexual assault of a child , a second - degree felony .
Barlow 's probation officer told The Salt Lake Tribune that he was in Arizona .
" He said the authorities had called him ( in Colorado City , Ariz . ) and some girl had accused him of assaulting her , and he did n't even know who she was , " said Bill Loader , a probation officer in Arizona .
Child welfare workers continued to search the 1,700 - acre compound Sunday afternoon , hours after six buses took 159 children and 60 adults removed earlier from the compound to San Angelo .
" We hope to immediately assess their medical and therapeutic needs , " Meisner said .
It was unclear , however , how long the state could detain most of the women and children without a court order .
A San Angelo judge has already given the agency legal custody of 18 sect children based on allegations of neglect or abuse .
Meisner said more legal developments might occur today .
" I do not believe we forced them to leave .
They knew what their options were , " she said without elaboration .
The sect and its leader
The raid came more than four years after members of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter - day Saints , long based on the Arizona - Utah border , began arriving at this rural agricultural community .
While mainstream Mormons disavowed polygamy more than a century ago , the sect , led by now - imprisoned Warren Jeffs , believes in plural , arranged marriages that often involve teenage girls and older men .
In September , Jeffs was convicted in Utah of being an accomplice in the rape of a 14 - year - old girl .
He faces additional charges of sexual conduct with a minor , incest and conspiracy in Arizona .
Since arriving , the sect has erected more than 35 buildings and a massive white temple on the compound , which is believed to be home to several hundred people .
An initial wave of alarm in Eldorado eventually gave way to an uneasy , peaceful co-existence with the sect , whose members were rarely seen in town .
" We 'd kind of mellowed out , both sides .
We 'd become accustomed to them , and no one thought they were a threat to the community , " said Eldorado Mayor John Nikolauk .
He said that while it was widely believed in Eldorado that they practiced multiple , arranged marriages , some involving minor girls , the explosive issue never broke the surface until last week .
" We suspected it was going on but without a complaint , you 're not going to get in there .
It 's a closed society , " he said .
" Everyone has empathy for the kids , that they 'll get the breaks a normal kid would have .
Maybe this will be the breakthrough we 've been looking for . "

Companies in this article DiCE
Last year EA announced that DICE studio's next Battlefield game - Battlefield Heroes - would be a free - to - play online game , monetised through micro-transactions .
GamesIndustry .biz spoke to DICE 's executive producer Ben Cousins at a recent EA press event about the business model behind Battlefield Heroes , the studio's relationship with EA , and videogame piracy .
Q : In the Battlefield Heroes trailer you make a joke about downloading the game from a torrent site .
Was piracy a deciding factor in deciding to release the game for free ?
Ben Cousins :
If you look at Korea - and really the idea for Battlefield Heroes came from a business trip to South Korea that a couple of guys had a few years ago - Korea and China are markets which are basically killed by piracy on the console side and on the PC side .
As a result this free - to - play model kind of came because people were used to not paying for their games because they were pirating them .
The companies started offering them for free and started monetizing it with micro-transactions .
I do n't know whether DICE has been driven by piracy in our games - it 's certainly a problem but we do quite well anyway .
It was more the case that the business model itself originally came from piracy back in the old days .
In that movie [ the Battlefield Heroes Trailer ] ... I think it 's important - I wrote the script for that movie - that we address the fact the piracy exists and there 's no point in hiding under the carpet or just sweeping it under the carpet .
Piracy is out there and the industry needs to find ways of dealing with it , and one of the ways is free - to - play games .
Q : If it 's not about piracy , is it more of a forward - looking business plan for how you think things will be ?
Ben Cousins :
It 's an experiment .
DICE has always liked to experiment , whether it 's within gameplay or within online services and that kind of thing .
We 're seen , within EA , as being at the forefront of online , certainly for action games , and we like to experiment .
It 's just literally " Okay , cost is n't going to be that high ; Let 's just try it and see what happens " and kind of go with it , rather than just continuing to make the same games over and over again .
Q : How does the cost compare to Battlefield : Bad Company ?
Ben Cousins :
It 's about a quarter of the cost of Bad Company .
Q : How many players do you need to make pay for micro-transactions to cover the costs ?
Ben Cousins :
The way it works ... We do quite a detailed business plan , we 've got a team , a store manager , a marketing guy and a business development guy working full time on heroes now , working on the business model .
Our assumptions all are based around the fact that 95 per cent of people wo n't spend any money , and there 's a small group of five per cent of people who are willing to spend money .
I can't go into the figures but you can look at the Korean games , which have their figures public - a lot of them - and you can build your model based around about how much people spend and how many people are spending money and things like that .
You do have to go broader than previous Battlefield games and you need maybe double the players that you had for BF2 for Battlefield Heroes to be a really big success .
Q : Previously you 've said that none of the items available to buy will affect gameplay .
Are you confident that cosmetic changes will be enough to encourage people to spend money on micro-transactions ?
Ben Cousins :
If you think about it from a gamers perspective , us as hardcore gamers or people in the industry , we always think about the mechanics - people will only buy something for a reason .
This is n't the case if you look at something like Habbo Hotel or Club Penguin or MapleStory .
Some of the items that sell the best are items that do n't really have any effect on gameplay what so ever .
Our store manager came to us from a German free - to - play game , and he has incredible stories of items that have no gameplay impact whatsoever , which are quite expensive , selling tens of thousands .
You 're talking roughly EUR 30 an item that people are quite happy to buy , which just changes the way their character looks .
So there is a precedent out there , so we 're quite confident of that .
Q : How does the download work ?
Is that a permanent presence on your computer ?
Because it seems like such a web - based game .
Ben Cousins :
It is web - based , but it 's too big and too high quality for us to run in a browser and just hold it in memory , so we do an install .
It 's very simple , you register as you would for something like Facebook or a forum - a very simple registration process - login , press " play now " and it will download the game .
250 MB , it 's very quick , and that 's basically it .
You can choose where you install it just like a normal PC game , but we think most people will just go for the standard place , and whenever you hit play again it will just launch the game .
So , you have to go to the website to launch the game , but it 's a permanent installation on your computer .
Q : Do you think browser - based games is a direction that you or the industry as a whole will be moving towards in the future ?
Ben Cousins : I think as an industry , as a whole , absolutely .
People talk about which of the two , PlayStation or Xbox , is going to be the big platform of the future .
I think the web is going to be the big platform of the future - whether it 's running on an iPhone or a Mac or on the PC .
Q : So when people say there 's going to be a one console future , you say : ' Yes and that 's going to be on the PC ' ?
Ben Cousins :
My response would be " Yes , and it 's going to be the web , and it does n't care if it runs on a phone or runs on a Mac or the PC . "
Q : On your relationship with EA ... Do you still feel independent ?
Ben Cousins :
We feel completely independent .
I 've been at DICE for just over a year now and before I joined DICE you hear stories about what it 's like to work at a company that 's just been bought by EA and I just do n't recognise the company that people used to describe .
I mean , we 're basically given complete freedom to do as we please .
We have to show our accounts , we have to show that we 're making money , and we have targets in terms of profitability , but really what we 're doing and how we do it is completely up to us .
With Mirror 's Edge and Battlefield Heroes you see two games which would never have happened under a dictatorial corporation .
You know , it 's complete freedom and completely innovative products and we 're completely left alone to do what we like .
Q : Do you think that reputation is overblown or do you think it 's changed since John Riccitiello ?
Ben Cousins : I think it 's changed since John Riccitiello , but I think it was never as bad as people thought .
I think there were a few studios a few years ago that were having problems but I think that the majority of people at EA have always been perfectly happy and have n't felt constrained by the corporation .
Q : Do you have a backup plan in case micro-transactions do n't take ?
Advertising , perhaps ?
Ben Cousins :
We do have advertising and all of our projections have revenue from advertising and micro-items , but the advertising is only on the website - at the front end - and not in the actual game itself .
Just static rich media - type adverts that you have in all websites .
There 's no precedent for a AAA action game which is funded by micro-transactions in the Western world , but there 's Habbo Hotel , there 's Club Penguin , there 's MapleStory .
There 's lots of games out there that are doing this but people do n't notice them because they 're played by ten year - olds .
It 's not really part of the mainstream gaming industry , so we feel really confident that if we can get the volume of people playing the game some of them will eventually be converted into paying users .
Reid : Bush 's comments on Qaeda and Iraq are ' misguided and dangerous ' Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday July 24 , 2007 Print This Email This Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( NV - D ) issued a sharp rebuke to the commander in chief on Tuesday , shortly after President Bush gave another speech defending his strategy in Iraq as a way to keep al Qaeda from attacking the United States .
" The Presidents claim that the war in Iraq is protecting us from Al Qaeda is as misguided and dangerous as the conclusions that drove us to Iraq in the first place , " Reid said in a statement sent to RAW STORY .
" The fact is that our continued flawed strategy in Iraq is emboldening and unifying Al Qaeda , both in that country and elsewhere . "
Earlier today , Bush told military personnel at the Charleston Air Force base , " Some say that Iraq is not a part of the broader war on terror .
They claim that the organization called al Qaeda in Iraq is an Iraqi phenomenon , that it 's independent of Osama bin Laden and it's not interested in attacking America .
That would be news to Osama bin Laden . "
However , Reid pointed out that al Qaeda in Iraq did not exist before the US invasion and ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003 , and criticized the president for attempting to link the Iraq war with the fight against Osama bin Laden 's terror network .
" Despite what the President would like us to believe , it has been established that Al Qaeda had no active cells in Iraq when we invaded , and we have long known that we were not attacked from Iraq on 9/11 .
Saying otherwise does not make it so , " Reid said .
" The Administrations own National Intelligence Estimate reported last week that the war is Al Qaedas most effective tool for recruiting terrorists and raising money .
Meanwhile , Al Qaeda is growing stronger and Osama bin Laden operates freely along the Afghanistan - Pakistan border nearly six years after the Sept. 11 attacks . "
Democrats in the Senate so far have failed to garner enough votes to pass a slate of measures that have been introduced aimed at beginning a troop withdrawal .
But Reid promised his party would " continue fighting for what the vast majority of the American people know we need : changing the mission in Iraq , bringing our troops home responsibly and refocusing our resources on al Qaeda . "
During his Tuesday speech Bush claimed that " surrendering the future of Iraq to al Qaeda would be a disaster to our country " but did n't mention a newly public US intelligence report that found Al - Qaeda had been reinvigorated and was plotting new attacks from a safe haven in remote tribal areas of Pakistan .
The report , a National Intelligence Estimate grouping the consensus findings of the US spy agencies , also declared that Al - Qaeda in Iraq was the terrorist network 's " most visible and capable affiliate and the only one known to have expressed a desire to attack the Homeland , " meaning the United States .
A previous NIE found that the war in Iraq was an effective recruiting tool for Islamist extremists including Al - Qaeda .
" Thanks for letting me come by today , " Bush said Tuesday .
" I 've explained the connection between al Qaeda and its Iraqi affiliate .
I presented intelligence that clearly establishes this connection .
The facts are that al Qaeda terrorists killed Americans on 9/11 , they are fighting us in Iraq and across the world , and they are plotting to kill Americans here at home again . "

Ayatollah Khamenei ( right ) said the US should not try " to break Iran "
The warning came from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a meeting with the head of the UN nuclear watchdog , Mohamed ElBaradei .
Ayatollah Khamenei insisted that Iran was not building a nuclear bomb .
He also said that the issue should not even be considered by the United Nations Security Council .
Meanwhile , a senior Iranian military official accused the Americans of being warmongers , following the incident in which Washington claimed that Iranian patrol boats swarmed around their warships in the Gulf .
The official said the incident did show Iran 's determination to defend the Straits of Hormuz - the strategic waterway at the mouth of the Gulf .
So , whatever really happened in that naval confrontation , the verbal skirmishing continues as fierce as ever .
Handfuls of Windows Vista Media Center users found themselves blocked from making recordings of their favorite TV shows this week when a broadcast flag triggered the software 's built - in copy protection measures .
The flag affected users trying to record prime - time NBC shows on Monday evening , using both over - the - air broadcasts and cable .
Although the problem is being " looked into " by both NBC and Microsoft , the incident serves as another reminder that DRM gives content providers full control , even if by accident .
Vista MCE users began reporting problems on Monday evening , starting with posts on the popular DVR - enthusiast forum on The Green Button .
While trying to record shows like American Gladiator and Medium , Vista users were presented with an error that read , " Recording cancelled .
[ TV show ] can not be recorded .
Restrictions set by the broadcaster and / or originator of the content prohibit recording of this program . "
The Green Button user justinjas posted a screenshot of the error on his blog .
It seems the flag only triggered copy protection measures in Vista , as one of our staffers with a DirecTV HD DVR recorded Gladiators as usual , and a TiVo spokesperson told CNet that the company had not received any complaints .
Spokespersons from Microsoft and NBC also told CNet that the issue was being looked into , indicating that the broadcast flag was likely switched on by accident .
The serves as a unsettling reminder that broadcasters can give instructions to the software built into DVRs , although they almost never do .
Many DVRs and other , similar devices appear to be aware of the content - restriction flags set by broadcasters , even if they 're not programmed to " obey " them by default .
Still , broadcasters would love to have the power to stop users from recording their shows , watching them later , and most importantly , skipping commercials when they do it .
Vista users are n't the only one to get hosed by broadcaster 's copy - protection flags this year .
Last month , DirecTV began to limit the window in which users could watch recorded pay - per - view movies .
Previously , users who purchased PPV movies had unlimited time to watch their content , but DirecTV said the movie industry wanted tighter restrictions .
As a result , DirecTV DVR owners must now watch their movies within 24 hours of purchase ( unlike rentals on iTunes , which must be watched within 30 days of purchase , or 24 hours from the time you press the play button ) , or else the content will go " poof . "
Remember : DRM is n't about fighting piracy .
It 's about the ability to strictly control how we consume content .
Users who are interested in pirating TV shows and movies are n't going to do so with a DVR or buy them through PPV .
They 've already skipped the middle - man and gone straight to BitTorrent with its decent - quality , commercial - less , and DRM - free offerings .
Boneheaded mistakes like the one apparently made by NBC and Microsoft Monday night will only serve to make alternative means of obtaining content more attractive .

Latin America and Asia Are at Last Breaking Free of Washington ’s Grip
Noam Chomsky
The Guardian , March 15 , 2006
The prospect that Europe and Asia might move towards greater independence has troubled US planners since the second world war .
The concerns have only risen as the “ tripolar order ” – Europe , North America and Asia – has continued to evolve .
Every day Latin America , too , is becoming more independent .
Now Asia and the Americas are strengthening their ties while the reigning superpower , the odd man out , consumes itself in misadventures in the Middle East .
Regional integration in Asia and Latin America is a crucial and increasingly important issue that , from Washington ’s perspective , betokens a defiant world gone out of control .
Energy , of course , remains a defining factor – the object of contention – everywhere .
China , unlike Europe , refuses to be intimidated by Washington , a primary reason for the fear of China by US planners , which presents a dilemma : steps toward confrontation are inhibited by US corporate reliance on China as an export platform and growing market , as well as by China ’s financial reserves – reported to be approaching Japan ’s in scale .
In January , Saudi Arabia ’s King Abdullah visited Beijing , which is expected to lead to a Sino - Saudi memorandum of understanding calling for “ increased cooperation and investment between the two countries in oil , natural gas and investment ” , the Wall Street Journal reports .
Already much of Iran ’s oil goes to China , and China is providing Iran with weapons that both states presumably regard as deterrent to US designs .
India also has options .
India may choose to be a US client , or it may prefer to join the more independent Asian bloc that is taking shape , with ever more ties to Middle East oil producers .
Siddharth Varadarjan , the deputy editor of the Hindu , observes that “ if the 21st century is to be an ‘ Asian century , ’ Asia ’s passivity in the energy sector has to end ” .
The key is India - China cooperation .
In January , an agreement signed in Beijing “ cleared the way for India and China to collaborate not only in technology but also in hydrocarbon exploration and production , a partnership that could eventually alter fundamental equations in the world ’s oil and natural gas sector ” , Varadarjan points out .
An additional step , already being contemplated , is an Asian oil market trading in euros .
The impact on the international financial system and the balance of global power could be significant .
It should be no surprise that President Bush paid a recent visit to try to keep India in the fold , offering nuclear cooperation and other inducements as a lure .
Meanwhile , in Latin America left - centre governments prevail from Venezuela to Argentina .
The indigenous populations have become much more active and influential , particularly in Bolivia and Ecuador , where they either want oil and gas to be domestically controlled or , in some cases , oppose production altogether .
Many indigenous people apparently do not see any reason why their lives , societies and cultures should be disrupted or destroyed so that New Yorkers can sit in their SUVs in traffic gridlock .
Venezuela , the leading oil exporter in the hemisphere , has forged probably the closest relations with China of any Latin American country , and is planning to sell increasing amounts of oil to China as part of its effort to reduce dependence on the openly hostile US government .
Venezuela has joined Mercosur , the South American customs union – a move described by Nestor Kirchner , the Argentinian president , as “ a milestone ” in the development of this trading bloc , and welcomed as a “ new chapter in our integration ” by Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva , the Brazilian president .
Venezuela , apart from supplying Argentina with fuel oil , bought almost a third of Argentinian debt issued in 2005 , one element of a region - wide effort to free the countries from the controls of the IMF after two decades of disastrous conformity to the rules imposed by the US - dominated international financial institutions .
Steps toward Southern Cone [ the southern states of South America ] integration advanced further in December with the election in Bolivia of Evo Morales , the country ’s first indigenous president .
Morales moved quickly to reach a series of energy accords with Venezuela .
The Financial Times reported that these “ are expected to underpin forthcoming radical reforms to Bolivia ’s economy and energy sector ” with its huge gas reserves , second only to Venezuela ’s in South America .
Cuba -Venezuela relations are becoming ever closer , each relying on its comparative advantage .
Venezuela is providing low - cost oil , while in return Cuba organises literacy and health programmes , sending thousands of highly skilled professionals , teachers and doctors , who work in the poorest and most neglected areas , as they do elsewhere in the third world .
Cuban medical assistance is also being welcomed elsewhere .
One of the most horrendous tragedies of recent years was the earthquake in Pakistan last October .
Besides the huge death toll , unknown numbers of survivors have to face brutal winter weather with little shelter , food or medical assistance .
“ Cuba has provided the largest contingent of doctors and paramedics to Pakistan , ” paying all the costs ( perhaps with Venezuelan funding ) , writes John Cherian in India ’s Frontline magazine , citing Dawn , a leading Pakistan daily .
President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan expressed his “ deep gratitude ” to Fidel Castro for the “ spirit and compassion ” of the Cuban medical teams – reported to comprise more than 1,000 trained personnel , 44 % of them women , who remained to work in remote mountain villages , “ living in tents in freezing weather and in an alien culture ” , after western aid teams had been withdrawn .
Growing popular movements , primarily in the south but with increasing participation in the rich industrial countries , are serving as the bases for many of these developments towards more independence and concern for the needs of the great majority of the population .
TorrentSpy closed its doors last month
File - sharing site TorrentSpy has been ordered to pay $ 110 m ( £ 56 m ) in damages to the Motion Picture Association of America for copyright infringement .
The ruling from a court in the United States comes just weeks after the website shut down .
TorrentSpy facilitated the illegal sharing of copyright files by hosting a collection of links to films and music .
TorrentSpy parent company Valence Media and its owners Justin Bunnell and Wes Park have filed for bankruptcy .
The MPAA first began legal action against the website in February 2006 .
" This substantial money judgement sends a strong message about the illegality of these sites , " said Dan Glickman , chairman of the MPAA .
" The demise of TorrentSpy is a clear victory for the studios . "
TorrentSpy utilised a legitimate file - sharing technology called BitTorrent .
It makes it easier to exchange large files over the internet without having to rely on central servers , with individual users sending and sharing bits of files .
In a four - page ruling , US District Judge Florence - Marie Cooper said that TorrentSpy had to pay $ 30,000 for " each of the 3,699 infringements shown " .
The judgement is one of the largest fines ever handed down for copyright theft .
TorrentSpy shut down on 24 March and the website now has a message saying it has closed as " the ultimate method of privacy protection " .
It states : " The legal climate in the USA for copyright , privacy of search requests , and links to torrent files in search results is simply too hostile . "

Times change , and a Living Constitution must change with them .
Accordingly , I suggest that modernization of the old Bill of Rights is urgently required along the following lines .
1. Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of fiscal responsibility ; or abridging the freedom of shopping at the mall or surfing online porn sites ; or the right of the people peaceably to cower in their homes , and to petition the Government for bombing the Iranians back into the Stone Age if they so much as whisper the Farsi word for “ nuclear . ”
2 . A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State , such Militia has no place in our country , wherein the people clamor not for freedom , but for the illusion of security — besides the old state militias were effectively incorporated into the national military establishment by the National Defense Act of 1916 , so the matter is moot .
No private person needs a gun ; the police have shown that they can and will protect everybody at all times .
3 . No soldier shall , in time of peace be quartered in any house , without the consent of the Department of Defense , nor in time of war , but in a manner to be prescribed by the president or , if he be a moron , by the scheming vice president lurking behind the throne .
4 . The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated unless the government wants to violate this right for national - security or other half - plausible reasons , and no Warrants shall issue , period , because a self - issued warrant known as a National Security Letter , written by any FBI agent with or without a good reason , will do just as well , maybe better , for the government , allowing the judges to get out to the golf course by mid-afternoon at latest .
5 . No person shall be held to answer for any capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury or if the government labels him an unlawful enemy combatant or a material witness to something or other ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb unless the judge lets the prosecutor get away with the imposition of such double jeopardy ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself unless waterboarded till he confesses to every crime known to man ; nor shall be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law , so the government must go through certain make - believe motions as a pretense of fair dealing ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation , unless corrupt local officials have entered into a sweetheart deal with real - estate developers who want somebody ’s house or business for their own private profit - seeking use , in which case all bets are off .
6 . In all criminal prosecutions , the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed , shall be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation , shall be confronted with witnesses against him , shall have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor , and shall have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense , except when the government has declared him subject to the Military Commissions
Act or peremptorily hauled him off to Guantánamo or Egypt or Bulgaria or some other hellhole where he will be tortured until he wishes he had never been born and tells his assailants whatever he can imagine might make them stop hurting him .
7 . In suits at common law , where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars , the right of trial by jury shall be preserved , and no fact tried by a jury , shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States , than according to the rules of the common law — but if anybody thinks this provision will help him escape the clutches of an ambitious prosecutor itching for higher office , then he sure as hell has n’t had much experience in the courts .
8. Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted except when the judge , not liking the looks of the accused , decides to throw the book at him to impress the law - and - order conservatives who for some reason imagine that only scumbags and ethnic Untermenschen ever become entangled in the legal system ’s arbitrary , capricious , and cruel web .
9 . Only an ink blot appears here ( formerly , before the ink blotted , it appears to have read , “ the enumeration in the Constitution , of certain rights , shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people , ” but no one now living can imagine what such words might have meant ) .
10 .
Only an ink blot appears here , too ( formerly , before the ink blotted , it appears to have read , “ the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people , ” but such a provision makes no sense whatever , because had it been in effect , it would have prohibited virtually everything the national government has done routinely for the past century or more ) .

About a month ago , Joe Lieberman explained that he ’s open to delivering the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in September .
“ If Sen . McCain , who I support so strongly , asked me to do it , if he thinks it will help him , I will , ” Lieberman told The Hill .
At the time , the Democratic Senate leadership did n’t seem prepared to do anything about Lieberman ’s antics .
Asked whether Lieberman ’s chairmanship was at risk in the next Congress , Majority Leader Harry Reid said succinctly , “ No . ” Majority Whip Dick Durbin added , “ We have one difference of opinion , maybe two with Sen. Lieberman .
As a whip , I can tell you time and again , he ’s been there when we ’ve needed him . ”
Democratic discontent , however , seems to be on the rise .
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) could be stripped of his chairmanship of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee after the next election , Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) has said .
Speaking to MSNBC host Keith Olbermann on Friday , Reid suggested the former Democrat , who lost to a left - wing primary challenger in 2006 and has now endorsed Sen.
John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) for the presidency , is not guaranteed to keep his prestigious chairmanship .
Olbermann asked Reid if there was “ anything that he could do that would make you move to take his leadership position away on Homeland Security . ”
The majority leader responded : “ Yes , of course , ” but did not elaborate .
Earlier on Friday , Reid added , “ I think it ’s wrong what he ’s done [ campaigning for McCain ] , and I told him that . ”
A Lieberman aide told The Hill , “ Sen . Reid has made it clear that the chairmanship is absolutely not in jeopardy . ”
A month ago , I ’d say that sounded right .
Now , I ’m not sure .
The Guardian added this item yesterday , suggesting the Republican convention may be the line Lieberman cannot cross , as far as the Democratic leadership is concerned .
Senator Joseph Lieberman , a stalwart backer of John McCain who calls himself an “ independent Democrat ” , could face punishment from the Democratic party if he is asked to speak at this summer ’s Republican convention . [ … ]
Reid today left the door open to sanctioning Lieberman if he speaks in favour of McCain ’s nomination .
“ I ’ll consider anything , ” Reid said at a breakfast with reporters today , adding that the Democratic presidential nominee , likely Barack Obama , would want to weigh in on Lieberman ’s future role .
Hmm .
A month ago , Reid suggested Lieberman is safe .
Yesterday , he ’s open to possible consequences .
I suppose the obvious question , then , is why Reid balked at the notion of punishing Lieberman when asked about this a month ago .
My suspicion is that Reid , at least at the time , did n’t want to spark a controversy or show his cards — he abruptly said “ no ” when asked whether Lieberman ’s chairmanship was at risk , tamping down speculation .
But over the last several weeks , my bet is that Reid has grown increasingly frustrated , and has probably heard an earful from some members of the Senate Democratic caucus .
Perhaps the talk we ’ve heard from Reid over the last five days is an effort to lay the groundwork for the punishment to come ?
At this point , I get the sense it ’s a distinct possibility .
In October 2002 , before it was fashionable to be against the Iraq invasion Barack Obama made a speech which said in part
But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States , or to his neighbors , that the Iraqi economy is in shambles , that the Iraqi military a fraction of its former strength , and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until , in the way of all petty dictators , he falls away into the dustbin of history .
I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a US occupation of undetermined length , at undetermined cost , with undetermined consequences .
I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East , and encourage the worst , rather than best , impulses of the Arab world , and strengthen the recruitment arm of al - Qaeda .
I am not opposed to all wars .
I ’m opposed to dumb wars .
Hillary voted for that dumb war and McCain wants to continue that dumb war indefinitely .
A Harvard - educated Manhattan jet - setter has been pegged as the money - laundering mastermind behind a massive LSD drug ring run out of a Kansas missile silo , The Post has learned .
Stefan Wathne , a 39 - year - old scion of New York ’s socially prominent Wathne apparel family , surrendered to federal agents Jan. 7 as he stepped off a plane at Newark Airport – after three years on the lam .
Wathne is accused in a 2005 federal indictment of laundering as much as $ 3 million through Russia between 1996 and 2000 for what authorities have described as the most prolific LSD operation in US history .
His arrest marks the latest chapter in a bizarre federal drug case that has unfolded over five years and featured a surreal cast of characters .
In addition to Wathne – an erstwhile financial planner and former American Ballet Theatre trustee – the case has included a prominent Harvard psychiatrist and a deputy director of a UCLA drug - study program .
In another strange twist , singers Sting and Paul Simon helped pay the legal bills for a witness in the case .
The drug ring was cracked in November 2002 , when the US Drug Enforcement Agency descended on a decommissioned military silo outside Topeka , which had been converted to a lab capable of churning out massive amounts of LSD .
The drug , formally known as lysergic acid diethylamid and originally used to study personality disorders , is the most potent hallucinogen known .
The government banned it in 1966 .
The feds arrested the Princeton - and Harvard - educated head of the operation , William Leonard Pickard , a noted chemist who at the time was deputy director of UCLA ’s Drug Policy Analysis program .
Pickard and an accomplice , California computer specialist Clyde Apperson , were charged with conspiracy and possession to distribute after agents seized enough raw material to produce 16 million doses of LSD , with an estimated street value of as much as $ 160 million .
The arrests put Wathne on the DEA ’s radar .
A Reykjavik - born Icelandic national whose family later put down roots here , Wathne was introduced to Pickard through Dr. John Halpern , a leading psychedelic researcher from Harvard ’s prestigious McLean Hospital .
Halpern , records show , was paid $ 319,000 by Pickard from 1996 to 1999 – the same years Wathne is charged with laundering money for Pickard .
Testimony at Pickard ’s drug trial suggested that Halpern was paid for the Wathne introduction .
Wathne ’s alleged role in the LSD ring was to take drug money , cycle it through Russia and then send it back to Pickard , partly in the form of a “ donation ” to his UCLA research program , according to testimony at Pickard ’s trial .
After the silo bust , Halpern made a deal with the feds and ratted out his friends .
He also rolled on a one - time New Mexico business partner , Alfred Savinelli , from whom Pickard had bought chemicals and glassware to make LSD .
Savinelli , whose company , Native Scents , sells botanicals and oils , was called as a witness .
He testified that part of his legal bill was paid by Sting and Paul Simon , whom he counted as friends .
The two entertainers have declined to comment on the case .
Pickard was convicted in 2003 and is serving multiple life sentences .
Wathne had by then vanished from the New York scene and was reportedly living in Russia .
Indicted in San Francisco federal court , he was declared a fugitive by the DEA .
A smooth - talking bon vivant fond of Rolex watches and expensive foreign cars , Wathne was well - known in social circles from Manhattan to Moscow .
In addition to being an ABT trustee , he sat on the board of the American Russian Youth Orchestra , which counts Laura Bush as its honorary chairwoman .
Wathne ’s 60 - something mother , Thorunn , and her sisters , Soffia , 51 , and Berge , 59 – a photogenic trio nicknamed “ the triplets ” and known for dressing alike in couture outfits at social functions – are fixtures on Manhattan ’s charity and party circuit .
Avid sportswomen , the three women made a fortune with their luxury outdoor and equestrian - related apparel and accessory firm .
They sold to Bergdorf Goodman and I .
Magnin and had a namesake boutique on West 57th Street that boasted Venetian plaster walls , a fireplace with a hand - carved limestone mantel and chandeliers made of antlers .
The firm also produced high - end luggage for designer Ralph Lauren .
Stefan Wathne headed the Moscow Institute for Advanced Studies , a nonprofit group run out of the West 56th Street Manhattan headquarters of the Wathne sisters ’ apparel business .
The charity was staffed by Wathne employees , tax records show .
Wathne – who also used the alias Gunner Stefan Moller – was arrested in New Delhi on Sept. 24 , 2007 .
Authorities here were trying to extradite him from India when he voluntarily agreed to return to the United States .
His arrest has sparked a new round of headaches for his family .
The mega - wealthy Wathne women recently sold off an $ 8 million oceanfront home in Nantucket .
In 2001 , they shuttered the Manhattan boutique .
They still hold millions in property around the city and own homes in Rye , Westchester County , and in Key Largo , Fla. , records show .
On Jan. 10 , Wathne pleaded not guilty to the money - laundering charges .
He surrendered his passport and was freed on $ 5 million bond to the custody of the Wathne sisters .
Part of the family ’s vast real - estate holdings – including six apartments on Central Park South – were put up as collateral .
If convicted , Wathne faces up to 20 years in the slammer .
An assistant for the Wathnes referred calls to a lawyer , who did not return calls .
Outside the family home in Rye , a chauffeur said Stefan Wathne is n’t talking .

Recently , the Green Zone parliament in Baghdad drafted a law that would forbid any political party that has an armed wing from participating in the upcoming regional elections in Iraq .
This law comes on the heels of an announcement by the Green Zone leader al - Maliki stating very similar terms .
The obvious target of this law are the forces behind al - Sadr known as the Mehdi Army .
Other factions in Iraqi politics that might be affected include the various Sunni groups that maintain an armed wing not approved by the US and those few secular parties that remain in Iraq and feature armed elements .
Despite any proclamations to the contrary claiming that Iraqi groups other than the aforementioned will also be affected , the reality is that other political parties that have so - called militias are the forces of Dawa and SCIRI , and the Kurdish parties .
The first two groups have , for all practical purposes , integrated their militias into the official security forces and the Kurds are very unlikely to dismantle their Peshmerga merely because the Green Zone government asks them to .
After all , it can be reasonably argued that the Green Zone parliamentarians and their US sponsors need the Kurds more than the Kurds need either of them .
As for those Sunni groups , popularly known as the Awakening Councils , their existence as legitimate armed forces exists primarily at the whim of the US .
This means that at any time , they too could become outlaw forces and the target of the Green Zone government .
No matter what happens in this most recent power struggle between the US - sponsored regime in Baghdad and the forces arrayed against it , the political situation will likely become more inflammatory .
If al - Sadr ’s movement and other anti-occupation elements stand down their militias , they stand to command a large minority if not an outright majority in the Green Zone legislature .
If that happens , then Washington ’s plans will suffer immensely and legislative calls for a withdrawal of all US forces will increase in strength and frequency .
If the opposition groups that are also armed refuse to turn in their arms and stand down , the fighting will most likely increase as Green Zone forces and their US backers intensify their military campaign to defeat them .
Either way , the political tenor will probably become more radical on the Iraqi street and Washington and its occupier government will grow weaker and less legitimate than it already is .
Why should these militias stand down ?
If events both recent and not - so - recent are any indication , the political decision by parties opposed to the US occupation to give up their arms only means that the occupiers and their client forces can attack them with even greater impunity .
In other words , if they give up their guns , the political resistance faces the very real possibility of both figurative and literal obliteration .
Already , the occupier ’s forces have used the truce declared by al - Sadr to arrest members of his militia and erect concrete barriers on major streets going in and out of the part of Baghdad known as Sadr City .
For the Sadrist forces and others opposed to the occupation and Green Zone government to follow the proposed law discussed above would only make the job of getting rid of those political forces opposed to Washington ’s plans for Iraq that much easier .
It ’s obvious by now that Washington has no intention of trying to win the hearts and minds of the people who claim al - Sadr as their political leader .
Without this option , the only remaining choice is neutralization — a choice ultimately made by Saddam , as well .
It is a choice that haunted him and will haunt Washington , too .
Once again , the only true solution to this conundrum and every other problem brought on by the continuing US occupation of Iraq is a complete US withdrawal .
If public opinion polls are to be believed ( and the sheer consistency of the results in this instance indicates they should be ) , the majority of Iraqis want the US occupiers out of their country .
This has been the case since the end of the first year of occupation and will most likely continue to be the case unless Washington somehow manages to silence every single Iraqi that opposes their presence .
Then again , opinion polls of US residents have consistently shown that they too want US troops out of Iraq , yet the troops are still there doing the work of the few Americans and Iraqis who truly benefit from their presence .
Instead , the US Congress is trying to convince the bureaucrats that the US military props up the Green Zone to pay for the US endeavor in Iraq .
Two Democrats and one Republican ( Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska , Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democrat Evan Bayh of Indiana ) are now drafting legislation that would replace all future aid grants to Washington ’s client regime with loans .
This is what passes for opposition legislation in the United States these days .
In actuality , it is just another attempt by Washington to blame Iraq for the mess the occupation has created .
Furthermore , the fact of reconstruction is more myth than anything else and what exists is rife with corruption in almost every facet .
Besides all this , the loans would keep Baghdad in debt for a considerably long time , forcing any government there to spend its resources not only on so - called reconstruction costs but on interest payments , as well .
In regards to the militias , the legislation ’s sponsors hope that Baghdad will pay for the Awakening Councils , thereby making them a semi-official part of the Green Zone ’s security forces , despite al - Maliki ’s consistent opposition to the Councils ’ mere existence .
This fact alone seems likely to doom the legislation as proposed , if not completely .
The suggestion that Iraq should pay for its reconstruction assumes that the Iraqis asked to be destroyed by the US military .
It further assumes that the government set up by the occupiers is a government that is able and willing to fulfill the Iraqi people ’s desire for peace and freedom from occupation .
The reality is that this is nowhere near the case .
Not only does the Green Zone government exist because of the US military and intelligence presence on Iraqi soil , it exists because Washington allows it to .
Of course , one hopes that Iraq will someday pay for its rebuilding .
However , as long as its government is beholden to the US for its survival that is unlikely to occur .
On the cusp of greatness
By July 1985 , Commodore had everything going for it .
The Amiga computer had been demonstrated in public to rave reviews , and everyone was excited at the potential of this great technology .
That 's when the problems started .
The Commodore Plus / 4
Commodore 's primary woes were always about money , and 1985 was no exception .
Sales of the Commodore 64 were still going strong , but the price wars had slashed the profits on the little computer .
The company had invested millions of dollars creating new and bizarre 8 - bit computers that competed directly against the venerable C - 64 , such as the wholly incompatible Plus / 4 , that had no chance in the marketplace .
To make things worse , the company had to deal with lawsuits from its ousted founder , Jack Tramiel .
Finally , Commodore had invested $ 24 million to purchase Amiga outright , but as the computer had not gone on sale yet , there was no return on this investment .
All these financial problems put a strain on the company 's ability to get the Amiga ready to sell to the public .
Without a lot of spare cash , it was difficult to rush the production of the computer .
Further software delays pushed back the launch as well .
The end result was that the Amiga did not go on sale until August of 1985 .
This would n't have been a huge problem , had Commodore been able to gather enough resources to ship the machine in quantity .
Instead , production delays meant that the computers trickled off the assembly lines , and by October there were only 50 Amiga 1000 units in existence , all used by Commodore for demos and internal software development .
Jack Tramiel 's Atari ST
This delay was doubly crippling because Jack Tramiel had managed to rush the development of the Atari ST , using off - the - shelf chips and an operating system and GUI purchased from Digital Research .
Tramiel was able to show the ST off at the January CES and started taking orders for the computer shortly thereafter .
This sudden competition from Commodore 's former CEO took everyone by surprise .
Missing Christmas
Amiga 1000 computers did not start to appear in quantity on retail shelves until mid-November 1985 .
This was too late to make a significant impact on the crucial holiday buying season .
Most retailers make 40 percent or more of their yearly sales over the holidays , and Commodore had missed the boat .
To make matters worse , the company was not really clear about how it was going to sell the computer .
The Commodore 64 had been sold at big retail chains like Sears and K - Mart , but marketing executives felt that the Amiga was better positioned as a serious business computer .
Astoundingly , Commodore actually turned down Sears ' offer to sell Amigas .
Back in the 1980s , Sears was a major player in computer sales ; I personally used to cherish parental shopping visits so that I could get my hands on the latest in computer technology .
The Atari ST was sold there , but the Amiga was not .
Even these blunders might have been mitigated had Commodore come up with some truly amazing advertising campaigns to drum up interest in the new computer .
The delays gave the company extra time to do this , but what Commodore came up with was so awful that it sickened many of its own employees .
Dysfunctional capital markets , frantic central banks , stressed - out consumers , fear and uncertainty -- all are alarming echoes of the global economic cataclysm of the 1930s .
Which raises the inevitable question : Could another Great Depression be lurking over the horizon ?
TV news programs show grainy footage of Depression - era bankers as reporters tick off grim economic statistics .
The Federal Reserve invokes powers it has n’t used since the 1930s .
Critics of President Bush ’s economic policies are emboldened to use the H- word : “ Hoover . ”
On the surface , there are disquieting parallels between economic conditions in the early 1930s and those of today .
There is the popping of enormous asset bubbles -- stocks then , housing now .
And , as in the Great Depression , the financial system is in disarray .
It was symbolized back then by the failure of thousands of banks , mostly small , local outfits -- 2,300 in 1931 alone .
The parallel today is the crippling ofonetime giantssuch as Bear Stearns Cos. , Countrywide Financial Corp. and Ameriquest Mortgage Co .
Many economists believe that the U.S. will find it almost impossible to avert a recession , if one has not started already .
Housing remains mired in a deep slump , with some analysts projecting that Southern California home values could plunge 40 % from their peaks last year .
The Commerce Department reported this week that new residential building permits nationwide plummeted 36.5 % in February from a year earlier .
Then , like now , stock prices were highly volatile .
The S&P 500 index , which fell more than 56 % from 1928 through 1940 , nevertheless recorded four up years in that span , including a 46.5 % gain in 1933 .
The shadow of the ‘ 30s looms over every economic downturn or crisis , no matter how modest .
Pundits were quick to invoke the Depression as a cautionary model during the stock market crash of 1987 , the bailout of the giant hedge fund Long - Term Capital Management in 1998 and the dot - com meltdown of 2000 and 2001 .
But there are vast differences between the 1930s and today .
U.S. unemployment reached 25 % during the Depression ; last month it was reported at 4.8 % .
The international industrial economy was a shambles in the ‘ 30s .
Today it is coming off a global boom .
“ I ’ve been asked many times whether we will have another Great Depression , ” said David M. Kennedy , a Stanford University history professor and the author of “ Freedom From Fear , ” a Pulitzer Prize - winning history of the Depression and World War II .
“ My standard answer is that we wo n’t have that one again -- I ’d be surprised to have one of that seriousness and duration .
But that does n’t mean we would n’t have a catastrophe we have n’t seen before . ”
Economists and historians say the most important difference between today ’s economic environment and the old days is the government ’s role .
“ There ’s a perception now that you do n’t stand around at the central bank and whack people with a ruler for making bad decisions , ” said Robert Brusca , chief economist at New York - based Fact and Opinion Economics .
“ Instead , you do something . ”
Nothing demonstrates that as vividly as the Fed ’s orchestration of the takeover of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co. over the weekend .
The deal staved off a possible Bear bankruptcy , which the central bank feared might traumatize financial systems worldwide .
The resolution drew a stark contrast with the Fed ’s role in the 1930 collapse of the Bank of the United States , a New York institution largely serving Jewish immigrants .
The failure was then the largest in U.S. history , and the Fed ’s inability to arrange a rescue by Wall Street banks -- including J.P. Morgan & Co. , the predecessor to the “ white knight ” in the Bear Stearns case -- caused a cataclysmic loss of confidence in the entire national banking system .
That fueled a panic that historians regard as a key cause of the Depression .
The Fed ’s relative powerlessness in 1930 led directly to New Deal reforms that vastly expanded its authority .
Some of the agency ’s new powers , such as its ability to lend directly to brokers and investment banks , were seldom or never used until the current crisis .
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke , an expert in the central bank ’s Depression - era history , is also knowledgeable about the instruments at its disposal in a crisis .
In a 2002 speech -- he was then a member of the central bank ’s Board of Governors under Alan Greenspan -- he outlined a number of drastic steps the Fed could take in extreme conditions and still remain within its legal authority .
Among them were buying up foreign government debt to influence dollar exchange rates , and even lending , if indirectly , against private assets .
The subject of Bernanke ’s speech was how to combat deflation , a broad decline in consumer prices that is not currently a problem on the Fed ’s agenda .
Still , the powers he described could apply in a wide range of dire scenarios .
But as Fed Vice Chairman Donald L. Kohn conceded in testimony before a Senate committee this month , the most serious challenges generally arise not from scenarios that can be forecast but from the unforeseen .
Alluding , in effect , to the tendency of regulated industries to burst at their weakest seams , Kohn blamed “ the most sophisticated banks ” for allowing credit rating agencies such as Moody ’s and Standard & Poor ’s to paper over the unsoundness of mortgage securities on their books .
The agencies bestowed lofty AAA ratings on some extremely complex mortgage bundles even though their inherent risks were not understood .
The banks and firms that packaged the securities and hawked them to clients simply accepted the rating agencies ’ conclusions , which were often favorable to the packagers .
The dubious valuations of many of these securities are at the core of the credit crisis roiling the financial markets today .
Brusca , the economist , says the most dangerous behavior often occurs just beyond regulators ’ reach -- in the exotic strategies of the hedge fund industry , to use a contemporary example .
“ We have a far more extensive regulatory network now , ” he said , “ but it ’s always the unregulated sector that pushes change . ”
Does it make sense to require banks to maintain adequate capital relative to their obligations , Brusca added , “ but let them have an unregulated hedge fund ? ”
There are also limits to what monetary policy -- the Fed ’s responsibility -- can achieve on its own to forestall a drastic economic downturn .
The Franklin D. Roosevelt administration not only reformed the Fed but also experimented with stimulative fiscal policy , such as unemployment relief .
New Deal programs aimed at staving off a wave of home foreclosures may be especially relevant today .
Among the most important was the Home Owners Loan Corp. , or HOLC , which is one of several models for homeowner relief being considered by Congress .
HOLC took over 1 million mortgages in default starting in 1933 , worked to keep the owners in their homes and made new loans to strapped mortgage holders .
When the agency was finally liquidated in 1951 , it even returned a small profit to the U.S. Treasury .
The Fed ’s recent actions were “ a temporary palliative ” to the fundamental problem in the economy , which is the rapid fall in home prices and its ripple effect on mortgage bonds and other securities , said Barry Eichengreen , a professor of economics and political science at UC Berkeley .
“ You have to reorganize the system , but the discussion about that has only begun . ”

29.May.MVM Illinois Pork Producers ' Association
6411 South 6th Street Rd
Springfield , IL 62707 - 8630 Gentlemen : Each day as I sit in the diner opposite my house , eating my bacon and drinking my milk , I wonder : why do n't we drink pig milk ?
Pork is such a natural and essential part of life .
It gives us ham and bacon , spam and red-hots , pork chops and lard .
But whereas cows give us so many delicious meat products , they also provide us with dairy .
Pigs are mammals too .
They lactate , do n't they ?
Why do n't we harvest it ?
Does their milk taste bad ?
It is toxic ?
Is it simply unattractive , perhaps an opalescent brown - green that blinds all to its delicious flavor ?
Is it hard to milk a pig ?
Do they produce enough milk to make it worthwhile ?
Is it too viscous or thin to be of any industrial or domestic use ?
Can you make cheese from pork milk ?
Or yogurt ?
Or butter ?
Can you cook with it ?
Make pasta sauce , or use the cream in fancy coffee drinks ?
As you can see , I have lot of questions about pork dairy potential .
It 's a topic I do n't know much about .
But I want to , because I 'm sure that there 's a good reason for the way things are , and I 'm curious about it .
Please write me back and let me know why such a potentially lucrative and delicious resource has not yet been tapped .
Thank you very much .

Dear Guy : I was excited to hear that each day you sit down to a meal of bacon , because today 's pork products are 31 % leaner than they were ten years ago .
Pork is delicious and very healthy as many physicians recognize it as a very important source of protein .
But the opportunity they present to the dairy industry is very limited .
Porcine do lactate and their milk I will assume would taste great , because it is made of 8.5 % fat in relation to the fat that makes up 3.5 % of the components in cows milk .
The other components such as lactose and water are found at nearly the same percentages in pig 's milk .
However , pigs will on average produce 13 lbs of milk in a day as compared to cows that produce 65 lbs of milk on average per day .
Pigs unlike cows cannot become pregnant while lactating and therefore possess a severe economic problem to producers .
whfle pigs consume less feed per day , economics does not allow pigs to be a viable source of dairy products .
The biggest challenge facing the porcine dairy industry is collecting the product .
Pigs on average have fourteen teats as opposed to cows that have four teats .
Pigs also differ from cows in their milk ejection time , a cows milk ejection is stimulated by the hoimone oxytocin and can last ten minutes , where as a pig 's milk ejection time only last fifleen seconds as the suckling pigs stimulate the release of oxytoc in .
The technology of a 14 cupped mechanized milking machine that can milk a pig in 15 seconds is not available to pork producers .
I hope I have answered your questions and I encourage you to think about developing a pig milking machine as you eat your bacon in the fixture .
Good Luck Bradley Wolter

10 . December.1992 Victorinox Cutlerers
Switzerland Gentlemen ,
Let me begin by telling you that I love your knives .
In fact , both for camping and around the home , I know of no more useful tool than a Victorinox .
Your knives are durable , practical , and very well conceived .
Each variety seems perfectly suited to its specific purpose ( I have the camping type ) and is carefully constructed to be of maximum utility .
However , one thing perplexes me , and it is primarily about this that I write to you .
You see , the bottom of my Victorinox camping knife sports a hook which pulls out from the body of the knife , and I am uncertain about what that hook is supposed to do .
I have shown it to several of my friends , but none of them has been able to provide me with a definitive answer .
Some have suggested that it is for sliding down a zip - wire .
Others think that it serves to tighten bootlaces .
Still others hold that the hook can remove fishhooks from captured seafood , while another group maintains that it is simply a general - purpose hook , offering itself to whatever task requires it , whether that be closing overstuffed suitcases or retrieving lost tampons .
Although each of these suggestions is conceivably correct , none of them has me absolutely convinced .
I still long to know the official job for which this hook was designed .
Apart from this one feature , I use my knife all the time .
I 'm hooked on it .
I only wonder what it should be hooked on ?
Please write me with an explanation , so that I can use my Victorinox knife to its fullest potential .
The confusion about my knife is really cutting me up inside .
Eagerly awaiting a reply , Guy Petzall .
They sent me this nice letter ( how 's that for Swiss efficiency ? ) and an informative booklet ... something along the lines of " a hook is a hook , you silly American . "
... well ...
I 'll show THEM silly American !
Kimberly - Clark Corporation
Depends Division
351 Phelps Drive
Irving , TX 75038 Dear Lifestyle Enablers :
The bathroom in my apartment sits all the way at the back of the building , a long walk down a long hallway , a journey often made to seem even longer by the anxiety of urgent necessity .
To compound this problem , I enjoy having parties in my home , yet with only one restroom so far away from the theater of action , you can imagine the congestion and discomfort that often ensue .
But thanks to you , I think I have struck upon a way to resolve this issue , to let my friends relax , and to allow all their various conversations and enjoyments to proceed without interruption .
The idea is a simple one : lock the bathroom door , distribute Depends undergarments to each of my esteemed guests as they arrive , provide them with a space to install themselves into their new diapers , and then serve everyone lots and lots of liquid refreshments .
Thus , I reason , their issue could be made into a non-issue .
It 's crude , but , you must admit ( for such is your mission ) , effective .
But I do n't like to go into such projects unprepared or uninformed -- half - assed , you might even say .
So I would like to know some technical specifications , if you do n't mind , prior to making concrete plans .
First of all , I am curious to know something about how Depends undergarments function .
Do they operate on the same principle as conventional diapers for young children , or is there a higher technology at play , something reserved for older incontinents ?
I imagine that all sorts of space - age polymers and gels might be employed , as well as any number of property - specific fabric layers cunningly concocted in your laboratory .
Absorption control .
Comfort control .
Aroma control .
Do tell .
Also , and this is a more practical matter , what is the holding capacity of your product ?
There must be some limit to the volume of exudate which your undergarments can handle before they absolutely must be changed for fresh ones , and in the interest of planning this little soiree , I would like to know that limit .
One beer contains 12 ounces ( 355 ml ) , an average cocktail roughly half that amount .
It would , in my opinion , be the height of poor taste to have less than the appropriate undergarment - to - libation ratio available to my distinguished friends .
Another area of concern regards the gender - flexibility of Depends undergarments .
Do men and women need different products , either as a question of fit , or as a response to the chemical - and ph-variations between the sexes ' respective outputs ?
And lastly , what about " # 2 " ?
Since the restroom will inaccessible to my select invitees , and realizing that food will likely be served as well , the possibility for exträurinary effluvial release must be considered .
Is your product equipped to serve this function ?
Thank you for your help , and if you can think of any other details I may have overlooked , I would appreciate whatever expert advice you feel free to share .
I am relying on you , counting on your product , and hanging on your every word .
I look forward to your response .
Most earnestly , Guy Petzall .

2211 N. Oak Park Boulevard
Chicago , Illinois 60635
To whomever might be interested , Driving south on I - 55 between Chicago and St. Louis to spend Thanksgiving with my family , I passed a truck sporting a small sign on its back panel .
Printed on the sign was the slogan " Expert Free Medical Care " , and the name of your hospitals .
I think you have a word order problem here .
You see , the absence of the hyphen notwithstanding , your sign could very easily be read to mean " Expert - Free Medical Care , " and no one wants medical care that is expert - free , no matter how cheap it is .
The sign , I think , would more appropriately read , " Free Expert Medical Care " .
I know that you do good work and that you provide a solid and necessary service to the community .
I just wanted to point out to you that your advertising campaign for that service could be better presented with the change I propose .
I hope you have a very joyous and plentiful holiday season .
Suggestively , Guy Petzall .

30.Oct.1998 British Airways
PO Box 5619
Sudbury Suffolk
CO10 2PG Gentlemen : I have flown a lot in my life , and I have never needed to use an airsick bag .
Which , as far as I can tell , is pretty standard : in our current stage of societal development , air transport has become a common part of life .
We grow up acclimatized to the motion , and we dont get sick .
And it is for this reason , I suppose , that the flight I took just two days ago , flight BA - 9 from Bangkok to Melbourne , did not offer airsickness bags as standard seat - pocket - phernalia .
I admire your trust that we can handle ourselves on an airplane , and I admire that you have found a way to eliminate a material cost , thus making all the tickets cheaper as well .
Your management system seems as streamlined as your aircraft .
I have also , however , traveled a great deal in Asia , in countries and environments where the people lead poorer and less sophisticated lives , on the whole , and where they have therefore not grown inured to the rigors of modern transportation .
Vomiting while in motion is for them almost a cultural mandate , something really incredible to behold .
Ive seen Malay children on boats spit up more than their entire body volume .
Ive seen teenage Indonesian girls and their grandmothers become ill simply by sitting on a bus before it even starts to move .
My friend Rick and I used to place bets , each time wed journey from one place to another , on who would lose their lunch first .
So what is my point ?
My point is that , as I sit here on this plane writing this letter , the Thai man on my right is looking a little bit uncomfortable .
Which worries me a bit because I know that , should he require an airsick bag , my lap is about the closest approximation hes gonna find .
Its a long flight already ; this anxiety only makes it longer , and should he choose to avail himself of my surface as a receptacle for bile , it will be a very torturous 10 - hours indeed , not to mention the poor light in which international customs agents tend to view people covered in vomit .
So please : return the airsick bags to their traditional location , sandwiched between the in - flight magazine and the safety card , and everyone will fly more comfortably .
Just thinking about all the poor nauseated passengers with no outlet for digestive expression really makes me sick to my stomach , and with nowhere else to go with it , I thought it necessary to pour these feelings into an envelope , and seal it , and send it to you .
Having landed safely , punctually , unspattered and grateful , Guy Petzall .
By the way , it turns out asians have been shown to be more susceptibe to motion sickness .
Somebody should inform the corporations .
19.April.1994 The Clorox Company
P.O. Box 24305
Oakland , California 94623 Gentlemen , Standing in my friends ' kitchen this evening , I spied what looked to be a plastic container of Purplesaurus Rex® flavored Kool - Aid TM .
I felt a sudden thirst , an overwhelming compulsion to drink , to seize the plastic spray - bottle and upend it into my arid , pasty mouth .
But , as fate would have it , the delicious - looking purple fluid was not Kool - Aid at all .
The plastic bottle contained a combination of isopropanol , grease cutter , surfactants , and fragrance .
Sound familiar ?
I almost gulped down 22 fluid ounces of your product , Formula 409 TM .
Please know that I am an adult .
I had no problem identifying my initial error easily in time to prevent myself from drinking your industrial - strength toxins .
But , and I cannot stress this to you enough , I shudder to think of all the children who might not be so prudent .
How could you be so unthinking ?
For while grease may be no match for Formula 409 , the potential blood on your hands will be far more difficult to remove when untold innocents drink your poison and die .
How often must this occur before you realize that , all marketing surveys aside , it 's simply a bad idea to make cleansers look like food ?
If you continue on your present course , I 'll get my cleanser from another source .
Please clean up your act .
Reproachfully , Guy Petzall .

6.may.2001 Sainsbury 's Supermarkets Ltd .
Stamford Street
London SE1 9LL Gentlemen : Even as I write to you , my friend Sarah is washing dishes downstairs using your product , Sainsbury 's Spring Bliss Washing Up Liquid .
But here 's the thing : she 's not rinsing them .
She just washes them and drops them , plate and cup alike , still sudsy , into the dishrack , and there leaves them to dry .
While it is true that I like to eat greasy food , I 'm not entirely convinced that your product 's claim of offering " 20 % better grease cutting power " is the way to alleviate my heartburn , because my heartburn is in no small part caused by worry that the ingredients in your dish cleaning liquid might not be all that good for us to eat .
Anionic surfactant , nonionic surfactant , amphoteric surfactant , hydrotrope , perfume and preservative : not my idea of a recipe for healthy living .
Yet Sarah insists that it 's perfectly OK to consume unrinsed quantities of Spring Bliss , in fact she insists that no one in Britain ever bothers to rinse their dishes , and that your product is made to fit the fashion .
I find this absolutely incredible , and therefore feel it necessary to write to you directly and ask if this is so .
I hope you have a truly blissful spring , and I look forward to your reply .
With all appropriate respect , Guy Petzall .
3.July .2001 Dear Mr Petzall
Thank you very much for your letter .
I am personally aware of the debate had between Americans and British about whether to rinse or not to rinse after using Washing - up Liquid .
Though originally from London I have spent sometime living in California and currently have an American housemate .
Under immense pressure from my American friends I agreed that I would rinse all dishes , cups , and so on under the water tap before allowing to dry on the side .
This is a practice that I have continued to this day .
However , our Formulated Household Technician has told me that if the correct amount of washing - up liquid is used it is perfectly safe to allow the suds to dry on the washing - up without rinsing .
I hope that you find this information useful and that you and your friend will be able to reach a satisfactory compromise on this matter .
Thank you again for writing .
Yours sincerely Adrian Johnson

I love movies , especially on a big screen and with bright color film rather than low resolution videotape .
However , one thing always disturbs me when I go to a theater .
Unfailingly , during the course of a movie , someone has to go to the bathroom , or has to go home , or to the hospital , or whatever .
And I 'm not saying that these are n't good reasons to leave .
What bothers me is that when they do exit the theater , in the very simple act of opening the door , they allow a blinding , piercing , annoying triangular shaft of light into the theater from the lobby beyond .
And this bolt of light disrupts my viewing of the show .
Now , you may say that I am perhaps being picky , that these are the woes of theater life .
And you would be right , except that a great deal of my annoyance at this seemingly trivial nuisance stems from my knowledge of how to curtail its ever happening .
My idea is this : install at the backs of the theaters not regular swinging double doors , but a pair of completely black revolving doors .
These doors would allow a great traffic of people through , as can be witnessed in any major city every day , and they would have the added benefits of being both quiet and light - tight .
No leaks , no disturbance , better enjoyment of movies for the audience , and perhaps more eager and better - paying customers for you as well .
I have given this much thought , and I sincerely feel that with this you could " revolutionize " the movie theater industry .
Eagerly awaiting feedback on what I think is a great idea , Guy Petzall .

Kraft Foods
800 Westchester Avenue
Rye Brook , NY 10573 USA Gentlemen :
This is not a letter of blame , nor of accusation .
I simply want to inform you of a situation , and hope that you will understand .
A few nights ago , I visited a Hoyt 's cinema in Santiago de Chile to see a movie .
To prevent interruption of the film , I decided to use the restroom before entering the theater .
I followed the signs downstairs , found the appropriate door , went through it .
Almost immediately , however , I exited again , shocked by what I had found .
It took me a moment to get my bearings back , I felt disoriented , confused , uncomfortable .
Because the restroom in that theater , although clean , hygenic , and completely unoffensive in every other way , smelled like Fruity Pebbles .
Exactly like Fruity Pebbles .
Bizarrely , precisely , incredibly , and unmistakably like Fruity Pebbles .
Now , I am neither a freak nor a fetishist , but I did have a very vivid childhood , and I know my breakfast cereals .
And , like I said , this is neither a letter of blame nor accusation .
But I would like to point out how disturbing this experience was for me .
Despite the known flexibility of chemical flavorings across a wide variety of industries , certain categories of experience are so distinct , so divergent , so completely exclusive of one another -- and rightly so -- that when they are somehow merged , a very uncomfortable psychology results .
For example , toilets and breakfast cereal , while perhaps sharing a causal connection , should by no means share anything else , and certainly not anything so evocative of essential character as an aroma .
Add to this how easily the name Fruity Pebbles can be misconstrued in itself given alternative contexts , and you might begin to form some notion of the sudden dread which burgeoned within my psyche and which caused me to flee the restroom before I even got a chance to use it .
Needless to say , the second half of the film was a rather difficult experience for me , but that is beside the point .
The point , simply put , is that bathrooms should not smell like food , nor should food smell like bathrooms .
And so , regardless of how this event came about , I thought that you both should be alerted to it , so that you could work out between yourselves exactly how it is that the restroom of a Chilean cinema should come to smell like an American breakfast cereal .
Until you do , each will continue to remind me of the other , and I wo n't be able to enjoy either one .
Thanks for everything .
I 'm going to the bathroom now .
Guy Petzall .

24.sept.99 United Artists Union Square 14 Theatre
850 Broadway
New York 10003 Gentlemen ...
Yesterday I visited your theater with 3 friends to see the classic animated feature Yellow Submarine .
Having seen the movie before , I expected to see a very funny , extremely psychedelic film featuring the music of the Beatles , enhanced with modern recording remixing techniques , and on a large screen with bright , crisp color .
I got what I expected , and enjoyed the film .
I have also seen other movies at your theater , and I knew to expect comfortable seats , a nice screen , and excellent surround - sound speakers .
Again , I was not disappointed : everything was as it should be , as I knew it would be , and I would definitely go to your theater to watch another film in the future .
However , before the film even began , while a United Artists Union Square 14
Theatre ad was flashing across the screen , I noticed that you claim to " guarantee a magical movie experience that exceeds our patrons ' expectations . "
I did have a magical movie experience .
But since I expected such , I have to admit that the experience as a whole did not live up to your guarantee .
I therefore ask that you make good on your promise , and offer my friends and I complimentary tickets to the next show we would like to see .
We want another magical movie experience .
And we 'll watch for that ad again .
Because though your theater is great , the tickets are expensive , and our accurate expectations are difficult to exceed .
Thank you very much for the magical movie experiences , and I look forward to many more in the future .
Cleverly , Guy Petzall .
November 8 , 1999 Dear Sir , I have received your letter and indeed our ad says we will exceed your expectations .
I am therefore " making good " on our promise by enclosing two free passes for you to come again .
I hope that the theatre will provide a more than magical experience this time around .
Feel free to drop us a comment anytime you feel necessary .
Thank you , Peter A. Revutin

5 - February - 1991 Amoco Corporation
Office of the Building
200 East Randolph Street
Chicago , Illinois 60601 Dear Sir ...
Yesterday night , Monday February fourth , I was driving south on Lake Shore Drive shortly after midnight .
Passing your building , which incidentally I think is one of the most beautiful in Chicago , I was astounded to see that nearly every window was lit .
I was shocked .
After all , you are Amoco , one of the chief oil companies in America , one of the largest suppliers of oil power to our country , yet practically every light in your entire monolithic eighty story building was on .
It struck me as improbable that every office was occupied , that every light was needed .
It seemed rather that very much energy was being wasted .
But this is nothing new .
The American economy is in a large sense built upon waste , upon consumption and extravagance .
But I was shocked that Amoco , a company that knows the value of energy , which has large assets at stake in the Gulf War , and which moreover owns one of the largest and most visible buildings in all of Chicago , would allow such conspicuous waste .
I would think that you more than most would understand the need for a more conservative energy policy , that you would be among the first to implement such a policy , and that you would be in the forefront of energy conservation , setting an example for the community and the world .
If indeed every office was occupied and every light truly needed , then I apologize .
But given the unlikelihood of this proposition , I must ask you to please think of the soldiers in the Middle East , fighting for among other things energy , and please consider how much of that energy you could save with a little prudence .
If nothing else comes of this war , I hope that America emerges with a new and more sensible energy policy , but if this aspiration is to be so openly disregarded by as powerful and well known a community example as Amoco , then such a policy can have no chance of taking hold in general .
Thank you for your time , Guy Petzall .

Chicago , IL 60637 Dear Mr. Petzall : I 'd like to thank you for your letter , and let you know that we agree with your philosophy regarding energy management .
Energy conservation is very important to Amoco and the nation , and every reasonable attempt should be made to conserve our resources and environment .
There are several factors regarding lighting management in the Amoco Building that may not be immediately obvious to an outside observer though .
For example , approximately 50 percent of the building is occupied by outside tenants , who control their own schedules in regard to lighting .
Several of these tenants have people working day and night .
In Amoco space , we primarily use open - office furniture planning , avoiding the use of floor - to - ceiling walls as much as possible .
Therefore , any lights which are activated on the floor will be evident at the windows .
At 7:00 p.m. , our computer controlled lighting management system turns off approximately 40 percent of the lights .
A reasonable level of lighting must remain on in order for the janitorial crews to clean the facility .
Lighting on our floors is zoned , and our lighting management program allows us to activate and deactivate zones in accordance with the janitorial schedules .
We have janitorial crews working 24 hours per day , although the bulk of their work is done by 1:30 a.m .
At 1:30 a.m. , most of the remaining lighting is deactivated with the exception of night lights for emergency egress and lighting in areas where people are working , creating the appearance that we 've left all our lights on due to the open - office environment .
The thing that is n't discernible by an outside viewer is that lighting levels are significantly reduced .
In comparing our energy costs per square foot to other high rise buildings , we are an exceptionally efficient building .
In fact , we 've been recognized by the American Society of Heating and Refrigeration Engineers for our energy management efforts .
In addition to lighting management , we ve retrofitted our building systems to include heat recovery systems , outside air economizers , and variable air volume systems in the building interior zones .
We are continuously searching for new technology to improve our energy management efforts .
In 1991 , we anticipate the beginning of a project to eventually ~ replace all fluorescent light fixtures in the building with higher efficiency , aesthetically pleasing light fixtures .
I hope this information helps to alleviate your concerns .

My anus is very important to me .
Not only is it one of the most tender and sensitive parts of my body , but I feel that it is by far one of the most useful as well .
And I think that it deserves very careful , very gentle treatment .
I have no desire to rub coarse - grain sandpaper on it , if you know what I mean .
In accordance with this personal be - nice - to - your - anus policy of mine , my companion Laurie and I recently purchased rolls of Charmin , Cottonelle and Northern bathroom tissues as well as your product , White Cloud .
Thus armed , we conducted what we like to think of as a taste - test .
We lived with them .
We wiped with them .
We blew our noses into them .
And I am very happy to inform you that in our unanimous opinion , your bathroom tissue has won the contest .
White Cloud is , in our opinion , the most appropriate tissue to use when wiping very delicate areas of the body , and , as I said before , I consider the anus to be very delicate .
It is a highly sensitive softness - detecting device , and your tissue came out on top with our bottoms .
I thought you would be interested in the results of an impartial , independent , and highly motivated examination .

Manager , Consumer Services
Procter & Gamble Company
P.O. Box 599
Cincinnati , Ohio 45201 Dear Ms. Puccini , Like all Americans , I watch television , and have therefore observed through your numerous advertisements that ERA PLUS is the only laundry detergent with the amazing cleaning power of protein , and as we all know , protein gets out protein .
In your ads , you show various words being written on different substances with your product : the word " grass " is inscribed in soap on a large grass stain , the word " blood " on a big red splotch , and so forth .
Then , invariably , each patch of dirt and soap - script is sprayed with water , revealing in clean white letters ERA 's powerful cleansing abilty .
My question to you is this : where does that large red stain , that enormous field of dried blood , come from ?
I have privately theorized about this mystery for years now .
Perhaps you have made a deal with a local butcher who , rather than discarding all the blood of his animal victims , donates or sells it to you for use in your ads .
However , this does not seem completely plausible to me , due to the difficulty and expense of transporting fresh blood .
Perhaps , then , you have a butcher in the actual television studio , slaughtering pigs over clean white sheets which are then given to your cleanser - calligrapher .
Or maybe it is beef blood .
This raises yet another question .
Assuming that the blood used in your ads is not human , which I believe would go against FCC regulations , how can you be certain that your product will act as effectively on human blood as it seems to work on the vital juice of whatever animal you are using as a paradigm ?
That is to say , do you test your detergent on human blood , or do you simply assume that all sanguinary fluid clots , and therefore dissolves , in the same way ?
And if you do test ERA on human blood , where do your test specimens come from ?
I do n't suppose that you have someone butchering people in the back room of some huge industrial complex for your detergent chemists to use for testing , do you ?
And if so , where do you get these people ?
Do you use children ?
Criminals ?
Immigrants , perhaps ?
Or human livestock raised specifically for this purpose ?
If the latter is the case , I hope that the strain you are using is one representative of the human race in general , at least as far as blood is concerned .
I 'd hate for all those arteries to be slit in vain .
I hope you respond to these very important questions .
I wo n't feel comfortable using ERA until my worries about your sanguinary policies are thoroughly washed away .
Quizzically yours , Guy Petzall .

Basking Ridge , New Jersey 07920 Gentlemen ....
In general , I like your products , which have always in my opinion been more sturdy and stable than the telephone equipment produced by most of your competitors .
Following this reasoning , I purchased one of your phones , model number 530 .
In many respects , I am very impressed with it .
There is only one problem .
Whenever the telephone gets even the slightest bit wet or damp , it internally electronically takes itself off the hook .
Even manually pushing the hang - up button down , has no effect : the phone spews out a dial tone unceasingly , ultimately concluding in that all too familiar " ER - ER - ER - ER - ER - ER - ER - ER " ultra -loud " hang up your phone " sound so effectively employed by the telephone company .
The only way to combat this is to unplug the entire unit , and even after this extreme measure has been taken , the " in use " light continues to flicker , running on battery power .
This is very troubling .
Now , you may say that the phone is not designed to get wet , to which I have two replies : firstly , that the phone should be made to withstand at least a little bit of moisture , but when my hand is at all moist and I answer the phone I know that I 'm going to be unplugging it soon ; and second , " wet " is far too strong a word for the minimum phenomenon which can completely disable my telephonic existence -- yesterday I had the phone in the bathroom where I was showering , and the ambient humidity alone was enough to render the telephone useless for the rest of the night .
The Wicked Witch of the West may have been politically powerful , but since water was a lethal poison to her , she was robbed of her dominance .
But where it took a whole bucketful to kill her , your product is susceptible to temporary destruction from mere atmospheric dampness .
I am unhappy with my telephone because of its hydrophobic tendencies , and am curious to learn of your reaction to this horror story .
I 'd have called you with this problem , but it 's raining today .

I had always worn Adidas Stan Smith tennis shoes .
Last summer , I purchased my first pair of Reeboks .
Inside the shoe , written on the tongue , are the following words : " From a tradition of over 90 years , these hand - made athletic shoes meet the demand for quality & performance required by today 's athlete . "
I have not found this to be the case .
An essential difference between the two types of shoes is that where the Adidas shoes are lined with some sort of petroleum - leather blend , yours have cloth lining .
Theirs last longer than yours .
Theirs slip on and off , yours wear through .
Four months after I purchased my Reebok sneakers , the cloth around the heel of each shoe had completely eroded away , exposing the leather underneath , and also exposing the plastic cup which gives support to the heel , but which now , in its unshielded state , acts as a razor - sharp blade of plastic which shaves a wafer - thin slice of flesh off of my heel each time I foolishly insert my foot into the shoe .
These hand - made athletic shoes did not meet the demand for quality & performance which I require .
And I 'm not even an athlete of today .
And I do n't like them .
And I 'm not going to buy another pair .

13.mar.99 Mr Stephen Jones
Managing Director / Chief Executive Officer
Greyhound Australia
Eddy Ave
Sydney NSW 2000
Australia Dear Sir :
This is a letter of congratulations .
I recently rode in one of your busses , an overnight from Dubbo , NSW to Brisbane , QLD , and I was surprised at the quality of the journey .
Even before I boarded , when I saw the driver tending to his mighty vehicle , I felt immediately assured by his confident demeanor and stable trustworthyness .
I was also heartily impressed by his uniform .
With his clean white knee - high socks , his dazzling white shorts , his brilliant white shirt -- and epaulets , no less -- his broad - brimmed insignia cap and brown loafers , he cut a massively present figure , a luminescent leader of people , a shepherd guiding our destinies .
I entered the bus and found my seat without a hint of reservation or pause , feeling secure , safe .
I knew I was in good hands .
And so you can imagine my delight when the bus started moving ( on time , of course ) and I realized that I had no neighbor !
That worked out great , because although I am of average height , on your busses my knees always seem to rub painfully against the seat in front of me , especially , but not only , when its occupant has adjusted it to its reclining position .
So with two seats at my disposal , I was free to lie across them , with my feet in the aisle , and using the window as a pillow .
And while this was of course not as comfortable as my own bed at home , it still felt infinitely better than sitting back in one chair , even at a lazy 45 degree reclining angle .
Somehow my back never quite matches the contours of your seats .
But with two whole seats at my disposal !
Of course I realize that they 're not designed to be used together by those lucky enough to have the option ( or they would be closer together and a little softer ) , but even so : what luxury !
And over the course of the evening , as I watched Australia move past the window , the stars rotate and then the sky lighten into a spectacular dawn , I got to try a wide variety of different ways to arrange myself with the advantage of the double - space , searching for a more natural position .
None was of course as comfortable as my own bed at home , but at least I had a choice of positions , and gratitude for it .
The video came as a pleasant surprise , and while I am generally not a fan of medium - budget films directed at pre-teen audiences , I am big enough to recognize the one you showed as an excellent example of the genre .
So the movie played , the night deepened , and our steady driver prudently switched on his hi-beam headlights .
And I suppose that the lights control must be located very near other switches on the dash , for , in turning on his bright lights , he , inadvertently , I think , switched on his public address microphone as well .
From that point on , we sleepy passengers were treated to a constant and soothing hiss from the overhead speakers , soporific , like a single protracted wave endlessly in the process of crashing onto an eternal nighttime beach .
This gentle soundtrack was only punctuated by occasional noises from our careful driver himself , an intermittent collection of gurgling , shifting , sniffling , throat - clearing , breathing sounds , comforting reminders of his persevering alertness , and also warm sounds in themselves , human sounds , as though in boarding his bus , we had each entered the moist security of his very womb ...
Well , just suffice it to say that it did feel like a genuine rebirth when , punctual as pie , our bus pulled into the Brisbane Transit Centre , and I stepped out into the fresh Queensland morning air , energetic despite my lack of sleep , and ready to take on a new day , in a new place , thanks to you .
You performed your service very adequately indeed , and I will definitely consider you first , the next time I need to travel and have no other means of transportation .
Give your driver my regards , and thanks for the ride .
Laudingly , Guy Petzall .

19 - October -1991 Mace
P.O Box 724207
Atlanta , Georgia 30339 Gentlemen .....
I have just watched one of your commercials on CNN .
It advertised a chemical weapon called Mace , which you manufacture .
In the ad , your product was described as a defensive weapon , whose primary use is to ward off assailants .
I think that this is a misleading claim , as Mace has at least as much offensive capacity as it has protective capability .
The thought of being mugged by an attacker bearing Mace makes me shudder , and you have to recognize that you are not just selling your chemical to honest , altruistic people , you are also indiscriminately distributing it to muggers , rapists , and other less than philanthropic customers as well .
In my opinion , so - called " defensive " weapons are inherently self - defeating in that in a very real way they create their own need .
All weapons are offensive .
And so was your ad .
Reproachfully , Guy Petzall
Other than Time Warner 's single - city foray into monthly data caps , consumption - based billing has mostly been little ISPs with little monopolies , and given the market , we thought it 'd stay that way .
Broadband Reports is , uh , reporting that now Comcast is mulling monthly caps ( which Comcast 's PR guy confirms , though not the details ) — something like 250GB , and then $ 1.50 for every GB over that .
According to their source , the idea has " a lot of momentum " and it'll start rolling out in the next two months .
The other part is that they 're going to start ramping up DMCA notices to pirate assholes , with a total disconnect if you 've gotten four letters in a 12 - month period .
Advertisement
If this is entering the mix with Comcast 's new " protocol agnostic " network management technique ( in something closer to English , very temporarily slowing down your whole connection if you 're hitting the pipe really hard at the same time as a lot of other people in your area ) , you 're looking at an uncomfortably restricted pipe ( to me anyway ) , even if they 're not targeting torrents specifically anymore , and the overage fees honestly are n't obscene .

The scary part is that this happening actually does make sense , for a couple of reasons .
One , P2P traffic is n't the biggest bandwidth hog , it 's streaming video , and this 'll get people to ( maybe ) cut down on their habit , however they 're sucking down bandwidth .
Second , it 'll keep them ( sorta ) clean with the FCC , which is seriously leaning toward transparency rules that would make ISPs be up front about this sort of thing anyway .
And after all , there 's no better motivator to watch your ass than money slipping out of your back pocket — no schmancy traffic management necessary .

The Cardiff Barfly may exude many things - including a regrettable and all - pervading aroma that can be traced back to the gentlemen 's lavatories - but a sense of glamour is not among them .
Outside , photocopied posters advertise forthcoming musical attractions .
The gig - goers of Glamorgan are invited to enjoy an appearance by the unpromisingly named Annotations of an Autopsy , an evening of extreme metal featuring not just Hate Eternal , but Cephalic Carnage as well , and the 2008 tour by veteran punks the UK Subs , complete with lead singer Charlie Harper , now 64 and still dutifully belting out Stranglehold and CID for anyone tough enough to brave the smell of the gents .
Inside , the members of Alphabeat sit huddled in what may be Britain 's least salubrious dressing room .
Handily located so that the band have to leave via the Barfly 's front door and walk down the street to reach the stage , it offers an intriguing line both in refreshments for the band - chief among them a tub of hummus that would cause lesser mortals to call health and safety and cancel tonight 's show on the spot - and graffiti .
A wag with a permanent marker has covered the wall in band names doctored to reflect a scatological bent .
" The White Shites , " reads vocalist Anders SG .
" U Poo. Limp Big Shit . "
His bandmates chuckle , but there 's something deeply incongruous about finding Alphabeat in these surroundings .
For one thing , they have a platinum album , albeit back home in Denmark .
For another , ever since they formed at school in the small town of Silkeborg , the sextet have unabashedly dealt in feelgood chart - friendly pop .
As if to reiterate the fact , their forthcoming album , This Is Alphabeat , features a gleeful assault on the eponymous 1978 debut single by John Lydon 's Public Image Limited .
The original is the kind of record that serious rock fans discuss in hushed and reverential tones .
Alphabeat 's version replaces Keith Levine 's scything post - punk guitar riff with jaunty whistling .
" I think we did it because we know that we are very pop , " says guitarist Anders B .
" So we thought it was quite a funny way to turn the song around because it was obviously a song that came just after punk " - he pronounces it " poonk " - " and we thought in a way , in this big indie scene that 's been here for quite a long time now , we were outsiders with this pop music . "
He frowns .
" We do n't want to go as far as saying we feel as poonk as Johnny Rotten , " he adds , hurriedly .
" I do n't know what those guys would think of that . "
There 's an argument that suggests one of the main reasons you might consider dealing in feelgood chart - friendly pop is to avoid having to sit in the dressing room of a grimy rock venue like the Cardiff Barfly .
After all , pop is supposed to be the genre that fast - tracks its stars into a glittering world of TV appearances , expensive videos and product endorsement .
Pop stars do n't pay their dues on what 's known as the toilet circuit .
If they perform live at all , they tend to do so in the kind of venues where Annotations of an Autopsy and the UK Subs are unlikely to ever tread : arenas packed with screaming , glowstick - waving kids .
Nevertheless , Alphabeat seem strangely at home here , amid the graffiti and the lethal - looking dips and the posters for the forthcoming show by Canadian hardcore poonks the Cancer Bats .
That may be because they 've been here before .
Last year , with their sights set on wider success , they relocated from Copenhagen to London , and began doggedly touring the lower reaches of Britain 's live circuit .
" We 've played shitty venues for two or three years now , " says Anders B . " I think it works .
It definitely takes some of the pop -star thing out of it , but we 're quite happy about that actually .
We played some concerts in Denmark on a huge stage , where we just did n't feel like we had that much to offer .
We felt like we were lying to people .
Now , we 're just enjoying the small venues . "
In any case , small venues are very much the point of their current tour .
Dubbed the Wonky Pop Tour , it 's been heralded in some quarters as a coming - out party for a new kind of pop star , here to save the genre from being finally , fatally smothered by Simon Cowell 's army of anodyne talent - show winners , and to rescue the charts from the preponderance of " landfill indie " bands that currently provide the meat and potatoes of the daytime Radio 1 playlist .
The Wonky Pop artists are unmanufactured but unashamedly melodic and capable of playing live without recourse to lashings of dry ice , troupes of dancers and an interlude during which they fly around the stage on wires .
As well as Alphabeat , it features the vaguely psychedelic pop-soul of Leon Jean - Marie , a dreadlock - sporting refugee from a Damage - style boyband who once toured with Steps , and Vincent Frank , a wiry 23 - year - old who plies an intense brand of self - produced electro - pop under the name Frankmusic .
All three hark back to an 80s they 're too young to remember , not just because of specific references in their music - Alphabeat 's sound is not unlike a Dayglo take on Let 's Dance - era Bowie , Leon Jean - Marie is audibly in love with Prince , Frankmusic vaguely resembles Soft Cell had they been produced by Daft Punk - but because they seem to embody the kind of pop star that held sway in the era before Stock , Aitken and Waterman 's legion of interchangeable poppets took over the charts .
" In the early 80s , the idea of a pop star was someone who was unusual or eccentric or fantastic in some way , " says Peter Robinson , of website popjustice.com , one of the tour 's sponsors .
" Everything that 's happened in the past 10 years , especially with TV shows where people are voted out if they 're a bit weird , suggests the best way to become a pop star is to keep your head down and not get noticed , not have much of a sense of individuality or style . "
He baulks at the suggestion that hawking around venues like the Cardiff Barfly is somehow at odds with the notion of being a pop act .
" This kind of grassroots approach to pop is n't something which can apply to all types of pop - the new Britney , or the new Girls Aloud , would need to appear with a bang - but the idea that pop music requires an impenetrable fourth wall in order to be pop is n't very helpful .
Pop personas are about projecting the idea that you 're a star whether you 're headlining at the O2 or third on the bill at a shithole like the Leeds Cockpit . "
Nevertheless , Alphabeat 's manager Ian Watt claims the idea for the tour was conceived amid considerable trepidation : " It could have fallen flat on it 's arse .
Hand on my heart , I really could n't have told you what kind of people were going to be in the audience . "
By the time it reaches Cardiff , however , the mood around the Wonky Pop Tour is bullish : the venues have been packed , all three artists appear to be on the up .
Alphabeat 's second British single , Fascination , recently spent four weeks in the Top 10 .
Leon Jean - Marie is , as he puts it , " getting a lot of love from Radio 2 " for his debut Bed of Nails .
If his forthcoming album fails , it certainly wo n't be for want of blue - chip collaborators , who include Mark Ronson , Cathy Dennis and Swedish production duo Bloodshy and Avant .
And then there is Vincent Frank , who , in a pub around the corner from the Barfly , lays out a detailed plan for world domination that involves simultaneously signing a major label deal and starting his own record label , collaborating with Madonna 's erstwhile producer Stuart Price , " a really stinking , completely epic and mental live show " , and ends somewhere in Hollywood with him pursuing a career in acting and scoring films .
Keen to point out that the first three have all been ticked off , leaving only Hollywood on his to - do list , Frank is enormously engaging , uproariously funny and faintly terrifying .
It 's hard not to feel that if he does n't become a pop star , it 'll be pop music 's loss .
Meanwhile , Watt , who also manages Mika , has cannily copyrighted the name Wonky Pop and is planning to extend the brand in a manner that would win the approval of Simon Fuller : he 's preparing two further tours , a club night and a series of one - off dates in London .
Whether this makes the whole enterprise seem a little less organic , unmanufactured and indeed wonky than it 's perhaps making itself out to be is a moot point , but there are no shortage of artists who want to get involved .
" There are at least 20 bands that fit loosely into this genre , " says Watt .
" I 'm hoping it will be a self - fulfilling thing , that people who go to the gigs will want to go out and create their own version of it . "
" I think there 's definitely something happening , " says Robinson , who 18 months ago appeared in the Guardian 's pages suggesting major labels should " put their money in a field and set fire to it " rather than spend it trying to launch a new pop act .
Recent events , however , have caused him to change his mind : " People are n't just buying pop music , they 're buying music from artists who are n't necessarily English - speaking or from the UK : Robyn , Alphabeat , September .
There was always this perception that Eurovision was some kind of definition of what European pop music was like , and people were able to put it in a box and dismiss it .
I think the fact that it 's being playlisted at Radio 1 has made a difference .
I 'm optimistic about what 's coming up for the first time in ages .
There 's lots of stuff knocking about which is really exciting . "
Quite what has caused the putative shift is a matter of some debate .
One theory suggests that Alphabeat et al simply have a wider reach than their manufactured forebears : " It 's pop music being made by adults for their own peer group , totally at odds with the era when pop music was made for and marketed at children , " says Robinson .
Another is that the teenagers who bought tickets to the Wonky Pop tour were once seven - year - olds whose musical flashpoint was provided by Busted and Avril Lavigne .
They moved on to indie and emo , but have tired of the glut of Identikit indie - rock bands and have come back to what they know : pop artists who write their own songs and play their own instruments .
Another suggests that indie music has now become so mainstream and so craven in its pursuit of success that listening to pop represents a way of setting yourself apart from the herd : " Pop got to the point where the music was n't the most important thing about it , where the songs were no good , " says Robinson .
" I think what 's happening now , with Scouting for Girls , the whole flipchart indie thing , is going to do the same for guitar music .
Pop music has become a bit of an alternative . "
Whatever the reason , in the Cardiff Barfly at least , it appears to be working .
The crowd - late teens and early 20s , dressed up , with a definite female skew - seem happy to support Frankmusic 's ongoing plan for world domination .
" Pop music was seen as a dirty thing , " he reflects later , " but porn is seen as a dirty thing , and that does n't stop people from liking it . "
Leon Jean - Marie exits the stage to be surrounded by a crowd of eager girls : if he is n't quite being mobbed , it 's not far off .
Alphabeat are a triumph : the audience reaction to Fascination virtually drowns out the band .
By the time all three artists come on stage for an encore of Daft Punk 's Digital Love , a happy and infectious pandemonium reigns .
No one seems bothered by the smell of the gents at all .
· The Wonky Pop Tour is at the Forum , Tunbridge Wells , tonight , then Night & Day , Manchester , tomorrow .
This Is Alphabeat is released on Charisma on June 2 . Leon Jean Marie 's album Bent Out of Shape is released on Universal on June 30

The RNC remains the GOP 's sole bright spot , but their advantage over the DNC is dwarfed by the massive fundraising advantages our Democratic candidates themselves are enjoying over their Republican counterparts .

Company Employee Performance Review , Included in Complaint Itself , Dispels Assertion Made by Company Spokesperson
Other Replies from Defendant Similarly Debunked by Documents Obtained by The BRAD BLOG ...
Brad Friedman Byon
3/31/2008 , 4:28 pm PT
-- By Brad Friedman
In a statement given to the media last week , in response to a federal fraud / false claims act qui tam suit finally unsealed last week , a representative from the defendant , voting machine company , Hart InterCivic , alleged the suit 's whistleblower , William Singer , was a " disgruntled employee . "
Employee " Performance Evaluation " records written by company management , included in the complaint itself , however , would seem to strongly contradict the claims of company spokesperson Pete Lichtenheld , as given to a reporter last week .
Additional claims by Lichtenheld , as reported by Kim Zetter at Wired 's Threat Level blog on Thursday , are also dispelled by a document from the U.S. Dept. of Justice , obtained by The BRAD BLOG .
The DoJ , after requesting and receiving extensions for two years , has finally decided against joining the federal qui tam suit , for the time being , allowing it to become unsealed last week , so that it may now move forward in federal district court .
The lawsuit , posted in full by The BRAD BLOG after it became unsealed last Thursday , details an extraordinary list of fraudulent behavior by Hart InterCivic , as related by one - time employee Singer , who alleges the company deceived Election Officials in Texas , Ohio , Colorado , and elsewhere in hopes of receiving federal monies as distributed via the Help America Vote Act of 2002 .
Allegations made in the suit include stunning revelations that Hart failed to test its products properly , and frequently at all , withheld information from prospective clients about the potential loss of votes in its voting systems , dummied - up machines , reports , and test results presented to clients in sales presentations , and much more in an attempt to win state and county contracts .
Much of the response to the suit by company spokesperson Lichtenheld , however , is easily dismissed upon examination of the evidence so far available in the case ...
The Old " Disgruntled Employee " Card
Wired 's Zetter reported last week that the Hart spokesperson attempted to downplay concern about the case by claiming that " none of Singer 's allegations are true " and that Singer was a " disgruntled employee who had trouble getting along with fellow workers . "
Yet , a quick read of the 45 - page complaint itself [ PDF ] reveals that Singer --- who at times served as the company 's only computer technician during the several years he worked there -- received high marks from the company in employee evaluations , which found him to be " highly effective " in his many roles at the company , and describe his " tireless dedication and willing spirit " on the job .
From the complaint :
Attached as Exhibit 7 is an electronic copy of Mr. Singers annual Performance Review dated November 25 , 2002 .
The review concluded that Mr. Singer was highly effective in several fields , including Subject Matter Expertise and Job Knowledge in his role as a technical services specialist .
Mr. Singer received an Overall Rating of highly effective , and he was lauded for his tireless dedication and willing spirit .
The review deemed Job Knowledge Mr. Singers strongest attribute given his high level of expertise and in - depth knowledge and technical skills .
The document goes on to detail Singer 's key role within the company , where he worked --- often accompanying company executives during sales presentations --- from November 2001 until January 2004 , when he " resigned from Hart under protest , citing many of the fraudulent
acts and misrepresentations giving rise to this action , " according to the complaint .
Singer 's 2002 Performance Review , referenced in the complaint as Exhibit 7 , goes on to sing his praises on a host of scores , indicating the company 's high degree of faith and appreciation for Singer 's work at the time .
That review is available in full here [ PDF ] .
When he resigned , his detailed , 5 - page resignation letter ( Exhibit 8 with the complaint , as available here [ PDF ] ) , says that he was leaving " [ d ]ue primarily to unresolved ethical differences " with Hart .
The complaint points out that his letter " cited specific acts of misconduct and fraud and closed with his hope that this letter has some positive impact in creating change . . . so that I am the last person that has to leave for the sake of their conscience . "
Lichtenheld told Zetter that " Singer left the company in 2004 , " adding , " I think it 's interesting ( that ) that 's four years ago .
It 's a good sign of the depth of his disgruntlement . "
Though Lichtenheld failed to note that Singer had attempted , as early as July 2004 , to notify the Secretaries of State of both Texas and Ohio about his numerous and serious concerns about what he described as criminal behavior , false claims , and fraud by the company .
Indeed , when
The BRAD BLOG originally posted Singer 's letters to OH and TX in full in July of 2006 , he told us he had shared his resignation letter with many people when he left , so the company would not later be able to label him successfully as " disgruntled . "
" At the time of my resignation , " he told us in 2006 , " I provided several people with my resignation letter , so everyone knew that I had resigned and given notice .
I was n't fired . "
He also pointed out that he was soon thereafter hired by Tarrant County , Texas --- which had a close relationship with Hart --- to program its voting systems .
" Would Tarrant county have hired me to be their Election Programmer if I had been fired by Hart ? "
Singer pointed out to us in our original 2006 report .
[ FULL DISCLOSURE :
It was that report which we tipped Robert F. Kennedy Jr. off to when chatting with him about some of the whistelblowers
The BRAD BLOG had reported on , but who had been largely ignored by the media , and who might make good plaintiffs in a federal qui tam lawsuit .
Kennedy quickly put an attorney from his radio - partner Mike Papantonio's Pensacola firm , Levin Papantonio Thomas Mitchell Echsner & Proctor , P.A , in touch with us , so that we could brief him on the case and put him in touch with Singer .
The federal fraud suit was filed shortly thereafter .
" Brad Friedman of The BRAD BLOG " is referred to in the complaint itself . ]
DoJ Faith
In Lichtenheld 's comments to Zetter , he also attempted to downplay both the severity of the allegations , and the competency of the attorneys who filed the suit .
Both claims are also easily dispelled .
" The government did n't join the lawsuit , so that 's a sign right there of the lack of faith they have in this lawsuit , " the spokesperson told Wired , in reference to the DoJ chosing not to excercise their option to join the case after two years .
Federal qui tam suits are filed by a " Relator , " in this case , the whistleblower Singer , on behalf of the United States of America , which then has 60 days to decide if it wishes to join the suit along with the Relator .
The DoJ asked for , and received , extension after extension from the court while deciding whether or not to join , for nearly two years since the case was originally filed and sealed .
Contrary to Lichtenheld 's assertion , however , the DoJ's 3 - page letter , finally declining to join the case , as obtained by The BRAD BLOG and available here [ PDF ] notes specifically , in its first point , that their decision to decline does not reflect their " faith " in the merits of the case as Litchtenheld charges .
" Our decision to decline should not be construed as a statement about the merits of the case , " the DoJ 's Robert McCauliffe writes in the letter to Singer 's attorney , Matt Schultz .
" Indeed , " McCauliffe continues , " the Government retains the right to intervene at a later date upon a showing of good cause . "
Additionally , Levin Papantonio told us last week that " the fact that DoJ declined to join the case does not deter us for a moment . "
Hart InterCivic : An American Company
[ Ed Note : Please see the " UPDATE / CLARIFICATION " found at the end of this article , regarding the following section .
- BF ]
Finally , for now , the last , and perhaps most pathetic , claim by Lichtenheld was a seeming attempt to take a shot at the competency of the attorneys who filed the suit , which claims on page 2 , that " Defendant Hart InterCivic , Inc. is a foreign corporation that has since 2000 been registered to do business in Colorado . "
Zetter reports that , in response , " Lichtenheld adds that Hart InterCivic is not a foreign company but is wholly owned by Americans . "
While it may be the first time that Lichtenheld has been asked to respond to such a lawsuit , Levin Papantonio confirmed to The BRAD BLOG that " foreign corporation , " in such a suit , refers to the fact that Hart , " whose principal office is in Texas , " according to the very next line of the lawsuit , is a " foreign " company to Colorado , where the lawsuit has been filed in federal district court .
UPDATE / CLARIFICATION
4/7/08 : Wired 's Kim Zetter writes , in regard to the final section above , concerning our points about the " foreign corporation " comment , to say that the matter was not one raised by Hart .
Rather , it originated with her own , understandable , original confusion about the term after noting it in the complaint .
During her conversation with Hart 's spokesperson Lichtenheld , she says , it was she who asked him whether or not the company was , literally , owned by a foreign outfit .
( Foreign ownership of voting machine companies has been an issue in the past , with companies such as Sequoia for example .
Details here . )
Lichtenfeld , who was also unaware of this particular legal use of the phrase , explained to her , in response , that Hart was American owned .
Zetter notes , therefore , that is inaccurate to characterize the exchange as one where Lichtenheld or Hart were " tak[ing ] a shot at the competency of the attorneys who filed the suit , " as we suggested .
Our contention that it was a " seeming attempt " to do so , she explained , would not be an accurate conclusion to take from her report on that particular matter .
We thank Zetter for that clarification .

The stereotypical startup dream hire is a 20 - something with as little life as possible outside of computers .
The one that ’ll be happy working 14 - hour crunch days for weeks on end sprinting for an ever - shifting target that keeps being 90 % done for 90 % of the time .
The one you can make sleep under the table or please with a foosball table in the center of the room .
The one where the company paying for dinner pizza is “ awesome ” .
I should know .
I used to be that gullible and even take an odd pride in being up to the job .
But it did n’t take long to catch on to the idea that packing a room full of these people was merely a crutch for shoddy management , lousy execution , and myths like “ this is the only way we can compete against the big guys ” .
And you certainly need the latter if you ’re trying to give turds wings , but how about just not trying to make crap fly in the first place ?
That ’s why I like working with the family man or woman .
They come in as a cold bath of reality .
When people have other obligations outside of work that they actually care more about than your probably - not - so - world - changing idea , the crutches are not available as an easy way out , and you ’ll have to walk by the power of your good ideas and execution or you ’ll fall fast and early .
That ’s a good thing !
From the experience I ’ve had working with family people , I ’ve found an amazing ability to get stuff done when the objectives are reasonably clear , the work appears to have meaning , and if it can be done within the scope of what should constitute a work week .
When there are real constraints on your time , like you have to pickup the kids or make them dinner or put them to bed , it appears to bring a serenity of focus to the specific hours dedicated to work .
This is what companies need , startups or not .
They need constraints and especially constraints on how often you can play the hero card to Get This Very Important Project Done .
Most projects are just not that important and most things just should n’t be done anyway , despite how good of an idea you feel it is in the heat of the moment .
Mr. Fishman is not the first hedge fund manager to run into trouble  and he certainly will not be the last .
After years of explosive growth , this secretive , sometimes volatile corner of the financial world is entering a dangerous new era .
The running turmoil in the markets is stirring fears that more of these funds will fail , some , perhaps , spectacularly .
“ This will be the year with the highest number of hedge fund failures given the huge number of new and untested hedge funds , ” said Bradley H. Alford , founder of the Atlanta - based Alpha Capital Management , an investment advisory business .
“ Last year there were some easy trades : short financials , short subprime , long non-U.S and emerging markets .
This year there ’s no clear trend and no safe place to hide . ”
So far few funds have suffered the same fate as Sailfish Capital .
But the signs are troubling .
The average stock - picking hedge fund sank 4.1 percent in January .
While that tumble was not as steep as the one taken by the broad stock market  the Standard & Poor ’s 500 - stock index was down 6 percent  it nonetheless represented the hedge fund industry ’s worst showing since November 2000 .
Few of the investment strategies employed by these funds made money .
Big - name funds are suffering .
David Slager and Timothy R. Barakett , who run the Atticus European Fund , lost more than 13 percent , and Lee Ainslie , who heads Maverick Capital , lost 9 percent through Jan. 25 , according to SYZ & Company , which tallies hedge fund returns .
( Compare that with 2007 performance when the funds returned 27.7 percent and 26.9 percent , respectively . )
Even Goldman Sachs , which turned out record profit last year while many other Wall Street banks stumbled , is struggling to make money for its hedge fund investors .
Its $ 7 billion Goldman Sachs Investment Partners fund , started on Jan. 1 , fell 6 percent last month .

Draw an impossible triangle by drawing an equilateral triangle and chopping off its corners .
This will leave you with a hexagon with three long , and three short sides .
Draw a smaller equilateral triangle in the middle of that hexagon .
Then draw a line from one corner of the hexagon until it just passes the small triangle .
Extend one side of that triangle to meet the other line and repeat for the other two sides .
When you are done , it should look like there are three L’s fitted together to form a 3D triangle with a triangular hole in the middle .

A reporter from England 's Telegraph is explaining The Colbert Report to his countrymen today .
" The Colbert Report is news parody of the first order .
The show 's titular host offers a funhouse - mirror reflection of the bellicose Right - wing opinionisers of Rupert Murdoch 's Fox News channel ( among others ) who dominate and dictate the political discourse in the States with lengthy and obnoxious opinion - slots that are somehow passed off as ' news ' . "
" While developing a spin - off based around this character , Colbert and his writers took great care in honing his on - screen persona to fit what they saw as a glaring gap in the comedy market for an obnoxious , editorialising political host just like the ones who had come to dominate the US airwaves .
" ' What the character expresses in specific reference to American television is the post evening - news , personality - driven , single - camera shout - fest interviews , ' says Colbert .
He 's referring to hosts such as Fox - bred entities like Sean Hannity and Joe Scarborough , and mildly less offensive CNN presenters Lou Dobbs and Anderson Cooper among many others .
" Colbert 's clearest role model would be Fox News figurehead Bill O'Reilly , who takes great pride in shouting down ' unpatriotic ' ( dissenting ) guests and occasionally having their microphones switched off mid-sentence .
' The emotion of the moment is assumed and amplified by a single voice and regurgitated back to the country at the lowest common denominator , ' says Colbert .
' It can be swathed in idea , but it 's essentially an emotional event .
I 'm regurgitating back to you how you feel about it - I am you .
I am you !'
Colbert continues : " At the heart of this is America as the chosen country of God .
It 's a conflation of the Statue of Liberty and the crucifix : American religiosity and American destiny are one and the same .
That 's why George Bush was chosen by God to lead the world .
Manifest destiny is an old idea , but now it 's just expressed in different ways . "

When Elvis Presley died Aug. 16 , 1977 , at his cherished Memphis home , a crowd gathered instantly at the whimsical gates of Graceland .
Three decades later , dedicated pilgrims are still out there in the sultry Southern sun .
AUDIO : Revisit Elvis ' rise to stardom " I could never have predicted 30 years ago that today Elvis would be as popular as he is , " says Priscilla Presley , 62 , the King 's onetime queen ( they divorced in 1973 after six years of marriage ) who oversees his legacy with daughter Lisa Marie .
But is Elvis still relevant to a larger world that has long since left his jumpsuit era behind — one that has traded ballyhooed TV specials for amateur YouTube clips , vinyl albums for iTunes and evolutionary careers for the bright but brief spotlight of American Idol ?
There is some evidence Presley 's kung - fu grip on the world 's imagination may be easing .
For one , Thursday 's 30th anniversary has not produced the avalanche of album reissues and book tributes of past milestones .
Elvis slipped last year to No. 2 on Forbes magazine 's list of top- earning dead celebrities , behind Nirvana 's Kurt Cobain .
And the top Elvis download to date is Junkie XL 's 2002 remix of A Little Less Conversation , which was never more than a modest hit for the man .
But it would be far too easy to count Elvis out , as many did in the late ' 60s before he donned a skintight black leather suit and roared through his 1968 TV special .
For many , Elvis ' blend of looks , talent and bravado will never weather with age .
" This is just the calm before the second coming , " predicts Alanna Nash , author of Elvis and the Memphis Mafia , referring to plans for refurbishing Graceland , where 50,000 fans are gathering for Elvis Week , down from more than 70,000 a decade ago .
" Elvis is such an ingrained part of America that I expect the flag to be redesigned any day to include his picture , " she says .
Cirque du Soleil is banking on such hyperbole .
In 2009 , the Canadian troupe will perform its offbeat circus spectacle to Elvis ' music , as it recently did with The Beatles .
Another true believer is Robert F.X. Sillerman , CEO of CKX , which bought an 85 % stake in Elvis Presley Enterprises in 2004 .
" The next five years will see an orderly release of new music , some never heard before , " he says .
Sillerman also plans to transform Graceland , a $ 27 - million - a - year attraction where 40 % of visitors are 35 and under , into a kingdom that would make Walt Disney wink in approval .
The $ 250 million overhaul of the Colonial - style house and its adjoining property will include the addition of a hotel and interactive museum .
The estate 's indoor racquetball court , which now holds the King 's many luminescent jumpsuits , will be returned to its original state , Priscilla Presley says .
A sprawling souvenir shopping center and airplane display across the street from Graceland will be redeveloped to include green space , which is " the way it looked when ( Elvis ) bought the property . "
Says Sillerman , whose diverse holdings include the rights to Muhammad Ali's estate and American Idol : " Our stewardship of the legend is n't commemorative , it 's current .
We 're focusing on Elvis as a contemporary entertainer . "
Timeless appeal
That would explain this spring 's much - downloaded American Idol duet between Celine Dion and Elvis , in which the Canadian siren seems to be standing next to the arm - waving , white - suited prince as they power through a sentimental If I Can Dream .
In the biased view of longtime professional Elvis tribute artist Rick Marino , that Idol appearance shows " Elvis is timeless , because as good as Celine is , he just dominated . "
Marino says he 's proof that Elvis , who would be 72 now , lives on .
His Jacksonville business has yet to slump , and far from catering to the graying set , he recently did gigs for a 21 - year - old 's birthday party and " drove kids crazy " when he appeared at his fifth - grader 's talent show .
" Everyone got him . "
Certainly , pop culture still gets the King 's power to sell .
A recent Viagra ad is set to the tune of Viva Las Vegas , Hershey 's has an Elvis Reese 's cup with banana - crème filling , and a limited - edition series of motorcycles from Harley - Davidson replicates his 1957 model .
Boomers who grew up with Presley probably will snap up such fare .
But what about those born after his death , generations for whom Elvis may just be a postage stamp or the butt of a joke ?
The singer 's charisma breaks through so long as people look past the kitsch and clichés , says Robert Thompson , professor of popular culture at Syracuse University .
" I teach Elvis in many classes , and often the kids taking notes look like they 're being lectured on the French Revolution , " Thompson quips .
" But there are always one or two students who perk up when they see the seminal Elvis .
They 're bitten by the very same thing that got kids all those decades ago . "
It may be that Presley , who died at 42 from cardiac arrhythmia caused by a cocktail of prescription drugs , is finally moving from celebrity to historical figure , as music legends Duke Ellington and Frank Sinatra did before him .
With a hint of melancholy in her voice , Lisa Marie Presley , 39 , says this could well be the case .
" Sometimes , I think most kids think Madonna or Jay - Z started music , " she says .
" I do n't think ( Elvis ) has been lost , but our pop-culture world is such a blur that it 's hard for people to focus on the past . "
Those who appreciate music history see his daughter 's point .
" It does n't matter if Elvis is or is n't moving merchandise for his accomplishments to mean something , " says veteran music industry watcher and author Dave Marsh .
He singles out Presley 's invaluable contribution to racial integration through music , which preceded the civil rights movement of the 1960s .
" He 's like Shakespeare .
He 'll always be relevant and iconic . "
Matt " The Cat " Baldassarri was only 1 year old when Elvis died , but Presley to him remains " the first stone - cold rocker " whose '50s music created the genre .
" He was willing to be himself , " says Baldassarri , 31 , who directs the 1950s channel on XM Satellite Radio .
" He was n't selling you anything fake .
You watch American Idol , and the show seems so safe .
He 'd never make it as a contestant . "
What captivates 30 - year - old country singer Jason Aldean is the length of Elvis ' shadow .
Born a few months before Elvis died , Aldean learned about the singer from his parents and went on to research what the fuss was about .
" My parents saw him in Macon ( Ga. ) , and they said it was nuts , " Aldean says .
" I 've watched a lot of things on him , all the movies .
My generation has n't seen an artist that big , not only someone who is a musical star , but also a public figure .
The closest my generation has is Michael Jackson . "
When Nick Kidd took a non-fiction course at the University of Kentucky a few years back , the syllabus included Bobbie Ann Mason 's Elvis Presley .
" I knew who he was , of course , but I can't say his music was on my radar , " says Kidd , 25 , a drummer and part - time DJ in Louisville .
" But when I realized that he really was a cultural phenomenon , I sort of got it .
His music still is n't relevant to me , it does n't have that punch .
But I 'm much more apt to defend him if someone takes a shot . "
' He was sexual , a rebel ' Helping Elvis win such new fans so many years after his death is his extraordinary ability to shift to suit the prevailing times .
" He was sexual , a rebel , a gospel singer , a Vegas showman , a B - movie actor , " says Erika Doss , author of Elvis Culture : Fans , Faith and Image .
" Elvis ' enduring presence is due to his many images .
When people look at him , they all find exactly what they want to see . "
Including Priscilla Presley .
" Elvis means something to people because he was n't a contrived person , he was organic and true to himself , " she says .
" For me , it 's the 1968 to 1972 Elvis .
Those were the years I remember him being the happiest .
It was after his movie career , just when he was getting back into music .
He was riding high . "
But for many veteran musicians , the Elvis that rocked their world was the black - and - white image from the '50s , a buttoned - down time that received a seismic jolt from Presley 's syncopated delivery and suggestive stage moves .
" The songs and body language he brought to American music are now simply accepted parts of its vocabulary , " says David Fricke , senior editor at Rolling Stone .
" You do n't have to say you got it from Elvis to know that you did . "
And most will indeed give credit .
" I do n't care if you 're talking about Bruce , Prince or Dylan , they all say it goes back to Elvis , " says Springsteen biographer Marsh .
" Where there is resistance , there is Elvis . "
And rebellion .
And innovation .
Mason likens Presley 's contributions to those of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Herman Melville , whose influence on lyrical poetry and novelistic structure have reverberated through centuries .
" Elvis , frankly , had an even wider impact on popular culture than those two , simply due to the mass communication of our age , " Mason says .
" Elvis has his place .
I do n't see him ever becoming a footnote . "
Yet she offers one stern caveat : If Elvis is " merely overhyped and oversold as something for tourists to consume , then we lose sight of our own history — growing up poor , embracing the influences of our youth , breaking through to the masses and struggling with the perils of fame .
Elvis ' story is really a heroic one .
If we turn him into a grotesque icon , we 're just victimizing him all over again . "
But here in America , great accomplishments and pop-culture adulation walk hand in hand .
Anyone hoping to be remembered for the former has to make peace with the latter .
Elvis author Nash can attest to that .
" I asked my ( grocery store ) to save the Elvis standup for me that Reese 's sent out to promote the banana - crème cup , " she says .
" When I went to pick it up , the guy said , ' I do n't know how you got this , about 15 million people wanted it . ' "
That 's evidence , she says , of the truth in what longtime Elvis manager Tom Parker said in 1977 : " Elvis did n't die , the body did . "

Gold leapt to another historic high today as investors rushed to buy the precious metal to protect against losses from the tumbling US dollar and record oil prices .
Prices jumped to an all - time high of $ 996.70 an ounce and analysts expect it to hit $ 1,000 today .
Gold has jumped 19 % so far this year after a 32 % rise in 2007 .
The latest surge in the metal was driven by the freefall in the dollar to a 12 - year low against the yen and a record low against the euro as fears mount over the health of the US economy and financial sector .
" If the dollar stays at this level , we might see $ 1,000 very soon , " said Walter De Wet , analyst at Standard Bank .
A weaker dollar makes gold cheaper for holders of other currencies .
The metal is also seen as a refuge during times of economic uncertainty and a hedge against oil - led inflation .
Oil was today hovering near its lifetime peak of $ 110.17 which was hit overnight .
" Every bit of bad US economic data boosts gold in two ways , " Fortis Bank said in a market report .
" First because it reinforces the return of its role as a safe - haven asset and second because the dollar falls on expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts . "
Figures on the US retail sector are due out this afternoon and weak numbers could further bolster gold prices .
Inflation fears have been the main force behind soaring gold prices .
In the UK , concern about price pressures were heightened after the Bank of England 's February inflation expectations survey showed Britons expect the cost of living in the future to rise to 3.3 % .
This is a series high and more than a percentage point above the actual CPI rate of inflation .
The quarterly survey showed expectations for inflation has picked up from 3 % in November and 2.7 % a year earlier .
People 's perception of the current rate of inflation also leapt to a record 3.9 % from 3.2 % in November and 2.9 % a year ago .
The monetary policy committee haS already expressed their fears of inflation risks despite signs that the economy is slowing .
Bank Governor Mervyn King has indicated that CPI inflation could well rise to 3 % in the short term due to record oil prices and rising food costs .
" With oil prices trading at $ 110 this is not going to go away .
This is a problematic position to be facing , " said Audrey Childe - Freeman at CIBC World Markets .
The survey limits the scope for more interest rate cuts to help boost growth in the UK economy .
The Bank has been cautious in easing borrowing costs , unlike the US Federal Reserve .
The MPC cut rates in February to 5.25 % - the second cut in three months .
Markets are pricing in a further three quarter - point cuts by the end of the year .
" The MPC is pragmatic about what is the right measure of inflation expectations but clearly a rise in their own survey is not going to help in bringing rates down quickly , " said Philip Shaw , economist at Investec .
Paul Dales at Capital Economics said the survey increased the likelihood that the Bank will keep rates on hold next month and in May as well .
It does n’t matter if you are a casual gamer or just a fanatic one , as you ’ve probably heard about “ Mass Effect : Andromeda . ”
This new action RPG has been released by BioWare on March 21 , 2017 .
Unfortunately for BioWare , the Mass Effect : Andromeda was launched with some issues that have annoyed many fans .
One of the issues that most of the fans were complaining about was that the characters are robotic in both movement and appearance .
Some of the gamers have also complained that the characters are lacking proper facial animation , meaning that when the character was talking , it had no expression .
Other players have noticed that the enemies were moving a bit strange , far from being realistic .
All the mentioned aspects are very important in a game and we ’re not sure what BioWare was thinking about when they ’ve released this “ unpolished ” Mass Effect : Andromeda .
To make things even worse , the game also comes with some technical issues .
One of the problems was causing Scott Ryder , the main character , to enter a strange animation stage , making him run in a zigzag pattern .
The game was also crashing if you tried to run it in a 16:9 or 16:10 portrait display , and it was not saving as often as needed during missions , which caused you to lose the progress .
Mass Effect : Andromeda 1.05 Patch
However , the Patch 1.05 has been released for Mass Effect : Andromeda , and many fans have hoped that it will finally fix some of the major problems of the game .
Well , it seems that they were not that lucky , as not all the problems were been fixed .
The “ zigzag ” issue was fixed and the eyes and facial acting of both humans and asari are looking way better than before .
The new patch has also brought a new feature that allows you to skip the autopilot sequences , which is a big plus , especially for the players that do n’t have the mood or the time to wait when traveling from one planet to another .
The developers have also brought some balance to single player and multiplayer mode , they ’ve fixed the save - related problems , improved the stability of the game and the matchmaking and latency in multiplayer are way better than before .
BioWare still has a lot of work to do on Mass Effect : Andromeda and we ’re pretty sure that the game developing company knows that .
We think that the guys who ’ve worked on this title have rushed in releasing it and we think that it was better to release it this autumn without these problems .
We have to mention that many players have decided to not purchase the game once they ’ve heard about all of its issues .
My Guide To Christian Tattoos
Christian Tattoos
- A Deadly Sin ? -
Being born into a Christian family , I was always thought to never interfere with God 's creation .
In other words , never to get pierced , never to get tattooed etc .
There was no such thing as Christian Tattoos !
I was thought that the Bible said that tattooing was a sin .
And so I thought for many many years ....
In my teenage years I became more and more fascinated by underground arts ( graffiti , tattoos etc ) and I also became the lead singer in a Christian punk rock band .
I was a rebellion and according to Leviticus 19:28 " You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh on account of the dead or tattoo any marks upon you : I am the LORD . "
So ... Was I a Sinner ?
I did n't look at my self as a rebellion - I just did what I liked .
Playing cool music and drawing nice pictures .
Later I also became almost obsessed with Harley 's and Customized Choppers , and today I 'm the vice president of a female christian biker club in Oregon .
Hehe .... ;)
My family did n't always approve what I did , but nowadays I think they 've got used to me .
I am who I am , and I am still an active Christian .
Maybe not exactly the regular run of the mill - " I am so holy " Christian but I AM definitively a Christian .
My biker club regularly do charity work , helping out in our community and raising funds to help " problem kids " in our town .
Christian Tattoos - The Ultimate Way To Show Your Love For God !
Think about it ...
" Love the Lord your God with all your heart , with all your soul and with all your mind . "
Matthew 22 .
I love God. You Love God ...
Why should n't we show it to the world by tattooing us ?
In my view it is the Ultimate Way of showing our devotion and love to God and Jesus .
It is an everlasting sign of Love .
Christian Tattoos Are Fine .
There is nothing wrong about being Tattooed if you are a Christian !
Christian Tattoos ;
Tattoos Vs God - The Never-ending Story .
In Christian forums all over the internet , I see this subject .
I think most of the kids , teens and young people understand tattooing and has nothing against it .
It is often the elder people that find our tattoos hard to swallow .
Nina , one of my biker friends , once said that her tattoos were a " witness to others " .
I think it is such a beautiful way to put it ...
It is OUR way of showing the world that WE LOVE THE LORD !
Tanya , another of my biker friends , used to be a prostitute junkie in New Orleans before she woke up on the floor of a dirty motel room one morning , covered in blood .
A guy had drugged her , raped her and tried to kill her .
It was that day she realized that she had to change her way of living .
She was so close to death that morning ...
" I was walking on a path , towards a white light ... Some kind of Gate , " she recalls .
" I could see a an angle standing there .
He took my hand and said that it was n't my turn yet .
Go back .
You have a second chance ... "
One week later she came to a re-hab clinic and her path towards a new and better life in Oregon started ...
She had a lot of satanic tattoos , skulls - and nude - tattoos that she now has covered up by extremely good looking Christian ones .
Actually , I think she has some of the most beautiful Christian Tattoos I have ever seen !
I hope to convince her to post some pics of her here , but she currently says that her tattoos are too personal to show on a website ...
Which I totally respect and understand , BTW .
But ...
They are so beautiful .
Especially , I love the one she has on her back .
It covers all of her upper back and is a giant multicolor drawing of Jesus on the Cross surrounded by a lot of small details ...
It is sooooo Beautiful and such a great way to Honor The Lord , I think .
Christian Tattoos - Getting Ideas ?
There are many places online to get ideas for new Christian Tattoos .
There are websites such as religioustattoos.net , tattoojohnny.com and tattoofinder.com that are really cool and have some nice ideas .
The PROBLEM , the way I see it , with these sites is that you have to PAY to get the tattoo designs you want .
You only get to watch small , and often blur , images of the various tattoos and you normally have to pay between $ 14,95 - 19,95 PER TATTOO !
I think that is a little bit stiff .
Do n't you ?
I know , that I often have to print them out to see if they really are any cool .
Sometimes I 've printed maybe 5 or 6 tattoos before I 've really found one that I like ...
With the sites above that would have cost me a lot of cash !
That is why , I and most people I know , use THIS SITE to get ideas for our Christian Tattoos .
Not only does this website have a really cool name , but they also offer the internet biggest collection of tattoo designs , featuring a WIDE range of religious and christian tattoos .
There is a ONE - TIME fee to join and once you have paid , you can access and downloads unlimited numbers of tattoo designs .

Post - Mortem On The 1Q GDP Report Recession , Even If Outside The Long - Held Definition So How Bad Are Things Going To Get ?
Have We Seen The Worst Of The " Credit Crisis " ?
Maybe It 's Not As Bad As We Thought Stocks - Have We Seen The Bottom ?
Conclusions - What To Watch For
Introduction
When the 1Q GDP report came out on April 30 and was better than expected , I wondered what the reactions might be .
If you will recall , the report cited GDP growth of +0.6 % for the 1Q when many believed the report would yield a negative number .
In fact , the mainstream media and Hillary and Obama have led us to believe that we are already in the grips of a serious recession .
It comes as no surprise that they still maintain that stance , despite the latest positive GDP number .
Likewise , I knew that the gloom - and - doom crowd would claim ( as always ) that the GDP report was bogus , and that we are headed for economic disaster .
What else is new ?
But I wondered how economists and respected analysts in the financial industry would react to the better than expected GDP report at the end of April .
As I expected , many in the economic and financial industry downplayed the report initially and pointed out that some of the " internals " in the report were indeed negative , as I reported last week .
But I also wondered that if , after a week or two of absorbing the latest GDP data , some respected economists and financial pundits would change their views and consider that we might not be in or headed for a recession , and that the state of the US economy just might not be so bad after all .
As I will discuss below , that appears to be happening .
There is a broad consensus that the fate of the US economy , and whether we have a real recession or not , hinges on the housing / credit crisis .
I happen to agree with that assessment , but I also believe it is still too early to tell if a recession is inevitable .
Now , in light of the latest 1Q GDP report , the opinions and forecasts of some respected analysts are growing less negative as I will discuss later on .
Finally , have you noticed that the stock markets have been going up nicely since early March , despite a ton of bad news ?
Stocks have a history of bottoming out before the economy recovers from a downturn .
Some analysts believe that is what is happening now .
Maybe it 's time to consider getting back in .
Post - Mortem On The 1Q GDP Report
While the mainstream media and the Democrats all but promised a very negative GDP report for the 1Q , the actual advance number came in better than expected at +0.6 % for the first three months of this year , the same as for the 4Q of last year .
Granted , +0.6 % is indicative of an economy that may be teetering on the edge of a recession , but it was at least mildly positive and above the pre-report consensus .
The immediate media response to the report was as expected , that the report was overly optimistic .
As I reported last week , even the Wall Street Journal was skeptical :
" ... But underlying data [ in the report ] - on consumer spending , business investment and construction - paint a picture of a deteriorating economy , one that expanded only because of a rise in exports and a buildup of inventories ...
Excluding exports and inventories , the economy contracted at a 0.4 % rate ... "
Yet as I also reported last week , there was some encouraging news in the latest GDP numbers .
For example , consumer spending that makes up apprx .
70 % of GDP actually rose 1 % in the 1Q , at a time when consumer confidence fell to the lowest level in 20 years .
While the latest WSJ / NBC poll found that 81 % of Americans believe we are now in a recession , people continued to spend money in the 1Q .
This is at least somewhat encouraging .
On the inflation front , the latest GDP report revealed that the price index for gross domestic purchases , which measures prices paid by U.S. residents , increased 3.5 % ( annual rate ) in the 1Q , compared with an increase of 3.7 % in the 4Q .
Excluding food and energy prices , the " core " price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.2 % in the 1Q , compared with an increase of 2.3 % in the 4Q of last year .
This was also better than expected .
In a separate report released last week , the Labor Department reported that US productivity rose by a better than expected 2.2 % ( annual rate ) in the 1Q .
Non -farm output per hour worked rose 3.2 % versus a year earlier , the largest gain in almost four years .
At the end of the day , it is clear that we are not in a recession just yet , at least based on the " advance " 1Q GDP report , which will be revised two more times in the coming weeks .
Maybe a recession lies ahead , but it 's not here yet .
Perhaps the US economy will have sunk slightly into the negative side in the 2Q , which we wo n't know until late July when the 2Q GDP report will be released .
But even if the 2Q GDP report is slightly or somewhat negative , that will not confirm that a recession is upon us .
Keep in mind that the government 's $ 168 billion " stimulus package " is going out to most US taxpayers as this is written , and this should provide at least a modest boost to the economy in the second half of this year .
As a result of the better than expected 1Q GDP report and the stimulus package , some respected analysts are dialing back their forecasts for a US recession just ahead , and perhaps for good reason .
Some readers have criticized my view over the last year or so that a recession was not the most likely scenario , especially in light of the housing / subprime / credit crunch .
Still , I may yet be proven correct .
Some well - known analysts are coming to agree as I will discuss below .
Recession , Even If Outside The Long - Held Definition
In the 30 + years I have been in the investment business , a recession has been defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth .
But just as I have expected , the media wants to redefine the definition of a recession to something more politically correct .
The media would now have us believe that the US economy is in a recession anytime that economic growth , or the lack thereof , creates a net reduction in jobs .
Clearly that is happening - the unemployment numbers have confirmed for the last three months that net jobs are in decline .
However , the April unemployment rate was actually better than expected and declined from 5.1 % to 5.0 % .
Net job losses in April were only apprx .
20,000 which was well below the reported job losses of apprx .
80,000 in March and February .
Yet the greater question is , has the long - time definition of a recession changed ?
Do we now define a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth , as we have for all these years , or is it some new definition that is much more limited ?
This is quite a debate , but it is fueled primarily by liberals that want to capitalize on President Bush 's failures to advance their own agendas .
What is all too clear is that the US economy is indeed in a marked slowdown , recession or not .
The slowdown has been precipitated and exaggerated by the subprime / housing / credit crunch , which is still far from over .
And what we do know is that the housing slump has led to a plunge in consumer confidence to the lowest level in over 20 years .
So , is this a recession by historical standards ?
Not yet .
But is it a recession based on the new media math ?
I would reluctantly have to say yes .
Maybe we redefine it as a " psychological recession . "
Consumers are still spending , as noted above , but they feel really bad about the state of the economy , and think things are going to get worse .
So How Bad Are Things Going To Get ?
The credit crunch is very real .
The repercussions of the housing slump , the subprime crisis and the resultant credit crunch are far from over .
Liquidity in the credit markets remains a fraction of what it was a year ago .
We see this in the investment markets as well , where trading volume remains down significantly .
The Fed has slashed interest rates time after time in an effort to relieve the credit crunch , with the latest cut in the Fed Funds rate to 2.25 % on April 30 .
That brings the cumulative rate cuts since last September to 3.25 % , which is a more rapid rate - cutting spree than in the first eight months of 2001 when the Fed was last battling a recession .
Still , it remains to be seen if this will be enough to avoid a recession this time around .
There are analysts on both sides of this fence .
Some believe the combination of Fed rate cuts and other federal relief on the mortgage side , along with the stimulus package ( more on this below ) , will be enough to prevent the housing crunch from sparking a real recession .
Others believe it is too little , too late , and the plunge in consumer confidence will result in spending falling to levels that will guarantee a recession later this year .
The stimulus package that the President and Congress passed totals apprx .
$ 168 billion , most of which will be doled out over the next couple of months .
It remains to be seen just how much that will boost the economy and when .
Will most consumers immediately spend the money ?
Or , will they save most or all of it ( doubtful ) ?
Obviously , the Bush administration hopes consumers will quickly spend the money in one way or another to boost the sagging economy .
But even if consumers do spend most of the newfound money , it is not certain just how much that will stimulate the economy .
Estimates vary as to when consumers will spend the money , but generally it is believed that the stimulus package will add apprx .
1 % to GDP .
But when ?
Some people have already received their government stimulus checks , but most will receive them over the next several weeks .
This suggests that most of the positive impact on the economy from the stimulus package will not be felt until the 3Q .
Furthermore , a one - time 1 % boost will not , by itself , turn this economy around .
Of course , we should not rule out additional stimulus to come , given that it 's an election year .
Have We Seen The Worst Of The " Credit Crisis " ?
As you know , the credit crisis has been sparked by the problems in the housing sector and subprime mortgage securities specifically .
As noted above , the housing numbers , on balance , just continue to get worse month after month nationwide .
Home foreclosures continue to rise ; the inventory of unsold homes continues to rise ; new and existing home sales continue to fall overall ; median home sale prices continue to fall in most parts of the country ; and housing starts continue to fall .
The question is , have we seen the worst of the housing / credit crisis ?
The answer to this question varies , of course , from region to region .
Here in Austin where I live , for example , we have seen no noticeable slowdown in the housing boom ; prices for homes are still going up generally ; and credit for home loans is still widely available .
This is also true in certain other areas of the country .
Of course , in most areas of the US , just the opposite is happening and home values have fallen precipitously in some regions .
There is little doubt that the credit crisis is far from over and will persist for at least another year or two .
It is clear that the credit crunch continues to spread from largely real estate related loans to commercial and industrial loans and credit card lending .
Even
Fed officials concur that lending requirements continue to tighten in most all loan categories nationally .
But might we have seen the worst of it by now ?
As noted below , there are those who believe we have .
Some financial analysts now believe that the bailout of Bear Sterns in March may have signaled the worst of the credit crisis .
That remains to be seen , of course .
Likewise , in light of the latest better than expected GDP report and the $ 168 billion stimulus package , some economic forecasters are shifting to a more positive , or less negative , slant .
Given that , let 's consider some more recent opinions on the overall state of the economy and the credit crisis .
Maybe It 's Not As Bad As We Thought - Some Opinions
Here are some recent revised opinions on the current state of the economy from some sources that we should at least consider .
The following quote is from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson last week in an interview with the Associated Press :
" The worst of the nation 's credit crisis may have passed ... There 's progress , and I think we 're closer to the end of this than to the beginning ...
There 's no doubt that things feel better today , by a lot , than in March ...
We will get some help from the stimulus [ package ] .
Later this year , I expect growth will pick up . "
Warren Buffet , the legendary investor and reportedly the richest man on the planet , had this to say last week :
" The worst of the [ credit ] crisis in Wall Street is over ...
I think the Fed did the right thing in stepping in on Bear Stearns . "
Buffet said that he believes the worst of the global credit crunch is behind us , but he added that there is still considerable pain ongoing for individual consumers in many parts of the US .
Based on his latest public remarks , it appears he believes we will get through this rough patch and continues to be bullish on the long - term prospects for the economy .
And this from Merrill Lynch CEO , John
Thain last week :
" The U.S. credit crisis is easing and the risk in its housing market is dramatically lower now . "
And this from our good friends at Stratfor.com :
" ... we reiterate the view we have held from the beginning - which is that the subprime crisis would cause the economy to slow and , in extremis , cause a short recession ...
At the moment we are not even sure that the slowdown will cause a recession ...
But we rejected months ago ... the idea put forward that we are in the greatest financial crisis we have seen since 1929 . "
And this from the Bank of England , which has had its own credit crisis :
" While there remain downside risks , the most likely path ahead is that confidence and risk appetite will return gradually in the coming months ...
As uncertainty falls and market liquidity improves , it should become clearer that some assets appear cheap relative to credit fundamentals . "
While the housing / subprime / credit crisis is far from over , there are at least some signs that we may have seen the worst of it .
Stocks - Have We Seen The Bottom ?
The major stock market indexes have been rising nicely since early March .
This rally , in the midst of a great deal of bad news , has investors asking :
Have we seen the bottom , and is it time to get back in ?
No one knows for sure , of course , but based on the discussion above and the possibility that the worst of the credit crisis might be behind us , I think there is a good chance that stocks could continue to trend higher just ahead .
Stocks have a history of bottoming out and rebounding well ahead of a turnaround in the economy .
Thus , the latest strength in stocks might continue for a while .
Most of the professional money managers I recommend are now positioned on the long side of stocks ( vis - à - vis mutual funds ) .
That includes Niemann Capital Management and Potomac Fund Management that I discussed at length last week .
Keep in mind , however , that I still believe ( as do others ) that the US equity markets may be in a broad trading range for the next year or longer .
Since the range I envision is very broad , stocks could still have considerable upside potential from current levels .
Yet in this dicey environment , I think it is even more important to have a portion of your equity portfolio with professional money managers that have the flexibility to move to the safety of cash , or hedge positions , should market conditions dictate .
Conclusions - What To Watch For
As I see it , the economy has three major issues to deal with in the coming months and years .
First , we have to get a better handle on exactly how much subprime exposure banks and Wall Street firms have , and whether or not they can survive .
I expect we will have a much clearer picture on the subprime and related exposure before the end of this year .
Next , we 're going to have to work through the housing dilemma .
In some geographic areas , housing prices may continue to climb , albeit at a slower pace .
In many others , however , housing prices will likely continue to fall , or stagnate where they are for an extended period of time .
Either way , it 's not good news for those who want a booming housing market to create equity in what is likely their largest investment .
Finally , I think the sticker shock associated with food and fuel prices is a major contributing factor to the recent plunge in the consumer confidence numbers .
It seems that gas prices go up each day , and we 're not even into the summer driving season yet .
Food costs are also rising quickly , so it 's no wonder that consumers are in a funk .
Despite that , the economy did remain in positive territory in the 1Q .
Consumer spending , which accounts for apprx .
70 % of GDP , continued to rise in the 1Q , although modestly .
It remains to be seen if the economy will have dipped slightly into negative territory in the 2Q .
And it will be interesting to see how much the stimulus package boosts the economy in the 3Q .
After reviewing the outlooks from all of my various sources of economic information , I believe we may have seen the worst of the subprime and housing crises .
However , I also tend to agree with Peter Bernstein , who I quoted last week as saying that our current economic malaise could hang on longer than most people expect .
Even so , there should be opportunities in the market for those who are properly positioned to take advantage of them .
Finally , I happen to think that now may be a good time to dip a toe back into the murky waters of the stock market .
Sure , there 's risk involved , but as I noted last week , sometimes you take on more risk by doing nothing .
So , if you are sitting on the sidelines , or are under - invested in equities , this may be a good time to consider investing with one or more of the professional money managers I recommend that have the flexibility to move to cash or hedge positions , just in case there is more bad news in the pipeline .

Coal triumphs over Gore , at least on the Drudge Report
Even with his blockbuster global warming jeremiad , and his Nobel Peace Prize , coal still triumphs over Gore .
At least on the Drudge Report .
In an amusing advertising juxtaposition this morning , an advertisement for the clean coal lobby appeared atop the conservative iconoclast Matt Drudge 's website , just above a series of headlines regarding Gore 's co-victory for the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize .
At the top of the page : " Life , liberty and the pursuit of a cooler planet . "
Just below : " GORE'S PEACE PRIZE TRIUMPH . "
The ad rotates , so it may not appear upon your visit to Drudge .
A screenshot appears below , of the Drudge page and the ad in real size .

Correction :
The first edition of this article incorrectly reported the text of the ad as shown in the image .
@BurntButterandSugar : Seriously !
There was like only one girl in our class who'd had her period too !
Nowadays about half the 5th graders probably have .
( I remember the booklet too !
I remember taking it into my room to read and being really embarassed when my mom came in while I was looking at it .
" Mooooooooooom ! "
@aubonpam : I remember that scene !
I was left with the unmistabable feeling that we were just shown some kind of promotional film for a womanly hygeine company .
Opinion
Rule by fear or rule by law ?
" The power of the Executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law , and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers , is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether Nazi or Communist . "
- Winston Churchill , Nov. 21 , 1943
Since 9/11 , and seemingly without the notice of most Americans , the federal government has assumed the authority to institute martial law , arrest a wide swath of dissidents ( citizen and noncitizen alike ) , and detain people without legal or constitutional recourse in the event of " an emergency influx of immigrants in the U.S. , or to support the rapid development of new programs . "
Beginning in 1999 , the government has entered into a series of single - bid contracts with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown and Root ( KBR ) to build detention camps at undisclosed locations within the United States .
The government has also contracted with several companies to build thousands of railcars , some reportedly equipped with shackles , ostensibly to transport detainees .
According to diplomat and author Peter Dale Scott , the KBR contract is part of a Homeland Security plan titled ENDGAME , which sets as its goal the removal of " all removable aliens " and " potential terrorists . "
Fraud - busters such as Rep. Henry Waxman , D - Los Angeles , have complained about these contracts , saying that more taxpayer dollars should not go to taxpayer - gouging Halliburton .
But the real question is :
What kind of " new programs " require the construction and refurbishment of detention facilities in nearly every state of the union with the capacity to house perhaps millions of people ?
Sect. 1042 of the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act ( NDAA ) , " Use of the Armed Forces in Major Public Emergencies , " gives the executive the power to invoke martial law .
For the first time in more than a century , the president is now authorized to use the military in response to " a natural disaster , a disease outbreak , a terrorist attack or any other condition in which the President determines that domestic violence has occurred to the extent that state officials cannot maintain public order . "
The Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , rammed through Congress just before the 2006 midterm elections , allows for the indefinite imprisonment of anyone who donates money to a charity that turns up on a list of " terrorist " organizations , or who speaks out against the government 's policies .
The law calls for secret trials for citizens and noncitizens alike .
Also in 2007 , the White House quietly issued National Security Presidential Directive 51 ( NSPD - 51 ) , to ensure " continuity of government " in the event of what the document vaguely calls a " catastrophic emergency . "
Should the president determine that such an emergency has occurred , he and he alone is empowered to do whatever he deems necessary to ensure " continuity of government . "
This could include everything from canceling elections to suspending the Constitution to launching a nuclear attack .
Congress has yet to hold a single hearing on NSPD - 51 .
U.S. Rep. Jane Harman , D - Venice ( Los Angeles County ) has come up with a new way to expand the domestic " war on terror . "
Her Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007 ( HR1955 ) , which passed the House by the lopsided vote of 404 - 6 , would set up a commission to " examine and report upon the facts and causes " of so - called violent radicalism and extremist ideology , then make legislative recommendations on combatting it .
According to commentary in the Baltimore Sun , Rep. Harman and her colleagues from both sides of the aisle believe the country faces a native brand of terrorism , and needs a commission with sweeping investigative power to combat it .
A clue as to where Harman 's commission might be aiming is the Animal Enterprise Terrorism
Act , a law that labels those who " engage in sit-ins , civil disobedience , trespass , or any other crime in the name of animal rights " as terrorists .
Other groups in the crosshairs could be anti-abortion protesters , anti-tax agitators , immigration activists , environmentalists , peace demonstrators , Second Amendment rights supporters ... the list goes on and on .
According to author Naomi Wolf , the National Counterterrorism Center holds the names of roughly 775,000 " terror suspects " with the number increasing by 20,000 per month .
What could the government be contemplating that leads it to make contingency plans to detain without recourse millions of its own citizens ?
The Constitution does not allow the executive to have unchecked power under any circumstances .
The people must not allow the president to use the war on terrorism to rule by fear instead of by law .
Building a Legal Framework for Torture On Jan. 17 , 2003 , Mary Walker , the Air Force general counsel , received an urgent memo from the Pentagon 's top attorney .
Attached to the classified document was a set of directives drafted two days earlier by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld .
Bookmark
Digg Email
Printer friendly " Establish a working group within the Department of Defense to assess the legal , policy and operational issues relating to the interrogations of detainees held by the U.S. Armed Forces in the war on terrorism , " the directives said .
Among the issues to be addressed were “ policy considerations with respect to the choice of interrogation techniques , including contribution to intelligence collection , effect on treatment of captured U.S. military personnel , effect on detainee prosecutions , historical role of U.S. armed forces in conducting interrogations , recommendations for employment of particular interrogation techniques by [ Defense Department ] interrogators . "
Earlier this week , the Defense Department turned over an 81 - page document to the American Civil Liberties Union in a Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit that provides further insight into the extraordinary Executive Branch powers granted to President George W. Bush following the 9/11 attacks .
John
Yoo , then a deputy in the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , drafted the document , dated March 14 , 2003 .
It essentially provided military interrogators with legal cover if they resorted to brutal and violent methods to extract information from prisoners .
" If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition , he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network , " Yoo wrote .
" In that case , we believe that he could argue that the Executive Branch 's constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions . "
The legal opinion for military interrogators was virtually identical to an earlier memo that Yoo had written in August 2002 for CIA interrogators .
Widely called the “ Torture Memo , ” it provided CIA interrogators with the legal authority to use long - outlawed tactics , such as waterboarding , when interrogating so - called high - level terrorist suspects .
But Yoo ’s legal opinions were not entirely the work of Yoo .
Pentagon Frustrations
In early January 2003 , commanders stationed at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba complained to Rumsfeld that military officials were unable to glean information from prisoners about alleged terrorist plots in the U.S. and abroad using conventional interrogation methods .
Following his conversation with military officials , on Jan. 15 , 2003 , Rumsfeld sent William Haynes II , the Pentagon 's general counsel , a memo requesting that he form a " working group " to determine what methods military interrogators could use to extract information from a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay .
Haynes asked the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel for guidance and selected Walker to chair a " working group " to write a report on legally permissible interrogation techniques .
The members of the group included former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith , officials from the Defense Intelligence Agency , representatives of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and judge advocate generals ( JAGs ) from all four branches of the military .
By the time Walker 's group had settled in for its first meeting , interrogators at Guantanamo Bay had already begun to violate the Geneva Convention .
To ratchet up pressure on prisoners , U.S. military personnel were experimenting with unusual tactics , including placing women 's underwear on prisoners ’ heads , a technique that later reappeared in Iraq 's Abu Ghraib prison .
A military official , who took part in discussions with Mary Walker ’s group , told the Wall Street Journal in June 2004 that there was a growing frustration among interrogators .
" We 'd been at this for a year - plus and got nothing out of them , " the official said , adding that threats were even made against the families of detainees .
The official said the message to a detainee would be : " I'm on the line with somebody in Yemen and he's in a room with your family and a grenade that 's going to pop unless you talk . "
Framing the Debate While Walker 's report was being drafted , the group discussed 35 different interrogation techniques that could be used to obtain information from prisoners .
Early drafts of the report advocated intimidating prisoners with dogs , removing prisoners ' clothing , shaving their beards , slapping prisoners in the face and waterboarding .
Though some of the more extreme techniques were dropped as the list was winnowed down to 24 from 35 , the final set of methods still included tactics for isolating and demeaning a detainee , known as " pride and ego down . "
Such degrading tactics violated the Geneva Convention , which bars abusive or demeaning treatment of captives .
The more extreme interrogation methods that made it into the final draft of the report rankled some of the JAGs , who feared the methods would put U.S. soldiers in danger if they were captured – and would tarnish the reputation and image of the U.S. abroad .
" Will the American people find we have missed the forest for the trees by condoning practices that , while technically legal , are inconsistent with our most fundamental values , ” wrote Rear Adm .
Michael Lohr , a member of the " working group , " in a February 2003 letter to Walker .
“ How would such perceptions affect our ability to prosecute the Global War on Terrorism , " asked Lohr .
The admiral was so upset with the draft report and the advice provided by the Justice Department that he requested Walker include a sentence in the final report making it clear that the legal findings were based exclusively on attorneys in the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel .
Lohr was not alone .
Maj. Gen. Jack Rives , who at the time was judge advocate general of the Air Force , also wrote a letter to Walker warning that the interrogation techniques in the report would violate military law .
" Several of the exceptional techniques , on their face , amount to violations of domestic criminal law and the [ Uniform Code of Military Justice ] , " Rives wrote .
" Treating detainees inconsistently with the [ Geneva ] Convention arguably ‘ lowers the bar ’ for the treatment of U.S. POW 's in future conflicts . "
Maj. Gen. Thomas Romig , an Army JAG , and Brig . Gen. Kevin M. Sandkuhler , a Marine Corps JAG , also voiced concerns , specifically the determination that the President has the power to override the Uniform Code of Military Justice and other federal statutes and international treaties in the name of national security .
Defending Bush ’s Authority
Walker 's group addressed these concerns , according to the report , by stating , in legal terms , that the President had the constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to ignore torture laws if national security were in jeopardy .
On March 6 , 2003 , eight days before
Yoo issued his legal opinion , Walker sent Rumsfeld a draft 53 - page " working group " report that said international treaties forbidding torture did not apply to prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay .
The report , which asserted that President Bush had " sweeping " powers as Commander in Chief , said Bush could suspend international laws and treaties governing torture in the name of national security .
" In order to respect the President 's inherent constitutional authority to manage a military campaign . . . ( the prohibition against torture ) must be construed as inapplicable to interrogations undertaken pursuant to his Commander - in - Chief authority , " the report stated .
The Justice Department could not prosecute military interrogators " who had acted pursuant to an exercise of the President 's constitutional power , " the report added .
Further , the report said that if a prisoner died as a result of a brutal interrogation technique , the interrogator would not be subject to prosecution if he had acted in a " good faith " effort to save lives .
" Good faith may be a complete defense , " the report said .
" Sometimes the greater good for society will be accomplished by violating the literal language of the criminal law . ”
The report cited a legal text , " Substantive Criminal Law " by Wayne LaFave and Austin W. Scott , to support the legality of the interrogation methods : " In particular , the necessity defense can justify the intentional killing of one person . . . so long as the harm avoided is greater . "
Rumsfeld signed the final report on April 2 , 2003 , two weeks after Bush ordered U.S. forces to invade Iraq .
One year later , photos depicting U.S. soldiers abusing and humiliating detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq were publicly released .
Congressional Reaction
The tide began to turn against Yoo 's and Walker 's expansive attitudes toward presidential authority when Jack Goldsmith took over as chief of the Office of Legal Counsel and , by early 2004 , had rescinded Yoo 's opinions .
On June 15 , 2004 , the Senate passed an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill backed by Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham , to give JAGs the same legal authority as military attorneys , like Walker , who are appointed by the President .
The amendment , dubbed the “ Mary Walker bill , ” was spurred by complaints from JAGs who said Walker had ignored their legal concerns about the interrogation of detainees at Guantanamo Bay .
In February 2008 , the Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility ( OPR ) confirmed that it had launched a formal investigation into whether Yoo and other attorneys in the Office of Legal Counsel gave the White House poor legal advice in authorizing CIA interrogators to use waterboarding to glean information about terrorist plots from prisoners .
In effect , the legal opinions from Walker and Yoo sought to provide a basis for the Bush administration to circumvent U.S. and international laws prohibiting torture of prisoners .
Immediately after the 9/11 attacks , the United Nations Committee Against Torture reaffirmed the prohibitions contained in the 1984 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment .
The Convention – approved by 145 nations , including the United States – states that " no exceptional circumstances whatsoever , whether a state of war or a threat of war , internal political instability or any other public emergency , may be invoked as a justification of torture . "
Moreover , the convention says individuals who resort to torture cannot defend their actions by saying they were acting on orders from superiors .
The United States signed the Convention Against Torture in 1988 under President Ronald Reagan , who hailed it as “ a significant step ” in preventing torture , which he called “ an abhorrent practice unfortunately still prevalent in the world today . ”
In a May 20 , 1988 , message to the U.S. Senate , Reagan noted that “ the core provisions of the Convention establish a regime for international cooperation in the criminal prosecution of torturers relying on so - called ‘ universal jurisdiction . ’
“ Each state party is required either to prosecute torturers who are found in its territory or to extradite them to other countries for prosecution . ”
It was this Convention , ratified by the Senate in 1994 , that Walker , Yoo and other Bush administration officials sought to bypass .
Although the treaty mandates that the United States cooperate in the criminal prosecution of torturers , the administration 's post - 9/11 legal opinions sought to shield American interrogators .
The Walker report , which was tailored to fit with Yoo ’s legal arguments , advised military interrogators that they could defend their actions by saying Justice Department lawyers told them that their methods were legal .

For the sake of this post , I ’m going to pretend to know what metaprogramming * is .
Â Yeah , so tinypy ** totally has that .
Â
At least , since the parser and compiler in tinypy is written in tinypy , you are able to modify those modules on - the - fly and add new features into the tinypy language .
Â
( Not that you ’d want to , but certain other languages get so uppity about being able to do that , I figured I ’d plug for tinypy here . )
For example , ( at present ) tinypy does n’t have support for decorators .
Â
I ’ve always liked decorators , so I made this code ( a zip of main.py , deco .
py*** , and test.py ) so that if you have a main .
py :
import deco
import test
When the deco module is loaded , it cleanly **** adds decorator support into the tokenize , parse , and encode modules of tinypy .
Â
Then when the test module is loaded , it is able to use decorator syntax .
Â
Yay !Â
This mostly thanks to the top down operator precedence implementation in tinypy .
So now , if say , you have some crazy idea for how the $ operator should be used in bigpy , you can go ahead and use metaprogramming to add it into tinypy and show all your friends how awful your new syntax looks and have a working proof - of - concept !
Â
Yay !
* feel free to enlighten me
** it ’s got a mailing list now , join in on all the fun !!
*** only 611 bytes :)
Â
They were pretty simple to implement , since they really just mean : “ given ‘@a
def b …’ do ‘ def b …
b=a(b ) ' ”
**** Since all the language features are stored in dictionaries , it ’s “ pretty easy ” to add new symbols / operators .
Â
( Or remove features , or whatever ! )
NEW ORLEANS 
A broad education overhaul under way here has produced improvement in test scores , results released Tuesday showed , though many students are still struggling .
The number of fourth graders who passed a state promotional exam increased by 12 percentage points over the previous year , and eighth graders improved by four percentage points .
School officials also noted significant increases in the numbers of students with passing scores in the test ’s various components 
English , math , science , social studies and reading .
Nonetheless , more than half the students who took the test in those grades did not pass , and 60 percent of high school students got an unsatisfactory ranking in standardized English and math tests , a figure three to four times higher than the percentage throughout Louisiana .
March 22nd , 2008 ( 10:59 am )
Lately , some folks on my f-list have been looking at Lord King Bad profic .
brown_betty gave us LEOPARD LORD , and cereta reviewed THE SHEIK , and burger_eater pointed me to Smart Bitches , Trashy Books 's take on Shayla Black 's DECADENT .
These books , it should be admitted , are deeply awful , and as portrayals of their authors ' ids , they 're more than a little alarming .
You do n't want to look , but you can't look away .
The awfulness becomes sublime .
So why am I commenting about this ?
Well , because I feel a little like Richard Dreyfuss in JAWS , during the scar scene : " I got that beat .
I got that beat . "
Permit me to introduce John Ringo .
Ringo is the author of a bajillion books , including fantasy and military SF .
The novels ( oh , yes , there is more than one ) we 'll be considering are from the PALADIN OF SHADOWS series .
These are modern - day action thrillers in which -- well , let 's look at GHOST , the first novel in the series .
The story begins with our hero , Mike Harmon , a accidentally witnessing the abduction of a college coed .
He witnesses it because he just happens to be lurking in the shadows and watching the coeds himself .
This is Mike 's recreation .
Why ?
Well :
He knew that at heart , he was a rapist .
And that meant he hated rapists more than any " normal " human being .
They purely pissed him off .
He 'd spent his entire sexually adult life fighting the urge to not use his inconsiderable strength to possess and take instead of woo and cajole .
He 'd fought his demons to a standstill again and again when it would have been so easy to give in .
He 'd had one truly screwed up bitch get completely naked , with him naked and erect between her legs , and she still could n't say " yes . "
And he'd just said : " that 's okay " and walked away with an amazing case of blue balls .
When men gave in to that dark side , it made him even more angry then listening to leftist bitches scream about " western civilization " and how it was so fucked up .
" I really want to know who you are . "
" Well , " he said , grinning , " if you ever see me again , for the first time , be overwhelmed by a wave of lust and need to give me a blowjob right then and there , even if it 's in public , okay ? "
" Sure , " Ashley said , shaking her head .
" Men . Maybe not in public , but we 'll talk , okay ?
This has ... "
" Do n't let this put you off of men , God damnit , " Mike said , firmly .
" I did n't risk my fucking life to have you go lesbo .
All men are n't these filth .
And if you decide they are , you 're spitting on what * I* did .
Because the * good * guys want to get laid , too .
Understand ? "
" You 've never actually raped a woman , have you ? "
Amy asked .
" Depends on the definition , " Mike replied .
" I do n't think any of the hookers in the third world are actually volunteers .
I keep that in mind when I fuck 'em .
It helps . "
" Yes , ma'am , " Mike said , taking a breath and definitely not sighing .
There was a pause as he listened to Pam 's mother .
" Go ahead , " Mike said , raising his eyebrows .
" Probably ring , " Mike said .
" Some ball but only monitored .
Possibly cock . " ... [ Ellipses in original -- DH ]
" I will be . " ...
" I 'm still making up my order in my mind , " Mike said .
" But leather .
Probably locking . " ...
" Ca n't cut it off if there 's a panic attack , " Mike said .
" You can cut leather . "
He looked over at Pam , who was staring at him , wide - eyed , and shrugged .
[ . . . ]
" Fine , " he said , nodding .
" Good talking to you , too , ma'am .
No , I wo n't say that in front of the girls .
Yes I will .
Goodbye . "
" Was that conversation about what I think it was about ? "
Pam said , staring in horror .
" Yep , " Mike said , shaking his head .
" You two have got a couple of kinky moms .
I guess the acorn does n't fall far from the tree . "
" Oh , God ! " Pam wailed .
" I did so not want to know that ! "
" It was better than having the conversation with her yourself , " Courtney said .
" Trust me . "
" There 's things I 'd like to talk about , but you 're my mother .
I do n't think you 'd understand . "
" You might be surprised , dear , " Abigail said gently .
" If you do understand , I do n't want to know , " Courtnet said , sighing , then paused .
" Mom , have you ever heard the ... term , I guess : scene . "
There was a very long pause .
" Yes , " Abigail said , calmly .
" Oh , " Courtney replied , her eyes widening .
" Is he a top or a bottom ? " Abigail asked .
" A what ? " Courtnet asked .
" Is he a dominant or a submissive , then ? " her mother asked .
" Mom ! "
" Dear , do you know what a spreader bar is ? "
" Mom ! " Courtney gasped .
" No .
And I do n't want to know if you do ! "
" You know those rosewood planter hangers in your father 's and my bedroom ? "
" Mother ! "
" I do n't think you know what truly good is , dear , " Abigail said , trying to get through to her .
" I know Pam came at least three times last night , " Courtney said .
" And I do n't know whether to count this morning as one , two , or one continuous amazing climax , Mother , if you want me to be blunt . "
" Oh , " Abigail said .
" Uhm ...
What was his name again ? "
" Mother ! "
" Well , your father and I do swing , " Abigail said .
" Mother ! "
" And , I suppose I 'm probably too old for him , but some guys do enjoy mother - daughter action ... "
" Mother ! "
" I 'm not particularly proud of that side of me , " Mike said as he pulled on his clothes .
" It comes out from time to time , but I do n't like it .
That , " he added , gesturing with his chin at the money , " does n't make up for what I did to you .
But ... it helps .
Both you and me .
And I 'm sorry for how I treated you , but I was at a point where it was do what I did or kill somebody .
And , unfortunately , right now there 's nobody left for me to kill . "
" Is okay , " Magdalena said , pulling the clip off the roll and counting the money .
" Not like , much hurt , much ... bad memory . "
She got to the end of the quick count and looked at him again , curiously .
" But for this , is okay .
Would do again . "
" Yeah , " Mike said as he holstered his piece and picked up his jump bag .
" But then you 'd be acting .
It would n't be the same . "
The blonde looked at him and lowered her eyes demurely but he'd gotten just enough of a flash to know it was a total act .
The eyes that had tracked to him were as cold as a shark 's , cold enough that they were a little frightening .
Not just resigned cold but the sort of look you saw on someone who'd seen too much combat and discovered they enjoyed killing people and breaking things .
Mike occasionally saw the same look in a mirror and knew it was the outward expression of something he did n't want to get involved with .
The blonde was a flat killer waiting for her chance .
" What the fuck do we do with them ? "
Mike asked , looking at the nine girls lined up by the roadside .
They 'd mostly stopped crying and now looked at the men with guns in fear .
They also were covered [ with ] blood and in some cases vomit .
" Clean 'em up and fuck 'em ? " Thompson suggested .
" You 're going to need lots of oysters , bud , " Adams said , chuckling as he tossed the former SEAL a towel .
" And Viagra stock . "
" Chief , they 're teenage virgins , " Mike said , toweling off .
" Viagra is not going to be necessary . "
The girl was clearly frightened , even terrified .
And , yes , very pretty .
About five foot one , long blonde hair and blue eyes .
And no more than twelve .
She was just starting to get the gangling growth spurt that kids hit at that age and might , indeed , grow some more tit .
He was n't sure she was even menstruating yet .
...
Mike let the girl sit on his lap and ran his hands over her stomach as she quivered in fear .
He was careful to try to skip the bruised areas but she was still quaking , which did n't help much .
He had a very real problem with being the sort of son of a bitch he was playing and the entire scene was turning him on more than he liked .
He knew the girl could feel a very solid erection under her pert little ass and he knew that made him not only a Class A son of a bitch but a pervert .
Unfortunately , short of castration he was n't sure what to do about his little problem .
Other than killing bastards who actually let their demons out .
Such as the two other males in
the room .
" Everything is in fricking Romanian , " Vanner said , shrugging .
" You read Romanian ?
I do n't .
We 're using automatic translators .
You know how good those are . "
" What about Nikki ? " Mike asked .
" She speaks English and Russian , " Vanner replied .
" Go roust out Russel , a Keldara girl , and one of the Keldara shooters , " Mike said after a bit of thought .
" Have them go find a street hooker that speaks Romanian and English .
Reads it , too .
One that wo n't be missed .
Bring her back here .
We 'll just take her with us when we leave . "
Anisa looked around and sighed .
" They are all dressed so ... "
" Sluttily , " Cottontail said , laughing nastily .
" Men like that .
They like to have women that are fast , cheap , and easy .
They do n't seem to worry about whether we like it or not .
Most of them like that we do n't .
They like to hurt us , to use us , to make us feel less than they are . "
" Not the Kildar , " Anisa pointed out .
" Even the Kildar , " Katya replied sharply .
" He likes that he owns us , that he can use us . "
" He treats you well , " Anisa protested .
" But he still owns us , " Cottontail snapped , turning to look at the girl and waving at the whores along the street .
" We 're no better than these !
We 're owned by the Kildar and he uses us at his pleasure !
The only difference is we do n't walk the street !
We just live in his brothel for the use of him and his friends . "
" He said he offered to let you all go , " Anisa argued unhappily .
" To where ? " Katya snapped back .
" What can we do but make our way on our backs ?
There are plenty of girls here who chose to be here , because even this is better than wherever they 're running from !
Because they do n't have any choice other than to sell their bodies .
They do n't have a family to go back to ... "
She stopped and turned away , her face hard .
" Is that what happened to you ? "
Anisa asked quietly as they continued walking .
" I do n't talk about it , " Cottontail said bitterly .
" Do you have a family ? " Anisa asked , still quietly .
" Just shut the fuck up , okay ? " Katya replied .
" We 're nearly there and we need to get our game face on . "
" Okay , okay , " Anisa said , readjusting her dress .
" Here goes . "
By the end of thirty minutes with Mike coaching her and Katya making snarky , but pertinent , remarks , she could walk in the heels and even undulate .
A bit .
Enough to look like a new hooker on the street .
As the two left , Adams let out a long sigh .
" I 'm going to have to either go down on the street and hire a girl or take a long cold shower , " the chief said .
" That was just ... "
" Erotic as hell , " Mike replied .
" You can understand why these pimps do what they do .
Besides the money , which in this society is nothing to sneeze at . "
" It almost makes me rethink my choice of career , " Adams admitted .
" And they get to do this all the time . "
" And beat the girls around when they screw up , " Mike added .
" I 'm not particularly into beating on women , " Adams said , shrugging .
" Well , most of the girls they get do n't particularly want to be hookers , " Mike pointed out .
" And even the ones that do do n't want to give up most of their hard - earned money to the pimps .
So they beat on them until they learn better .
It 's a sucky situation .
And you know the fun part ? "
" What ? "
Adams asked , frowning curiously .
" How many whores have you fucked in some third world shithole ? "
Mike asked , turning to look at him .
" We 're the reason this goes on .
You ca n't just say ' it 's males ' when you 're one of the males that benefited by it . "
" Tell me something I do n't know . "
Adams shrugged .
" I do n't notice you losing sleep over it . "
" I do , sometimes , " Mike admitted .
" And I 'm the one that enjoys beating on women .
I wish I had the money to buy up every whore and potential whore on the planet and put them someplace safe . "
" But if you did , you 'd just have more kidnappings . "
" There 's that , " Mike admitted , sighing .
" You ever think about this whole system as a good thing ? "
Adams asked .
" What in the hell do you mean by that ? "
Mike snarled .
" Think about it , " Adams replied calmly .
" In the States , the predators snatch some girl off the street , rape her and kill her .
Here , they snatch them off the street , rape them and sell them .
Alive . "
" Now there 's a hell of a thought and no lie , " Mike said quietly .
" But you think that some of them do n't die in the process ? "
" No , a bunch of them do , " Adams admitted .
" But a bunch of them live , too .
For a given value of life .
Which means still breathing .
Concentrate on bringing home a live one and leave the fucking existentialism for after the mission , SEAL . "
" Will do , Chief , " Mike said , grinning .
" Now I 'm gonna go find some abused , raped , forced - to - be - a - whore whore and fuck her silly ass off .
For cash .
Without beating on her .
End of angst . "
Katya looked over the long list in wonder .
" What is ' micrometallic skeletal enhancement ? ' " she asked , her eyes wide .
" You do n't want that , " Mike said , looking over her shoulder .
" Unless there 's been some radical development in nanotechnology they 're sitting on , it would mean stripping off your skin and muscle to get it .
On the other hand , you'd be bulletproof , to low velocity weapons , over most of your body .
Jesus Christ .
There are n't many of these that are listed as actually used .
But the ones that are scare the hell out of me .
At least the ' sonic transceiver ' is listed as ' tested , stable . '
But I was joking about the poison fingernails ! [. . .]
Go for the ' subcutaneous nonmetallic puncture device . '
Means you can carry a knife anywhere . "
" I like the poison fingernails , " Katya said .
" I can use them on this mission ! "
Ladies and gentlemen , * our hero .
* You think that paragraph alone would make this book awesomely bad , but no .
IT GETS MORE SO .
Yes , you will be horrified by a lot of this , because Mike Harmon 's adventures are by turns awesomely horrific and horrifically awesome ; I freely confess that I cannot stop reading these books , because * I have to see what Ringo does next . *
I do , however , have a finely - tuned defense mechanism : whenever something trips my circuit breaker , causing me to cringe away from the page , I utter aloud a cry that resets my noggin .
You will probably need it yourself , so I provide it here , as a public service : " OH JOHN RINGO NO .
" GHOST is Ringo's own admitted Lord King Badfic , his id run wild .
By his own account , he was trying to write several books he was actually contracted for , but GHOST kept nudging at him , and finally he just wrote the damn thing to * make it go away * so he could get back to fulfilling his contracts .
Ringo locked the spewings of his id away on his hard drive , until he mentioned in passing on an online forum that yeah , he 'd written another book , but it was * awful * and would never see the light of day .
Naturally , folks were curious , and when Ringo posted a sample , nobody was more surprised than him to find that the response was , more often than not , " Hey , man , I 'd buy this .
" So his publisher put it out , and the books are now doing pretty well for them .
I 'm sure this is a pleasant surprise if you 're Ringo or his publisher , but it 's also got to be a little embarrassing ; he 's committed the literary equivalent of charging money for folks to watch him roll naked in a pile of dead and smelly fish .
And then being begged for encores .
As of this writing , I have only the first three books in the series , because dammit , I will buy crap , but I refuse to buy crap in hardcover .
That 's * expensive . *
I mean , I could be spending that money on * guns .
* To resume : Mike hitches a ride on the back of the van that kidnaps the coed .
Mike , you see , is a former Navy SEAL , call sign " Ghost . "
" Fifteen years in the teams had left him with degenerative damage in half the major joints in his body and a back that was compacted enough for a fifty - year - old , " but like most action heroes ( see : Stephen Hunter 's Earl Swagger and his son Bob Lee , both of whom I love )
Mike 's old injuries do n't enjoin him from going strong in the actual action scenes ; they 're more atmospheric than anything else .
It turns out that terrorists are kidnapping young women as part of a Diabolical Plan ( " Let us rape them to the Glory of Allah ! " ) .
Mike 's plan to go for help -- alas , he left his cell phone charging at home -- goes toes up when he is spotted by a sentry and has to kill the man in self - defense .
If he leaves to get help , the sentry will be found , and the bad guys will pull up stakes .
You knew it was coming : former SEAL , outnumbered and outgunned , against a swarm of dastardly Arab terrorists .
He rescues the coed , name of Ashley , but refuses to tell her who he is -- he 's killed a bunch of people , and he 's worried about legal repercussions .
THE WHOLE BOOK IS LIKE THIS .
Unfortunately , Mike has only disrupted one shipment .
He finds documentation indicating the bad guys are on the way to Atlanta 's main airport , and gives chase -- only to accidentally spy them at a smaller one , and realize they 've laid a false trail .
No backup , again , so he hides in the plane shipping the roofied coeds off to Syria , where their rapes and torture will be videotaped for jihadist progaganda .
Mike manages to disrupt the torture and gets the word out via sat phone , then sits back to wait for rescue while setting up a defensive perimeter with the help of some of the more athletic coeds .
Learning their names is too much bother , so he dubs them " Babe " ( for Babe Ruth ; she plays baseball , and learns to apply her skills to grenades ) , " Bambi , " and " Thumper . "
They are , of course , naked , and Mike pauses to appreciate the view as he sends them scurrying to fetch him ammo .
( " Dead bad guys and naked girls .
It 's like an op in a titty bar .
All I need is beer and steak , maybe some heavy metal or Goth music , and this would be perfect . " )
Lest you think it is all blood and guts , Mike and a ROTC cadet named Amy bond over music ; during off moments , they sing " March of Cambreadth " and " Winter Born , " and he confesses his less savory inclinations .... I... I just ...
OH JOHN RINGO NO .
I am going to skip over a bunch of stuff , like the hostages setting up a webcam link and getting live coverage on FOX News , but let me just tell you that the cavalry comes and rescues the coeds and the injured Mike , but not before he kills the president of Syria and Osama bin Laden , both of whom happen to be at the facility , and cuts bin Laden 's head off to put in a pail as a gift for the President .
AND he convinces several of the coeds to become staunch Republicans .
AND THAT IS JUST PART ONE .
I feel about the PALADIN OF SHADOWS series the way that a lot of people feel about ALL - STAR BATMAN AND ROBIN : it is so horrifically awful that it becomes TOTALLY FUCKING AWESOME .
Unless , of course , you have triggers about some or all of this stuff , in which case my recommendation is TO RUN AS FAR AND AS FAST AS YOU CAN .
I will , however , say that GHOST and its sequels are * excellent * for reading out loud to people , particularly friends who are horrified and actively begging you to stop .
( And you will be inclined to disregard such pleas , because you will need to share the pain . )
I should note that , as you may have gathered , the series -- GHOST in particular -- is not just slaughtering terrorists and deeply skeevy sexual stuff .
GHOST is an example of explicitly ideological fiction , and I think that subject is worth a minor digression .
There are two kinds of ideological fiction : the implicit and the explicit , the former being more common .
Implicit ideological fiction does not directly champion a particular ideology as such .
More often , it presents a world rooted in that ideology 's assumptions .
As you 'd expect , when it comes to surviving and triumphing in such a world , the characters who incorporate the morals of that ideology do remarkably better than anyone else .
Stephen King 's novella " The Mist " is a pretty good example of what I 'm talking about .
The onset of the mist itself is a the fault of the military - industrial complex .
Christianity provides not a comfort , but a rationale for slaughter .
The human villains are comfort food for the leftist viewpoint .
This does not make " The Mist " a bad story .
It is , in fact , pretty goddamned awesome .
But some aspects of it are a trifle obvious , particularly if you 've sussed King 's political leanings from such works as FIRESTARTER or THE DEAD ZONE .
A lot of fiction these days is implicitly liberal , because a lot of writers lean vaguely left and so their stories reflect their internalized truths .
This may not be obvious for folks who lean to the left , and focus on the progressive failings of books ( particularly representation and diversity ) , but for folks who lean to the right , it 's a little jarring when , for example , a DC comics story implies that the US government shot war correspondent Lois Lane in order to get Superman to fly to the battlefield post - haste , on the grounds that his presence would motivate the enemy to surrender .
If you lean to the left , this is a compelling storyline because it reflects your own unease with the US at war , and distrust of the government to do the right thing under these circumstances , as well as the belief that the government is more likely than not to actively do evil in order to facilitate its ends .
If you 're more conservative , you may well find that storyline deeply offensive , considering that the US is in the middle of a war with people who literally behead journalists they do n't like .
This tendency of a lot of fiction to be implicitly leftish means that conservative and libertarian ideological fiction tend , by reaction , to be explicitly ideological : the writers are n't content to treat their worldview as a given within the spectrum of their story , but make * winning ideologically * a component in the story .
This is doubtless satisfying and comforting , but it has a tendency to wind up being too much on the nose .
That 's not to say that liberals do n't do it , too .
Richard North Patterson is a wonderful thriller writer , but his Kerry Kilcannon political novels are just appallingly tone - deaf in this regard ; Patterson can't write convincing conservatives to save his life , and so Kilcannon 's opposition comes off as being about as deep and believable as the token liberals in Tom Clancy novels .
Actually , no ; the token liberals in * Vince Flynn * novels !
And do n't get me started on Aaron Sorkin .
The various types of ideological fiction also differ in how they treat the loyal opposition -- by which I mean , the people who disagree but are nominally on the same team .
In conservative ideological fiction , the loyal opposition is steamrolled ; they 're there , but are defeated or ignored by Our Heroes , who are of course Faithful and Right ( pretty much any Tom Clancy novel ; 24 ) .
In liberal ideological fiction , the loyal opposition is defeated and becomes the subject of public opprobium , while Our Heroes are admired for being Faithful and Right ( as in TRANSMETROPOLITAN , say , or my beloved BABYLON 5 , or to a lesser degree in SERENITY , or half of John Grisham 's novels , or ... incidentally , could I just request that if any of my liberal friends decide to write a political intrigue , would you please not foist yet another goddamned haircut of Watergate or Murrow vs. McCarthy on the world ?
BECAUSE I HAVE FUCKING SEEN IT ) .
In Libertarian ideological fiction , there generally * is* no loyal opposition ; Our Heroes are Faithful and Right and those who disagree with them are either misinformed ( and over the course of the novel are educated to become Faithful and Right ) or outright evil .
( Also , Libertarian authors are , for the most part , constitutionally incapable of lecturing an audience on merely one political question ; they want to convince you on all of them , and all at once . )
( The writer whose ideological novels have done the best job of portraying honest but implacable disagreement , in my view , is Allen Drury .
His ADVISE AND CONSENT series makes for a fascinating study of ideological fiction in its own right .
Another day . )
Anyway .
Mike has rescued a number of nubile college women from rape and torture at the hands of jihadists , slaughtered innumerable terrorists , killed the president of Syria and Osama bin Laden , and plugged the author 's favorite bands and movies .
Also , the United States has , as a punitive measure , dropped a low - yield nuke on Syria .
You would think that would be enough for a book .
Hah .
As I said earlier , that is JUST IN PART ONE .
In part two , Mike , independently wealthy after getting the bounty for Osama , is now doing a lot of fishing on his newly - purchased and heavily - armed yacht .
He meets up with two young college girls and invites them onto his boat , where he promptly introduces them to the joys of BDSM .
With emphasis on scenes that incorporate non-con and slavery scenarios .
But do n't worry !
He gets their moms ' permission first .
No , really .
He does .
She 's not kidding .
Here 's an excerpt of that conversation : Does it get worse ?
Yes .OH JOHN RINGO NO .
This goes on for about eighty pages , and then Mike gets a call to go intercept a smuggled nuke , which he does .
And no , he 's not done yet .
There 's also a part three , in which Mike takes time off from whoring his way through Eastern Europe to stop a terrorist nuke from going off in Paris .
But not too much : when Mike gets frustrated , he hightails it to a brothel , waves a large sum under the bouncer 's nose , and gets a pretty fifteen - year - old whore for the day .
He brutalizes the young woman , mentally and physically , taking occasional breaks to make her sleep cuddled next to him until he is ready to brutalize her again .
It is an awful , gruesome , drawn - out sequence , and if you read it it 'll make you sick .
But it 's not the worst part .
That comes at the end , when he gives her a huge tip .
Then , of course , he * buys her from her pimp , * and takes her along .
Sometimes , alas , OH JOHN RINGO NO does not offer much in the way of relief .
The acquisition of Magdalena marks the beginning of a long - running trend in the series : Mike 's accumulation of whores .
It is almost a running gag .
It is not funny yet -- at this point , it is , in fact , just * immensely * disturbing and wrong -- but this is the beginning of a trend , so I feel obliged to note it .
He takes in whores and sex slaves the way old ladies take in cats .
ONLY MORE SO .
As we will see .
You will be relieved to know , however , that nothing else happens to Magdalena :
Mike just buys her out of sexual slavery and takes her on to Paris , where , off - stage , she finds a suitable man to charm and runs away with him while Mike is off trying to stop a nuke from detonating -- and there , mercifully , GHOST ends .
As you can tell , GHOST is a pretty horrifying read .
I re-skimmed it writing this , and I had honestly forgotten just how painful to the psyche it is .
So you may ask : * Hines , why the hell were you reading this ?*
And the answer is : because I read the * second * book * first .
* Yes , that 's right .
I mentioned it above , but in case you 'd forgotten : this is a series .
And while the first book seethes with anger and disturbing sexuality , the second , while not exactly mature or brilliant , is solid guilty pleasure for those who like men's adventure .
The second book also features , amazingly , some characterization .
Where the first novel only focused on portraying Mike 's hard - assedness and the depths of his depravity , the second features big chunks of him just interacting with characters * without killing or fucking them . *
And Ringo does n't do a bad job of portraying those other characters ; most are stock , but a couple are somewhat fun .
The first book , GHOST , is an unending stream of horrors , one after the next ; the second , KILDAR , is heavy on wish - fulfillment fantasy and has its share of freaky shit , but it 's actually rather fun to read if you have a weakness for its genre .
What genre , you ask ?
AHA .
The opening of Kildar finds Mike in Georgia .
No , the other one .
The former Soviet republic is a rough place , and Mike , who 's bumming around the world while dodging fatwas , manages to get insanely lost during a snowstorm and wind up in the ass - end of nowhere .
And ass - end of nowhere in Georgia is * seriously * ass - end of nowhere .
It 's a small town , with an inn , and a mildly corrupt Claude Rains of a police chief who'd like to curtail the rampant drug- running , gun-running , and sex - slave - running of the mostly Chechen criminal enterprises -- but he does n't have the funding or men , so elects to stay alive .
Oh , and a brothel staffed with nubile young girls .
( Look , it 's a JOHN RINGO novel , okay ? )
And it has the Keldara .
The Keldara are a stubborn , proud tribe of farmers .
Who can kick serious ass , when they 've a mind .
Their history is mysterious , and they 're not inclined to share .
But their women are beautiful , their beer is jaw - droppingly magnificent , and it just so happens that they have a tradition of being beholden to a feudal lord , a foreigner who comes to them from the outside world ... You can see where this is going .
And you 're absolutely right .
Once you get past GHOST 's initial spleen - venting , the PALADIN OF SHADOWS series falls into a much - maligned , much - loved genre which , for lack of a better name , I call " Man Builds Stuff and Gets Lots of Pussy . "
This is , quite frankly , what got me reading the series : I am not much for stories of a guy just killing terrorists and getting laid a lot ; but let him start building a small kingdom while killing terrorists and getting laid a lot , and I am there .
I confess that have a soft spot for these kinds of stories .
I suspect that * lots * of men do : even if we do n't build things ourselves , we like to * read about * guys building things : castles , weapons , companies , societies .
It 's really very soothing ; it combines the pleasures of fiction with a those of a do - it - yourself manual .
The same impulses may explain why a lot of male writers are n't content to have their hero just carrying , say , a 1911 as his sidearm ; they have to tell you what make , model , whether it 's got an internal or external extractor , what aftermarket parts he 's tuned it up with , and who he bought them from , until you know all about his Kimber 's Ed Brown slide stop and Wolff springs .
( Curiously , the sex - related parts do not require details of every thrust ; if the chapter fades to black with the hero hopping into bed with two nubile wenches , honor is satisfied .
John Ringo , alas , often carries honor considerably farther . )
Mike becomes the new Kildar -- i.e. , the Keldara 's boss -- and moves into a huge , majestically decorated caravanserai .
He starts improving the Keldara lot with pickups , tractors , and new wells ; to improve the local security situation , he registers them as a militia and starts importing weapons and trainers .
Also , to take care of the trainers ' needs , he brings in whores .
LOOK , I TOLD YOU .
HE ADOPTS THEM .
LIKE CATS .
In this case , he rents several girls from the local brothel and moves them in with him , where he puts them on an increased salary and instructs them to help out around the place as well as service him and the trainers he imports .
Of course , it'd be too much trouble for the trainers to learn the whores ' actual names .
So Mike renames them : Flopsy , Mopsy , Cottontail , and Bambi .
( If you want to take a moment to bang your head against the table , go ahead ; I understand . )
The women on the training staff , Mike notes , will have to take care of their own needs .
The Keldara are prickly about sexual matters .
For this reason , Mike 's female servants are older Keldara women .
Keeps him from getting all worked up and into trouble , y'see -- look , I 'm sorry ; I know that table is n't getting any softer , but if you keep up the blunt force trauma , eventually brain damage will set in and you 'll * forget .
*Cottontail -- her real name is Katya -- is actually my favorite character in the series , for one simple reason : * she hates the hero . *
This gives me something to identify with .
Most of the whores and concubines Mike amasses are simple - minded , cheery creatures , happy to have a nice place to live and an owner who's ( of course ) really good in bed .
Katya , OTOH , is bitter , angry , and sociopathic .
This makes her a hell of a lot less comforting for the hero and the wish - fulfillment story , but it makes her much more plausible as someone who 's been used as a sex slave .
When Mike asks her what she wants , her answer is , " I never want to spread my legs for another man . "
He says he can't do that -- he needs her to be a whore for a while yet ( OH JOHN RINGO NO ) -- but he realizes she 's seriously smart , so starts getting her trained in languages , intelligence ... and eventually , assassination .
More on that later .
Whores aside , there 's a lot less OH JOHN RINGO NO in KILDAR .
Huge chunks of the book are given over to buying tractors and pick - up trucks , building dams , training the Keldara to use firearms , that kind of thing .
Yes , there 's a gorgeous fourteen - year - old teenage girl pursuing Mike , but he 's actually putting her off , because the Keldara do n't want their girls messing around , and besides she 's too young .
And you start to think okay , GHOST was really horrifying , and there 's still some creepy stuff , but John Ringo 's at least got it out of his system .
And then chapter fourteen happens .
The gorgeous Keldara teen mentioned above ( her name 's Katrina ) is kidnapped by white slavers , and Mike and the Keldara intercept their van and shoot the engine up with a Barrett .50 BMG .
The van turns out to contain seven teenage farmgirls from outside Keldara territory who were sold into slavery by their families .
And that 's * exactly what he does . *
As Mike rationalizes it , " It was what they knew was coming , anyway . "
At least if he keeps them , he can see to it they 're educated and what not .
And so for their own good he will have to take them in , as concubines , and deflower them .
With his penis .
Some , of course , are too young .
He 'll have to wait .
Until they 're sixteen .
Of course , as you will immediately have realized , if he 's going to have a harem he needs a harem manager : as Mike puts it , " Women are the root of all evil .
And teenage girls have n't learned to use their power for good .
There 's a reason that harem doors had bolts on the outside . "
So he flies to Uzbekistan and meets with a sheikh , who provides him with a harem manager , who just so happens to be a twenty - six - year - old supermodel - quality extreme masochist who loves to give blowjobs .
You are now weeping .
Say it with me : OH JOHN RINGO NO .
At the end of KILDAR , there is a skirmish between the Kildara and the Chechens , but that 's really not the point : the book is about Mike and his training staff discovering the joys of the alpha - male paradise by drinking exquisite beer , engaging in traditional male tests of strength and bravery , building dams and rifle ranges and commando troops , and fucking the hell out of beautiful girls whose age range makes you wonder nervously about the kinds of pictures on the author 's hard drive .
It 's alternately guilty pleasure fun and OH JOHN RINGO NO , but it never hits GHOST 's level of JESUS CHRIST IT'S A LION GET IN THE CAR .
And then there 's the THIRD book ... The third book , CHOOSERS OF THE SLAIN , is the best of the ones I 've read .
It 's certainly the most interesting , and has a little more of a plot .
That does n't mean it 's not highly disturbing .
A prominent Democratic Senator ( he's in the running to become the next Senate minority leader ; in the Ringoverse , the Republicans are in charge , as God meant them to be ) asks Mike for help : the daughter of a substantial campaign contributor has gone missing in Moldova .
She 's been -- I know this will be a shock , considering that John Ringo is careful to avoid the " Women in Refrigerators " shtick , because of his strong sensitivity to the portrayal of female characters -- * kidnapped by sex slavers .
* No , really .
So Mike and company start following up the chain to find the girl .
Along the way , they stumble into a massive conspiracy that involves Hostel - style torture - for - fun vacation packages .
Also , there is a B - plot in which Mike starts up a business selling the Keldara 's beer , and so takes time out of torturing and killing sex slavers to go to a beer trade show in Las Vegas -- look , do you see what I mean by awesomely horrific and horrifically awesome ?
Basically , Mike assembles a team of Keldara shooters ( male ) and intel specialists ( female ) , along with Cottontail the Killer Whore , and makes his way through the layers of the sex - slaver network , torturing and killing white slavers as he goes .
The torture gives him information about the next level up , which he uses to find the next bunch of guys to torture for information about the level above them , and so on .
Of course , it would n't be a John Ringo book unless the hero accumulates women who are 1 ) whores or 2 ) on their way to becoming whores .
The first of these is a girl named Oksana .
It 's okay !
Oksana has n't been made a sex slave yet .
She 's still a virgin .
Mike knows .
Because he * checks .*... I fucking hate myself for reading this .
Next up is Nikki , a hooker who works in a club belonging to sex - slaver Nicu Gogosa .
Mike buys her for intel purposes , then winds up keeping her around .
After the raid on the club , he liberates a bunch more sex slaves , including a young woman named Daria .
She was a virgin before she was forced into prostitution , and now craves rough sex and punishment , but hates herself for wanting it .
Mike takes her to bed in a heavy BDSM kinda way -- it 's okay !
IT 'S RAPE COUNSELING !
And there 's still more !
" Get a whore . "
IT 'S HIS ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING .
This accounting of the collection does not include Natalya , the sex slave they were sent to rescue in the first place , or Elena and Catrina , two Keldara girls who were kidnapped for sex slavery years ago , or the other sex slaves rescued at the same time as Daria ; or the hooker one of the Keldara falls for and decides to bring along -- it 's not a harem , it 's an *entourage .
* But it 's not all whoredom .
Well , okay , it is , but there is actually some interesting stuff going on in the book .
A fair portion of it involves Katya , aka Cottontail .
While pretty much every good - guy character in the book admires , worships , or simply likes Mike , Katya * hates * Mike .
This does n't just make her unique ; it makes her the best character in the series , because she 's absolutely right about him .
Mike knows he 's a deeply twisted person , at best a " good monster ; " but as often as Ringo has Mike muse on this , when he 's loved by everyone who knows him the effect is to downplay or even endorse Mike 's depravity .
This makes Katya and Mike an interesting contrast : they 're both deeply sick people who take joy in causing pain and suffering .
Katya is manipulative , selfish , and cruel towards humans when she has them within her power ; where Mike tries to compartmentalize his cruelty , Katya doesn't , and because of this she sees Mike 's kindler , gentler slavemaster shtick as a joke and a lie .
Which it is .
But because Mike is the viewpoint character , the audience is expected to identify with him on a strong level .
Katya , meanwhile , is a problem for Mike , one he has to control .
We 're not expected to identify with her , while we 're expected to root for him off the bat .
And so Katya 's attitude toward Mike does n't just work to characterize her .
It changes the dynamics of Ringo 's game .
And considering the oversexed , perverse , alpha - male wish fulfillment nature of the series , that 's a pretty interesting move .
Here 's an example .
Katya , aka " Cottontail , " and a Keldara named Anisa are on a mission , and they 're walking down a street lined with ( of course ) prostitutes .
Holy crap , talk about speaking truth to power : the least sympathetic of the recurring characters in the series is laying out exactly what she thinks of the hero .
And she hates him .
And she 's right to .
It 's an aspect of the book that makes for a really interesting dynamic .
If you 've been rooting for Mike to kill that terrorist , fuck that girl , become that warlord , it 'll sucker - punch you .
Ringo has set up his audience to identify with Mike , and cheer him on , and now he uses Katya to pull the rug out from under them .
It 's an especially interesting choice because Ringo acknowledges Mike to be a creation of his darkest id ; Katya 's challenging of Mike is pretty much an acknowledgment that * shit is fucked up in here .
* There 's a scene , between Mike and his number - two , which pretty much nails the same thing , albeit in a far more grotesque and disturbing way : ... I... yeah , sorry , I kind of need a minute after that last bit .
Really , that scene is kind of brain - melting ; it combines the horrifying " OH JOHN RINGO NO " stuff with a bit of self - examination and a character dynamic that subverts a big chunk of the series premise .
The hero 's channeling of his perversion so that he does n't become the thing he fights winds up feeding the thing he fights .
That 's interesting .
Most of the time , Mike 's enemies can be opposed , defeated , destroyed , and so Mike comes out a champion of good ; but this is something he can't destroy .
This does not make the series * good , * mind , but Ringo is doing something different here , and it 's weirdly interesting .
I get the feeling I 'm seeing Ringo doing some extremely disturbing self - examination , as a writer and as a man ; it 's not his primary focus by any means , but if you look at GHOST and then look at CHOOSERS OF THE SLAIN , you do n't see maturity , sensitivity , or plausibility , but you do see something that looks a bit like growth .
He 's developing the series in a way that 's freakish and yet strangely compelling , and I find it hard to wrap my brain around , because I 'm honestly not sure what he 's trying to do .
Oh , wait -- I just realized that I forgot to tell you about the whole part of the book where Mike discovers that the Kildar has droit de seigneur and is eagerly expected to deflower the Keldara women on their wedding night , in order to bring honor to them and their husbands .
And the chapter he spends taking Keldara beer advertising photographs with a fifteen - year - old girl licking froth off the top of a beer bottle , BUT GODDAMMIT I HAVE TO DRAW A LINE .
There is one more thing .
Mike needs some infiltrating done , and decides Cottontail is the one to do it .
To keep tabs on her , he gets in touch with people in Black Ops to have her augmented .
... no , not like that .
Like this :
No , she does not exactly become Whoreverine , but it is close : Katya gets augmented with an electronic snooping and communications system , poison fingernails , subcutaneous pouches for smuggling weapons , and a dose of a combat drug that gives her thirty seconds of batshit insane berzerker speed and hyperstrength .
And then she goes off and kills men , which she enjoys heartily .
And it 's actually a little relieving -- Katya 's a nasty person , but she 's had such a shitty time over the course of the books that you 're really rooting for her to go out and kill sex - slavers left and right .
The PALADIN OF SHADOWS series is arguably the most horrifying series of books I have ever read .
It has a hero I can't stand , politics so strong they 're comical , and sex scenes that are downright horrifying .
And I can not stop reading it .
I am going to buy every single one , and if Ringo ever comes out with a spin - off featuring Katya as Cottontail the Bionic Whore , I will buy that too .
Because dammit , there 's bad , and then there 's so bad you have to memorialize it for future generations .... Amazon just announced to me that they 've shipped my pre-ordered copy of book 4 , in paperback .
OH JOHN RINGO NO .
The OH JOHN RINGO NO t- shirt contest ?!
I 'm surprised , too .
But the request was made , and the request has been heard .
Trying to gauge interest ; there could be some charitable good to be had here .
Okay , it 's official .
You can now buy OH JOHN RINGO NO shirts to benefit the Helen Bamber Foundation , which ( among other things ) helps women who were forced into prostitution .
Which is what Mike does .
In his way .
John Ringo , a real class act , has graciously endorsed the project and the designated charity .
The shirt design is by , and it 's absolutely terrific .
Details here :
As of Thanksgiving 2008 , we 've raised seven hundred dollars for the Helen Bamber Foundation .
Thanks , everybody . :
Shirts discontinued because everybody who wants one has one .
