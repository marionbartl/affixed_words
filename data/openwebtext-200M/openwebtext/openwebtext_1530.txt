We 've already seen a broken build of Android 2.1 for the Droid Eris slip out accidentally , but now the full package is available for installation courtesy of the fine folks at xda-developers .
We have n't tried it ourselves , but we 're told it 's working fine , and that snazzy new version of Sense is apparently quite snazzy and new .
Of course , you 're risking your phone and all your data if you try this , so the absolutely smart and prudent move is to wait for the official update , but do let us know how it goes if you 're daring enough to load it up , okay ?
And just like that , it 's been ported to the Sprint Hero , although not everything works quite yet .
You be careful , kids .

Federal prosecutors have opened an investigation into trading at Goldman Sachs , raising the possibility of criminal charges against the Wall Street giant , according to people familiar with the matter .
While the investigation is still in a preliminary stage , the move could escalate the legal troubles swirling around Goldman .
The Securities and Exchange Commission , which two weeks ago filed a civil fraud suit against Goldman , referred its investigation to prosecutors for the Southern District of New York , which has now opened its own inquiry .
Goldman has vigorously denied the accusations by the S.E.C. , which accused Goldman of defrauding investors involved a complex mortgage deal known as Abacus 2007 - AC1 .

Private DVCS Hosting
While using Github and Bitbucket for hosting and collaborating on open source projects is great -- and not to mention free of charge -- I have several repositories with personal and client related code which needs to stay private ( like wasitup 's source ) .
Most of these repositories are quite small , weighing in under one megabyte .
I quickly realized that I had reached the maximum number of private repositories on Github and Bitbucket for my plan while using less then one percent of my alloted disk space .
I 'm equally satisfied with using Git and Mercurial - - both have their own strong and weak points -- so I went out and searched for alternatives offering support for one or both of these DVCS s .
Please note that this is a fairly high level overview of DVCS hosting providers where I focused mainly on price for private repositories and allocated disk space .
When selecting a provider you should probably take a closer look at how easy its offering is to use , how stable and available it is , and that it provides the features you need .
Note that all mentions of repository count ( including all values in the " Repos " column in the following tables ) are referring to private repos only , not public repos .
Git and Mercurial
A few providers supports both Git and Mercurial repositories .
While support for both of my favored DVCSs is convenient , there is a possibility that the lack of focus on one system results in a less integrated user experience .
A fairly polished interface with a repository browser , ticketing with milestones , time tracking , and wikis .

Kiln segments its plans based on the number of users one needs .
For this comparison I 've used the price of one user .
There are no restrictions on how much storage you can use in Kiln provided that you do n't do anything overly abusive ( like using it for video storage ) .

Conclusion
For my own needs I 'm only interested in the providers which do n't impose restrictions on the amount of private repositories .
This eliminates SSH Control , Github , Beanstalk , Codaset , Bitbucket , and Active State Firefly .
I 've ranked the remaining contenders based on how much storage you get for your buck within three price categories :
Free
Assembla Free : 2 GB Unfuddle Free : 0.2GB Codebase Free : 0.02GB
Up to $ 10 / month
Repository Hosting 6GB : $ 1.67 / GB XP - Dev Pro Small : $ 5/GB Indefero Business : $ 6.28 / GB
Up to $ 20 / month
Repository Hosting 16GB : $ 1.25 / GB XP - Dev Pro Medium : $ 3.75 / GB
Up to $ 50 / month
Kiln ( one user ) : Approaching $ 0/ GB Repository Hosting 46GB : $ 1.09 / GB Xp - Dev Enterprise Small : $ 2.50 / GB
Kiln is obviously the most affordable solution if you 're planning to store lots of data , but can get pricey due to the per user pricing model if you 're working in a team .
Due to the restrictions on maximum allowed active projects or spaces you should probably ignore Codebase , Assembla , Unfuddle if you use project management features ( e.g. ticketing , wikis , time tracking ) together with each private repository .
I myself have signed up with both Kiln and Repository Hosting so that I can evaluate both more in depth .
There is a huge CBS / NYT poll and article ( Poll Finds Tea Party Backers Wealthier and More Educated ) about the tea party members .
I was not surprised to read they skew older , white , Republican , better educated and higher income than the average American .
I was surprised to read they favor Social Security and Medicare .
Towards the end of the article , I read a shocking data point .
In the orgy of coverage of this poll and article generated , no one seemed to mention this :
The percentage holding a favorable opinion of former President George W. Bush = 57 %
A substantial majority of Tea Party members hold a favorable opinion of the man that history will very likely deem the worst president in American History ( Presidential Historians disagree as to whether he is in the bottom 3 or 5 as of today ) .
Its all you need to know about the Tea Party .

Augmented reality enthusiasts dream of a future where having access to data everywhere will give us the eyes of the Terminator .
Imagine donning virtual glasses that display digital captions describing everything you look at .
Stare at a building , and a caption spits out when it was built ; look at a stranger on a bus and a digital bubble appears in the corner of your eye , displaying his name and age .
We 're not quite there yet , but Swedish software company Astonishing Tribe is taking one step toward that reality .
The company is experimenting with " augmented identification " on smartphones to identify people just by snapping a photo of them .
Demonstrated in the video above , the smartphone app Recognizr uses recognition software to create a 3 - D model of a person 's mug .
Then it transmits the model to a server , which matches it with an image stored in the database .
An online server performs facial recognition and shoots back a name of the subject and links to his social networking profiles .
A little creepy , right ?
Recognizr is still just a concept app being tested with a small number of profiles on an Android phone .
We doubt anything like this will hit the consumer market soon , since the software will have to be optimized to recognize images from billions of photos across all the social networking sites out there .
But still , this is an exciting glimpse into our data - injected future .

In Europe , industry efforts to remove trans fats in the form of partially hydrogenated oil from the food supply have been fast and effective .
But many food manufacturers in North America are still dithering .
Doctors called for a trans fat ban in the UK earlier this month , even though voluntary industry efforts are thought to have brought trans fat consumption down to safe levels there .
Meanwhile , it emerged that a two - year trial period for industry to voluntarily reduce trans fats has failed in Canada .
And the debate goes on in the United States .
Current trans fat bans only encompass areas that cover about 20 percent of the US population , but the latest proposed ban , in Louisville , Kentucky , has been rejected .
In Denmark , where it has been illegal for foods to contain more than two percent trans fats since 2004 , deaths from heart disease have dropped by 20 percent .
The pressure on industry is already high , but if food manufacturers in some regions can switch out trans fats while others do not , it ’s time to get tough .
Clogging arteries for 100 years ​
Artificial trans fats in the form of partially hydrogenated oils have been around for about a century , and were even marketed from the 1960s as a healthy alternative to the saturated fats found in butter .
But from the late 1980s evidence started to accumulate showing that trans fats could be linked to increased rates of cardiovascular disease .
Now , more than 20 years later , we know that they not only raise levels of bad cholesterol in the blood , but also lower levels of good cholesterol , clogging arteries and causing heart disease .
Not even saturated fats are as bad as that .
In fact , a 2006 review of the Nurses ’ Health Study in the United States , a major source of evidence on the harmful effects of trans fats , found that for each additional two percent of calories consumed from trans fat , risk of coronary heart disease nearly doubled , but the same increased risk was seen only with a 15 percent increase in saturated fat .
Health authorities all over the world have recommended that consumption of trans fats should be reduced to the trace amounts that occur naturally in meat and dairy .
So why are there still those in the food industry that have n’t moved to take such a deadly ingredient out of their products ?
The problem is , despite the health impacts , artificial trans fats have been a boon for the food industry – oils have a higher melting point when they are partially hydrogenated , are much cheaper than other oils or fats , and baked goods have a longer shelf life .
We now know these fats are harmful and provide no nutritional benefit , and there is a ballooning choice of alternatives .
Sure , manufacturers should be given some time to phase them out , but at this stage , there is no excuse .
Adulteration education ​
If the Louisville ban had gone ahead , for example , over a million more people would have benefited from a virtually trans - free food supply , but instead they are the latest to be subjected to education , in other words , told to be vigilant about the possibility that foods could contain a potentially lethal substance .
What ?
This is perverse .
Voluntary reductions and public education campaigns seem to sit well in the United States , where there is strong support for personal freedom of choice in many matters considered reasonable to regulate elsewhere .
However , any support for the ‘ right ’ to eat and cook with foods that contain deadly trans fats is the clearest proof that education campaigns are failing .
The current piecemeal approach is not good enough .
Governments have spent enough public money assessing industry efforts .
And they have found that voluntary reductions are not always effective .
It ’s time to look to Denmark ’s example and get trans fats out of our food .

The oil and natural gas lobby is working hard to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from establishing safeguards to protect the public from chemicals used to produce shale gas through “ hydraulic fracturing , ” also called “ fracking ” or “ fracing . ”
Oil and gas companies use fracking in combination with horizontal well drilling ; the process involves injecting a mixture of water , sand , and chemicals at high pressure into rock formations thousands of feet below the surface to fracture the rock and allow oil and gas previously trapped inside the rock to escape .
Recent advances in drilling techniques combined with fracking have dramatically expanded the supply of technically recoverable shale gas .
But studies show that the chemicals may pollute nearby sources of water .
BP , ConocoPhillips , and Shell Oil Co. ’s latest lobbying efforts propose adding “ Sense of the Senate Language ” to upcoming energy and climate legislation from Sens.
John Kerry ( D - MA ) , Lindsey Graham ( R- SC ) , and Joe Lieberman ( I - CT ) that would exempt fracking from federal oversight .
Lee Fuller , executive director of Energy in Depth , a consortium of U.S. oil and natural gas producers , wrote in a recent letter to the senators , “ we hope that you can find space in your draft legislation to make your commitment to natural gas explicitly clear …to remind your colleagues once again of the critical role that technologies such as hydraulic fracturing can and must play in meeting the goals for our future . ”
The proposal would be on top of a similar fracking loophole already on the books .
The practice is currently protected from oversight under the Safe Drinking Water Act due to an exemption in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 .
The loophole was added into the bill after a 2004 EPA study found the process posed “ little or no threat ” to drinking water .
Natural gas companies have often cited this study as evidence that the practice is “ safe , ” but the study was cursory and called “ scientifically unsound ” by Weston Wilson , an EPA scientist with more than three decades of experience with the agency .
The Oil and Gas Accountability Project also reported that , “ EPA removed information from earlier drafts that suggested unregulated fracturing poses a threat to human health , and that the Agency did not include information that suggests fracturing fluids may pose a threat to drinking water long after drilling operations are completed . ”
An aide for Sen .
Kerry has indicated that the three senators have not included the oil companies ’ proposal in their draft bill .
Sen .
Graham also said that there is not yet language to continue to protect fracking included in the bill , but said , “ we need to use the fracturing process to get gas .
But it needs to be transparent , and we understand the environmental impact of it . ”
Hiding the truth on fracking chemicals
The Safe Drinking Water
Act loophole is n’t the only exemption natural gas producers enjoy .
They are also free from reporting the specific toxic chemicals used for fracking , even though many other industries must report their toxic emissions under the 1986 Emergency Planning and Community Right - to - Know Act .
The Right - to - Know Network , a project of OMB Watch , notes : “ Studies have identified a long list of toxics that may be included in these fracking fluids , and numerous cases of drinking water contamination have been documented . ”
A study by Environmental Working Group “ found that at least 65 chemicals used by the natural gas industry in Colorado — many of them used in hydraulic fracturing — were listed or regulated as hazardous substances under six federal statues including the Clean Air Act , Clean Water Act , and Superfund . ”
And the OGAP report found that , “ The EPA states that many chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids are linked to human health effects .
These effects include cancer ; liver , kidney , brain , respiratory and skin disorders ; birth defects ; and other health problems . ”
The natural gas industry ’s most common defense to these claims it that fracking fluid mostly consists of water and less than 1 percent is chemicals .
Yet OGAP reports that , “ The draft EPA study included calculations showing that even when diluted with water at least nine hydraulic fracturing chemicals may be injected into [ underground sources of drinking water ] at concentrations that pose a threat to human health . ”
Of course , this fact never made it into the final EPA report that led to the fracking exemption .
Homeowners and communities adjacent to natural gas production facilities that employ fracking have the right to know about the toxic chemicals used at these sites .
And without information from the natural gas industry on what chemicals it uses , it will be impossible to conclusively state that the practice poses no danger .
The issue of public disclosure is not an idle debate without public health consequences .
Congress need look no further than a 2008 Colorado case , where an emergency room nurse was sickened and nearly died after she treated an oil and gas worker whose clothes were soaked with fracking fluids .
The nurse , Cathy Behr , said the physician who treated her was unable to get information on the chemicals she was exposed to and had to guess .
“ It was the right guess , because slowly I started getting better , ” Behr told the Durango Herald .
Some companies work to change , others fight it
Some natural gas companies , notably Chesapeake Energy Corp. , Range Resources Corp. , and Schlumberger Ltd , have expressed a willingness to disclose the chemicals used in fracking .
Announcements by CEOs of Chesapeake Energy and Range Resources on the need to make this information public followed twin events that bore ill tidings for the industry : spills at drilling sites in Pennsylvania and proposals for new regulations in New York .
About 30 gas operators are already sharing data with the state Department of Environmental Protection in Pennsylvania .
Although ProPublica notes that they “ do n’t list all the ingredients or explain how they might be combined , information that environmental scientists say is critical to measuring the risk associated with fracturing fluids . ”
Other firms , such as Devon Energy Corp. , Southwestern Energy Corps . , and Newfield Exploration Co. , are “ exploring ways to recycle waste water , use nontoxic chemicals for drilling and eliminate the need for some chemicals altogether . ”
Yet much of the natural gas industry continues to fight reasonable measures to protect the public health and environment .
The industry claims that state regulation of hydraulic fracturing is sufficient but at the same time they fight more effective state oversight .
Colorado recently added new oil and gas drilling rules that require companies to disclose fracking chemicals to the state , for example , and the industry is suing to overturn the new rules .
Conclusion
Natural gas producers should be required to make public and accessible information on the chemical components of fracking fluids rather than perpetuating the existing exemptions from the Right - to - Know program .
Many gas producers are concerned that this would reveal their trade secrets , but the TRI program has a process to protect such proprietary information without forcing them to reveal trade secrets .
And the EPA has acknowledged the need to deal with trade secrets in TRI submissions .
And even if the EPA approves an industry ’s claim of trade secrecy , there is still a provision to protect public health by allowing states to identify the health effects associated with the chemicals and make that information public .
Natural gas emits half of the carbon dioxide pollution compared to coal and can serve as a bridge fuel to a lower - carbon future .
Processes that make shale gas production possible , such as fracking , can help speed this transition .
But we need to pursue this cleaner energy future in a sustainable manner that does not come at the expense of public health .

Most articles focus on the financial nuts and bolts of the things you should have in order before you consider buying a home .
You ’ve got to have good credit .
You ’ve got to have a down payment .
You ’ve got to know the housing market .
And so on .
Yet those are n’t the only important things to be thinking about :
Unorthodox Recommendations for Prospective Homeowners
1 . Save a significant amount each month for at least two years
A mortgage payment requires financial discipline as well as enough money , period .
Can you cover the mortgage ?
The insurance ?
The taxes ?
The constant expenses that go with homeownership ?
Use a mortgage calculator to figure up what your monthly mortgage payment will be .
Tack 50 % on top of that for insurance , taxes , and other expenses .
Subtract your current monthly rent payment from that .
If you ca n’t save that amount each month , then you ’re not ready to buy a house of that size .
People will give all sorts of reasons why such a statement is n’t true .
“ You really do n’t need that much money each month . ”
Let ’s hear that refrain again when your hot water heater fails at the same time as you need a new lawnmower and your lawn needs re-seeding .
“ Our lifestyle will be different when we own a house . ”
In what way ?
The only major change will be that you have less spending money and , most likely , more room to store stuff .
Such statements are merely ways to pass the buck on to your future self , the responsible one who owns a house and makes more money and makes all of the payments .
If that person does n’t exist now , merely owning a house wo n’t make that person exist in the future .
Do n’t ever base your plans on what you hope might happen someday .
Take responsiblity now .
See whether or not you actually can make it work in terms of your month - over - month finances .
If you ca n’t do it now , then you wo n’t be able to do it then .
2 . Sell off all of your stuff that you do n’t use
The less stuff you have , the less space you need .
The less space you need , the smaller house you need .
The smaller house you need , the more likely it is that you ’ll be able to afford that house .
Go through your closest .
Pare down .
Get rid of stuff that you do n’t use .
If you sell off a lot of your stuff that you do n’t use , you ’ll not only realize you do n’t need as much space as you thought you did , but you ’ll also find that you suddenly have some cash in hand that can help you move towards actually owning a house .
Even better : the less stuff you have , the easier ( and less costly ) it is to move .
I ’m not arguing on behalf of selling off stuff that has value to you .
I only suggest that you go through your closets and cupboards and get rid of the stuff that you do n’t use .
It ’s just sitting there taking up space , convincing you that you need more living space , when in fact it could be money in your pocket and freedom in your life .
3 . Fix some stuff
If you ’re a renter or you live at home , it ’s easy enough to call a landlord or a parent when there ’s a problem .
“ The toilet seems to be broken . ” “ There ’s no hot water . ”
“ Why wo n’t the dryer dry my clothes ? ” “ There ’s water flooding the basement . ”
Here ’s the catch : when those things happen in a house of your own , it ’s up to you to fix it .
If you can ’t , you ’re going to be shelling out fistfuls of cash to pay someone to do it .
When you ’re living in such an environment , you ’ve got a perfect opportunity to learn how to do such things with something of a safety net .
When the toilet breaks , try to fix it yourself .
Watch some YouTube videos on toilet repair .
Identify what parts you need , find a good hardware store , and pick them up .
Give the repair a serious attempt all by yourself .
If you ca n’t do it , then report the problem .
Do n’t just walk away , though – watch and learn from someone who can do it .
Watch your landlord or the repairman .
Try to figure out where you went wrong and how you can avoid it next time .
Even if you fail , you ’ve learned some things .
You ’ve learned how to use tools .
You ’ve learned how to identify problems .
You ’ve learned what the equipment looks like .
This will make solving future problems much simpler and much more cost - effective , especially when you ’re living in your home and something goes wrong for the first time .
4 . Figure out why you ’re buying a home
There are lots of bad reasons and non-reasons to buy :
Do n’t buy a home because that ’s what you ’ve been told you ’re “ supposed ” to do .
Do n’t buy a home because that ’s what you think you ’re “ supposed ” to do .
Do n’t buy a home because it ’s a good investment for the future .
It ’s really not all that great of an investment .
Do n’t buy a home because you might get married and have kids someday and you need the space for this hypothetical future .
Do n’t buy a home because you think it will lead you to some sort of idealized suburban life .
A home wo n’t change who you are .
Do n’t buy a home because you ’re trying to “ keep up ” with someone in your life .
It ’ll make you fall further behind in the long run .
Buy a home because you it truly makes sense financially and you ’re ready ( and excited ) to deal with the challenges of homeownership .
Buy a home because it ’s better for your housing dollar than the other options available to you .
Buy a home because it ’s what you want and it ’s what you can handle , not because it ’s what others want .
Back in 1999 on a radio program I had in NYC at the time , I was stridently critical of the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , which was euphemistically called " The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 " by the very appropriately named Teabagging maestro , Dick Armey .
On the radio program , for months I protested every day that this law was nothing but yet another attempt to inflict Ayn Rand feudalism on hapless Americans .
It should be noted that this execrable and deliberately destructive law was signed by Bill Clinton .
In addition , this evil gutting of the Glass - Steagall Act ( not even one of my listeners had ever heard of it ) was rapturously endorsed by Lawrence Summers , the Treasury Secretary for Bill Clinton , and currently the Chief economic adviser to President Obama , and Timothy Geithner , who was then the Chairman of the New York Federal Reserve Bank , and the current Treasury Secretary to President Obama .
What does it say about Obama 's commitment to financial regulation that his principal economic soothsayers are the very same individuals who aggressively counseled President Cllinton to endorse and sign this idiotic and evil obliteration of the regulatory framework that had protected the American people for over 65 years from the Dodge City economics that has recently brought suffering to billions of innocent people here and abroad !
What I will say now is heresy in the United States , but after all the financial anarchy and pain [ ie .
, The savings and loan Crisis ( 1989 ) , The stock market crash of 1987 , The Long Term Capital Crisis ( 1998 ) , Enron , Tyco , Worldcom ( 2002 ) , and the current mortgage crisis / derivatives crisis ) ] , that the people of the United States have suffered repeatedly in the past twenty years , it is apparent that the problem is not regulation , nor is the " solution " , to be found in " reasonable " milquetoast rules crafted by the same wretched people who imposed this fiasco in the first place .
More importantly , from 2001 through 2008 , we all experienced the intrinsic vulnerability of even the most carefully crafted regulatory framework , given the ease with which the reactionary Cheney / Bush regime was able to subvert regulation across the board by merely appointing openly dedicated enemies of regulation to the chairmanships of the regulatory bodies .
What 's necessary is to begin a serious inquiry as to why an economy of 300,000,000 million citizens should be held prisoner by the private money interest of a small number of people who , on the basis of nothing more than their staggering assets , can control the financial destiny and viability of the other 300,000,000 voting citizens .
There is no reason in reality why such an irrational scheme as the above should continue .
Big Business and Big Finance need to be controlled by all the citizens , for the benefit of all the citizens , not for the benefit of a tiny and elite cadre of private owners on the basis of their own whim , wealth , and private benefit , for the pleasure of themselves alone , and to the continuing misfortune of a nation of 300,000,000 at the mercy of their greater glory .
The citizens need to control the wealth of the nation , and the day to day management of that wealth needs to be directed by people directly accountable to the 300,000,000 citizens rather than to self - interested Boards of Directors accountable only to themselves and their private fortunes .

Via Dan Savage 's blog at The Stranger , some clever chappie ( I do n't know who ) has declared May 20 , 2010 " Everybody Draw Mohammad Day , " in support of Matt Stone and Trey Parker and in opposition to religious thuggery .
Why May 20 ?
I have n't a clue , though it could have something to do with Otto ascending the throne of Greece .
Or , more likely , King Sancho IV of Castile 's founding of the Study of General Schools of Alcalá .
I will be employing my tremendous skill as an illustrator , of course , and expect that my colleagues will do the same .
If they refuse , they will be declared weak - kneed , namby - pamby , quisling infidels and will be shamed on this blog ( Though such idle threats rarely work these days ; perhaps I could threaten them with a painful death , which seems to do the trick ) .
If readers would like to show their solidarity , please email your Mohammad masterpieces to me here : mmoynihan at reason.com .
The best ones will be published on Hit & Run , which , along with the concomitant death threat , is reward enough .

The Vatican will finance new research into the potential use of adult stem cells in the treatment of intestinal and possibly other diseases , officials announced Friday .
The project is at a very preliminary phase and it will be years before any clinical treatment might be available , the officials said .
The Vatican has agreed to donate $ 2.7 million to the research , which is led by the University of Maryland 's School of Medicine , project officials said .
The church is opposed to embryonic stem cell research because it involves the destruction of embryos , but it supports the use of adult stem cells .
In 2007 , Pope Benedict XVI said adult stem cell research respects human life , which according to church teachings begins at conception .
The Vatican has drawn criticism for its opposition to embryonic stem cell research .
But the Vatican insists there are scientifically viable alternatives and the efforts of the scientific community should go in that direction .
Financing this project is part of those efforts .
But while embryonic stem cells are especially prized for their pluripotency — meaning they can morph into any type of cell in the body — adult stem cells are not as pluripotent .
For that reason , embryonic stem cells are considered to have more potential for the treatment of diseases such as Alzheimer 's , diabetes and Parkinson's .
Researchers involved in the Vatican - financed project say they want to assess the potential of intestinal stem cells — a relatively new field — for therapeutic use .
" We want to harvest them , we want isolate them , we want to make them grow outside our body and see if they are pluripotent , " said Alessio Fasano , the scientist leading the project and the director of the University of Maryland Center for Celiac Research .
" If we reach that phase , if we are able to achieve that goal , then our next step is to eventually move to clinical application , " Fasano told The AP before Friday 's announcement .
Intestinal stem cells have certain features that makes them appealing for this kind of research , Fasano said .
They are very active cells — the intestine replenishes all its cells every few days — and they are intrinsically flexible — already programmed to generate all the various kinds of cells such as mucus cells or epithelial cells present in the highly complex organ .
Furthermore , harvesting them can be done through a routine procedure like endoscopy , Fasano noted .
Fasano said his team hopes to have a first answer on the feasibility of the project within the next two to three years .

Vaneras just announced a huge list of changes being made to the shaman class on the official forums , and holy crap .
There are a lot of really interesting and really cool changes and additions being made .
As always , here is my analysis and commentary on the changes .
Healing Wave ( level 4 ) :
While the shaman already has an ability called Healing Wave , we ’re adding another spell to the class ’s direct - healing arsenal and giving it a familiar name .
The current Healing Wave will be renamed Greater Healing Wave , and the intent is for the “ new ” Healing Wave to be the shaman ’s go - to heal .
Lesser Healing Wave and Greater Healing
Wave will be used on a more situational basis .
Unleash Weapon ( level 81 ) : Unleashes the power of your weapon enchants for additional effects ( see below ) .
A dual - wielding Enhancement shaman will activate the effects of both of their weapon enchants .
Instant cast .
30 - yard range .
15 - second cooldown .
Undispellable .
Here are a few examples of effects we ’re considering for this ability :
Windfury Weapon – Hurls a spectral version of your weapon at a target , dealing 50 % weapon damage and increasing the shaman ’s Haste for the next five swings .
– Hurls a spectral version of your weapon at a target , dealing 50 % weapon damage and increasing the shaman ’s Haste for the next five swings .
Flametongue Weapon – Deals instant Fire damage and buffs the shaman ’s next Fire attack by 20 % .
– Deals instant Fire damage and buffs the shaman ’s next Fire attack by 20 % .
Earthliving Weapon – Heals the target slightly and buffs the shaman ’s next healing spell by 20 % .
Healing Rain ( level 83 ) : An area - effect heal - over - time ( HoT ) spell that calls down rain in a selected area , healing all players within it .
There is no limit to the number of players who can potentially be affected ; however , there are diminishing returns when healing a large number of targets , much like the diminishing returns associated with AoE damage spells .
This should give Restoration shaman another healing tool that improves their group - healing and heal - over - time capabilities .
2 - second cast time .
30 - yard range .
10 - second duration .
10 - second cooldown .
Spiritwalker ’s Grace ( level 85 ) :
When this self - targeted buff is active , your spells are no longer interrupted by movement and possibly even by your own attacks .
This will give shaman of all three specs another way to heal or do damage when it ’s necessary to move in both PvE and PvP .
Instant cast .
10 - second duration .
2 - minute cooldown .
Ability Changes
Restoration shaman and other healing classes will need to pay attention to mana more than they ’ve had to during Wrath of the Lich King .
Spirit will be the Restoration shaman 's primary mana - regeneration stat .
We ’re making changes to which classes and specs are able to dispel magic , diseases , curses , and poison , largely for PvP purposes .
Shaman will have Cleanse Spirit as a baseline ability , but it will only remove curses .
Restoration shaman will have a talent that will improve Cleanse Spirit so that it also removes magic .
Shaman will no longer be able to remove poison .
Cleansing
Totem will be removed from the game , as we want dispels to be a decision for players , not something done mindlessly .
To that end , all dispels will cost slightly more mana , and you will waste the spell if you cast it when there is nothing to remove .
( Currently , the dispel is only cast when there is something to remove , which encourages spamming “ just in case . ” )
We will balance PvE dispelling with this new model in mind .
Totem of Wrath now will replace Flametongue Totem for all shaman , and dropping this totem will buff the group ’s spell power by 4 % .
Elemental shaman will have a talent that lets all Fire totems provide +10 % spell power , allowing them to drop Searing , Magma , or Fire Elemental Totems without losing their spell - damage buff .
The 4 % and 10 % buffs will be exclusive with each other and with the warlock ’s Demonic Pact , so you ca n’t benefit from all of them at once .
We ’re also considering letting Elemental drop Searing Totem at range .
We want to free up Enhancement global cooldowns to make the spec more dynamic to play .
We ’re considering , for example , increasing the cooldown of Lava Lash so shaman have time to work other interesting abilities into their rotation .
Talents
Elemental Reach will be simplified so shaman have a more consistent spell range .
We plan to add Earthquake as a deep Elemental talent for targeted and persistent AoE .
Spirit Link will likely be worked back into deep Restoration in some form .
The idea is that you will be able to link targets together so they share damage .
When we had previously tried to implement Spirit Link , it was hard to balance and a little confusing .
However , we really liked the concept -- and so did players -- so we are trying to bring it back .
Elemental will have a deep talent that allows Spirit ( which will appear on the gear they share with Restoration shaman ) to boost their Hit rating .
Enhancing Totems will be replaced with Focused Strikes , which will improve the damage of the new spell Primal Strike and Stormstrike .
With the Mastery system , we ’re also considering removing a number of talents that grant passive bonuses , such as Mental Quickness , Improved Windfury Totem , Mental Dexterity , Call of Thunder , Tidal Mastery , Purification , Nature ’s Blessing , and others , to allow players more freedom to choose more interesting talents .
The Mastery System
Elemental Spell damage
Spell Crit
Elemental Overload :
Your direct - damage spells have a chance to proc a less powerful “ bonus " version of the spell .
This will work much like the current Lightning Overload talent , but would also apply to Lava Burst .
Enhancement Melee damage
Melee Haste
Nature Damage :
This will provide a passive bonus to the Nature damage dealt by the Enhancement shaman .
Restoration Healing
Meditation :
The amount of mana you regenerate in combat as a function of your Spirit .
Deep Healing : Your direct heals will do more healing when the target ’s health is lower .
This will scale to damage ( e.g. someone at 29 % health would receive more healing than someone at 30 % ) rather than have arbitrary break points .
Miscellaneous Q&A
The Cataclysm is a time of great upheaval .
Deathwing ’s return to Azeroth tore a hole in the fabric of the universe that tragically resulted in the ultimate and irrevocable destruction of all Sentry Totems .
Level designers are contemplating a shrine for the Sentry Totem near that of Uther the Lightbringer .
We know shaman players will greet this news with grief , but as with all class changes we ’ll have to get into beta before anything is final .
Ok ... interesting .
I guess this is Blizzard 's answer to the problem that downranking spells used to solve .
This will give us a way to cast a medium - sized , mana - efficient spell instead of a quick , expensive spell ( LHW ) or a huge , expensive ( though worth it ) spell ( GHW ) .
And from what else I 've been seeing , it looks like other healer classes will be getting similar medium - range heals .
Looks like this will make spell rotations much more interesting , even if it is basically just a version of Paladin Judgments .
Overall , a pretty cool addition , especially for Enhancement .
Wow , that 's pretty cool .
So it 's basically a healing version of Flamestrike , or an easier - to - use ( but probably weaker ) version of Tranquility Whoa , really ?
That 's huge .
Being able to gun and run from time to time ( or heal and run away , which would be very useful for me ) is going to be a major asset for us shamans .
This 'll be a big help for fighting meleers in PvP , and for boss battles that require a lot of moving around .
This is something we 've known about for a while , of course .
Personally , I think Blizz has let mana regen become too powerful in WotLK , to the point that you do n't really have to worry about it anymore .
I purposely avoid any MP5 gear , and I 've gotten rid of mana - regen talents , because they 're just not useful anymore .
I should be ending boss fights with most of my mana gone , not at 50 % or so like I do now .
Oh crap .
I do n't like this at all .
I feel like Cleansing Totem is the one thing that keeps me from being a guaranteed kill for rogues and death knights right now .
Removing my ability to remove ANY poisons or diseases is going to be very bad .
Spiritwalker 's Grace will help a little bit , but as soon as a rogue or DK gets in my face , I 'll still be extremely likely to die .
And I can only Thunderstorm once every 45 seconds .
Finally .
This is a huge boost for us Elementals .
It 's always been a tradeoff between buffing the group with ToW and doing more damage with totems , and now we 'll be able to do both at once .
I 'm sure it also means that we 're losing the crit debuff it provides , but that 's not unexpected .
Searing
Totem is still pretty weak , but I can definitely see myself keeping it dropped at all times , just to get a little extra DPS when a Magma totem is n't feasible ( or when the Fire Elemental is on cooldown ) .
And being able to drop it at range would be a big help .
I just hope they increase its duration and damage .
Ok , sure .
If they 're increasing the cooldown on LL , I 'm sure they 're also increasing its damage , because I doubt that they want to weaken the spell .
Sounds fine .
This probably means that Flame Shock 's sniper - like range will be reduced a bit , but whatever .
Hell yes .
I 've been hoping to get Earthquake for a long time now ( it was a Far - Seer spell in WC3 ) .
However , AoE is n't really a problem for us anymore , thanks to how powerful Magma Totem and Fire Nova are .
It would need to have a good secondary effect ( like a knockdown or something ) .
Still , it'd be nice to be able to do AoE without having to step into the fray to drop the totem ( besides what 's already offered by Chain Lightning ) .
Hell yes .
Another classic WC3 ability .
I was really disappointed when they removed it during the WotLK beta , but it sounds like they 're really going to be able to do it this time .
Yea , we 've known about this one for a while too .
A good change , but I wonder if we 're going to wind up with as much Spirit on gear as we have MP5 on gear now , and what 'll happen once we reach the Hit cap .
I guess that 's where Reforging becomes useful .
Also , how the hell are Elemental and Enhancement going to regen mana ?
Ok , sure .
I 'm not sure where the buff from ET is going .
It 's probably just being eliminated , so that Shamans and Death Knights can provide the same quality of buff ( from Horn of Winter ) no matter what .
Sounds like Blizz is trying to get rid of most instances where different buffs of different qualities clash .
Sounds good .
Those talents are boring , and Blizz wants to make talents more interesting .
However , they 're going to have to add a lot of replacements , otherwise players will be able to get all the talents they want without having to put much thought into their choices .
Read up on the Mastery system here
Not much to say here , except that I really like the Mastery system , and I really like Deep Healing .
Also , Lightning Overload will provide a boost to Elemental Overload instead of what it does now .
Vaneras also answered some interesting questions here .
Of particular note :
A team of Russian and American scientists has discovered a new element that has long stood as a missing link among the heaviest bits of atomic matter ever produced .
The element , still nameless , appears to point the way toward a brew of still more massive elements with chemical properties no one can predict .
The team produced six atoms of the element by smashing together isotopes of calcium and a radioactive element called berkelium in a particle accelerator about 75 miles north of Moscow on the Volga River , according to a paper that has been accepted for publication at the journal Physical Review Letters .
Data collected by the team seem to support what theorists have long suspected : that as newly created elements become heavier and heavier they will eventually become much more stable and longer - lived than the fleeting bits of artificially produced matter seen so far .
If the trend continues toward a theorized “ island of stability ” at higher masses , said Dawn A. Shaughnessy , a chemist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California who is on the team , the work could generate an array of strange new materials with as yet unimagined scientific and practical uses .

Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) called the ruling ' absurd ' .
House members blast prayer ruling
A bipartisan group of 19 House lawmakers demanded Wednesday that the federal government appeal a week - old ruling by a federal judge that the National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional .
“ She ’s made a decision that seems on its face patently absurd , ” said Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) , during the hour - long press conference sponsored by the Congressional Prayer Caucus .

U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb ruled in Wisconsin on April 15 that a National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional , violating the First Amendment ’s Establishment Clause .
Members sounded confident that the ruling would fall on appeal in the Seventh Circuit .
And Rep. Lincoln Davis ( D - Tenn . ) said he ’s “ certain ” the Obama administration will issue a proclamation for a National Day of Prayer on May 6 , despite the ruling .
The White House had no immediate comment , though it said last week the president planned to mark the day .
The Justice Department has 45 days to decide on an appeal .
And spokesman Charles Miller said Wednesday , “ No determination has been made as of yet . ”
Rep. Todd Tiahart ( R - Kan. ) and 24 cosponsors have introduced a resolution that would stress a National Day of Prayer does not represent an unconstitutional establishment of religion .
It would reaffirm the commitment to an annual prayer day and encourage Attorney General Eric Holder to appeal the ruling .
Still , last week ’s surprise ruling has fired up religious conservatives .
“ Make no mistake about it , there is a struggle going on in our country over whose sets of values , whose sets of principles are going to prevail : the secular left versus those of us who believe in the Judeo Christian tradition and heritage and truths that are part of that , “ said Rep. Jim Jordan ( R - Ohio ) .
“ My concern is if we do n’t prevail on the values debate , we may not have the toughness , the tenacity , what it takes to prevail on the other big challenges : the economic and financial concerns we face , the terrorist threat we face .
It is really that important .
It ’s really that fundamental . ”
Another Republican said the ruling shows why judicial nominees need to be studied closely .
“ It shows the importance of having someone in the White House who appoints good judges , ” said Rep. Doug Lamborn ( R - Colo . )
“ This judge was appointed by Jimmy Carter .
Need I say anything more ?
We have to make sure that President Obama does not send someone to the Supreme Court someone ’s name this summer who is of the same liberal bent as this judge is . ”
Others vigorously argue that the long history of presidential proclamations for prayer does not violate the Constitution because no one is forced to pray .
Rep. Mike McIntyre ( D - N.C. ) noted that the original law calling for the day says people “ may ” turn to God on the day chosen by the president .
“ It ’s not requiring people to do anything , ” he said .
“ It says that they ‘ may . ’
And I think that three letter word clears it up . ”
Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R - Texas ) personally criticized the judge for having the gall to overturn two centuries of precedent .
“ I ’m sure she ’s got the best degrees on her wall and all , ” he said , “ but she is ignorant of our history . ”

Three species thought to be extinct have been found again , to the delight of conservationists .
In the UK , the rare ghost orchid , declared extinct in this country just last year , has been found in England , and a caddisfly – a small flying insect – last seen more than a century ago has been discovered again in Scotland .
On the global stage the yellow - spotted bell frog , presumed " possibly extinct " by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature , has been seen on a creek - bed in Australia .
The good news stories follow a warning by a leading IUCN expert that humans are now driving plants and animals to extinction faster than new species can evolve .
Simon Stuart , the IUCN expert who chairs the Species Survival Commission which declares species endangered or extinct , said that although roughly one " possibly extinct " species each year was re-discovered , many more plants and animals were added to the list .
There will also be continuing concern for species that are re-discovered in very small numbers .
For example only a single 5 cm high ghost orchid was found by the botanists who revealed it is still alive in the UK .
The sighting of the caddisfly by a PhD student beside a river in north - west Scotland – 350 miles north of the previous record , according to the conservation charity Buglife – could further suggest the influence of climate change in driving species out of their traditional habitats , something some plants and animals will be able to adapt to better than others .
" The whole point of the ' possibly extinct ' list is they can come in and out , " said Stuart .
" But we 're adding species on to the ' possibly extinct ' list much faster than we 're taking them off it . "
The IUCN has much stricter rules about declaring a species fully extinct , including that it must have been actively searched for by teams of experts in the field .
However in 2008 the Switzerland - based organisation did have to move the Miles ' robber frog ( Craugastor milesi ) from the extinct to critically endangered list after a single specimen was found in Honduras .
Among the reasons conservationists dislike a species being declared extinct are that it is no longer possible to get money to research and preserve its habitat .
The locations of the orchid and the Australian frog are both being kept secret to protect them , however one of the bell frogs and a tadpole have been taken to Taronga zoo in Sydney for a captive breeding programme .

Bill : Continuing now with our lead story , the obama administration trying to expand federal power .
00:09:40 Joining us from washington , new york congressman anthony weiner .
00:09:43
So you read my talking points , congressman .
00:09:45
Where am I going wrong ?
00:09:46 >>
Well , you have a couple of factual things wrong .
00:09:49
First , there was nothing in the bill that has any health records being revealed to the federal government .
00:09:54
There is nothing that has the irs finding out your health insurance status except whether you have insurance or not .
00:09:58
And that is weather you are going to claim it in order to be able to get your deduction .
00:10:02
But you also set up .
00:10:03 >>
Bill : All right .
00:10:04
Let me challenge .
00:10:04 Number one , on the health records , if you read the " wall street journal " today , there is a big article that in order for the federal government to make decisions on who gets what , you are going to have to have a review panel of some kind to look at people 's status .
00:10:19
So , I 'm not sure you 're correct about that .
00:10:21 You have to -- >>
here is where you are mistaken .
00:10:25
They are going to aggregate like they do now things that are going on in the health care economy .
00:10:29
But they wo n't know a single thing about bill o'reilly 's health care or anthony weiner 's health care .
00:10:35
They will go to the hospital and say how many gallbladders taken out .
00:10:38
Which procedures were more or less efficient ?
00:10:40
What kind of rates did you have .
00:10:41
To say that people are going to lose control over health records is deceptive .
00:10:45
It really is but the point that you are fundamentally making -- >>
Bill : Woe , woe , woe .
00:10:50
If there is a controversial about a procedure that procedure is out of the american 's hands doctor 's hands it's in the federal government 's hands .
00:10:58 >>
You are misunderstanding .
00:11:00
Right now for the past 50 years , tomorrow , we are always going to be , since we are big providers of health care , we in the federal government , but to taxpayers with taxpayers dollars always looking at what things work well and what things do n't .
00:11:11
No different than the new england journal of medicine compiled the records of 10,000 people who had apen diets and figured out what worked best .
00:11:20
There is nothing in the bill that does what you said , bill .
00:11:23
Let me be clear .
00:11:25 >>
Bill : Let me point out .
00:11:26
That 's not what the other side is saying .
00:11:28 We will see how it pans out .
00:11:29 >>
There is enormous -- I will tell you something , bill .
00:11:33
There is enormous amount that others on the other side are saying are just lies .
00:11:38
We have to be careful not to have false debate .
00:11:42 >>
Bill :
The irs is now going to have to enforce obama care .
00:11:45
So if you say flip it , I ain't buying it , then the irs is the one that is going to make the determination whether you get fined or what happens to you .
00:11:54
So , again , the irs is going to have to have access to information .
00:11:57 >>
That is not true .
00:11:59 >>
Bill :
Who is going to do that ?
00:12:00 >>
I 'm going to explain how the bill works .
00:12:02
Right now , under this law as passed the other day , if you want to get the tax credit to buy insurance , you will have to stay on your tax form whether or not you are already getting it .
00:12:13
We are not going to give the tax benefit to someone owning a home who does n't actually own a home .
00:12:20 >>
Bill : I got that , but if you do n't want to buy health insurance , the irs has to see to it that you do .
00:12:27
That 's what universal health care is about .
00:12:28 >>
That 's another mistake .
00:12:30
You are not required to get insurance under the law .
00:12:32
Can you choose to pay into the pool that pays for your insurance should you go into a hospital emergency room .
00:12:39 >>
Bill :
What if you choose not to do anything ?
00:12:41 Than who -- >> you are going to have to pay up to , not exceeding 1 % of your income because .
00:12:46 >>
Bill :
What if you say who , I 'm not , then who comes after you .
00:12:50 >>
Bill , I 'm going to have to try to squeeze in an answer here .
00:12:53
It is no different than if you say you get a tax deduction when you buy a home , you have got to prove you have got a home .
00:12:58
You are going to have to pay for health insurance because everyone is getting it under the new plan .
00:13:02
When you go into a hospital emergency room , and someone provides you care , you can't pay , you and I pay for it this fund would make that up .
00:13:11 >>
Bill :
You are dodging the question .
00:13:12 >>
I 'm answering the question .
00:13:13
You are making stuff up .
00:13:15 >>
Bill :
If someone is defiant , and there will be people who are and say I am not going to participate in this .
00:13:21 I 'm not going to give anybody a nickel .
00:13:23 I 'm not going to give you information about my health status , the irs then comes in and deals with that person .
00:13:29 >>
That 's not true .
00:13:31 >>
Bill : Who deals with them ?
00:13:31 >>
I do n't know how else to say this .
00:13:33
It 's the same exact process .
00:13:35
It says in the bill we are not criminalizing anyone for failure to .
00:13:39 >>
Bill :
They get fined .
00:13:40 >>
Bill , here is what we are going to have to try to figure out .
00:13:43
If we are going to communicate , you will have to let me speak .
00:13:45
Right now we have 88 % compliance rate with all elements of the tax code , requirements , sanctions , everything .
00:13:50
It 's the highest in the world .
00:13:52 >>
Bill : What about the other 12 % ?
00:13:55
The irs gets them if they do n't pay the taxes .
00:13:57
Ask wesley snipes .
00:13:58
You can't tell me the irs is n't the enforcement arm here .
00:14:02
It is .
00:14:06 Congressman ?
00:14:07 >> [ sigh ]
I have a very big burden here debunking every one of the mistakes you are making .
00:14:12
It 's going to take me a while .
00:14:15 >>
Bill :
Tell me which agency in the federal government will deal with someone who absolutely defies ?
00:14:19
Which one .
00:14:20 >>
Bill , watch this .
00:14:21
We are not criminalizing people who fail to comply .
00:14:24
Do you understand me ?
00:14:25 >>
Bill :
They have to pay a fine .
00:14:27 >>
Do you understand ?
00:14:28 --
That 's exactly right .
00:14:30 >>
Bill : Who determines the fine ?
00:14:31 >>
It 's in the law .
00:14:34 >>
Bill : All right , congressman .
00:14:35 >>
I have got to tell you something .
00:14:37
This is the problem with this debate .
00:14:38
Things that are made up and then no opportunity to .
00:14:41 >>
Bill : I 'm a simple man .
00:14:42 I 'm asking you the simplest question in the world .
00:14:45
If somebody refuses to cooperate , who fines them and you can't tell me .
00:14:50 >>
When you say something -- it is no different than any of the various things we have in our life .
00:14:55
If you go littering and that 's a $ 50 fine , no one is following you around to get your litter .
00:15:00
Why is this such a difficult concept ?
00:15:03 >>
Bill : I know I 'm not a smart man but i .
00:15:05 >>
I love you , buddy .
00:15:07
You have got to stop making up stuff about the bill .
00:15:09
You have got to stop .
00:15:10 Come on , my man .
00:15:14 >>
Bill : Levy fined .
00:15:15 >>
Next time you ask me the question we will get to that .
00:15:18 >>
Bill : I asked it five times , congressman .
00:15:20 Thanks for coming on .

Ann coulter supposed to speak in canada last night .
00:15:24
It did not happen .
So , it ’s well known that you should n’t have code that looks like this ( examples in ruby and ruby - like pseudo code , but they ’re trivially translatable to any other language ) :
begin do stuff rescue end
i.e. you ’re swallowing the exceptions because they scared you and you wanted to hide them .
This is naughty .
A more subtle trap people fall into is the following example from the rails boot.rb ( this is n’t a rails specific problem .
I see it everywhere )
def load_rails_gem if version = self.class.gem_version gem ' rails ' , version else gem ' rails ' end rescue Gem:: LoadError => load_error $ stderr.puts %( Missing the Rails #{version} gem .
Please `gem install - v=#{version} rails` , update your RAILS_GEM_VERSION setting in config / environment.rb for the Rails version you do have installed , or comment out RAILS_GEM_VERSION exit 1 end
Let ’s consider the results of this rescue block : A generic error message is printed , and we exit with a non -zero status code .
Now let ’s consider the results of not having this rescue block : A specific error message is printed , we exit with a non - zero status code and we get a stack trace telling us exactly what went wrong .
So by including this rescue , we have lost information .
Often this information does n’t matter , but as it turns out in this case it does :
If you have a gem version clash where rails depends on a different version of a gem that has already been loaded you will get a Gem : : LoadError and , consequently , a very misleading error message .
I do n’t want to pick on rails .
Well , correction .
I do n’t want to pick on rails here .
This post is actually inspired by a similar incident at work :
There was a piece of code that basically looked like this :
begin connect to server rescue STDERR .puts " Could not connect to server " exit end
And were getting very puzzling errors where we were sure all the details were correct but it was failing to connect to the server .
Once we deleted the rescue code it was immediately obvious why it was failing ( if you care , the reason was that we were n’t loading the config correctly so it was trying to connect with some incorrect default values ) .
Which brings me to the point of this article :
The best way to handle exceptions is not to handle them .
If it ’s not an exception you can reasonably recover from , the chances are pretty good that the default behaviour is more informative than the “ helpful ” code you were going to write in order to catch and log the error .
So by not writing it you get to have less code and spend less time debugging it when it inevitably goes wrong .

SCENE : Mannahatta , May 24 , 1626 .
On the horizon are two tall - masted ships , anchored in the Hudson .
Two Lenape Indians , CALKANICHA , a chief , and LAPOWINSA , a younger tribesman , converse in their native Lenape , beneath an ancient oak tree .
CALKANICHA : ( troubled )
They showed you the beads ?
LAPOWINSA : Yes , Grandfather .
Beads , kettles , duffel cloth — you were just saying how we could use some duffel cloth .
CALKANICHA : I know , I know .
( Sighs . )
It just does n’t add up .
Just then , a large contingent of Dutchmen approaches the Indians .
They set down a large wooden chest , overflowing with wampum beads , duffel cloth , and other assorted goods .
PETER MINUIT , the director - general of New Netherland , removes his hat and bows deeply .
PETER MINUIT : ( in Dutch ) Greetings , most wise and noble chief .
On behalf of the Dutch East India Company , I offer you these valuable treasures in exchange for the rights to this tree - filled island and all its surrounding lands .
Lapowinsa and Calkanicha peer into the chest .
They chat animatedly with each other in Lenape .
After a minute , Minuit becomes antsy .
PETER MINUIT : Er , is there a problem ?
Lapowinsa replies in rudimentary Dutch .
LAPOWINSA : Chief want me to say he appreciate offer — especially the wampum .
Chief big on wampum .
( Calkanicha gives a thumbs - up . )
But , before we sign anything , we want to make sure white man understand what he is getting into .
PETER MINUIT : ( confused ) I ’m not sure what you mean . . .
LAPOWINSA : Look , we not want to seem patronizing — after all , it ’s your duffel cloth — but we been in Mannahatta long time .
And , sure , it seem dazzling and sophisticated at first .
But living here ?
( He makes a skeptical face . )
It not everything it cracked up to be .
PETER MINUIT : ( worried )
Why ?
Is there a scourge ?
Warlike neighbors ?
LAPOWINSA : Not “ scourge ” per se .
( Pinches fingers philosophically . )
More like cultural pathology .
PETER MINUIT : I do n’t follow .
LAPOWINSA : You know , little things : like how people only interested in “ what you hunt , ” not “ who you are ” ; the relentless sarcasm ; Fashion Week — oh , and how everyone always talking about Greenmarket !
Seriously , it ’s just produce !
It make you feel like social pariah because you do n’t like rainbow chard .
Calkanicha interjects .
__
LAPOWINSA : Chief say chard thing even worse in Brooklyn .
PETER MINUIT : ( annoyed ) I fail to see how this is relevant . . .
LAPOWINSA : We just saying that this place have way of skewing people ’s priorities .
For example : Chief reside in bearskin district .
Chief ’s brother - in - law Eriwoneck live behind that new Montessori school in East Village , only twenty thousand paces distant .
And yet they never see each other , because Eriwoneck refuse to journey beyond Fourteenth Creek !
Calkanicha shakes his head ruefully .
The Dutchmen are totally mystified .
LAPOWINSA : ( pensive )
You know , it amazing how warrior can live among so many kinsmen and yet feel so alone .
PETER MINUIT : ( exasperated )
If you are trying to discourage us from settling in this place , it will not work !
We shall tame this savage land , and it will be a paradise on earth !
A city free from extravagance and disproportionate compensation ; with modern schools , selfless governance , and a system of congestion pricing to minimize gridlock !
Lapowinsa chortles .
PETER MINUIT : ( grandiose ) Romantic entanglements shall be mature and drama - free , and man shall treat his neighbor with exquisite grace and consideration — even if he is in a really big hurry .
The natives stare blankly at the white man for a full minute .
Finally , Calkanicha shrugs .
LAPOWINSA : ( translating )
Chief say , “ Knock yourselves out . ”
Moments later , Lapowinsa and Calkanicha sign the deed of sale , and move to the country , like they always talked about .
Sure enough , the New Amsterdam colony is plagued by violence , ethnic tension , and chronic mismanagement , and in 1674 the beleaguered settlement is ceded to Great Britain .
Conditions remain difficult for the next three hundred years or so , until someone finally builds an IKEA . ♦

Illinois State Senator Dale Risinger ( R , Peoria ) has offered a bill in Springfield that drives our society further along the path of making parts of the human body a commodity , undercutting the sacred status of human life .
SB 3613 , the Presumed Donor bill , amends the Illinois Anatomical Gift Act to define all Illinois patients as “ presumed donors ” unless they specifically avail themselves of the opt out clause .
In other words , unless you tell the government that in the case of your presumed brain death you do n’t want your body parts cut out and donated to other patients , they will be cut out and given to others .
As the law stands now a potential donor has to opt in to the organ donor program in order to allow the government to authorize usage of organs in case of brain death .
One must inform the state ahead of time that one will agree to donate his organs .
This bill would reverse that process of consent .
If SB 3613 passes all patients will be assumed to be fodder for transplants unless they ’ve specifically told the state that they do not want their body parts to be parceled out to other people .
As the synopsis of the bill states :
This bill , “ Provides that , on and after July 1 , 2012 , each resident of Illinois who is of sound mind and who has attained the age of 18 years is presumed , by operation of law , to have given all of his or her body for any organ donation purposes . ”
Proponents of this bill say that it will help alleviate the desperate need for donor organs and will help hundreds of patients live that might otherwise die due to their disease and lack of donor organs .
It does sound like a great idea until one begins to look at it all with a bit more logical eye .
Laws like a “ presumed donor ” law could easily cause doctors to care less for the injured when looking to harvest organs for patients waiting transplants .
And since the criteria for a transplant includes the donor ’s “ brain death ” one is struck with abuse that such a designation could lead to .
Medical science is replete with cases of patients that were called brain dead and given up as a lost cause but who woke up , healed , and became sentient , active people once again despite the doctor ’s negative expectations .
Unfortunately , medical science is not always right with its determination of when an injured patient is permanently bran dead .
That being the case , to assume that every patient that is determined to be brain dead is a candidate for organ harvesting could easily put the life of that patient in danger of being given less importance when weighed against people waiting on an organ donor list .
Injured patients have to trust that a doctor has their best interest in mind and must hope that a doctor ’s zeal to harvest organs takes a back seat to the welfare of the potential donor .
This law , however , would upset that delicate balance and place the need for organs at a higher level of importance than the life of the potential donor .
This all tends to make the human body more of a commodity than a sacred vessel .
Doctors could easily begin to see severely injured patients as temporarily breathing organ banks instead of living humans that need their utmost skill to heal them .
If you stand against this bill and want to see Illinois organ donor law stay as an opt in law instead of one of “ presumed consent ” you have a chance to voice your disapproval of the law by supplying written testimony to Senator Risinger via email at senatorrisinger@yahoo.com .
Unfortunately I am only finding out about this now as a public hearing was held on Tuesday , March 2 .
Please do email Senator Risinger that you oppose this bill .

Wind power has emerged as a viable renewable energy source in recent years — one that proponents say could lessen the threat of global warming .
Although the American Wind Energy Association estimates that only about 2 percent of U.S. electricity is currently generated from wind turbines , the U.S. Department of Energy has said that wind power could account for a fifth of the nation ’s electricity supply by 2030 .
But a new MIT analysis may serve to temper enthusiasm about wind power , at least at very large scales .
Ron Prinn , TEPCO Professor of Atmospheric Science , and principal research scientist Chien Wang of the Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences , used a climate model to analyze the effects of millions of wind turbines that would need to be installed across vast stretches of land and ocean to generate wind power on a global scale .
Such a massive deployment could indeed impact the climate , they found , though not necessarily with the desired outcome .
In a paper published online Feb. 22 in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics , Wang and Prinn suggest that using wind turbines to meet 10 percent of global energy demand in 2100 could cause temperatures to rise by one degree Celsius in the regions on land where the wind farms are installed , including a smaller increase in areas beyond those regions .
Their analysis indicates the opposite result for wind turbines installed in water : a drop in temperatures by one degree Celsius over those regions .
The researchers also suggest that the intermittency of wind power could require significant and costly backup options , such as natural gas - fired power plants .
Prinn cautioned against interpreting the study as an argument against wind power , urging that it be used to guide future research that explores the downsides of large - scale wind power before significant resources are invested to build vast wind farms .
“ We ’re not pessimistic about wind , ” he said .
“ We have n’t absolutely proven this effect , and we ’d rather see that people do further research .
” Daniel Kirk - Davidoff , a chief scientist for MDA Federal Inc. , which develops remote sensing technologies , and adjunct professor of meteorology at the University of Maryland , has examined the climate impacts of large - scale wind farms in previous studies .
To him , the most promising result of the MIT analysis is that it indicates that the large - scale installation of wind turbines does n’t appear to slow wind flow so much that it would be impossible to generate a desirable amount of energy .
“ When you put the wind turbines in , they are generating the kind of power you ’d hope for , ” he said .
Previous studies have predicted that annual world energy demand will increase from 14 terawatts ( trillion watts ) in 2002 to 44 terawatts by 2100 .
In their analysis , Prinn and Wang focus on the impact of using wind turbines to generate five terawatts of electric power .
Using a climate model developed by the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research , the researchers simulated the aerodynamic effects of large - scale wind farms — located both on land and on the ocean — to analyze how the atmosphere , ocean and land would respond over a 60 - year span .
For the land analysis , they simulated the effects of wind farms by using data about how objects similar to turbines , such as undulating hills and clumps of trees , affect surface “ roughness , ” or friction that can disturb wind flow .
After adding this data to the model , the researchers observed that the surface air temperature over the wind farm regions increased by about one degree Celsius , which averages out to an increase of .15 degrees Celsius over the entire global surface .
According to Prinn and Wang , this temperature increase occurs because the wind turbines affect two processes that play critical roles in determining surface temperature and atmospheric circulation : vertical turbulent motion and horizontal heat transport .
Turbulent motion refers to the process by which heat and moisture are transferred from the land or ocean surface to the lower atmosphere .
Horizontal heat transport is the process by which steady large - scale winds transport excessive heat away from warm regions , generally in a horizontal direction , and redistribute it to cooler regions .
This process is critical for large - scale heat redistribution , whereas the effects of turbulent motion are generally more localized .
In the analysis , the wind turbines on land reduced wind speed , particularly on the downwind side of the wind farms , which reduced the strength of the turbulent motion and horizontal heat transport processes that move heat away from the Earth ’s surface .
This resulted in less heat being transported to the upper parts of the atmosphere , as well as to other regions farther away from the wind farms .
The effect is similar to being at the beach on a windy summer day :
If the wind weakened or disappeared , it would get warmer .
In contrast , when examining ocean - based wind farms , Prinn and Wang found that wind turbines cooled the surface by more than one degree Celsius .
They said that these results are unreliable , however , because in their analysis , they modeled the effects of wind turbines by introducing surface friction in the form of large artificial waves .
But they acknowledge that this is not an accurate comparison , meaning that a better way of simulating marine - based wind turbines must be developed before reliable conclusions can be made .
In addition to changes in temperatures and surface heat fluxes , they also observed changes in large - scale precipitation , particularly at the mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere .
Although these changes exceeded 10 percent in some areas , the global total changes were not very large , according to Prinn and Wang .
To investigate the effect of wind variability on the intermittency in wind power generation , the researchers used the climate model to estimate the monthly - mean wind power consumption and electrical generation for each continent , concluding that there are very large and geographically extensive seasonal variations , particularly over North and South America , Africa and the Middle East .
They explain that this unreliability means that an electrical generation system with greatly increased use of wind turbines would still require backup generation even if continental - scale power lines enabled electrical transmission from windy to non-windy areas .
Although Prinn and Wang believe their results for the land - based wind farms are robust , Wang called their analysis a “ proof - of - concept ” study that requires additional theoretical and modeling work , as well as field experiments for complete verification .
Their next step is to address how to simulate ocean - based wind farms more accurately .
They plan to collaborate with aeronautical engineers to develop parameters for the climate model that will allow them to simulate turbines in coastal waters .
Update ( December 2019 ) – A lot can happen in less than a decade and quantum computing is now a reality !
You can now use Amazon Braket to Get Started with Quantum Computing .
— Jeff ;
We ’ve had more than our fair share of technical challenges along the way , but the time is right for me to talk about our newest product , the Quantum Compute Cloud , or QC2 for short .
This is the first production - ready quantum computer .
You can use it to solve certain types of math and logic problems with breathtaking speed .
Ordinary computers use collections of bits to represent their state .
Each bit is definitively 0 or 1 , and the number of possible states is 2n .
1 bit can be in either of 2 states , 2 bits can be in any one of 4 states , and so forth .
Quantum computers such as the QC2 use a more sophisticated data representation known as a qubit or quantum bit .
Each qubit exists in all of it ’s possible states simultaneously , but the probability that a qubit can be in any of the states can change .
Quantum computers work by manipulating the probability distribution of each state .
How do you program a quantum computer ?
With quantum algorithms , of course .
Pretty much everything that you know about traditional programming becomes obsolete when you step up to the QC2 .
You need to think in terms of probabilities , distributions of probabilities , and so forth .
Take a look at Shor ’s Algorithm for finding prime factors to get a better idea of the power of a quantum computer .
We are also planning to support Bernhard Omer ’s QCL programming language .
Take a look at his thesis on Structured Quantum Programming to learn more .
Here ’s a QCL code sample to get you started :
Once you ’ve launched a QC2 instance and loaded up your algorithm , you must sample the output ( also known as “ collapsing the quantum state “ ) in order to retrieve the probability distribution which represents your answer .
You ’ll want to do this more than once for any particular problem in order to increase your confidence in the solution .
Collapsing the quantum state is a destructive operation ( much like reading from a magnetic core memory ) ; be sure to account for this in your algorithm .
In effect , the answer does n’t exist until you ask for it .
Until now , the largest quantum computer contained less than 8 qubits .
Because we ’re really , really smart , we ’ve been able to push this all the way to 32 in the first - generation QC2 .
This will allow you to represent problems with up to 232 distinct states .
We ’re launching the QC2 in the US East Region in multiple Availability Zones .
using the amazing “ spooky action at a distance ” property of quantum entanglement , you can actually replicate QC2 instances across Zones .
The QC2 beta is limited , and will definitely close before the end of the day .
— Jeff ;
PS – We need to hire lots of world - class people to help us with leading edge technologies like QC2 , EC2 , and the like .

For the student who wants to dig deeply into the Buddha ’s teachings , “ Wings to Awakening ” is one of the best anthologies available because of its very specific focus on the “ how ” and “ what ” of the Buddha ’s Awakening .
As its author , Thanissaro Bhikkhu writes in the Preface :
Many anthologies of the Buddha ’s teachings have appeared in English , but this is the first to be organized around the set of teachings that the Buddha himself said formed the heart of his message : the Wings to Awakening ( bodhi - pakkhiya - dhamma ) .
The material is arranged in three parts , preceded by a long Introduction .
The Introduction tries to define the concept of Awakening so as to give a clear sense of where the Wings to Awakening are headed .
It does this by discussing the Buddha ’s accounts of his own Awakening , with special focus on the way in which the principle of skillful kamma ( in Sanskrit , karma ) formed both the “ how ” and the “ what ” of that Awakening :
The Buddha was able to reach Awakening only by developing skillful kamma — this is the “ how ” ; his understanding of the process of developing skillful kamma is what sparked the insights that constituted Awakening — this is the “ what . ”
For your personal study , here it the complete “ Wings to Awakening ” by Thanissaro Bhikkhu in PDF form , offered freely and with the aspiration that it be a resource and refuge in your dharma practice .
[ The Buddha : ]
So this is what you think of me : “ The Blessed One , sympathetic , seeking our well - being , teaches the Dhamma out of sympathy . ”
Then you should train yourselves — harmoniously , cordially , and without dispute — in the qualities I have pointed out , having known them directly : the four frames of reference , the four right exertions , the four bases of power , the five faculties , the five strengths , the seven factors of Awakening , the noble eightfold path .

Technology reporter , BBC News
The researchers studied films such as Avatar
Micro -blogging service Twitter can be used to predict the future box - office takings of blockbuster films , according to researchers at Hewlett Packard ( HP ) .
The computer scientists studied 3 million messages - known as tweets - about 25 movies , including Avatar .
They found the rate at which messages were produced could be used to accurately predict the box office takings before the film opened .
Further analysis of the content of the messages could predict ongoing success .
" Our predictions were incredibly close , " Bernardo Huberman , head of the social computing lab at HP , told BBC News .
Word of mouth builds audience
Jan Saxton
Adams Media Research
For example , he said , the system predicted that zombie film The Crazies would take $ 16.8 m in its first weekend in the US .
It actually took $ 16.06 m .
The team forecast that romantic drama Dear John would take $ 30.71 m in its first US weekend .
It took $ 30.46 m .
The unpublished research has been posted on the Arxiv website .
Social sentiment
The team were able to make their first - weekend revenue predictions by analysing the torrent of tweets about a particular film in the run up to its release .
" We developed algorithms to analyse these tweets and measure the rate at which they were produced , said Dr Huberman .
" Our intuition was that the faster people tweet , the more likely they are to go and see it . "
Twitter and sentiment analysis
The teams were then able to forecast the ongoing success of a film , including its second weekend revenues , by doing what is known as sentiment analysis .
This analyses the content of tweets and decides whether it is positive , negative or neutral .
" It 's tapping into collective intelligence , " said Dr Huberman , who carried out the work with Sitaram Asur , also of HP .
The team trained their system using Amazon 's Mechanical Turk , an online tool that pays people to perform small tasks that computers would struggle to complete .
" We got people to classify tweets and we used that to calibrate the sentiment analysis , " explained Dr Huberman .
Again , the system tracked the fortunes of movies and outperformed other predictive systems such as the Hollywood Stock Exchange , he said .
For example , analysis showed a boom in positive sentiment about the Oscar - nominated The Blind Side after it was released , but showed the opposite affect for New Moon , which initially sold well but rapidly lost viewers .
" Word of mouth builds audience , " said Jan Saxton , vice president and senior films analyst at Adams Media Research .
She highlighted the film My Big fat Greek Wedding , which she said became the " film of the year " in 2002 by recommendations .
" If word of mouth becomes a faster , more effective marketing tool , then the effect on the movie business could be profound . "
Both Dr Huberman and Ms Saxton said that the demographic of Twitter - which tends to be young , tech - savvy and reasonably affluent - may limit the utility of the system for analysis of some trends , such as those aimed at children .
However , Dr Huberman believes it could be of use in forecasting other trends , such as how well a gadget or product will sell .
Elements such as sentiment analysis are also being used by other groups .
For example , it is being used by an organisation called Tweetminster to monitor the UK general election to work out whether online buzz correlates with the winners .

The sad news has been confirmed .
Jack Herer , author of Emperor Wears No Clothes and renowned around the world for hemp activism , has died at 11:17 a.m. today , in Eugene , Oregon .
Jack Herer suffered a heart attack last September just after speaking on stage at the Portland HempStalk festival .
The last seven months have proven to be a huge challenge to the man , with several health issues making his recovery complicated .
Jack Herer 's health has been poor lately , this last week there have been reports of the severity , and an outpouring of prayers on his behalf .
" It 's shocking news , even after these last seven , trying months , " said Paul Stanford , THCF Executive Director .
" Jack Herer has been a good friend and associate of mine for over 30 years .
I was there when he had the heart attack at our Hempstalk festival and I know he would n’t appreciate the quality of life he 's endured these last months .
Still he will be greatly missed .
I honor his memory . "
" No other single person has done more to educate people all across the world about industrial hemp and marijuana as Jack Herer .
His book is translated into a dozen different languages , it 's a bestseller in Germany , " added Stanford .
" The Hempstalk stage will forever be the Jack Herer Memorial stage .
And , a Memorial is planned to be built where he fell that day , " Stanford said .
" His legacy will continue to inspire and encourage for generations to come . "
Jack Herer , author of " The Emperor Wears No Clothes , " died this morning in Eugene , Oregon .
He had been in ill health since suffering a heart attack at the Portland Hempstock Festival last Fall .
Here 's the report from the Salem News
A biomechanical arm built out of found objects and stainless steel rods served as inspiration for one of the world 's weirdest microphone stands .
Artist Chris Conte created the gleaming , sci-fi–looking mike holder for Adam Gontier , lead singer of Three Days Grace .
Gontier found photos of Conte 's original artwork online and inquired about a custom piece of gear based on the arm .
" When he asked me over the phone if it can be done , I was like , ' Hell yeah , it can be done , ' " Conte said in an e-mail interview with Wired.com .

The only problem :
The band wanted a left arm and the original was a right .
" I suggested we take molds and make casts from the original , " said Conte , 40 , who lives on New York 's Long Island and worked in prosthetics before concentrating full - time on art .
" I first needed to sacrifice the original arm and reverse - engineer it into a left arm .
I also needed to construct it in such a way where it could be broken down into sub-assemblies that were practical for mold - making and casting . "
The biomechanical mike stand breaks down like a traditional piece of music gear .
Conte made three of the mike stands ( Gontier bought a backup for the road ) .
The mike stands are constructed primarily of stainless steel .
One part of the quick - release mechanism is made of brass .
" The arm you see in the photos is actually a casting in stainless steel of the master using the lost - wax process , " Conte said .
" Eleven separate silicone molds were taken from the master to create the wax models needed for the casting process . "
The project took about three months , and Gontier used the stand onstage for the first time Feb. 19 at the Prudential Center in New Jersey .
Conte , who was previously profiled by Wired.com ( " Creepy Cyberpunk Fantasies Come to Life " ) , said his work is a reflection of the things he loves .
" I simply build the things I wish I had , " he said .
" The work also expresses my fascination with advanced technology , specifically cybernetic organisms , combined with my admiration of relics from the past .
Cybermechanical sculpture is perhaps one way to describe it . "
Next up for Conte :
He 's building four insectoid creatures out of recycled watch parts for a print and television ad campaign for London retailer Harrods .

The plus size supermodel opens up about the challenges of succeeding in the fashion industry
She suffered from a crippling eating disorder to maintain the size 0 frame she needed to work in the fashion industry , but eventually found greater fame as a size 12 model .
Now Crystal
Renn is speaking out about the changes she thinks the fashion industry should make .
“ We , as a culture , are fixated , and perhaps even in an unhealthy way , with dress size and the scale size , ” Renn said in a new interview with ABC ’s Nightline , during which she debated the question , “ Is it Okay to be Fat ? ”

The model , who has also been an advocate for a wider array of sample sizes ( most runway samples are a size 0 or 2 ) , also says she ’s faced discrimination due to her weight .
“ Fat people are absolutely discriminated against .
I know this because of the type of modeling I do If it was n’t , then I ’d be all over the runways , every single runway , like everyone else , ” she says .
Instead , she ’s had to make her mark in a specialized market – on her own terms .

La paura dell ’FBI per gli hacker dagli occhi a mandorla è sempre più alta .
Già qualche tempo fa ne avevamo parlato , con sospetti di spionaggi informatici cinesi , ora però l’indice è puntato contro l’hardware contraffatto che arriva dalla Cina che potrebbe servire a violare i database del governo .
Paranoia ?
Chissà .
Una presentazione dell ’FBI finita illegalmente su Internet rivela i timori del Bureau .
A riguardo , l’Assistant Director della Cyber Division , James Finch ha chiarito che “ quel briefing non classificato non doveva essere divulgato ” .
Il tutto riguardava una vasta falsificazione di prodotti Cisco che sarebbero stati acquistati dall ’esercito , dalla marina , dall ’aviazione : praticamente l’intera Difesa americana era rifornita di pezzi cinesi .
Il cattivo funzionamento della componentistica ha destato i primi sospetti , che hanno presto condotto alla inquietante scoperta .
Adesso la paura è che si potesse trattare di trojan .
I tecnici della Cisco hanno esaminato i pezzi contraffatti concludendo che non sono evidenti tentativi di renderli vulnerabili ad attacchi informatici , ma l’FBI si accontenterà di queste rassicurazioni ?
Io non credo proprio .

i Phone and iPad advertisements have always shown the time as 9:42 and 9:41 .
Why ?
Steve Jobs has certain idiosyncrasies and much of the reasoning behind his and Apple 's choices are kept tightly under tight wrap so we never knew -- until now .
Scott Forstall , SVP of iPhone software at Apple Inc , has finally given the answer .
Scott stated that the big reveal of a keynote usually happens at around 40 minutes in , give or take .
In order to have the pictures on the iPhone / iPad sync with the audiences ' watches the time of 9:42 was chosen for the iPhone and 9:41 for the iPad .
So there you have it , one less secret in the Apple multiverse and as with many secrets , the answer is simple and reasonable .
A part of me had hopped that the reasoning behind the magic time 9:42 was something more eccentric , such as it was the time Steve Jobs first child 's was born or the secret code to unlocking Flash on the iPhone .
Another part of me is amazed by the thought Apple places into every detail of their advertising .
Either way , mystery solved .

Rumored wedding bells for Bar Refaeli and Leonardo DiCaprio may ring true or false , but these are already being muffled by controversy .
Supermodel Bar Refaeli is one of Israel 's most successful " exports . "
But with fame comes responsibility -- and now an Israeli organization is beseeching Refaeli not to wed Leonardo DiCaprio -- out of a responsibility to future generations .
" It is not by chance that you were born Jewish , " wrote Baruch Marzel in a letter he sent Refaeli through her mother ( and that promptly appeared in the press ) .
" Your grandmother and her grandmother did not dream that one of their descendants would one day remove the family 's future generations from the Jewish people .
Assimilation has forever been one of the enemies of the Jewish people . "
Marzel , a well - known stalwart among Israel 's ultra-nationalists , appealed to Refaeli on behalf of an organization named " Lehava . "
In Hebrew , this means " flame : ; it is also the Hebrew acronym for " Preventing Assimilation in the Holy Land . "
The organization , according to its Facebook page ( in Hebrew ) provides assistance to Jewish girls in relationships with non-Jews , especially Arabs .
There are other organizations in Israel that specialize in extricating Jewish women from marriages and other relationships with Arabs .
Last month , Yad L'achim held an event for 100 women " rescued from Arab villages . "
Three fox cubs got their heads stuck in a drain grate in Plainfield , Connecticut last Friday .
Neighborhood residents could hear their mother calling for them from out of sight .
After firefighters were unable to cut the grate , Animal Control Officer Karen Stone tried lubricating the pup 's heads with Vaseline , then corn oil , but had no luck .
What finally did the trick was a dose of Dawn dishwashing detergent .
The pups were freed from the grate and driven back to the area of their den , soapy but unharmed .

From birth , Israel was a regional menace until America became its benefactor in the late 1960s .
Now it ’s a global one , powerful with a large standing army and the latest weapons and technology , nuclear armed and ready to use them .
It ’s belligerent on the slightest pretext or none at all , and a threat to world peace and security because US administrations since Lyndon Johnson supported a nation of 5.6 million Jews in an area the size of New Jersey , partnering in its worst crimes and abuses .
It ’s due largely to the Israeli Lobby ’s influence , or as John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt wrote in their book , The Israel Lobby and US Foreign Policy , America ’s Middle East policy is driven “ almost entirely ( by ) US domestic politics , and especially ( because of ) the ( Lobby ’s ) activities … .
This situation has no equal in American political history . ”
In his book , The Power of Israel in the United States , James Petras documented its enormous influence , explaining its roots throughout government , the business community , the dominant media , academia , the clergy , and powerful wealthy Jewish families .
Broad support comes from thousands of dedicated activists , including doctors , lawyers , accountants , other professionals , philanthropists , and journalists given special prominence and benefits for their unwavering pro-Israeli reporting , suppressing decades of its militarism , belligerence , and illegal occupation while vilifying Israel ’s enemies .
As a result , Israel receives enormous benefits , including billions in annual aid , the latest weapons and technology , unrestricted US market access , and free entry of its immigrants .
Its imperial wars , illegal occupation , and crimes of war and against humanity are supported .
Harmful Security Council resolutions are vetoed and General Assembly ones ignored .
As a result , it operates freely , including spying in America by covertly penetrating US military bases , the FBI , CIA , IRS , DHS and many other government agencies , remaining unaccountable for its actions .
Israel is unique as America ’s largest aid recipient , on the most favorable terms , and virtually anything more requested , given openly or covertly , in violation of the 1961 US Foreign Assistance Act ( as amended ) , stipulating that no aid be provided to governments that engage :
in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights , including torture or cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment or punishment , prolonged detention without charges , causing the disappearance of persons by the abduction and clandestine detention of those persons , or other flagrant denial of the right to life , liberty , and the security of person , unless such assistance will directly benefit the needy people in such country .
In 2004 , the amended Act let the president provide aid to treat orphans , other vulnerable children , those with HIV / AIDS , and to set up schools and other supportive programs .
US Aid to Israel
In November 2008 , Shirl McArthur of the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs ( WRMEA ) used Congressional Research Report ( CRS ) data for a “ Conservative Estimate of Total Direct US Aid to Israel ” since 1949 , saying it ’s almost $ 114 billion , but explaining that determining the exact figure is impossible since parts are buried in various agency budgets , mostly the Defense Department ’s ( DOD ) or in forms not easily quantifiable .
He states :
“ It must be emphasized that this analysis is a conservative , defensible accounting of US direct aid to Israel , NOT of Israel ’s cost to the US or the American taxpayer , not of the benefits to Israel of US aid .
The distinction is important , because the indirect or consequential costs suffered by the US as a result of its blind support for Israel exceed by many times the substantial amount of direct aid ” provided .
Besides Afghanistan and other Middle East conflicts , excluded from McArthur ’s data , is the mounting Iraq invasion and occupation cost , estimated by Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes to be $ 3 trillion in their book titled , The Three Trillion Dollar War : The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict .
They include an extra $ 2 trillion national debt , ad infinitum interest on it , veterans ’ healthcare and disability payments , the economic impact of lives lost and jobs interrupted , the higher cost of oil , the long - term economic impact , and numerous intangibles such as global anti-American sentiment , the near universal Arab world view that Washington attacked Iraq for Israel , and the US ’s reduced capability to respond to other global crises and address vital homeland needs .
In his June 2003 WRMEA article titled , “ The Cost to American Taxpayers of the Israeli - Palestinian Conflict , ” Thomas Stauffer conservatively estimated it at around $ 3 trillion measured in 2002 dollars , nearly four times the amount for the Vietnam war , also in 2002 dollars .
Stauffer said US Israeli aid is way - understated :
“ since much is outside of the foreign aid appropriation process or implicit in other programs .
It comes to $ 1.8 trillion , including special trade advantages , preferential contracts , or aid buried in other accounts .
In addition to the financial outlay , ” about 275,000 US jobs are lost annually .
His estimates include :
multi - fold oil price increases ;
the effect on US jobs and exports ;
economic and military aid ,
special benefits to Israel , including privileged contracts for Israeli firms , legal and illegal weapons and technology transfers , exemption from US trade protection provisions , discounted “ surplus ” military equipment sales , low or no-interest loans , and other undisclosed costly benefits , exclusively for Israel .
He concluded that Israeli assistance and Middle East unrest “ ha( ve ) proven to be very expensive for the US , ” much higher than revealed figures .
Their total costs “ are some six times the official aid ” with all related factors included such as the price of oil and burden on other regional states .
“ All states — not just the US — have borne the burden of conflicts in the Middle East . ”
Known US aid includes :
annual $ 3 billion direct appropriations ;
undisclosed additional amounts ;
millions annually to resettle immigrants ;
disclosed and unknown billions in loan guarantees ;
since 1981 , economic aid in direct cash transfers , and since 1985 military aid the same way ;
Israeli military loans as grants , repayment not required ; Israel wants them called loans to avoid US monitoring ; according to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , “ Technically , the assistance is called loans , but as a practical matter , the military aid is ( given as ) grants ; ”
economic aid is the same , Israel spending it as it pleases with no required accountability ;
since 1982 , Economic Support Fund ( ESF ) cash transfers come in lump sum form at the beginning of each fiscal year , no strings attached — a benefit afforded no other country , made even greater by investing it in US Treasuries ;
special Foreign Military Sales ( FMS ) funding is also afforded to purchase American weapons and technology ; other countries buy them through the Defense Department ( DOD ) ; Israel deals directly with US companies ; other countries must comply with minimum purchase amounts ; Israel has no such restriction ; other countries let DOD disburse funds to suppliers ; Israel pays them directly and is reimbursed by the US Treasury ; under this arrangement , Israeli officials have committed serious offenses , including embezzlement and improper access to highly classified information on US weapons and technology ;
US weapons suppliers provide offsets by purchasing Israeli products and services ;
Israel may use over 26 % of its aid to buy weapons , munitions and other equipment from its own companies ; no other nation has this benefit ; as a result , its arms industry is one of the world ’s largest and most sophisticated ; in 2007 , it was the 8th largest supplier to developing countries ;
aid finances Israel ’s defense industry ;
state - of - the - art weapons and technology are provided ; and
America guarantees Israel ’s access to oil and finances its settlements — illegal under international law .
In April 1998 , Washington designed Israel a “ major non-NATO ally , ” qualifying it to receive Excess Defense Articles ( EDA ) under Section 516 of the Foreign Assistance Act and Section 23 ( a ) of the Arms Export Control Act .
As a strategic US ally , it gets unmatched preferential treatment .
In FY 2009 , the If Americans Knew web site said America gave Israel $ 7 million or more daily .
Palestinians got nothing , except to police their own people , strengthen Fatah against Hamas and other competing parties , some economic aid benefitting Israel and the West , and spotty amounts through USAID and to UNRWA and US - based NGOs for projects called “ humanitarian . ”
In their above - mentioned book , Mearsheimer and Walt said :
Since the October ( 1973 ) War , Washington has provided Israel with a level of support dwarfing the amounts ( given ) any other state .
It has been the largest annual recipient of direct US economic and military assistance since 1976 and the largest total recipient since World War II .
Total direct US aid to Israel amounts to well over $ 140 billion in 2003 dollars … .
In per capita terms , the United States gives each Israeli a direct subsidy worth about $ 500 per year .
Over the last 20 years , Washington focused mainly on military aid , increasing it by $ 150 million annually since FY 2007 , plus additional amounts for Israeli incursions , planned jointly with Washington .
Before 1998 , Israel annually received military grants of $ 1.8 billion and economic ones totaling $ 1.2 billion .
Beginning in FY 2009 , by mutual agreement , economic aid is being reduced by $ 120 million and military grants increased by $ 60 million annually over 10 years .
In August 2007 , a memorandum of understanding afforded Israel $ 30 billion in aid for 10 years , plus later discovered undisclosed amounts , totaling billions .
Budgeted amounts go mostly for specific projects , such as Israel ’s Merkava tank , its Arrow anti-missile missile , other anti-missile systems , and the cancelled Lavi attack fighter .
Grants also go to US - Israeli scientific and business cooperation organizations , the two largest being the BIRD ( Binational Research & Development ) Foundation and the BARD ( Binational Agriculture and Research and Development ) Fund .
Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) Report on US Foreign Aid to Israel — December 4 , 2009
Its latest report affirms Israel as “ the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign assistance since World War II , ” saying it gets nearly $ 3 billion annually , mainly as military assistance .
In August 2007 , the Bush administration incrementally increased it by $ 6 billion over the next decade .
For FY 2010 , the Obama administration requested $ 2.775 billion in Foreign Military Financing ( FMF ) .
Congress provided $ 555 million of Israel ’s total FY 2010 FMF in PL ( Public Law ) 111-32 , in the FY 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act. HR 3081 and S 1434 contain the remaining funds .
On July 9 , 2009 , HR 3160 was introduced , the Israeli Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act , 2010 .
The bill was referred to committee and awaits further action .
Recent possible military sales include :
on September 29 , 2008 , the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter with associated equipment and training , a deal , if consummated , worth up to $ 15.2 billion ; Israel wants up to 75 depending on the cost ; negotiations continue , but reported disagreement was reported over its right to customize aircraft to its needs and the final per plane cost , from $ 100 – $ 200 million depending on the degree of customization ;
on September 9 , 2008 , Patriot Missile Fire Unit upgrades , 1,000 GBU - 39 small diameter guided bombs , and 28,000 M72A7 light anti-armor weapons , in total worth about $ 330 million ; Israel already has US - supplied Hawk and Patriot missiles as well as its own defense systems ; since 1988 , both countries have been developing the Arrow Anti-Missile system , a weapon with theater ballistic missile capability ; Arrow became operational in 2000 ; Arrow II is designed to deter longer - range conventional ballistic missiles , and other systems are under development , including Arrow III ;
on July 30 , 2008 , nine C - 130 J - 30 aircraft with associated equipment and training , worth up to $ 1.9 ; billion ; and
on July 15 , 2008 , four Littoral combat ships , worth up to $ 1.9 billion , and JP - 8 aviation jet fuel worth up to $ 1.3 billion ; in 2009 , Israel declined to purchase these ships over cost concerns .
American Israeli aid began in 1949 with a $ 100 million Export - Import Bank loan and continued modestly for the next two decades .
In 1962 , Israel bought its first advanced weapons system , Hawk anti-aircraft missiles .
In 1968 , a year after the Six Day War , the Johnson administration assured Israel ’s regional military superiority .
Since 1970 , large - scale aid followed .
In 1971 , it was $ 545 million , and by 1974 Israel became America ’s largest aid recipient , two - thirds for military purposes .
After the 1979 Camp David Accords and Israel - Egypt Peace Treaty , Washington gave both sides $ 7.5 billion under the 1979 Special International Security Assistance Act , allocated 3 - 2 favoring Israel .
Thereafter , regular and emergency economic and military aid followed .
Today , Israeli allocations far exceed amounts given Egypt or any other nation .
In 1985 , Congress appropriated special economic assistance of $ 1.5 billion under terms of a US - Israel Joint Economic Development Group ( JEDG ) , calling for neoliberal reforms and empowering Israel ’s Finance Ministry and national Bank .
Washington and Tel Aviv colluded for two goals :
— balancing Israel ’s budget ; and
— cutting wages , prices , credit , public benefits , pensions , and the currency ’s value as well as curbing union power and establishing an exploitable temporary worker market .
It began Israel ’s race to the bottom by mass privatizations , welfare and social benefit cuts , and wealth shifted to the top as in America , the result being growing Jewish poverty , hunger and homelessness to the present .
In 1985 , all US military aid became grants , what began for economic aid in 1981 .
Thereafter , generous supplemental aid followed , including after the Gulf and 2003 Iraq wars .
The FY 2003 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations
Act included $ 9 billion in loan guarantees over three years and $ 1 billion in military grants .
Other amounts came earlier .
They ’ve continued ever since , some open , others covert , affording Israel exclusive preferential treatment .
The “ special relationship ” remains fixed under Obama , what he affirmed at the June 2008 AIPAC meeting that he ’s “ a true friend of Israel , ” felt he was “ among friends , ” stressed that “ the bond between the United States and Israel is unbreakable today , tomorrow and forever , ” and , in fact , “ as president , I will work with you to ensure that this bond is strengthened . ”
He has n’t disappointed .

Republican Siren Song of Sedition
The KKK came to rally in my town when I was a teenager .
I could n’t understand why we had to pay for security so these hate mongers could march in our streets .
I stood on the curb watching them , tears rolling down my face , and I asked myself , what kind of world is this ?
What kind of world is it where we pay for the security of these hate mongers to express themselves , but no one could save the African Americans who were lynched in the south ?
No one could save my gay friend from being spit on ?
No one can save the woman beaten to death by her husband ?

No one can spare the endless humiliations born from simple biology , but we could protect these hate mongers , who ironically were comprised of mostly privileged white males .
And yet , I ’ve never hated someone ’s message so much that I wanted to shut him or her down by force .
My liberal parents taught me that those folks had a right to freedom of speech .
Freedom of speech .
This is our right as American citizens .
Part of my job as a citizen is to tolerate ideas with which I do not agree , so long as they do not infringe on the rights and safety of others .
It is our most basic of rights , so much so that we are loathe to speak out when people are inciting violence , lest calling for accountability and responsibility mitigate their freedom of speech .
The left understands this and supports it to an extreme , while the right has shown an increasing inability to handle dissent of any kind .
The right is especially intolerant of the electoral kind of dissent .
The right is attacking , intimidating , and squashing political facts and opinion that they do n’t want to hear .
They ’re doing it by any means possible — broken windows , hitting Obama stickered - cars , spitting on congressmen .
This is not freedom of speech .
It is domestic terrorism .
These are the actions of cowards , who do n’t have the guts to face reality .
Here ’s reality : George W Bush started an illegal war based on a lie .
George W Bush got our children , spouses and parents shipped off to war over a lie .
We are losing that war .
George W Bush also deregulated the financial industry to such an extent that both the housing market and Wall Street collapsed and most of us lost our life savings .
Yes , it sucks .
But reasonable , mentally fit people do n’t take that out on the next guy .
They do n’t take it out on other citizens .
They do n’t resort to violence and intimidation .
No , this is the deliberately directed , impotent , misdirected rage of the politically powerless .
These people are being used to further the political agenda of the wealthy privileged few .
These are the people who heed their Republican leaders ’ siren call of sedition .
This , ladies and gentleman , is the modern day “ conservative ” Republican base , otherwise known as the Tea Party , the Sarah Palin Rally fan club , and the “ Christian nationalists ” .
A party so morally depraved and bereft of intellectual ideas , it has no other choice than to lure its base to anarchy .
And let ’s be real .
They are n’t doing this because they really think Obama is the anti-Christ .
They ’re doing it because they do n’t want to give up power , and they have nothing else .
We need to resist the urge to meet the thugs in the street .
The street is all they have .
Instead , patriotic citizens of all ideologies need to take a stand for civility .
We need to demand it from our elected officials .
We need to demand a debate of ideas .
And most of all , we need to keep these dangerous people , who clearly do not stand for the American way , out of government until they can show some respect for the founding principles of democracy .
A new strain of hypervirulent , deadly Cryptococcus gattii fungus has been discovered in the United States , a new study says .
The outbreak has already killed six people in Oregon , and it will likely creep into northern California and possibly farther , experts say .
The new strain is of the species Cryptococcus gattii , an airborne fungus native to tropical and subtropical regions , including Papua New Guinea , Australia , and parts of South America .
An older strain of the fungus was frst detected in North America in British Columbia , Canada , in 1999 .
No one knows how the species got to North America or how the fungus can thrive in a temperate region , experts say .
" The alarming thing is that it 's occurring in this region , it 's affecting healthy people , and geographically it 's been expanding , " said study co-author Edmond Byrnes , a graduate student at the Joseph Heitman Lab at Duke University .
Less common than bacterial and viral infections , fungal diseases usually strike people with weakened immune systems — part of what makes the recent deaths of otherwise healthy people in Oregon so worrisome .
People can become infected with Cryptococcus gattii by inhaling the microscopic organisms — and there 's not much you can do about it .
There 's no vaccination or other preventative measure available for the new strain , though the infection can be treated with antifungals , the study says .
And " there are no particular precautions that can be taken to avoid Cryptococcosis , " according to the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control .
" You can , however , be alert for long lasting or severe symptoms and consult a physician ( or veterinarian for animals ) for early diagnosis and treatment . "
Appearing several months after exposure to the fungus , the infection causes a bad cough and shortness of breath , among other symptoms .
On a positive note , fungal infections , unlike viruses , can't be passed from person to person .
Fast - Spreading Cryptococcus Gattii Superfungi
The first U.S. Cryptococcus gattii cases were identified in 2005 .
It was n't until the new study , though , that genetic analysis revealed that the fungus is a new strain that had originated in Oregon .
Of the 21 known cases involving the new strain , 6 have been fatal — about 25 percent .
The new strain has so far been deadlier than the strain in British Columbia , which killed 19 out of 218 known victims , or 8.7 percent .
The organism has also attacked domestic and wild animals , according to the study , published April 22 in the journal PLoS Pathogens .
Though the reason for the new strain 's severity is unknown , " one thing fungi do that bacteria do n't is they have sex with each other , " Byrnes noted .
( Related : " Rainmaking Bacteria Ride Clouds to ' Colonize ' Earth ? " )
As with humans , nearly every fungus offspring represents a new combination of genes and their resulting traits .
So it 's possible that the new fast - spreading superfungi is the result of Cryptococcus gattii mating .

The looters had already taken the lampshades , the fridge , and the DVD player .
Today they began on the shrubbery – digging up the dwarf fir trees from the front garden of Kyrgyzstan 's president , Kurmanbek Bakiyev .
The air resounded with crashing .
One ambitious looter even stole the drainpipes .
The popular revolt in Kyrgyzstan that toppled Bakiyev two days ago was so sudden and ferocious that nobody has had a chance to give it a name yet .
But it would be plausible to dub it the fir tree revolution – after the presidential shrubs taken and loaded into taxis .
Kyrgyzstan 's opposition parties declared they had formed a new interim government , after a day of mayhem on yesterday when security force snipers and riot police opened fire on unarmed demonstrators as they tried to storm the main government building in the capital , Bishkek .
At least 75 people were killed and 300 more injured .
Speaking in Bishkek 's ransacked parliament building today , the opposition leader Roza Otunbayeva said : " You can call what happened here a popular uprising or a revolution .
In essence people were simply fed up with the regime , and with its repressive , tyrannical and abusive ways . "
Otunbayeva said her temporary government had taken control – with security headquarters , state TV and various government building now in opposition hands .
She added that she planned to hold elections in six months after a new constitution had been drafted .
Out on the streets , however , there were few signs that the new regime was in control of anything .
The police and security forces appeared to be hiding .
Large crowds milled around the Soviet - era fir - tree - lined boulevards , forming and reforming revolutionary huddles .
Dozens of shops had been looted .
Burned out cars littered the pavements .
The main government building was on fire , with thick , black smoke pouring out of its upper floors .
Hundreds of looters gathered near the White House presidential building .
The shells of trucks and a tractor lay next to destroyed railings .
Youths perched on an armoured personnel carrier , seized yesterday from government troops .
By late afternoon the general prosecutor 's office was gutted , with gangs roaming around inside , smashing windows with broken - off table legs .
Sheets of paper – followed by a fig plant – fell from a balcony .
At the parliament building opposition workers were tossing posters of Bakiyev into the street .
Otunbayeva , a former foreign minister , said Bakiyev had fled the capital after yesterday 's revolution and had taken refuge in the southern town of Jalal - Abad , on the Tajik border .
Asked whether the new administration planned to arrest him , following yesterday 's massacre , she replied : " He should resign .
His business is finished in Kyrgyzstan . "
But the prospect of prolonged instability was raised when Bakiyev later told a Russian radio station that he refused to stand down .
Speaking to Ekho Moskvy from an undisclosed location , he said : " I do n't admit defeat in any way … Even though I am president , I do n't have any real levers of power . "
Protesters said they had been driven to revolt by the decision to raise communal charges for water and electricity .
The hikes had been the last straw in the country of five million people already wrestling with mass unemployment and widespread poverty .
The unrest began in provincial cities on Tuesday , with locals seizing regional government buildings , before riots erupted in Bishkek .
Opposite the White House , Melis Deripasov was still incredulous at the security forces ' reaction .
" So many boys died .
Two of my friends died .
A young girl died just over there .
The government used snipers against us , " he said .
" I 'm unemployed .
There is no work and no factories .
Bakiyev stole everything .
All that was left was the air we breathe . "
This was the second revolution in five years Deripasov had taken part in .
In 2005 pro-democracy demonstrators propelled Bakiyev into power , in the so - called tulip revolution .
But despite hopes that he would be a progressive ruler , critics say that Bakiyev turned out to be as greedy and illiberal as all other leaders in Central Asia .
" This revolt was a cry from the soul .
But I can't help feeling we deserved this president , " Gulnura Bepeera said .
Kyrgyzstan is now at the centre of an geopolitical tussle between Moscow , Washington and Beijing .
Russia 's prime minister , Vladimir Putin , today phoned Otunbayeva and offered his support .
She in turn thanked Russia for its " significant support " in exposing what she described as a " nepotistic , criminal regime " .
The Kremlin was fed up with the Bakiyev regime , which it believed had fallen under US control .
At issue is the US air base at Manas , near Bishkek , a key supply post for the US military and for Barack Obama 's efforts to win the war in nearby Afghanistan .
The Russians have been trying to turf the Americans out of the base .
The opposition , now in power , had promised to do just that .
Today , however , Otunbayeva said there would be no quick decisions : " Its status quo will remain in place .
We still have some questions on it .
Give us time . "
But another former opposition leader now in a senior government role said there was a " high probability " that the US lease would be curtailed .
Much of the frustration directed at the ousted government has stemmed from Bakiyev 's appointment of many of his family members to key government positions .
In particular , his younger son , Maxim , was widely detested .
Inside Maxim Bakiyev 's wrecked and burned mansion a stream of looters and the merely curious trampled over beds of broken glass .
On the wall someone had written : " Fuck you " .
Nearby , they had added : " Death to Maxim ! "
A couple of fir trees were still left in the beds .
But the others had all gone , transplanted – like the rest of Kyrgyzstan – to a new and uncertain future .
Protestors at Parliament objecting to the provisions of the Digital Economy bill .

The Liberal Democrats have called for the Digital Economy bill to be scrapped and re-introduced afresh in the next Parliament , and say they will oppose its rushed passage if , as expected , it is speeded through to become law in the " wash - up " ahead of a general election .
Paul Burstow , the Liberal Democrat chief whip , told the Guardian that although the party 's opposition might not be enough on its own to prevent the bill from passing , he hoped that the arguments being put forward - that the issues needed more debate than has been possible - might sway one of the other parties into delaying its passage .
" During the negotiation and discussion in the wash - up we will make it clear that we think that it is n't a suitable way to deal with the issues remaining such as site blocking , " Burstow said .
" We will put amendments down and make the case and hope that the government and the Conservatives will agree that it should n't proceed at this stage , " Burstow said .
The bill has proved controversial principally because it would require internet service providers ( ISPs ) to monitor internet connections provide details in cases of alleged copyright infringement , and the powers that it gives to " copyright holders " - expected mainly to be record labels and film companies - to lay accusations against people who might then see their internet connection suspended without proof of wrongdoing .
It also contains provisions that could lead to sites which are " mostly infringing " of copyright being blocked by ISPs .
That could mean that a site such as Wikileaks , which acts as a conduit for documents leaked anonymously by whistleblowers , would vanish from the internet as seen in Britain .
On Tuesday night the government published a new clause 18 for the bill to replace one which has raised the ire of lobbying groups .
The key difference from the previous clause appears to be that the secretary of state for business would have the final say on whether an internet site could be blocked .
The Department for Business , Innovation and Skills says of the addition : " the new clause sets out to achieve the main aims of the original clause 18 , but with some new safeguards :
" The new clause is a legally enforceable version of the clause inserted by the Opposition , with additional safeguards :
" It provides for a limited power to propose regulations in the future .
The regulations would allow copyright owners to apply for court injunctions .
These injunctions would require ISPs ( or other service providers ) to block access to specified internet locations providing access to copyright infringing material ;
" The safeguards are extensive , including provisions on consultation , threshold and proportionality , Parliamentary accountability , legitimate use of websites , freedom of speech , and ensuring due court process . "
Hundreds of people protested outside Parliament last week over those provisions of the bill .
The Open Rights Group has also been critical of the amount of time that has been devoted to debating it : while it has had three readings in the House of Lords , including a committee stage , it has had only one reading in the Commons , and if it proceeds to the " wash - up " it will not receive a detailed line - by - line examination in committee .
Instead , it would be pushed through with the minimum of debate .
The bill 's second reading in the Commons is scheduled for Tuesday 6 April , when Gordon Brown is also expected to ask the Queen to dissolve Parliament ahead of a general election on 6 May .
That would trigger the fast - track " wash - up " where legislation that has passed through one house of Parliament will be considered by all the main party whips for royal assent .
Typically , bills required to keep the process of government going - such as the Budget or finance bills - are nodded through in a truncated third reading .
Doing that with the Digital Economy bill could prove more controversial if the government puts it into the wash - up , says Burstow .
" We will vote against it at the third reading , " he said .
Burstow said that discussions about the parties ' positions occur all the time as part of Parliamentary business .
" The question will be whether these concerns are shared by one of the other parties . "
Such opposition would constitute an obstacle to the bill , rather than a roadblock , he acknowledged .
" We 're putting down some markers . "
" It might be that this is legislation where there 's recognition that it need more time to be properly scrutinised , which is n't possible this close to a general election , " Burstow said .
The question of whether the bill has had sufficient debate has also caused a row between the BPI , which represents record labels and backs the bill , and the Open Rights Group , which opposes its strictures on internet users and says it would choke off services such as public Wi -Fi .
The ORG says that the bill has had insufficient debating time in the Commons , and has challenged the BPI to say whether it thinks the time allotted - expected to amount to about 90 minutes - is sufficient for a bill of this importance .
The BPI says that the time allotted is a matter for the party managers - but has declined so far to answer queries raised by Guardian columnist Cory Doctorow on whether it thinks the time allotted under the present timetable is sufficient .
Thousands of letters have been sent to MPs by constituents via the 38 Degrees site complaining at the lack of debate of the bill .
The cutting - edge of literary studies uses brain scans and evolutionary psychology to fashion a science of reading , but these techniques have already been at work crafting the latest and most invasive phase of capitalism .
EXCLUSIVE : Leonardo DiCaprio is in early talks to play FBI director J. Edgar Hoover in Hoover , an epic drama that Clint Eastwood will direct and that he and Brian Grazer will produce with Rob Lorenz through Imagine and Malpaso .
Talks with Leo are just getting underway , but I ’m told that DiCaprio will play the lead role in the film written by Dustin Lance Black , with production to begin later this year .
The project began at Universal , where Imagine is based , but is mobilizing at Warners , where Eastwood ’s Malpaso has long called home , and where Eastwood is in post production on Hereafter , the film that stars Matt Damon .
Sources tell me that Imagine had been developing “ the story of the beginning of the FBI ” for a year when it finally showed the script to Universal , where the reaction was negative .
“ This is exactly what we do n’t want to make , ” Uni execs reacted .
“ It ’s period , and we have lost enough money with these things . ”
But then Grazer got the screenplay to pal Clint ( they did The Changeling and have had a personal relationship ever since ) , the two men met about it in mid-February , and suddenly Universal has a tough decision to make since .
As a Uni exec admits , “ Clint is an amazing director with an extraordinary trach record , and you ca n’t possibly dismiss anything he gets excited about .
The first question now to ask is how much will it cost to make ? ”
Universal ’s reticence is understandable , as the studio has endured a rough run with adult - themed dramas .
The film will prove a better fit at Warner Bros .
This will be DiCaprio ’s first film with Eastwood .
This role sounds as ambitious as his Oscar - nominated portrayal of Howard Hughes in the Scorsese - directed The Aviator .
In Hoover , he takes on one of the other formative figures in 20th Century America .
Hoover formed the country ’s federal jurisdiction law enforcement system with the establishment of the FBI and , while he might have come in with high ideals as a public servant , he increasingly became a manipulative power broker with a closet full of his own secrets .
When Hoover is depicted in films , it is usually in unflattering fashion .
But I ’ve heard this script described as “ peeling back the curtain on the life of Hoover ” with no cross - dressing claims .
A few children among the refugees belong to families involved in the drug trade , and rival gang members have threatened them , bringing the specter of gangland killings to the high school , law enforcement and school officials say .
“ Some of the families who are fleeing from Mexico are doing it because they were somehow participating in these acts , ” said Jose G. Franco , the school superintendent , “ and if you want to get at somebody , you get at their children . ”
The Hudspeth County Sheriff ’s Department and the state police are keeping a close eye on unknown vehicles parked near the schools .
The school district has for the first time hired a law enforcement officer to patrol its three campuses and has installed security cameras .
Spectators are now barred from football and basketball practices .
“ The kids are a little bit on edge , you know , ” said Constable Jose Sierra , who patrols the schools .
“ When we see a different car , we start to get phone calls . ”
Not everyone coming from El Porvenir is seeking asylum .
Many Mexicans in towns along the river have special border - crossing cards , which let them cross for up to 30 days to do business and shop near the border .
But some have used the visas to relocate their families temporarily to Fort Hancock and other small towns on the Texas side .
Those who have temporary tourist visas or who can obtain business visas because they have enough money to start businesses in the United States are also moving their families across the border .
( Cities like El Paso and San Antonio have had real estate booms and a flourishing of small businesses and Mexican restaurants as a result . )

Other Mexicans who were once happy living in Mexico are taking advantage of whatever means they have to obtain a visa and get out .
Some were born in a hospital on the United States side and are American citizens , for instance , or have married citizens but have never applied for residency .

Paul Cooper said the ban had effectively ended his career
An amateur footballer who received six red cards in the same match has admitted his playing career is over after receiving a two - year ban .
Paul Cooper , 39 , got a second yellow card for dissent while playing for Hawick United against Pencaitland in the Border Amateur League in November .
He then received another five red cards for verbal exchanges with the referee .
Mr Cooper said he loved football but would now have to " find something else to do on a Saturday " .
The player , nicknamed Santa , said he realised it was his own fault he had got into disciplinary trouble .
" I completely overreacted after I had been sent off and I know I said things to the referee I should not have , " he said .
" But I felt so frustrated as I honestly was n't to blame for the incident that led to me being sent off .
A few mad moments have basically cost Paul his footballing career
George Shepherd
Hawick United manager
" After the game I went to see the referee in his dressing room and I apologised to him for losing it and he accepted the apology . "
Mr Cooper said he was unable to attend a disciplinary hearing in Glasgow due to work commitments and then received a letter confirming his lengthy ban .
" Unfortunately I 've been in bother before with bans and I expected six months , " he said .
" But I was absolutely stunned when I got two years . "
He added that he believed it had effectively ended his 22 - year playing career .
He said : " I will just have to go with the flow , accept things and find something else to do on a Saturday . "
' Matter closed ' Hawick United manager George Shepherd said he believed the two - year suspension was " way over the top " .
" A few mad moments have basically cost Paul his footballing career , " he said .
" He is a very good player and will be a big miss to Hawick United . "
Hugh Knapp , secretary of the Scottish Amateur Football Association , said the matter had been properly dealt with under its disciplinary procedures .
" Mr Cooper was given the opportunity to attend a hearing but decided not to , " he said .
" He was also given the opportunity to appeal to the Scottish Football Association and again chose not to do that so the matter is closed . "
Mr Cooper 's club Hawick United were also fined £ 150 .

Consensual Crimes Do Not Belong in a Free Society
This includes blue laws , drug laws , prostitution laws , and any other law which utilizes our tax dollars to prevent people we do not know from doing things which do not harm anyone but themselves .
Free Trade Benefits Everyone
Protectionism does not create long - term benefits .
In the short term , protectionism hinders competition and raises prices .
In the long term , the free market always finds a way to work around protectionism .
Immigration Made This Country Great
The hard working people who made the arduous journey to this country built the greatest nation on earth .
Current immigration laws deny this country the youthful energy of immigration .
Current immigration laws are thinly - veiled racism .
Treat People with Respect
People deserve to be treated with respect .
We do not believe that a government which seeks to micro-manage every aspect of its citizens lives treats its citizens with the proper degree of respect .
Governments Exist By Consent of the Governed
Mankind existed long before national governments .
Government was created to serve the needs of the people .
Government seems to have forgotten that .
Free Markets Work
Government regulation is , in every case , less efficient than the regulation provided by millions of independent buyers and sellers in a free economy .
Fewer Crimes Lead to Better Enforcement
If our police forces were not required to waste their scarce resources hunting down marijuana smokers , they would be able to devote more of their time to keeping our streets and our homes safe from violent criminals .
Self - protection is a Responsibility
Self - protection is primarily the responsibility of the individual .
The national government should assist against threats from foreign powers .
The police should assist against threats against criminals .
The individual has the responsibility to participate actively in his own defense .
All Men and Women Deserve Equal Treatment under the Law
All men and women are not created equal .
Some are small , some are tall .
Some are brilliant ; some just barely manage to get by .
All of these should be treated fairly and equally under the law .
It is the responsibility of government to serve all of its citizens .
It is not the responsibility of government to injure some of its citizens to benefit others .
Freedom of Speech
All of our other rights begin with the freedom of speech .
Freedom of speech is our first defense against the loss of all other freedoms .
The Right to Bear Arms
The right to bear arms is our last defense against the loss of all other freedoms .
Racism is Stupid
Racism introduces artificial standards and inefficiency into the competitive process of the free market .
Racists allow less capable students into their schools .
Racists hire less capable employees into their businesses .
Racists deny themselves potential markets for their good and services .
Racists are stupid .
The U.S.A. is the Most Successful Social Experiment in the History of Mankind
The United States of America is the greatest country to ever exist on the earth .
This is not due to our natural resources , our racial heritage , or our religious beliefs .
This is due to our shared commitment to a set of ideals , which are comprised mostly of limited government and sound economic policy .
The two men most responsible for the success of our country are John Locke and Adam Smith , neither of who ever stepped foot on this continent .
The Separation of Church and State
It is the job of government to serve the people .
It is not the job of government to tell the people what to believe .
Marriage is a Religious Institution
We do not believe in state approval for homosexual marriage — or heterosexual marriage .
A marriage is a relationship between two people and their God .
The requirement to obtain the permission of a petty bureaucrat to be married is objectionable .

A persuasive e-mail from an iPhone developer to Steve Jobs helped Pointy Heads Software get its Knocking Live Video — the first official iPhone app capable of streaming live video over 3G and WiFi connections — approved for sale in the App Store .
The app relies on a private API — well - known among iPhone developers — to enable its video streaming feature , so its approval is a good sign for other companies developing video - based apps .
It 's also a good sign that Apple is taking developer complaints with the App Store approval process seriously .
Knocking Live Video uses an interesting take on streaming video .
Unlike Qik , which is designed to stream video to multiple clients , Knocking streams from one iPhone to another .
( It should be noted that the iPhone version of Qik was n't approved with live streaming — it can only upload the video to Qik 's website after recording for later streaming . )
You simply launch the app and " knock " another iPhone user with Knocking Live Video installed .
That user will receive the " knock " via push notification .
Once answered , you can then stream live video directly to them .
An iPhone 3GS or iPhone 3G is required to transmit video , but other iPhones and iPod touches can receive and view the stream via WiFi .
" We are focused on phone - to - phone , not uploading to the Web , " Pointy Head developer Brian Meehan explained to Ars .
" Who really cares about fleeting moments other than friends and family seeing it as it happens ?
With Knocking people share what they are doing right now .
Our testers have referred to knocking as a ' visual tweet , ' " he said .
To make its magic work , the app relies on use of a private API that enables capturing frames live from the iPhone 's screen .
" Our app uses a form of screen capture to create live moments which we have built a complex algorithm around , " Meehan told Ars .
However , use of private APIs — internal programming functions and methods that are n't approved for developer use — is a direct violation of Apple 's iPhone developer agreement .
It goes without saying that Knocking Live Video was promptly rejected about 30 days ago for violating this clause .
But Meehan was convinced that his app was worth fighting for .
" When it was rejected , I decided not to give up and reach out directly to Steve Jobs via e-mail , " he told Ars .
" I reached out to Apple to reconsider our application due to its potential to culturally change how people share live moments phone - to - phone . "
He made his case " in a way that was not about me or our app , rather about being a life - long user of all Apple products , about how I believed in Apple and that I believed Jobs would respond , " Meehan said .
Meehan ended up composing a passionate plea to Apple 's CEO , explaining he has been frustrated and disheartened with the app approval process , which often leaves developers wondering and waiting with little or no response from Apple about any potential problems .
He pointed out that there are other apps that had been approved using the same private API call — though it was prior to Apple 's suspected use of automated analysis software that can comb through code and spot references to unapproved APIs .
Meehan even " humbly " requested that Jobs himself review a demo of the app and reconsider it for approval .
He then fired off the e-mail to Jobs at 11 pm on Saturday , November 21 .
An Apple executive , who wishes to remain anonymous , contacted Meehan at 8:30 am the following Monday morning to discuss the app and its rejection .
He revealed that the order to reverse the app's rejection came " directly from the top . "
Within three hours of the phone call , Knocking Live Video was approved for sale via the App Store .
The app is available for free starting today .
The approval is significant for several reasons .
It 's the first app with verified use of private APIs that Apple has approved for sale .
It 's also the first app approved to allow live video streaming .
Finally , it 's a concrete sign that Apple is indeed working to address developer concerns — though persuading Steve Jobs to personally approve an app is probably not going to become an official policy .
" Apple told me they are listening , and truly care about their developers and getting it right , " Meehan said .
" And I have to say I agree , as they reached back and it was a very positive experience , " he told Ars .
The executive that Meehan spoke with did n't say if all apps using the particular API would now be eligible for approval —use of private APIs is generally frowned upon since they may change at any time and are n't guaranteed to work indefinitely .
If Apple makes an internal change to iPhone OS , an app that uses a private API may suddenly stop working or start crashing .
Given that Apple has been convinced that streaming video is a useful application for the iPhone , it will likely soon offer an approved API for screen capture or even accessing the iPhone camera 's video stream directly .
Recently Apple SVP of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller tried to address concerns with the App Store approval process , echoing the sentiment that Apple is working hard to get things right .
We noted at the time that saying it is one thing , and doing it is another .
Reversing its decision to reject Knocking Live Video — like its recent reversal with Rogue Amoeba 's Airfoil Speakers Touch — is an important step in the right direction .

Lusaka , Zambia
Elleman Mumba makes an unlikely celebrity .
He is not a singer nor a footballer - he is a 54 - year - old peasant farmer from southern Zambia .
Yet he has appeared on the front page of a national newspaper and been interviewed for numerous radio and television programmes .
They said I was using juju in my field .
I felt very bad , but I knew I was n't using witchcraft
Elleman Mumba
What explains his fame ?
Mr Mumba grows maize and groundnuts on his small plot of land in Shimabala , just south of Lusaka .
Feeding his family used to be a problem .
" The yield was very little .
We were always looking for hand - outs ; we had to rely on relief food . "
Quiet agricultural revolution
Like many farmers , Mr Mumba had no oxen of his own to plough his field .
He had to wait in line to hire some , which meant he often failed to plant as soon as the first rains fell - with disastrous consequences .
A chaka hoe means there is no need to plough with oxen Researchers say that for each day 's delay , the potential yield shrinks by between 1 % and 2 % .
Then , in 1997 , Mr Mumba suddenly found himself in the vanguard of a quiet agricultural revolution .
His wife had been given free training in a system called conservation farming , and persuaded him to try it .
Conservation farming is about doing less to get more .
Instead of ploughing entire fields , farmers till and plant in evenly spaced basins .
Only a tenth of the land area is disturbed .
This reduces erosion and run-off - where soil and nutrients are washed away by rain .
" That season I had 68 bags of maize - enough to feed my family and buy four cattle , " he says , blazing with pride at the recollection .
Using just a wide - bladed traditional chaka hoe , Mr Mumba had dug a series of shallow rectangular planting basins in his field during the dry season .
It was a tough job to break the sun - baked soil , but he persevered , and was ready to sow his seed with the first rains .
Suspicious success Punctual planting was not the only reason for Mr Mumba 's bumper crop .
I pay for my children to attend school .
I can pay for the grandchildren to go to nursery school .
So when I die , they will be able to excel on their own
Elleman Mumba
The basins had punched through the layer of compacted earth created under the topsoil by repeated ploughing .
Roots and rain no longer struggled to penetrate this " plough pan " .
The crop flourished in spite of low rainfall and some of Mr Mumba 's neighbours regarded his success with suspicion .
" They said I was using juju in my field .
I felt very bad , but I knew I was n't using witchcraft .
I told them : ' In CF there 's no juju .
It 's just that you conserve water , so even when the rains are light , you are able to get something . ' "
Now many of those who called him a witchdoctor have followed him into conservation farming .
It is a growing trend .
Easier and easier Across the country there are more than 160,000 farmers using basins or other minimum tillage methods , including large - scale commercial farmers .
For big or small , the principles are the same : disturb the soil as little as possible
use natural processes as well as fertiliser to replenish its nutrients
leave crop residue in situ rather than burning it off
rotate crops Musango trees act as an organic fertiliser through leaf shedding
And the benefits ?
" I pay for my children to attend school , " says Mr Mumba , a father of six , " I can pay for the grandchildren to go to nursery school .
So when I die , they will be able to excel on their own . "
Mr Mumba also enjoys the reduction in his workload .
The basins are always sited in the same place , so digging becomes easier with each successive year .
Weeding takes less time because fertiliser has been applied only to the basins and not the whole field .
His crop is as high and healthy as ever this year , but it has cost him less effort .
In the future it will cost less money too .
Just hands and a hoe Protruding at regular intervals above Mr Mumba 's crop are the thorny branches of young musango trees .
Also called winterthorn or ana tree , this unusual acacia sheds its leaves just as the first rains fall , creating a nitrogen - and nutrient - rich carpet .
Conservation farming has meant Mr Mumba 's family never need food aid When mature , Mr Mumba 's musangos will act as an organic fertiliser factory , and reduce his expenditure on artificial inputs .
Zambia 's Conservation Farming
Unit is not just promoting the musango 's potential for fertilising the soil .
It says the tree could play an important role in combating deforestation , both through planting programmes and by reducing the need for farmers to slash and burn new areas to access fertile soil .
Dissenters say there is not enough empirical evidence to support the promotion of conservation farming as a magic bullet for sub-Saharan Africa 's food shortfall .
But several countries in the region are investigating its potential , hence the stream of visitors to Mr Mumba 's door .
They want to see if an average farmer really can produce such good results with just his hands and a hoe .
Giggling at all the attention he is getting , Mr Mumba is pleased to say yes , he can .

Not so many years ago , even as I was filled with fear and loathing of the hideous misconduct of the US Patent & Trademark Office , I retained some respect for the notion of patents .
I even wrote what I think is an unusually easy - to - read introduction to Patent Theory .
But no more .
The whole thing is too broken to be fixed .
Maybe it worked once , but it does n’t any more .
The patent system needs to be torn down and thrown out .
I offer the following evidence , just a few random things that came across the radar in recent weeks .
Some of these are long but they ’re all worth reading :
RIM hit with more patent woes .
Sample quote : “ A black cloud of litigation is nothing new for RIM , as lawsuits are commonplace in the competitive technology sector . ”
Sawyer Weighs In On Intellectual Ventures .
Sample quote : “ There is no positive evidence for software patents improving or increasing innovation in software .
None . ”
Sequential Innovation , Patents , and Imitation ( PDF ) .
Sample quote : “ The natural experiment that occurred when patent protection was extended to software in the 1980 's provides a test of this model .
Standard arguments would predict that R&D intensity and productivity should have increased among patenting firms .
Consistent with our model , however , these increases did not occur . ”
Patent infringement lawsuits raking in the big bucks .
Sample quote : “ It 's clear that the upper hand currently belongs to those who are n't making products . ”
Reducing the Cost of IP Law .
Sample Quote : “ There are literally no studies clearly showing any net gains from IP .
If anything , it appears that the patent system , for example , imposes a gigantic net cost on the economy ( approximately $ 31 billion a year , in my estimate ) . ”
I particularly like that last piece , even though it ’s too long .
While we all might agree that , in theory , it ’d be good to introduce legal structures that provide incentives for inventors , the evidence is in , and it ’s clear that the current structure fails to achieve that while imposing horrendous costs and inefficiencies .
And here are a few words for the huge community of legal professionals who make their living pursuing patent law :
You ’re actively damaging society .
Look in the mirror and find something better to do .
Two Texas - based refinery giants have pledged as much as $ 2 million to fund signature gathering for a ballot initiative to suspend California ’s landmark global warming law , according to Sacramento sources .
The companies , Valero Energy Corp. and Tesoro Corp. , own refineries in California that would be forced under the law to slash emissions of heat - trapping greenhouse gases .
Campaign workers began collecting signatures Tuesday for the initiative , which would delay regulations to implement the nation ’s most comprehensive climate legislation until California ’s unemployment level drops to 5.5 % for at least a year .
The current jobless rate is more than 12 % .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a strong supporter of AB 32 , the global warming law , had asked businesses not to support the ballot measure , which was launched by a coalition of Republican politicians and conservative activists .
California companies , according to a source close to the administration , “ are more tolerant of California ’s environmental leadership .
But these Texans do n’t want to pay to cut their emissions in California if the federal government is not going to pass climate legislation .
They can throw a few mill - ion dollars into ” fighting the law .
A federal climate bill , passed by the U.S. House last June , has stalled in the Senate in the wake of intense lobbying by coal and oil companies , which would be forced to cap their emissions .
Scientists say carbon dioxide and other gases are trapping heat in the atmosphere and disrupting the planet ’s climate .
Meanwhile , the recession and high unemployment rate have pushed environmental issues far down the list of public concerns , at the same time that conservative groups have latched onto global warming as a way to attack the Obama administration .
A Tesoro spokesman did not respond to inquiries .
But the company ’s website invites visitors to lobby Congress to ensure “ fair ” climate legislation and fight any effort by the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act .
Bill Day , a Valero spokesman , declined to confirm or deny the company ’s involvement , saying that “ any contributions would come out in normal disclosures ” under California ’s campaign laws .
He referred a reporter to Goddard Claussen , a Sacramento political consulting firm , which is handling the ballot campaign .
However , Day added in an e-mail that Valero had set up a website , www.voicesforenergy.org, “ to educate consumers about the federal cap - and - trade legislation .
Valero has been very outspoken about the dangers of these proposals and the fact that they would badly damage the economy while having no effect on climate change . ”
The initiative sponsors , including Assemblyman Dan Logue ( R - Marysville ) , Rep. Tom McClintock ( R - Granite Bay ) and the People ’s Advocate , a Sacramento - based anti-tax group , have until April 24 to gather 433,971 valid signatures to qualify it for the November ballot .

In Hollywood , any movie whose premise can be described in five or fewer words is ( ironically ) called “ high concept . ”
And as much as we love videogames , let ’s face it : by those standards , most of them are pretty damned high - concept .
That ’s part of what makes them fun .
And in a celebration of that fun , we ’ve randomly selected 94 different games and summed up their entire premises ( or just something instantly recognizable about them ) in exactly five words .
Got it ?
Enough blather .
Games in five words GO !

A London - based precious - metals trader who had accused JPMorgan Chase of manipulating the gold and silver markets was involved in a bizarre weekend car accident that triggered a police chase before the suspect was nabbed .
Andrew Maguire , a metals trader at the London Bullion Market Association , and his wife were traveling in their car when a second car coming out of a side street struck their vehicle .
That car then hit two more vehicles before fleeing .
London cops using helicopters and patrol cars chased the hit - and - run driver before nabbing that person , whose name has not been released by authorities .
Maguire and his wife were released from the hospital yesterday .
London police would not comment on the accident investigation .
The hit and run occurred after Maguire ’s name came to light Thursday during a US Commodities Futures Trading Commission hearing on limiting gold and silver positions held by large market participants in order to prevent manipulation .
During the hearing , Maguire was identified as having sent e-mails to Bart Chilton , a CFTC commissioner , and Eliud Ramirez , head of the commission ’s enforcement division , alleging that JPMorgan had used its massive metals positions to manipulate the commodities markets .
In one e-mail , Maguire wrote , “ It is common knowledge here in London among the metals traders that it is JPM ’s intent to flush out and cover as many shorts as possible prior to any discussion in March about position limits , ” referring to last week ’s CFTC hearings .
JPMorgan inherited the positions when it acquired Bear Stearns two years ago .
When the allegations first surfaced last week , JPMorgan declined to comment .
A fellow poster on a chat service had a very important problem that he was asking for help solving .
His son , an adult , is developmentally disabled and the programs that the family has come to rely on to create for him something like a normal life were being slashed .
When this poster tried to explain the situation to officials and others who might help , their eyes glazed over and they lost interest .
What can he do ?
The answer was a simple one : he had to learn how to tell a story .
He had to make the people listening want to care and get involved .
Facts and logic are never enough in a situation like this because people have to connect .
It may seem ridiculous that the care of a vulnerable person comes down to a skill akin to being a big hit at parties , at least in what we think is a rational world .
Yet that is exactly what people have to do in order to speak with a clear voice above the noise of all the many problems of the world .
The simple skill of telling a story is at the root of what we might call a common culture .
Without a common framework for telling stories and making easy connections , many small problems start to fester into bigger ones .
We ca n’t run our world with the kind of mechanical precision that we expect from a society of experts for the simple reason that they ca n’t expect everything that might be a problem to cross their radar .
When stories are left untold , problems are left unsolved .
Those that are told have to compete with so many stories out there coming from people that might be easily misunderstood .
How can anyone make sense of all of them ?
That is why the basic human need to make connections on a personal level means that storytelling is essential to everything that we might call our “ standard of living ” .
We live in a time when storytelling itself has often been left to “ experts ” of one variety or another .
Entertainment comes to us from large corporations who have movies , books , or perhaps important “ infotainment ” that they carefully package up to sell to us .
Smaller stories have to be made into larger parables before they can be delivered into this stream , their meanings often twisted or aggrandized in strange ways that might miss the real point .
If the stories come from a very different life than the passive viewers are used to , the simple act of setting the stage to make a connection might drown the story in details .
Common culture , a shorthand that has to be at the root of any useful soundbite , is always the first victim .
The situation is never hopeless , of course .
The internet has made it possible for people to tell their stories to audiences that they may not have had access to otherwise .
The stories still have to cross lines of sub-culture and roll on top of a lot of noise , but they can make it .
What is critical to getting this done is skill , the simple art of telling a story .
It ’s not that different than what might pass between strangers in a bar , what was done around a campfire in ancient times , or what might sum up a life in a good eulogy .
But it is a skill that we all have to learn if we are going to make this thing we call the internet into a useful antidote to the bizarre cult of celebrity that media megalomania has created .
It is the first step in creating a common culture with a quick shorthand for delivering stories .
These make connections that allow an otherwise specialized world to run properly .
That is what my internet writing guide is all about .
I hope that I have generated a few tools that will help people be better storytellers .
What is less important is the work itself , the body of “ expert opinion ” , than the sparks of discussion that it might generate .
Have I crafted the last word in how to tell a story on the internet ?
I sincerely doubt it .
What I want to give people is not only the tools that might make them better storytellers , I want them to understand that they can and probably have to learn how to tell their stories well .
If my guide gets that process started , it is successful .
How important is it to tell a story well ?
What skills might I have left out ?
I ’d love to know what you think because that is the point of any of this .
I know of at least one person who found the need very important , but I ’m sure you have many other examples .
Please , tell me your stories .
I hate to say this guy is a mess , but ... this guy is kind of a mess .
It 's easy to blame the economy .
It 's easy to alibi and give him the benefit of the doubt , but this week 's announcement that Gillett Jr. and Hicks would be selling Liverpool FC makes ALL three of his sports franchises currently involved in a change of ownership .
Pardon the somewhat dim witted , knee - jerk analysis on my part , but how many other professional sports franchise owners are scraping pennies together to pay the banks ?
( More than we know , sure ...)
But how many are sitting on their proverbial lawn chairs watching a veritable garage sale of sports enterprises like Tom Hicks ?
Not many .
Some of us find ourselves asking the question : Why ?
And more specifically :
Why us ?
An answer wo n't be given , so in the mean time , fans of the Rangers , the Stars and now Liverpool will simply have to content themselves with the knowledge that the man will soon be gone from our beloved teams , all of professional sports , and more importantly : our payrolls , forever .
( If we 're lucky . )
I do n't know if it 's especially fair that 14 years of Tom Hicks ownership ( producing a Stanley Cup and a bevy of Division titles ) will be remembered only for it 's botched ending , but frankly I 've gone from defending the man to just wanting it to be over .
( Tomorrow , if at all possible )
There 's an old saying that " the squeaky wheel gets the oil . "
So it should come as no surprise that Hicks has given more quotes about Liverpool fans in less than 3 years than he has about us in nearly 15 years as owner of the Dallas Stars .
He recently told one new outlet , " When you feel fans turn against you it 's very frustrating " regarding Liverpool FC fans .
Hey , Tom .
What about us ?
We 're turning against you too .
Hello ?
Then again , to our credit , we 're not calling up owners and threatening them in the middle of the night , so it 's hard to compete for attention with stuff like that .
Gary Jacobson had a great article in the Dallas Morning News about Hicks last week , and said this :
Hicks bought the Stars for $ 84 million in 1996 and the Rangers for $ 250 million in 1998 .
Business was n't always good .
In 2002 , for example , the Rangers lost $ 45 million and the Stars lost $ 3 million , largely because of higher player payrolls , The News reported earlier . [ ]... his problems are similar to those of other owners whose income depends on making deals in other businesses .
When the deals slow or stop , as they have in this economic downturn , so does the income .
The question then becomes , no matter how rich , can an owner afford to keep supporting his teams from his own pocket ?
Hicks decided early last year that he could n't , and Hicks Sports Group stopped making interest - only payments on $ 525 million in loans for the Rangers and Stars .
Hicks said he personally made some of the payments .
" In these times , I 'm not willing to do that anymore , " he said a year ago .
Which suggests that as far back as 2002 , Hicks was eating losses for his sports teams but supporting them anyway because the rest of his private investments were thriving at least enough to cover the losses .
Now everything is in the toilet and as a result , we have the lowest paid defense in the league .
So do you take the " that 's not my problem " approach to this , or can you at least appreciate the effort and the winning that came with it for so many years , barring the last two ?
" I 've been in private equity for over 30 years , and I believe that Liverpool will prove to be one of the most profitable investments I ever made , " Hicks said Friday to The Dallas Morning News .
Were I a Liverpool FC fan , I would be feeling pretty used by Hicks .
He and Gillett made promises about a stadium and putting " star players " on the field that they did not deliver on , and now they exit having increased the clubs debt , with what will likely be a substantial profit .
Yet as a Stars fan , there 's a little voice deep down inside somewhere telling me that I should look at the bigger picture when trying to put his ownership stint into perspective .
At least for the time being , that little voice can shut up .
Watching the drama of the NHL playoffs unfold without Dallas participation is making me a bit short sighted and ungrateful to you , Mr. Hicks , no matter how unfair it may be .
Please , very kindly , sell this team and be done with it .
How will you look back on Hicks ' time in Dallas when it 's all said and done ?
Twitter astronaut is first to post stunning YouTube videos direct from SPACE
Astronaut Soichi Noguchi has already made his name as a prolific Twitterer , who delights his 125,000 followers with live pictures from the International Space Station .
Now the Japanese engineer has gone one better , posting stunning footage of Earth and the Moon on his own YouTube channel .
This morning he posted a two - minute video of the Earth filmed from the window of the new observation deck on the orbiter .
' Welcome to the journey over Madagascar !
Enjoy the out - of - the - world view , ' he wrote .
The outline of the world 's fourth largest island is clearly visible under patchy cloud , as the space station zooms at 17,500MPH over head .
A week ago he unveiled a beautiful one minute clip showing the Moon slowly setting into the horizon .
The 44 - year - old has been orbiting 200 miles above our planet since December 2009 and is due to come back this June .
His last ISS mission was in 2005 .
[ caption ]
Mr Noguchi was taking advantage of the Italian - made cupola installed on the new Tranquility module last month .
The £ 17 million observation deck has one central window and six outer windows , which give panoramic views .
It is used by crew members to operate the robotic arms on the station as well as monitor the approach of supply ships .
Major construction on the £ 60 billion orbital outpost is complete and Nasa has only four more shuttle missions planned to ferry spare parts and supplies to the station , a project of 16 nations that has been under construction since 1998 .
Mr Noguchi is the only astronaut on YouTube and is by far the most active of the ISS crew on Twitter , posting in both English and Japanese .
Today he said the crew have a rest day ' except for a few medical ops and our favorite exercise time . '
The micro-blogging service seems particularly suited to the busy astronauts , who can use it to describe their daily routines in just 140 characters .
The first live Twitter post was sent by astronaut Timothy Creamer on January 25th , after the space station finally went online this year .

As Greece has tottered on the brink of fiscal chaos , threatening to drag much of Europe down with it , Wall Street ’s role in the fiasco has drawn well - deserved scorn .
First came the news that Greece had entered into derivatives transactions with Goldman Sachs and other banks to hide its public debt .
Then came reports that some of those same banks and various hedge funds were using credit default swaps  the type of derivative that kneecapped the American International Group  to bet on the likelihood of a Greek default and using derivatives to wager on a drop in the euro .
European leaders have called for an inquiry into the Greek crisis .
Ben Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , has told Congress that the Fed is “ looking into ” Wall Street ’s deals with Greece , and the Justice Department is investigating the euro bets .
That is better than turning a blind eye , but it is not nearly enough .
The bigger problem is in America , where markets are supposed to be fair and transparent .
These particular  and particularly complicated  instruments are traded privately among banks , their clients and other investors with virtually no regulation or oversight .
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , taunting the United States for trying to halt Iran ’s nuclear program , showcased an improved centrifuge on Friday which officials said would enrich uranium faster than existing models .

U.S. President Barack Obama , who is seeking tougher U.N. sanctions against Tehran , acknowledged that such measures would not necessarily work , but said sustained world pressure could prompt Iran to revise its nuclear calculations over time .
Ahmadinejad , in a speech to mark Iran ’s annual nuclear day , called the nuclear arms reduction treaty that Obama signed with Russia this week “ a masquerade ” which hid his true intentions .
“ We consider nuclear weapons to be against humanity , ” he said .
“ Iran ’s nuclear path is irreversible .
The Iranian nation has reached a new point where no power can deter it from moving full speed ahead to reach peaceful nuclear energy , ” he said at a ceremony where he unveiled the centrifuge model from behind a white curtain .
Western nations fear Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons but Tehran says its program is entirely peaceful .
In Washington , State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Iran ’s latest “ chest thumping ” about its nuclear capabilities could strengthen the push for U.N. sanctions .
He said a peaceful nuclear program would have no need for faster centrifuges .
“ We have to conclude that Iran has nefarious intentions with its nuclear program and that ’s expressly why we continue to work with the international community on additional measures , sanctions , to show Iran that there is a consequence for its failure to meet its obligations , ” he said .
PUSH FOR SANCTIONS
The head of Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organization , Ali Akbar Salehi , said the latest “ third generation ” centrifuges had a separation power of 10 , six times that of the first generation .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
But it was not clear when the new machines would be introduced into full - scale enrichment .
“ In the near future we will be ready to inject gas into this ( third generation ) centrifuge , ” Salehi told Iranian state TV .
The centrifuges Iran uses now are adapted from a 1970s design and have been prone to breakdowns .
Tehran has been testing new models for several years at a site which is under the watch of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
“ This is not unexpected and given what Obama is doing , I think they are really trying to show that they are getting past the sanctions , ” said David Albright , director of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington .
“ The real issue is , are they able to build these in the thousands or ... in the tens , and when are they going to be installed ?
The other question is , do they work well ? ”
Western analysts say Iran has exaggerated progress in the past to bolster domestic pride about its nuclear program and to improve its bargaining position with major powers .
Diplomats close to the IAEA said it was unclear why Iran had not chosen to reveal a more significant advance , and questioned whether it was having technical problems or being cautious due to the current spotlight on the nuclear program .
Western countries are seeking the support of Russia and China for a fourth round of U.N. sanctions against Tehran .
Obama , who hosts a nuclear security summit next week , wants them to back further measures to deter Iran from pursuing what the West believes is a covert drive to develop nuclear weapons .
Obama said there was no guarantee the sanctions that could be instituted now would automatically alter Iranian behavior .
He hailed what he called an “ enormous shift ” by Russia in efforts to get all countries , notably Iran and North Korea , to “ start abiding by certain rules of the road . ”
Russia , along with China , has long resisted calls for tougher sanctions on Iran but now chides Tehran for ignoring offers made by world powers aimed at defusing the nuclear issue .
“ I ’m not questioning your expertise , ” Paul cautiously said to the Certified DBA , “ it ’s just that I ’m just not used to requests with … this level of detail . ”
Paul should have done what he was asked , exactly how he was asked to do it .
After all , he was not an expert but just a lowly systems administrator .
Fortunately , the Certified DBA made sure to keep him in his place .
“ I would expect not , ” smirked the Certified DBA , “ system administrators generally do n’t know how to tune for database performance , so I have to be very specific on the server configuration . ”
The “ configuration ” that the Certified DBA was referring to was a rather complex set - up of disk partitions and RAID .
Per his request , the server Paul was to set up should have six disks , each with ten partitions set - up .
Corresponding partitions on disks 1 , 3 , and 5 were to be concatenated ( not striped ) to each other via RAID , while the partitions on disks 2 , 4 , and 6 served as mirrors of their corresponding partitions on disks 1 , 2 , and 5 .
All of these partitions were then to be mounted as directories ( / p1 , / p2 , etc ) in the file system .
“ Fair enough , ” Paul acquiesced , “ but I ’d like to understand why this helps with database tuning .
I mean , would n’t this just create slower reads and writes ?
I just do n’t see how it helps perfor — ”
“ I ’ve been doing this for fifteen years and it ’s not like you can understand database tuning overnight . ”
The Certified DBA was getting aggravated .
“ The long and the short of it is : the partitions allow me to place datafiles on different physical parts of the disk .
The outer edge of the disk is the fastest , so I put indexes in partition 1 .
Large binary data goes on partition 10 .
And so on . ”
Paul was n’t convinced , and still could n’t imagine how this would improve performance , especially since a query that touched several tables would require reading several partitions from disk .
But as the lowly system administrator , he did as he was told and set - up the sixty partitions and then configured them with the RAID tool .
The application launched a couple months later and , shortly thereafter , ran into performance problems .
The Certified DBA was not surprised , especially after learning that the drives Paul ordered were only 7,200 RPM .
“ It ’s just common sense , ” he scolded Paul , “ go with 10,000 RPM !
Why would you even bother with 7,200 in anything you do ?
I ’m not a system admin , and I know that . ”
Doing exactly as he was told , Paul ordered another batch of drives – this time 10,000 RPM –and configured them in an “ even more performant configuration . ”
Instead of utilizing the entire disk , only the top 25 % of disk space was to be used .
According to the Certified DBA , the bottom 75 % – located beyond the “ outer rings ” – was far too slow , and needed to be abandoned .
It took an exorbitant amount of time to configure , and it still did n’t work .
The application ran awfully slow , and disk I/O was through the roof .
Worse , as a result of the smaller drives and 25 % usage requirement , the available disk space was quickly filling up .
The Certified DBA offered yet another idea : stagger the partitions such that partition 1 starts on disk 1 , partition 2 starts on disk 3 , and so on .
And , of course , buy more 10,000 RPM drives .
In theory , it should drastically help alleviate the high I/O , since it would “ randomize ” where data were being stored or retrieved .
Paul , being the lowly system administrator , was not in a position to argue with the Certified DBA , and had little choice but to do what he was told .
But instead of doing just that , Paul decided to try something different .
While the Certified DBA was on vacation , Paul took a pair of the 10,000 RPM drives , mirrored them , and then set - up a series of directories ( / p1 , / p2 ) on the file system .
When the system was brought back online – using a single drive and a single partition – the I/O reads went down by a couple orders of magnitude .
The overall application performance improved dramatically , and the users were appreciative .
But there was one thing , however , that was missing : approval by the Certified DBA .
Undoubtedly , he’d be upset that his instructions were n’t followed , and accuse the lowly sysadmin of subterfuge and insubordination .
With the Certified DBA returning the following day , Paul was desperate and changed the “ df ” command such that it executed a shell script that looked identical to the real df command : it listed ten partitions , each mounted in / p1 , / p2 , and so on .
And the shell script worked .
In fact , it worked so well that the Certified DBA took a screenshot of it and used it in an article he wrote about database “ tuning ” for a trade magazine .
And , being the nice guy that he was , the Certified DBA gave Paul a signed copy of that issue .
Though the Certified DBA is long gone , Paul still keeps the signed magazine hanging in his office .
It ’s taught him more about database tuning than he ever could have hoped for .
The detail of modern science is incomprehensible to almost everyone , which means that we have to take what scientists say on trust .
My heart rebels against this project : I would rather be pelting scientists with eggs than trying to understand their datasets .
In The Guardian 's Comment is Free section there 's an article by George Monbiot called
The trouble with trusting complex science which argues that :
He does this in the context of climate change science .
I wonder if he actually tried to read the key paper that describes why we know that the global temperature is increasing .
The paper is Uncertainty estimates in regional and global observed temperature changes : a new dataset from 1850 .
Go on , read it .
I dare you .
The critical thing you need to be able to understand to understand that paper is ... how to calculate an average .
That 's a GCSE level maths subject ; here 's a quick page to revise that in case you 've forgotten how to average .
Because , you see , the entire process described in that paper involves the following steps : 1 . Get temperature data ( i.e. thermometer readings ) at different places around the world for many , many years2 .
Work out the average temperature at each location by averaging the values between 1961 and 1990 on a monthly basis .
So you end up knowing things like the average January temperature at Heathrow .3 .
Now go back and work out how much the temperature for any given month and year deviates from the average : all that means is subtract the average temperature from the observed temperature for the same month .
Now you know how ' different ' the temperature is .
This is called the anomaly .
If it 's getting hotter the anomalies will get bigger .
4 .
Divide the globe up into squares 5 degrees on each side .
Find all the thermometers inside each square , find their anomalies for each month and year .
Average them to get an average anomaly for that square .
5 .
Take all the squares in the northern hemisphere , average their anomalies for each month and year .
Draw a graph showing the temperature changing .
Repeat the for southern hemisphere .
6 .
Now take the northern and southern hemisphere temperatures for each month and year and average them to get a global temperature anomaly chart .
Child 's play ?
Yes .
I 'll admit that the rest of the paper has some harder concepts ( standard deviation , anyone ? ) .
But I 'll wager that the real reason that people do n't understand science is not because it's too hard to understand , but because they are n't motivated .
Yes , there are parts of science that require a lot of knowledge , but covering your eyes and not trying to understand is likely where many people go wrong .
Or to put it Monbiot 's way :

Thirty - one acres in extent , Tell Zeidan is situated where the Balikh River joins the Euphrates River in modern - day Syria .
The location was at the crossroads of major trade routes across ancient Mesopotamia that followed the course of the Euphrates River valley .
Stein said Tell Zeidan may have been one of the largest Ubaid temple towns in northern Mesopotamia , and that it was as large or larger than any previously known contemporary Ubaid towns in the southern alluvial lowlands of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is today southern Iraq .
However , because the site was not occupied after about 4,000 B.C. , the prehistoric strata of Tell Zeidan are immediately accessible beneath the modern - day ground surface instead of being buried beneath layers of deposits from later periods .
" This means that , for the first time , archaeologists can excavate broad areas of an Ubaid temple town to understand how a proto- urban community actually functioned in the sixth - fifth millennia B.C. , " Stein said .
The new excavations Tell Zeidan reveal the emergence of an elite that possessed the political power necessary for communities to move from self - sufficient village life to societies dependent on trade and capable of acquiring luxury goods , Stein said .
Stein , a noted archaeologist who is a specialist on the Ubaid culture , began excavating the site in 2008 and returned in 2009 .
He is the American co-director of the Joint Syrian - American Archaeological Research Project at Tell Zeidan , and Muhammad Sarhan from the Raqqa Museum in the nearby provincial capital of Raqqa is the Syrian co-director .
" The two - millennium - long occupation spans four key periods : two phases of the late Copper Age on top , the Ubaid period in the middle and the Halaf period at the bottom , " Stein said .
The excavations so far show that the transitions between these periods were peaceful , including the period in which the influence of the Ubaid culture spread from its south Mesopotamian homeland up the Euphrates River into north Syria .
" One of our most remarkable finds was a stone stamp seal depicting a deer .
The seal was unusually large , about two inches by two - and - a - half inches , " Stein said .
The seal was carved from a red stone not native to the area , but was similar in design to a seal found 185 miles to the east near Mosul in northern Iraq .
" The existence of very elaborate seals with near - identical motives at such widely distant sites suggests that in this period , high - ranking elites were assuming leadership positions across a very broad region , and those dispersed elites shared a common set of symbols and perhaps even a common ideology of superior social status , " he said .
The seals were used as stamps to indicate possession of goods in the period before writing .
The team found obsidian blades and chips wasted during the production of the blades .
The high - quality volcanic glass had to be brought to the community from sources 250 miles away in what is now Turkey .
The greenish - black color and chemical composition show that it came from mines in the eastern part of the country .
The people in Tell Zeidan also had access to copper ore from sources near modern - day Diyarbakir , Turkey , about 185 to 250 miles away .
Those materials were smelted at Tell Zeidan to produce metal tools that represent the most advanced technology of the fifth millennium B.C. People must have transported the material on their backs , however , as Tell Zeidan flourished at a time before donkeys were domesticated .
The wealth of the community came from irrigation - based agriculture , trade and manufacturing .
" We found flint sickle blades everywhere , easily recognizable from the glossy sheen where they had been polished by the silica in the stems of the wheat that they were used to harvest , " Stein said .
The people used bitumen , a tar substance obtained from pits 43 miles away , to secure the blades onto handles .
Along with the advanced technology , a wealthy ruling class and individual identification by stamp seals , the people at Tell Zeidan also built large public structures of mud bricks .
###
The Tell Zeidan project was supported by the National Science Foundation .
The open source sociology project ( OSS ) .
This will be the beginning of a growing network of sociology , anthropology students , teachers and thinkers .
The intent is to decentralize academia and the professional circles , and bring the knowledge to everyone .
The " open source " source philosophy is embodied here .
As the world changes and becomes decentralized and " open , " so too should its thinkers , philosophers and social scientists !

2010 USHL Clark Cup Finals Preview - USHL
The opinions expressed in this release are those of the organization issuing it , and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts or opinions of OurSports Central or its staff .
Bob Dylan is " a plagiarist " , Joni Mitchell said in a rare interview this week , offering cranky comments on old Bob and warm memories of Jimi Hendrix .
The legendary singer - songwriter , who has wrestled with health problems , said she may quit music to lobby for recognition of her rare medical condition .
But let 's begin with Dylan .
Mitchell was speaking to the LA Times as part of a joint interview with performance artist John Kelly , who has performed Mitchell 's songs in drag .
The Times interviewer referred to Old Nasal Voice in passing , citing his name - change from Robert Zimmerman to Bob Dylan .
( Mitchell also abandoned her birth name , Roberta Joan Anderson . )
Mitchell launched into an unprovoked assault .
" We are like night and day , he and I , " she scoffed .
" Bob is not authentic at all .
He 's a plagiarist , and his name and voice are fake .
Everything about Bob is a deception . "
Cowed , the interviewer moved on to safer topics – such as Prince ( apparently a Mitchell fan ) and sex appeal .
Yet Mitchell still had time to slag off Grace Slick and Janis Joplin ( allegedly they were " [ sleeping with ] their whole bands and falling down drunk " ) , and Madonna .
Railing against the " stupid , destructive " era we live in , Mitchell took aim at the Material Girl .
" Americans have decided to be stupid and shallow since 1980 .
Madonna is like Nero ; she marks the turning point . "
It was n't all piss and vinegar .
Mitchell fondly recalled Hendrix , " the sweetest guy " , and late - night listening sessions together .
But even this memory is shaded in frustration .
" He made his reputation by setting his guitar on fire , but that eventually became repugnant to him , " she recalled .
" ' I ca n't stand to do that anymore , ' he said , ' but they 've come to expect it .
I 'd like to just stand still like Miles . ' "
If Mitchell seems ornery , it may simply be because she is feeling better .
Last year , the singer announced that she suffers from Morgellons syndrome , a rare skin condition .
It 's a controversial diagnosis – many doctors deny that Morgellons is real , calling it delusional .
" [ It 's a ] weird , incurable disease that seems like it's from outer space , " Mitchell told the Times .
" But my health 's the best it 's been in a while .
Two nights ago , I went out for the first time since 23 December . "
" Garbo and Dietrich hid away just because people became so upset watching them age , but this is worse , " she said .
" Fibres in a variety of colors protrude out of my skin like mushrooms after a rainstorm : they cannot be forensically identified as animal , vegetable or mineral .
Morgellons is a slow , unpredictable killer – a terrorist disease : it will blow up one of your organs , leaving you in bed for a year . "
" In America ... [ doctors ] send you to a psychiatrist , " Mitchell explained .
" I 'm actually trying to get out of the music business to battle for Morgellons sufferers to receive the credibility that 's owed to them . "
Then again , this campaign will need funding .
Perhaps Bob Dylan could record a benefit album ?
The Jerusalem Post
Post
US Senator John Kerry came out loudly in favor of sanctions against Iran ’s energy sector in a press conference in Jerusalem on Monday .
Asked by , John Kerry , the powerful head of the Senate ’s Foreign Relations Committee , said that he “ absolutely ” supports sanctions against Iran ’s energy industry .
“ I believe that the most biting and important sanctions would be those on the energy side , ” Kerry said in a press conference after meeting Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu .
The senator said that there were other sanctions that should be considered , such as financial ones , but he thought that those against the energy sector were “ of particular importance .
”
In the last two weeks , Netanyahu has been continuously calling for sanctions against Iran ’s export and import of oil , saying that anything less would not be effective .
Up until Kerry ’s comments , the prime minister ’s call has not received an echo .
Asked by thewhether he was concerned Israel would take unilateral actions , or whether he relayed that concern to the prime minister , Kerry said that Israel and the US are “ talking from the same page . ” Kerry said that one of the reasons for so much dialogue over the lastfew weeks , including his visit and the upcoming one of Vice PresidentJoe Biden next week , was to ensure that “ we are all on the same page , all clear about what time frames exist or do n’t exist , what threatlevels may be real or not real , or what options may be on the table forus . ” Kerry said that Netanyahu was “ tremendously supportive ” of theinitiatives currently being discussed , and said that the prime ministerwas not “ rash . ”
Charles Cecil 's influence in the games industry as a storyteller is longstanding .
He 's the founder and managing director of UK - based Revolution Software , with credits that includeand thegame series -- two highly admired and acclaimed properties in the adventure game genre .
He 's also just announced that he 's working with the BBC and Sumo Digital on a series of videogame adaptations of the TV series Doctor Who .
Cecil has been making games for 30 years , hugely acclaimed ones for 20 .
He 's clearly confident in his abilities as a designer , and has a lot to be proud of -- but there are times when he sounds as if he can still barely believe he 'sHere , we find out about his relationship with the adventure genre , as well as his newgame series , the opportunities of independent development , and the - based game he revealed , then went silent about , last year .
Charles Cecil : I think that the whole idea of interactive narrative from a creative perspective , from a theoretical perspective , is actually fascinating .
What we are doing is obviously pioneering a totally new form of entertainment , in the way that , if you think of other entertainment media -- television has a lot more to do with film , and obviously books and plays -- we have something quite extraordinary .
And what I find fascinating is that while there are clearly huge opportunities , there are also great constraints .
The opportunities are clear .
Well - written videogames are incredibly compelling .
What I think is quite interesting is that there was a period at one point where it was felt that people from outside the industry could write much better stories than we could , and so scriptwriters were brought in , and actually what everybody failed to realize is that the medium inherently has constraints .
Like the way that we build empathy with characters is much easier , because in a non-linear medium it's all about looking at a character , and building an emotional bond with them -- an empathetic bond -- and then experiencing their emotion through that character .
But clearly if you 're controlling that character , then the relationship is different .
Yes , there is an empathetic bond , but it 's also much more associational .
And that 's why , certainly in our infancy as an industry , there 's this sort of emphasis on licensed characters , because the great thing about a licensed character is you immediately inherit all the empathy that the character built in whatever medium it 's come from .
But the thing that 's quite interesting -- and this is what I try to play around with quite a lot -- is in a film , or in any linear medium , you would have a disconnect between the information given to the audience , and the protagonist , so you create tension .
The example I rather like is that , in a slasher move , you know the slasher is sitting behind the tree waiting for the teenage girls who are skipping along .
They 're wandering around , they 're thrilled because they 're going about , y'know , whatever they 're doing , and there 's an incredible tension created in the audience because you know that there 's something waiting for them , even if you do n't quite know what .
In a game , obviously , you can't quite do that to the same extent , and so I think it 's fascinating how you create the disconnect , and I think it 's important to create that disconnect , because it allows a certain level of tension .
Slightly more than rebooted ... has considerable additional content ...
Oh , I think if you actually play it on the DS and on the iPhone , the tactility of it is absolutely wonderful .
What we decided was that the point - and - click was n't broken , so why change it ?
So fundamentally , a lot of it is very similar .
But the ability to actually feel the screen and to play the game through the tactility of touching the screen with your finger or with the stylus -- I think it adds a lot .
I think it 's very exciting , and I had absolutely no idea it would work as well as I feel it has done .
Part of the reason , of course , is that we were very happy and very prepared to just throw everything out and start again with the interface .
And , universally , people have said that the interface we 've come up with is infinitely better than the one thatdid .
And , I mean , I think that 's a fact .
It is .
And it 's interesting , becausewas very ambitious , and very , very good , and I love what they 've done with the art .
But clearly that was a group of people who were probably scared to make brave decisions .
They were happy to commission vast amounts of art so you could see what went before and what went now , but sometimes you just need somebody who 's gonna sit there and say , " well , actually , it does n't work very well , so let 's throw it out and start again .
" And I think if you look at companies like LucasArts , who I admire enormously , their attitude towards fans who wanted to do tributes tois very , very different to the way that we handle it .
But again , it 's because ultimately we are a very small group , and we make a decision , and I think probably time will prove that we were right to be very relaxed in the way that we allowed people to create products as long as they did n't commercially exploit them -- and that 's a line that I 've been very clear that can not be crossed .
But beyond that , we see it as very flattering .--
I mean , great !
I really admire the guys that did that .
We provided them some sprites and stuff , but the rest of it they did absolutely by themselves .
Oh , yes , it does .
Look at something like , which is very simplistic , but it 's much easier to play .
I think point - and - click in the old sense ...
I have to say , I think point - and - click on iPhone actually works really , really well .
But what I was quite pleased about is that one of the criticisms people made of theis that the new material felt very contemporary but the old material felt a little bit old - school .
A couple of people said that , and I was thrilled , because it means that , actually , according to these people , we 've successfully reinvented the point - and - click to feel contemporary .
But I think as an interface it 's perfectly relevant .
I think obviously what people expect is different .
Inwe had more close - up screens and more mini-games , and of course they were absolutely relevant to the gameplay , and I think they improved the overall feel of it .
Part of what our next game is going to be is a partnership with [ Watchmen co-creator andartist ]
Dave Gibbons , so it 'll be very comic book orientated .
And I think there 's a lot you can do with comic books as well , particularly if you want to keep your memory footprint quite small so you can download stuff through Wi -Fi or mobile .
No , no ... Absolutely nothing to do with that .
Yeah , I know , I need to get back on it .
The reason I have n't done anything is that , over the last year , we finishedon DS and Wii , we 've doneon iPhone , we 've doneon iPhone , I consulted to Disney on a really nice little game based on A Christmas Carol , and obviously I 've been working with the BBC on .
So there just has n't been time to do anything else .
And I 'm a great fan of One Big Game [ the charitable publisher responsible for Chime , and also involved in this project ] , and I started down that road , and then everything went crazy , and everything 's still crazy .
I will - at some point very soon - return to it .
I think it 's a great idea , and I 'm really excited by it , but I just have n't had a moment spare , not one moment , as you can imagine .
I mean , that 's a lot of stuff going on , a lot of it in parallel .
Yes -- except that , actually , we 've been working on that for a year .
Over a year .
So , you know , we 're a long way down the road on that .
I 've got a few more months on that , but in the grand scheme of things we 're definitely towards the end of that project .
Yes , I will do .
I 'll have to be a little bit careful .
I was approached by the BBC just over a year ago , and they were keen to reach an area of the audience - particularly males , younger males - who were not watching so much television .
They feel that it 's absolutely vital that they continue as the BBC to communicate with them .
Their remit is to educate , to entertain and to inform .
And we came up with this idea - well , it was their desire to do a Doctor Who game - for an adventure game that was every bit of the top quality - I mean , it looks superb - that was highly accessible - so it had a simple interface - and that was true to the brand , in that you know the Doctor would n't go around shooting things , you know .
We 've been very , very sympathetic to the brand 's values , because obviously it 's a very powerful brand and very important to the BBC .
That 's probably all I should reveal .
Otherwise I 'll get shot .
Yes , definitely .
Well , what I find exciting is that , like it was in the early 80s , you can have one boy or girl or two people sitting in a bedroom , and they can come up with something that really is amazing , and that they have passion about , and that could be hugely successful .
We were getting to the stage where the barrier to entry and the risks were so high that , ultimately , there was no indie scene .
Now there 's a thriving indie scene , and it can only grow .
I 've been working now on games for 30 years , and so I guess I 'm seen as a safe pair of hands .
Now , a 16 , 17 , 18 - year - old with passion and talent can blow everything apart and come up with something amazing , and I think that 's very refreshing , and I think it 's great for the business .
RASICAM : The Little Infrared Camera that Could
Perched on a peak high in the Chilean Andes , 2200 meters above sea level , the Cerro Tololo Inter - American Observatory has an enviable view of the night sky .
In 2011 , the Dark Energy Survey collaboration will install the largest digital camera ever built inside the Cerro Tololo dome to gaze deep into the universe .
And sitting nearby , gazing at something a little closer to earth , will be the SLAC - built Radiometric All Sky Infrared Camera , or RASICAM .
With its 500 megapixels , the Fermilab - led DES camera , or DECam , will search the sky for evidence of dark energy , the mysterious force that seems to accelerate the expansion of the universe .
To succeed in revealing the fundamentals of this dark 74 percent piece of the universe , the collaboration will need not only an extremely sensitive camera , advanced optics and a data acquisition system that can take a new photo every 17 seconds , but also a clear view of the night sky .
This is where RASICAM fits in .
" DECam dwarfs RASICAM .
But RASICAM plays an important role in DES observations , " said SLAC Professor Rafe Schindler .
" By instantaneously mapping high cloud distributions and contrails of airplanes at night , RASICAM will tell DECam if the atmospheric conditions in a particular direction are suitable for observing .
Astronomers refer to this as ‘ seeing . ' "
RASICAM , which is being built at SLAC , will spend its nights searching for high - altitude cirrus clouds , the thin wispy clouds that are oftentimes a precursor to stormy weather .
In addition , it will be on the lookout for contrails from airplanes that can drift into the field of view of the main camera .
" These are a major irritant for astronomers , " said Associate Engineer Howard Rogers , who is responsible for the mechanical design , fabrication , and installation of the RASICAM .
To see clouds 40,000 feet in the air even on the darkest nights , RASICAM will view the sky not in visible light but in infrared — essentially , heat .
The water droplets in clouds and contrails emit infrared radiation , causing them to glow against the cooler background sky in RASICAM 's infrared photos .
Many observatories already use such infrared cameras to determine which nights are clear enough for observations .
The SLAC - designed model , however , incorporates several new and innovative design components .
Unlike previous infrared cameras , which determine only whether there are clouds in the sky , RASICAM 's state - of - the - art camera can determine the absolute temperature measured in each of its 76,800 pixels , and thus can create a detailed digital picture of where it 's cloudy and where it 's not .
The unique curvature of the RASICAM gold - plated mirrors , which reflect infrared light into the camera , also ensures that an object will appear the same temperature no matter where in the sky it is .
" As far as we know , this is the first such camera in which the horizon does n't appear hotter than the rest , " said Stanford graduate student Peter Lewis , who designed the camera 's optics , including the mirror 's unique curvature .
Lewis also modeled the system optically and is now writing the control and user - interface software .
When the system is operational , anyone will be able to view the images of the Cerro Tololo sky in real - time , over the web .
RASICAM is also physically burlier than previous such cameras for a rather unexpected reason .
" Midway through this project , we were told that Andean Condors [ the largest flying land bird in the Western Hemisphere ] are not uncommon in the region , and that these 30 pound birds might perch on our camera , " Rogers said .
" That 's a rather unique design parameter , " Lewis added .
As a result , the design now calls for supporting struts made of stainless steel and spikes on the top of the structure to deter condors from resting there .
These new design elements — both the expected and the unexpected — will allow for the best cloud measurements possible over RASICAM 's nearly all - sky field of view , keeping DECam operators up - to - date on clouds already in their way and those that will likely float through in the near future .
RASICAM will take about 60 digital photos per second , add them together and refresh an image on the DECam operator 's screen every 30 seconds .
Right now , the RASICAM components sit disassembled in SLAC 's Central Laboratory .
In the coming months , Rogers will draw on his experience building experimental aircraft to piece the instrument together and build a composite weather enclosure to protect the camera during the daytime and in bad weather .
Rogers , Schindler and Lewis will then fly to Chile this August to install RASICAM at Cerro Tololo .
Researchers plan to mount DECam onto the newly refurbished Cerro Tololo BLANCO telescope mid next year , and start up the camera before the end of 2011 .
Beginning in 2011 DECam and RASICAM will work together to shed light on dark energy .
" Pretty much every astronomical observatory needs an instrument like this , " said Lewis .
" We hope future observatories can use the RASICAM design for a lot more performance and , because we worked on a shoe - string budget , for less money . "
With UC Santa Cruz , SLAC joined the DES collaboration in March 2009 .

Let ’s begin with the definition of a speedrun first .
A speedrun is a play - through , or recording thereof , of a video game performed with the intent of completing it as quickly as possible , optionally under certain prerequisites , mainly for the purposes of entertainment and competition .
Wikipedia
Throughout my 25 + years of gaming I have tried a number of speedruns , but have succeeded in exactly zero of them .
To accomplish a speedrun not only do you need patience and a thorough understanding of the game ’s mechanics , but you also need a bit of memorization and actually be GOOD at video games .
Now we are all good at games , but this kind of good is taking things to a whole new level as you will soon see .
The NES era of games is a great test area for speedruns because many of the games were short platformers .
Okay they were n’t short when I played them , but these players make quick work of each game .
While you may be taking a ten minute break to plant your crops in Farmville , some person is zipping through Batman with ease .
Many of these runs are done with emulators so that they could be recorded .
In no way should this take away the achievements that each of these players have accomplished .
1. Contra
There are a number of reasons why I would n’t be able to pull this one off and of course the first revolves around not being able to use the Konami code .
The second means I would have to beat the game in single player mode .
I do n’t think I ever tried , but I am pretty sure I never even came close in beating the game without the aid of a partner .
I tend to think that the game was easy only because I had 30 lives and another person had 30 also , but I definitely died more than three times during my runs so the game was n’t as easy as I remember it to be .
I ’m not sure if this run is done on memorization or instinct , but the player in it is good .
Damn good .
2. Batman
One of my favorite NES games of all time .
It was challenging , but not to the point you wanted to throw the controller at the screen .
I actually beat this game and I remember feeling like the greatest video game pimp in the whole wide world .
Unfortunately this player makes me feel like I should go back to lincoln logs and leave the real gaming to the pros .
I did n’t even know you could hit an enemy and just run right through them while they were flashing .
I probably took at least 5 x as long to beat the game as this guy .
As I mentioned , the game was challenging so I could never pull this off because I was guaranteed a couple of deaths from time to time .
My jumping was n’t as accurate as I would have liked it to be .
He must ’ve been the true Batman .
3. X- Men
This game was crap .
It was easily one of the worst games on the NES and if you know the NES games catalog you know that means a lot .
It hurt even more that the X - Men were my favorite superheroes and there was a time where I would do anything to make enough money to buy the new comic book editions that came out each month .
The fact that this person was able to even get through the game without smashing his head through the TV is nothing short of amazing and reason # 1 why I would never have been able to finish the game .
The fact the this person does n’t even switch toons in midlevel is another amazing feat .
If you watch the video you will see that it ’s almost impossible to even tell what is going on and you are n’t even playing it .
Man this game blew .
4. Marble Madness
This game was hard enough to control with a trackball , it was even more difficult to control with the rigid NES gamepad .
The run shown above unfortunately is n’t the NES run , which does n’t let you embed , but it is the exact same game .
I first played this game on my Grandmother ’s Amiga computer and do n’t remember how far I got , but I definitely never beat it .
Each level took me forever because I felt you had to be super precise when apparently you could just fly through corners if you wanted to .
I ’ll have to keep this in mind next time I decide to give the game a shot .
Of course I will need to put down Plants vs. Zombies first .
Hm , maybe Marble Madness would be a good iPhone game .
Someone get on it .
5. Mega Man 2
My second favorite NES game of all time .
It might be weird calling this a speedrun considering the video is over 39 minutes long , but if you played the game then you know there are just delays in it that you ca n’t speed through .
There are definitely two specific parts in this game that would trip me up .
I did beat the game , however these two parts always took me a couple tries .
The first one is the Quick Man stage , the second level the player in the video runs through .
The second one is the Dragon in Dr. Wily ’s castle .
Of course I would die many more times in other parts , but I know if I had a perfect run going , those two parts would be my downfall .
Instead of Marble Madness give me Mega Man on my iPod Touch .
6. Super Mario Bros. 2
Of course I am referring to the American version of Super Mario Bros .
2 . The only reason I would n’t be able to accomplish the speed run as this player has done is because he uses Luigi and makes him look godly .
Seriously , has Luigi ever looked so good before ?
Then he moves to Toad and you would think he was Arnie in Predator .
Excuse me while I just run through everyone to the end of the board .
Although this game was fun it was my least favorite of the trilogy .
Super Mario Bros. 3 being my all - time favorite and the original just being a classic .
I guess I did n’t like stopping to pick up some radish to throw at some weird looking bird hopping my way .
Stupid enough we had to kill Bowser each level in the original , now you give us Birdo to throw eggs at every 30 seconds ?
I pass .
7. Super Mario Bros .
This run just leaves me speechless .
The amount of close calls and exploits performed by this player go to show I would never even come close to perfecting a run like this .
Every jump is well - timed and executed to perfection .
Rarely do you see the player do a full jump and apparently there is no need when you can just hop and skip over every bad guy .
Some claim that this was run using cheats , but I can see it happening like this due to it being one of the first Nintendo games around so glitches are bound to be part of it .
8. Double Dragon 1 , 2 & 3
You read that right .
This is a speed run of all three games run back to back .
Solo .
No restarts .
Under an hour including endings .
I should n’t even have to explain why I would n’t be able to pull this one off , but I know I never beat any of these games without a partner .
Maybe I just like playing video games with others or maybe I was n’t as skilled a gamer as I thought as a 10 year old .
There you have it , my top 8 ( +2 ) speedruns of games from the NES era .
Did you ever try a speedrun and succeed ?
Preamble : Goldman Sachs has kindly taken time out of its busy schedule of shorting the collateralised credit future obligations markets to appear before the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations today and answer one or two questions .
According to pre-released testimony , the head of Goldman Sachs , Lloyd Blankfein , will admit that his bank failed to raise the alarm about excesses in the mortgage industry and got involved in " overly complex " derivatives deals that fuelled perceptions of Wall Street running out of control .
Blankfein will tell the committee that the Securities and Exchange Commission 's $ 1bn ( £ 647 m ) fraud case against his firm marks a low point in his career .
" It was one of the worst days of my professional life , as I know it was for every person at our firm , " Blankfein says .
But there could be lower points to come for Blankfein .
According to today 's New York Times , Goldman Sachs devised " a series of complex deals to profit from the collapse of the home mortgage market " , which goes beyond the one deal that the SEC has picked out .
( For background have a look here and here on the SEC 's case . )
And my colleague Andrew Clark had a brief but exciting close encounter with Blankfein recently , which is well worth reading .
( I 'll also be living tweeting events as they occur on Twitter : @ RichardA - which will be much the same as this live - blog but shorter . )
9.50 am : As we await Blankfein 's arrival and the start of proceedings , a brief round - up of what to expect according to the US media .
According to the New York Times :
The legal storm buffeting Goldman Sachs continued to rage Tuesday just ahead of what is expected to be a contentious Senate hearing at which bank executives plan to defend their actions during the housing crisis .
Yves Smith of the naked capitalism blog has some analysis worth reading :
As Goldman and the Senate Committee on Investigations are duking out The Battle of the E - Mails , with each side claiming the other has painted a misleading picture , it is becoming pretty clear that Goldman , contrary to its sanctimonious twattle about putting clients first , actually puts its fees first .
Time magazine 's blogger goes mildly insane :
Tell us Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein , were you :
a ) lying to the American public
b ) cheating the American public
c ) stealing from the American public
d ) all of the above
And the Wall Street Journal has a round - up of Goldmans jargon you might be hearing about in the email correspondence that the committee will examine .
Such as : Lemonade : A structured - financial deal Goldman mixed up to make bad loans go down easy on investors .
Used in a sentence , from a Goldman email : " They structured like mad and travelled the world , and worked their tails to make some lemonade from some big old lemons . "
10.00 am : For those of you following this in the US , it 's on C - Span 3 , and not as you might think , C - Span 2 .
Live streaming available for everyone , including outside the US , here .
10.04 am : Carl Levin , the committee chair , is opening proceedings .
An amusing fisking of Blankfein 's prepared testimony is here , from the Zero Hedge blog .
The full text is here but without the nasty asides .
10.15 am : Those of you not familiar with Carl Levin , he is one of the sharper brains in the Senate – and that 's not a back - handed compliment , although it could be .
He 's a top inquisitor who has been doing this for a while and knows all the tricks .
Levin 's open statement is n't pulling any punches : " The firm 's own documents show it was placing large bets against the US mortgage market , " says Levin .
" The firm has denied making those bets , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary . "
The he gets to the nub of the SEC case against Goldman : that Goldmans ' clients had a " reasonable expectation " that the bank would not sell products that it did not want to succeed .
" Those were reasonable expectations , " says Levin .
But were they ?
That 's the $ 1bn question .
Levin is now running through the greatest hits of the financial crisis and mortgage market meltdown and the likes of WAMU , New Century and other names that have come and gone .
10.20 am : Levin is laying into Goldmans and its shorting of the housing market from 2006 onwards .
His argument is that Goldmans was a vulture , swooping in to destroy a market it helped create in the first place , a " bait and switch " if you will :
Goldman says these bets were just a reasonable hedge .
But internal documents show it was more than a reasonable hedge – it was what one top executive described as " the big short . "
Listen to a top Goldman mortgage trader , Michael Swenson , who touted his success in 2007 , what he called his " proudest year " because of what he called " extraordinary profits " – $ 3bn as of September 2007 – that came from bets he recommended the firm take against the housing market .
Mr Swenson told his superiors , " I was able to identify key market dislocations that led to tremendous profits . "
10.30 am : The full text of Senator Levin 's opening " remarks " – if a few verbal punches in the face can be termed " remarks " , that is – is now online here .
But here 's a choice " remark " :
These facts end the pretense that Goldman 's actions were part of its efforts to operate as a mere " market - maker , " bringing buyers and sellers together .
These short positions did n't represent customer service or necessary hedges against risks that Goldman incurred as it made a market for customers .
They represented major bets that the mortgage securities market – a market Goldman helped create – was in for a major decline .
Goldman continues to deny that it shorted the mortgage market for profit , despite the evidence .
Why the denial ?
My best estimate is that it's because the firm , Goldmans , cannot successfully continue to portray itself as working on behalf of its clients if it was selling mortgage related products to those clients while it was betting its own money against those same products or the mortgage market as a whole .
Ouch .
According to Levin , Goldman
Sachs needs to maintain they are honest brokers in order to more efficiently fleece their clients .
Or as Ralph Waldo Emerson put it : " The louder he talked of his honour , the faster we counted our spoons . "
10.45 am : Susan Collins , filling in for Tom Coburn as the ranking Republican member , is next .
Here 's the shorter version : Lots of bad things happened and it all got a bit crazy but financial innovation is important .
But you know , ethics .
Now the rest of the committee gets to make a few sound bites .
Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill gets into the complexity of the investments that Goldmans traded in , with particular ire for synthetic CDOs : " It 's the la-la land of ledger entries . "
She 's on top form : " It 's called synthetic because there 's nothing there but the bet . "
More McCaskill : " What you worried about most was a bad article in the Wall Street Journal , not a regulator . "
And : " You think you 're so smart .
Let me tell you , any street gambler would never lay a bet with the house that has the record that this investigation reveals . "
10.50 am : Now the Goldman Sachs witnesses are sworn in .
Daniel Sparks , the former head of Goldman Sachs ' mortgage department , kicks off with his statement , and tells us what a great bunch of highly ethical people work at Goldmans .
Josh Birnbaum , a former managing director in the the mortgage department at Goldman Sachs , is next .
He also says that GS is chock full of ethical people who breathe integrity .
His full testimony is here .
He says :
No one from senior management told me to make a directional bet against the subprime market .
Rather , during the 2006 - 2007 period , regardless of whether our books were long or short , the consistent theme from management was to get smaller , reduce risk , and get closer to home .
11.00 am : An hour in and the excitement is almost too much to cope with .
( Irony . )
Luckily , to make things really exciting , here 's a big fish : Michael Swenson , the managing director of the mortgage department at Goldman Sachs .
And he instantly provides a clear and easy to understand summary of his role :
I was primarily responsible for the Asset - Backed Securities ( ABS ) trading desk , which was responsible for making markets in ABS securities and derivatives for our customer franchise .
The ABS desk traded consumer ABS , sub - prime cash , single - name ABS credit default swaps ( which I will refer to as " single names " ) and the ABX indices , which are a family of synthetic indices that reference a standard basket of 20 subprime deals .
That 's cleared that up .
11.10 am : And now it 's the man we 've all been waiting for : the London - based Goldman Sachs banker Fabrice Tourre , aka " Fabulous Fab " as he referred to himself , whose emails and role are at the centre of the SEC 's case against Goldmans :
" The whole building is about to collapse anytime now , " Tourre , an executive director at Goldman Sachs in London , wrote to a friend in a January 2007 e-mail , according to the SEC 's complaint .
" Only potential survivor , the fabulous Fab … standing in the middle of all these complex , highly leveraged , exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstruosities !!! "
Fabulous Fab lays out his defence before the committee :
The last week has been challenging for me and my family , as I have been the target of unfounded attacks on my character and motives ....
I wish to repeat – I did not mislead IKB or ACA , two of the most sophisticated institutional investors in these products anywhere in the world .
11.12 am : Fabulous Fab is disappointingly normal in real life , as opposed to his obnoxious email persona .
" Tourre actually does n't look / sound as douchey etc as I expected , " tweets an observer .
Oh well , it 's early days .
My colleague Andy Clark reports that top Wall Street blogger Bess Levin at Dealbreaker opines that the Fab has " grown his hair a little longer and is looking kind of hot " .
11.16 am : Now Levin is reading out some naughty internal emails about selling securities to clients on the one hand while shorting them to death elsewhere in the market .
Levin asks Sparks : " The buyer ... is asking a direct question , how do you guys get comfortable with the source of these securities ?
Did you not have a responsibility to answer a direct question ? "
Sparks looks perplexed ( and , frankly , I 'm with him there ) .
Levin repeats himself several times , the gist of which is : should have the bank told a client that asked a direct question about Goldmans view ( " comfort " ) of a particular security – one that in fact Goldmans was shorting at the same time as selling .
" I think you understand it , I think you do n't want to answer it , " says Levin .
" I 'm just going to go on because you 're not going to answer the question , that 's obvious . "
Sparks does a good impression of a fish trying to breathe air .
11.35 am : This is fantastic stuff .
Now we 're in to the toxic garbage of the sub - prime market that Goldman Sachs happily sold and shorted from time to time .
Levin's now onto something called " crap pools " involving Fremont sub - prime mortgages , which Goldmans sold to the tune of $ 700 m , and asks Sparks if he recalls the deal .
Umm , says Sparks .
The Timberwolf CDO is next up .
" I remember in the longs we took we lost hundreds of millions of dollars , " says Sparks .
" I 'm talking about the shorts , " snorts Levin , who is having fun here .
His tactic is to give the witness about 0.05 of a second to answer his questions .
Levin is now reading out internal Goldmans emails : " Boy , that Timberwolf was one shitty deal , " reads one .
" How much of that shitty deal did you sell to your clients ? " wonders Levin .
" You knew it was a shitty deal and you did n't tell your clients , " Levin tells Sparks .
" Does that bother you at all ? "
Sparks goes down the Reagan route in his defence : " I do n't recall , " he says .
Oh wow , this is delicious .
I wish I could keep up with Levin here , who is greatly enjoying repeating the phrase " shitty deal " .
Daniel Sparks is currently wishing he'd done medicine like his parents wanted him to .
But oh no , he had to be clever and go work on Wall Street .
11.40 am : Susan Collins takes over grilling Sparks , and gets the same stonewalling that Levin got : " I 'm beginning to share the chairman 's frustrations and I 'm only into 30 seconds of my time , " says Collins sharply .
Her question is : " Do you have a duty to act in the best interests of your clients ? "
Sparks gulps and rolls eyes .
" I believe we have a duty to serve our clients well , " Sparks replies , which draws a sharp intake of breath in the room , for good reason .
Bam .
Sparks wo n't agree that Goldmans Sachs should act in the best interests of its clients .
That 's a killer .
Tourre gives a similar weasel response – about offering liquidity – and Collins slaps him around .
Birnbaum is the only one who says yes , it does .
11.45 am : Yikes .
Susan Collins accuses the Goldmans witnesses of trying to " burn through " the committee 's time , after Tourre asked her to repeat a long question .
She gets back on track , grilling Un - Fabulous Fab over an email of his : " This sounds like a deliberate strategy to sell products to less sophisticated clients ... so you could make more money , " asks Collins .
Tourre repeats the " highly sophisticated institutions " line about buyers in his defence .
" Well Mr Tourre that 's not how it reads to me , " retorts Collins , who 's doing a good job here .
11.55 am : Chairman Carl Levin rather ominously says : " We 'll be here as long as it takes , " in case the Goldman Sachs witnesses want to run out the clock .
The Goldmans people should take that seriously , as a promise not a threat .
This is the US Senate .
They love talking on TV .
12.00 pm : Ted Kaufman , who is Joe Biden 's fill - in senator , actually seems to know what he is talking about , perhaps because being from Delaware , a tiny state full of banks , helps .
Kaufman is honing in on " stated income loans " – the worst of the worst mortgages handed out during the bubble with slightly higher interest rates without checking on the borrowers " stated income , " i.e. any number the borrower felt like writing down on a form .
Sparks rather foolishly appears to claim that Goldmans did n't know what a problem these dodgy stated income loans were , and Kaufman is ... well , making fun of him is the polite way of putting it , so Sparks quickly changes his tune .
Sparks is awful .
If Goldmans had the choice , a big umbrella handle would appear off stage and yank him out of there , and run down the curtain .
12.08 pm : " Do n't do the hindsight thing with me , " Kaufman says , more in sorrow than in anger , as Sparks makes another pathetic attempt to defend himself .
The Big Short by Michael Lewis gets another mention .
Let 's all buy a copy .
12.15 pm : " Have you ever heard of barbelling ? " asks Senator Kaufman .
And guess what ?
They have n't , except from reading Michael Lewis 's book .
In fact it seems that many staff at Goldman Sachs only found out about all this sub - prime CDO - whatever business from reading The Big Short .
I can just imagine the scene in the staff cafeteria : " Hey Daniel , have you read this stuff ?
Wow ! "
Someone should buy these guys a copy of Liar 's Poker - that will really blow their minds .
On second thoughts , maybe not .
( Barbelling is not a pick - up line in a sleazy bar .
In fact it is packaging securities by lumping together some good stuff with rubbish so that the package seems ok on average .
There 's a statistics joke that sums this up : A man with his head in a freezer and feet in an oven is , on average , at room temperature . )
12.33 pm : Tom Coburn arrives , the ranking Senate Republican , and instantly sinks his fangs into Goldman Sachs .
No he does n't !
He gives them a big hug , in a manly fashion of course .
Well , that was a complete waste of time .
In unrelated news : Wall Street donations to the Re-Elect Tom Coburn Committee flood in .
12.45 pm : Claire McCaskill next up .
" Who chose ACA ? " , she asks , getting to the meat of the issue at hand with the SEC 's case against Goldman Sachs .
Ah , Goldmans and Paulson , says Tourre .
" Now this is what a lot of people do n't get , this is where it gets weird " says McCaskill .
" Why would n't you just tell [ other clients ] that we 're doing this because Paulson wants to go short ? "
Tourre 's answer has three parts , the third of which is that Goldman might want to keep the position for itself .
In other words , that Goldman might want to short this crap to death if they thought there was money it in .
Tourre falls back on the standard Goldman defence : ACA selected the portfolio .
" You put ACA in there as some sort of fig leaf , " retorts McCaskill .
1.00 pm : Three hours in .
And now we are back to Timberwolf - the " shitty deal " that we have already come to know and love .
Senator McCaskill proceeds to dance on its grave .
There 's some confusion about particular emails going astray .
" Do n't worry , I 've got plenty more , " says McCaskill .
As an aside : McCaskill has a nonchalant manner of saying " shitty " .
Watching people in a room leafing through bits of paper not exactly the most riveting TV in history since Frost - Nixon interview or Nick Clegg 's last debate .
" Were you approached by Graywolf ? " asks McCaskill , sounding like she 's reading lines from an upcoming X - Men movie staring Hugh Jackman 's father .
Otherwise , this is getting repetitive .
Who 's next ?
Mark Pryor , Democratic senator from Arkansas , who pokes Sparks again over the bank 's responsibility to inform its clients about the bank 's trading activities .
But compared with Levin 's bite , this is like being savaged by a dead sheep .
In this case , a not very bright dead sheep .
1.15 pm : Republican Senator John Ensign is next in the batter 's box .
He 's a senator from Nevada , the home state of Las Vegas , and he thinks that comparing Wall Street to Vegas insults Vegas .
" In Vegas , you know the odds .
On Wall Street , they manipulate the odds while you 're playing , " says Ensign – who knows something about this subject , since his stepfather ran a swanky casino , Mandalay Bay :
Las Vegas is full of casinos , but none quite like the one at Mandalay Bay .
Our 135,000 square - foot gaming environment was designed to make waves along the Strip .
You 'll play in a tropical setting of flowing water , lush foliage , and exotic architecture .
And whether you prefer slots or tables , blackjack or poker , you 'll find a full selection of your favorite games .
1.30 pm : Ensign wonders if Goldman Sachs 's pay structure and bonuses lead to ethical behaviour ?
" I believe that at Goldman Sachs , in the past , I had every reason to be ethical , " says Sparks .
Birnbaum agrees , and goes further : " If you were n't cognisant of ethics you would not get paid and you would probably get fired . "
Mmm .
1.45 pm : Jon Tester , a Republican from Arizona , asks a pretty straight forward question of Birnbaum : how and when did he become convinced that the housing market bubble was in decline ?
And ca n't get a straight answer .
Birnbaum gets sniffy about the difference between house prices and sub - prime mortgage defaults .
" I 'm not trying to set you up or anything , " asks Tester , getting , well , testy , and presses on as to when Birnbaum thought the housing - parrot was dead and whether he discussed this with his colleagues .
" I did socialise my thoughts with some people , " says Birnbaum , who really comes across as a barrel of laughs , socialising his thoughts .
Can we run a Turing test on Birnbaum ?
I 'm not sure he 'd pass as human , based on today 's performance .
I was suspicious earlier when he described the committee members as " earthlings " .
And for the 900th time during this meeting , Tester asks what a synthetic CDO is .
" You can say what you want but it is gambling , " says Tester , wanting to know why they exist in the first place .
1.55 pm : We 're back to the question of Goldman Sach 's responsibility to its clients , as opposed to its market - making and own dealing - making .
Sparks : " If you do n't prudently manage your risk , you wo n't be around to deal with your clients . "
Oh dear , Senator Tester asks Sparks what he'd do in terms of reforming financial services regulations .
Again , Sparks wo n't answer .
" It 's a very hard question , " he cautiously ventures .
Well stop the presses .
2.10 pm : Four hours and still going .
But here 's Chairman Levin again .
" Let 's look at the junk you were selling , " he says with relish .
How long before he says " shitty deal " again ?
Somewhere on Wall Street someone is taking bets on that very question .
Now Levin is unpicking a series of deals .
" If you can sell your junk and shift the risk on that , then Goldman puts $ 2bn in its pocket , " says Levin .
Sparks interrupts , asking which exhibit was being discussed .
Levin is visibly annoyed at the delay .
" Maybe we 'll get an answer this time , " he snorts .
Levin 's game is point out where Goldman was selling securities to clients at the same time as it was buying synthetic CDOs to hedge its exposure .
The Goldman people look confused , because we have two alien races involved in mutual incomprehension here .
They see this as normal activity , but Levin is trying to expose that Goldman is playing both sides of the game – telling its clients that it's an investor while at the same time getting the hell out of Dodge .
" They made some lemonade from some big old Goldman Sachs lemons .
Have you got regrets ?
You ought to have plenty of regrets , " growls Levin .
Let me predict right now that many Goldman Sachs executives will never donate money to the Democratic party for the rest of their lifetime .
2.14 pm : Levin exhibits great comic timing .
" This is Goldman Sachs 's statement to the SEC .
[ Pause ]
I 'm not sure you want to quibble with this one . "
But of course they do quibble , in that they will only speak to their own parts of the business .
Later , to Birnbaum : " I 'm just asking you if you think the darn statement is true . "
Somewhere on Wall Street , darts are being thrown at pictures of Carl Levin .
2.25 pm : Now even Tom Coburn is getting tough - ish with Goldmans , possibly as a result of the evasive responses by the Goldman Sachs witnesses .
There 's only one way to get through a Senate hearing : you have to remember that senators believe they have the wisdom of Solon and the divine powers of Byzantine emperors .
The best tactic is throw yourself on their mercy .
The mistake being made by the Goldman Sachs staff here is that they think they are in an episode of Law And Order .
They 're not .
They 're in an episode of Rome , subject to the whims of a brutal tyrant .
2.36 pm : Oh dear , Tourre is not dealing well with Levin asking him questions that are matters of public record , and then attempting to respond in financial jargon .
Levin now reading out more incriminating internal emails about Goldman 's relations with its clients .
( Obscure side - note : Tourre reminds me of PY Gerbeau , the man who ended up running the Millennium Dome .
But maybe that 's because they are both French . )
3.00 pm : Well the computer just swallowed a chuck of text of Levin roasting Tourre over an open fire , and I 'm losing the will to live .
After five hours of back and forth , but mainly forth , since the Goldman witnesses are n't giving much away , there 's a lot to pick over – I 'll be back to wrap up later .
In the meantime , the New York Times is doing a far better , grown - up job with the live - blogging here .
For your viewing pleasure here 's a highlights reel of Carl Levin 's " Shitty Deal " remix .
It 's a scream .
3.16 pm : Woo hoo !
A break in proceedings for the time being .
9.00 pm : So that was Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein 's testimony , which lacked something of the fireworks earlier in the day , possibly because after 10 hours of this , everyone was starting to melt .
My excellent colleague Andrew Clark does the hard work on the appearances by Blankfein and chief financial officer David Viniar :
The seven past and present Goldman executives appearing in Congress were greeted by protestors in prison uniform , bearing placards reading Stop looting America ! and Shame .
Goldman 's chief executive , Lloyd Blankfein , at times struggled with the tone of hostility , assuring lawmakers that he had no better foresight of the US economy than others in the market : " I do n't think we 're that smart . "
You know Blankfein does n't really believe that .
Conclusion : Goldman
Sachs are n't the first group of people to find themselves caught like rabbits in headlights before a hostile Congressional committee .
They have learned the hard way about the level of hostility that exists towards them and to Wall Street , a hostility not at all tempered by the fact of an economic train wreck and it being an election year .
And they have learned the iron rule of Capitol Hill : the most dangerous place in Washington DC is between a US senator and a TV camera .
Despite all that , Goldman Sachs came with nothing .
In its mind the bank has done nothing wrong , nothing whatsoever .
In fact it believes quite the reverse : that its actions are beyond reproach , barring a few choice emails that they 'd rather had n't been made public , and that GS is merely an honest market - maker .
Reading the tweets of disbelief from Wall Street and its allies , that lambasted the senators for not understanding how things are done , or how the market works , reinforces that view .
The thing is , the senators do n't understand how a modern investment bank works – or rather , now they 've found out , they are shocked .
That a reputable bank can play both sides of the market , like the mob telling one of its boxers to take a fall , selling investments at the same time as selling those clients and investments short , is what has shocked them .
It does n't shock Goldman Sachs or Wall Street because that 's the way it has evolved , and if those silly old senators have n't caught up , that 's their problem .
To the senators though , that 's betting against their own clients .
According to Goldman , that 's " reducing risk " .
What else : an interesting piece in the Columbia Journalism Review about the Greywolf " shitty deal " that Senator Levin was so interested in .
Shitty sounds about right .
And here 's far more detail than 99.99 % of the world will ever need to know on the subject of Greywolf .
Here 's Simon " Baseline Scenario " Johnson 's summary of the day 's outcome :
At this stage in the proceedings , the Goldman Sachs ' public relations people must be feeling more than a little down .
The firm 's lawyers are still breathing fire , Lloyd Blankfein trod the fine line between not being apologetic and actually saying " it 's capitalism , stupid " , and the more junior executives interrogated today did not say anything blatantly incriminating .
But the public image of the firm around the world – including with finance ministers and pension funds – has taken a severe beating
The last word should go to Carl Levin , from his grilling of Blankfein : " They 're buying something from you – and you are betting against it .
And you want people to trust you .
I would n't trust you . "
A study led by University of Pittsburgh researchers could finally lay to rest the millennia - old conjecture that the ancient empire of Carthage regularly sacrificed its youngest citizens .
An examination of the remains of Carthaginian children revealed that most infants perished prenatally or very shortly after birth and were unlikely to have lived long enough to be sacrificed , according to a Feb. 17 report in PLoS One .
The findings -- based on the first published analysis of the skeletal remains found in Carthaginian burial urns -- refute claims from as early as the 3rd century BCE of systematic infant sacrifice at Carthage that remain a subject of debate among biblical scholars and archaeologists , said lead researcher Jeffrey H. Schwartz , a professor of anthropology and history and philosophy of science in Pitt 's School of Arts and Sciences and president of the World Academy of Art and Science .
Schwartz and his colleagues present the more benign interpretation that very young Punic children were cremated and interred in burial urns regardless of how they died .
" Our study emphasizes that historical scientists must consider all evidence when deciphering ancient societal behavior , " Schwartz said .
" The idea of regular infant sacrifice in Carthage is not based on a study of the cremated remains , but on instances of human sacrifice reported by a few ancient chroniclers , inferred from ambiguous Carthaginian inscriptions , and referenced in the Old Testament .
Our results show that some children were sacrificed , but they contradict the conclusion that Carthaginians were a brutal bunch who regularly sacrificed their own children . "
Schwartz worked with Frank Houghton of the Veterans Research Foundation of Pittsburgh , Roberto Macchiarelli of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris , and Luca Bondioli of the National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography in Rome to inspect the remains of children found in Tophets , burial sites peripheral to conventional Carthaginian cemeteries for older children and adults .
Tophets housed urns containing the cremated remains of young children and animals , which led to the theory that they were reserved for victims of sacrifice .
Schwartz and his coauthors tested the all - sacrifice claim by examining the skeletal remains from 348 urns for developmental markers that would determine the children 's age at death .
Schwartz and Houghton recorded skull , hip , long bone , and tooth measurements that indicated most of the children died in their first year with a sizeable number aged only two to five months , and that at least 20 percent of the sample was prenatal .
Schwartz and Houghton then selected teeth from 50 individuals they concluded had died before or shortly after birth and sent them to Macchiarelli and Bondioli , who examined the samples for a neonatal line .
This opaque band forms in human teeth between the interruption of enamel production at birth and its resumption within two weeks of life .
Identification of this line is commonly used to determine an infant 's age at death .
Macchiarelli and Bondioli found a neonatal line in the teeth of 24 individuals , meaning that the remaining 26 individuals died prenatally or within two weeks of birth , the researchers reported .
The contents of the urns also dispel the possibility of mass infant sacrifice , Schwartz and Houghton noted .
No urn contained enough skeletal material to suggest the presence of more than two complete individuals .
Although many urns contained some superfluous fragments belonging to additional children , the researchers concluded that these bones remained from previous cremations and may have inadvertently been mixed with the ashes of subsequent cremations .
The team 's report also disputes the contention that Carthaginians specifically sacrificed first - born males .
Schwartz and Houghton determined sex by measuring the sciatic notch -- a crevice at the rear of the pelvis that 's wider in females -- of 70 hipbones .
They discovered that 38 pelvises came from females and 26 from males .
Two others were likely female , one likely male , and three undetermined .
Schwartz and his colleagues conclude that the high incidence of prenate and infant mortality are consistent with modern data on stillbirths , miscarriages , and infant death .
They write that if conditions in other ancient cities held in Carthage , young and unborn children could have easily succumbed to the diseases and sanitary shortcomings found in such cities as Rome and Pompeii .
Well , Geohot promised a workaround for Sony 's removal of the " install other OS " feature in PS3 firmware 3.21 and now Geohot has delivered .
While it 's not available to the public just yet , Geohot 's 3.21OO custom firmware will apparently be simple to install and , as you can see in the video after the break , it works just as you 'd expect and simply restores the " other OS " option to its previous place .
Geohot even says that the custom firmware might actually enable the other OS feature on the PS3 Slim , but he has n't yet had a chance to try it out .

Fleetwood Mac — Go Your Own Way
Every seller must go their own way .
Some accept the reality of the market and price accordingly .
Some do not .
Every owner wants house prices to take flight , particularly those who are underwater .
Unfortunately , fundamentals that support the housing market can only go up so fast , and in case you did n't notice , wages are going down .
Bubble - era home prices wo n't be seen again until 2025 or beyond in California , Florida , Arizona and Nevada
BROOKFIELD , Wis. , Apr 08 , 2010 ( BUSINESS WIRE ) — Fiserv , Inc. , the leading global provider of financial services technology solutions , today released an analysis of home price historical trend data and forecasts for more than 375 U.S. markets based on the Fiserv( R ) Case - Shiller Indexes ( R ) , which is owned and generated by Fiserv , data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) and Moody's Economy.com .
The Fiserv analysis indicates the markets that experienced the greatest price bubble , including certain metro areas in California , Florida , Arizona and Nevada , wo n't see home prices return to peak levels until 2025 or later .
That represents an unprecedented market cycle that will last a full generation from the top of the market in 2006 - 2007 .
Many other markets , including major urban centers in the Northeast and industrial Midwest , may need to wait a decade or more until prices return to their market peaks .
" Nationally , Fiserv Case - Shiller data points to a further seven percent decline in home prices through the end of this year , with a prolonged recovery beginning early in 2011 .
In many markets , the emphasis is on the word ' prolonged , ' " said David Stiff , Chief Economist , Fiserv .
" We see several powerful forces in the market that will severely hinder the housing recoveries of many metro areas , particularly in the hard - hit states of California , Florida , Arizona and Nevada .
It will take these markets 15 or more years before home prices climb back to their peaks . " …
Home sales grew dramatically , jumping from 4.5 million units in January to 6.5 million units in November 2009 , the highest gains since 2006 .
This was attributed to lower prices , almost record - low mortgage interest rates , and the $ 8,000 tax credit for first - time home buyers .
Another factor that temporarily slowed the erosion of home prices has been the financial institutions ' inability to effectively sell homes with distressed mortgages .

In The Great Housing Bubble , I noted the following :
Table 11 : Summary of Predictions for Irvine , California Home Prices Method Total Decline Appreciation Rate Recovery Year S&P / Case - Shiller Inflation Support 55 % 3.3 % 2039 Median House Price and Historic Appreciation 45 % 4.4 % 2023 Price - To - Rent Ratio 22 % 4.7 % 2019 Price - To - Income Ratio 43 % 3.2 % 2029 =====================================
======== ============
========= 41 % 3.9 % 2028
The range of predictions for the decline of home prices in Irvine , California , is from 22 % to 53 % with an average of 41 % .
The predicted time of peak - to - peak recovery ranges from 2019 to 2033 with an average of 2028 .
Of course , since Irvine is in the heart of a bubble - prone market , recovery may happen more quickly , but then again , that would mean prices have entered another unsustainable price bubble .
My predictions of the bottoming price look unlikely at this point .
The Federal Reserve has raised the trough with its activity .
I think this pushes the bottom forward , perhaps to 2012 or 2013 and raises it .
Nothing changes the underlying fundamentals .
Unless we inflate another housing bubble , prices will take a very long time to reach the peak .
What is happening in Irvine ?
One measure of price activity in a market is dollars - per - square - foot .
In The Great Housing Bubble , I described it this way :
The median is a good measure of general price activity in the market , but it does have a significant weakness : it does not indicate the value buyers are obtaining in the market .
The houses or structures built on the land compose the most significant portion of real estate value in most markets .
These structures deteriorate over time and require routine maintenance that is often deferred .
During times of prosperity , many people renovate homes to add value and improve their living conditions .
The impact of deterioration and renovation of individual properties is not reflected in the median resale value .
Also , at the time of sale , there are often buyer incentives which inflate the recorded sales price relative to the actual cost to the buyer .
These buyer incentives also distort the median sales price as a measure of value .
Many data reporting services measure , record , and report the average sales cost on a per-square - foot basis to address the problem of evaluating what buyers are getting for their money .
For instance , in a declining market if people start buying much larger homes at the limit of affordability , the generic median sales price would remain unchanged , but since buyers are getting much larger homes for the same money , the average cost per-square - foot would decline accordingly .
This makes the average cost per-square - foot a superior measure for capturing qualitative changes in house prices ; however , this method of measurement does not capture the relative quality of the square footage purchased , only the price paid for it .
High quality finishes may justify a higher price per square foot .
There is no way to objectively evaluate the impact finish quality has on home prices .
The main problems with using the average cost per-square - foot to measure price is that it does not provide a number comparable to sales prices since it has been divided by square feet , and it is not widely measured and reported .
The change in market mix will also impact the $ / SF measure .
Larger properties generally sell for less than smaller properties on a $ / SF basis ; therefore , when the mix changes to larger properties , the $ / SF will decline .
That is much of what is driving the slide witnessed in the $ / SF measure since last September , a period within which the median went up .
If the Federal Reserve had not propped up the market last year , we would likely be seeing $ 275 / SF to $ 300 / SF across most of Irvine .
We still might get there depending on interest rates and inventory .
It does n't seem likely that prices will go up given the current market head winds .
Did n't get the press release
The owner of today 's featured property obviously did not get the Fiserv press release .
In his world , there was no housing bubble , and his house kept on appreciating while the remaining housing market collapsed around him .
This property value went up 20 % since the peak in summer of 2006 .
WTF ?
The owner put a large amount down , and he has only recently obtained a few private loans to get him through the recession .
In his mind , he is still a millionaire .

Iron ore giants Vale and BHP just dealt a death blow to the 40 - year old system of negotiating prices annually with Asian customers .
They 've moved to a short - term quarterly contract system , and reportedly secured price hikes as high as 90 % in the process .
Bloomberg :
Sumitomo Metal Industries Co. , Japan ’s third - biggest steelmaker , agreed to pay Vale $ 100 to $ 110 a metric ton for the three months beginning the April 1 , spokesman Toshifumi Matsui said .
BHP , the world ’s largest mining company , today said it will sell the majority of its production to Asian steel mills on shorter - term contracts without giving pricing .
...
“ If the industry moves to a quarterly pricing , that will in fact be a true market mechanism , not driven by anyone in particular but driven very much by market forces , ” Sam Walsh , the head of Rio Tinto ’s iron ore operations , said March 24 .
It has happened .
The concession by Asian steelmakers speaks to both A ) the bargaining clout of the world 's few major iron ore producers and B ) the enormous demand and booming prices Asian steelmakers are seeing .
To accept huge price hikes for iron ore shows they are sold on the current China boom , since China accounts for over a third of global steel demand .
Yet the on frequency could also work out to their benefit .
If China slows and steel prices fall , they 'll be able to , hopefully , adjust down their iron ore input costs more rapidly .

" There are both federal and state laws here in California that protect reporters and journalists from search and seizure for their news gathering activities .
The federal law is the Privacy Protection Act and the state law is a provision of the penal code and evidence code .
It appears that both of those laws may be being violated by this search and seizure . "
While some have suggested that this may not apply if they were investigating Gizmodo for criminal activity , the EFF says it does n't matter and the shield laws apply anyway .
But even if they are saying it was unlawful , the statute appears to say it does n't matter .
The crime that you 're investigating cannot be receipt of that information or materials .
Based on a report by TechCrunch , it appears the San Mateo County District Attorney 's Office is acknowledging that the shield protection laws may still be valid .
The investigation has reported to have come to a pause as they reevaluate whether or not those shield laws do apply in this situation .
Michael Kutsche is a character designer and concept artist working in the film industry .
He was one of the character designers on Tim Burton ’s recent film , Alice in Wonderland , and is currently working on the upcoming John Carter of Mars , directed by Andrew Stanton and slated for release in 2012 .
Originally from Germany , Kutsche is a self - taught artist who credits the internet with establishing his career .
Though he works in traditional media like oil and watercolor for his personal and gallery art , his professional work is primarily digital paintings , and it was from a portfolio on CGSociety , a community site devoted to digital art , that he first gained the notice of Sony Pictures Imageworks , a connection that led to his work on Alice .
Kutsche often works with his digital tools in a way that gives a feeling of painterly traditional brushwork .
Though his original CGSociety portfolio does not seem to be active , there is a two page interview with him on the site , as well as a walk through of the creation of one of his pieces , The Boxer .
His website has a gallery of work from 2008 and 2009 , and he has recently started a blog .

How to Rollover Your 401k Into a Roth IRA

On Sunday ( February 28 ) , people poured onto the streets of downtown Vancouver to celebrate Team Canada 's win against the U.S. in the gold - medal men's hockey game .
Here 's several shots of the revelry , captured by contributors to the Georgia Straight 's Flickr group .
.
I read the behind - the - scenes Edmunds series .
I studied specs and reviews of dozens of cars .
I talked to friends who drive my top candidates .
I knew my budget .
I knew what general features I most wanted ( leather ) , what was optional ( moonroof -- sigh . ) and what I 'd skip ( spoilers , GPS ) .
I was ready .
Except for one thing .
Which car did I most want ??
Which really translated into : WHO AM I ??
For some people a car is wheels and a seat .
They think it says nothing about them .
I say , that says something about them .
I 'm the kind of person who gleans meaning from a hairstyle , the kind of cocktail someone orders , a person 's ringtone or lack of one .
So am I a mid-career professional looking to impress someone , anyone , with her ride ?
For a while I started to think so , but then I realized there 's no one to impress but myself ( and my pocketbook ) , since I do n't usually do business with image conscious types .
Forget that .
Am a mother ( not yet , but buying a car with that in mind ) looking for a roomy backseat and a quiet cabin , perfect for sleeping triplets ?
( Hey , gotta be ready for anything ! )
Or am I an ambitious young professional looking to maximize gas mileage , zip through traffic in a cute little thing and be comfortable along the way ?
Do I love to pass people on the highway ?
A little too much .
Would I be comfortable driving something boring safe and slow , in exchange for a roomy interior and cruise control ?
Er , maybe !?
So there it was , an identity crisis -- sporty , stately , kid friendly , city friendly , all or none of the above ?
Mr. A tried to help .
He knows a ton about cars , and he knows a ton about me . :)
He drives a Civic and has been very pleased with it .
I asked him to help me narrow down which of the following cars packs the best balance of sexy features , comfortable drive , affordability and a solid repair track record .
Recap :
Me :
What do you think between the Mazda 3 or 6 , the Hyundai Elantra , a VW , a Toyota , a Volvo , another Nissan , or , what else ?
Him : How about a Honda Civic ?
Me : I tried one and did n't really like it .
It was a 2012 model , and those are getting bad reviews .
Him : How about a 2011 ?
Me : No , I want something ... different .
More energetic , more alive .
Him : Like a Civic ?
It 's super reliable .
You 'll never see them on the side of the road .
Me : I think I 'm leaning toward the Elantra .
Him :
Why do n't you test drive a 2011 Civic and we 'll go from there ?
Me : Thanks , darling !
I think we narrowed it down !
Next step : Unleashing the internet negotiation elves .
To a certain extent Acne can be ok on a model ( because it will go away in time ) , but if there 's an option to play a long game of " connect the dots " on your face then probably not .
As for crooked teeth , I think that 's a definite NO .
Im not trying to be mean , but I have honestly never seen a model with bad teeth .
One of the great principles of modern times is equal pay for equal work .
So , where are our feminist sisters now that the annual grunt - fest at Wimbledon has begun ?
Yup , as we face the grim prospect of female players like Portugal 's Michelle Larcher emitting the kind of frenzied grunt at every stroke like she 's starring in some kind of particularly weird niche porn movie , at least the wimmin can console themselves with the fact that they will get the same money .
Even though they are likely to spend roughly half of the amount of time on court as their male colleagues , thanks to the efforts of the WTA and players like Serena Williams , each round offers the same dosh for both sexes .
So , the winners of both the male and female sections can both look forward to trousering a rather tasty £ 850,000 each for winning -- with the woman playing the best of three , while the man will have had to come through two weeks of playing the best of five .
So , in the spirit of equal work for equal pay , should the female game not also adapt to best of five ?
Erm no .
Because as top female player Jelena Jankovic whined last week at the prospect of playing best of five : " What , you want to drive us into oblivion ? "
So , we want the same money because we 're women .
But we do n't want to do the same work .
Because we are women .
But only a sexist pig would point out that absurdity , of course .

A corporate watchdog group that got rid of Joe Camel is after another icon - this time , its target is tall , red and happy .
Corporate Accountability International plans to host a retirement party for Ronald McDonald as it releases a report Wednesday that basically says , " We ’re not loving it . " The report calls for McDonald ’s to stop using the iconic clown .
“ For nearly 50 years , Ronald McDonald has hooked kids on unhealthy foods spurring a deadly epidemic of diet - related diseases , ” said Deborah Lapidus , the senior organizer at Corporate Accountability International .
“ Ultimately the report makes the case that it ’s time that McDonald ’s stop directing fast food to kids .
Really , Ronald deserves a break and so do we . ”
The group plans to hold events outside of McDonald 's throughout the country and wants the fast food chain to stop using its corporate mascot .
The mascot makes children “ vulnerable to manipulations to marketing ” and turns them on to junk food at an age when childhood obesity rates have soared , Lapidus said .
The group is employing the same strategy as it did to target the cigarette mascot in its “ Send Joe Camel packing ” campaign in the 1990s .
“ A lot of our thinking is modeled on that campaign and success , ” Lapidus said .
“ We think of Ronald McDonald as a deep - fried Joe Camel for 21st century . ”
McDonald ’s does not appear to have plans to ditch the clown .
The company released a statement to CNN.com calling Ronald McDonald “ a beloved brand ambassador for McDonald 's ” and described him as crucial to its charity efforts to help families of hospitalized children .
“ Ronald also helps deliver messages to families on many important subjects such as safety , literacy , and the importance of physical activity and making balanced food choices .
That 's what Ronald McDonald is all about , which our customers know and appreciate , ” according to the statement .
Lapidus said the fast food giant 's message has some “ fundamental ironies . ”
“ McDonald ’s charity does a lot of good and they do work to be commended , ” she said .
“ But there are serious question about the face of the charity that ’s about kids getting better that also promotes unhealthy food to kids .
Could it not serve the same children without the cross promotion of burgers and fries which are affecting kids ' health ? ”
Other McDonald ’s characters , such as Hamburglar or Grimace ( the purple triangular fellow ) can rest easy .
Health advocates are not targeting them .
The owner of the SUV that USC Trojans running back Joe McKnight has been seen driving says it was bought for the junior 's girlfriend as a favor .
In e-mails to the Los Angeles Times and Los Angeles Daily News , Scott Schenter , a Santa Monica , Calif. , businessman , said the car is driven by Johana Michelle Beltran -- McKnight 's girlfriend -- and that he helped purchase the Land Rover because Beltran 's family had trouble qualifying for a loan .
Contrary to a reporter 's firsthand account , USC's Joe McKnight has denied driving an SUV owned by a California businessman .
Kirby Lee / Image of Sport / US Presswire
" It is her car , " Schenter wrote .
" She makes the payments and she is responsible for insurance .
The payments are a little over $ 500 / month [ not a big amount ] . "
McKnight has denied driving the car , but the Los Angeles Times said in a story that one of its reporters has seen USC 's leading rusher driving the SUV several times .
The Times first reported the story Friday night .
Schenter also said he is a University of Washington fan who has " nothing to do with agents , marketing players or representing athletes " despite his ownership of the Web domain www.4joemcknight.com, which he says has not been renewed .
" I own so many Web site domains that I only purchased www.4joemcknight.com [ did n't renew ] because I thought it was clever along with the many other ones I own / owned , " Schenter wrote in the e-mails .
Schenter said a company he founded in May 2008 , USC Marketing , stood for " United States China Marketing , " and that despite being an employee for the Los Angeles County Assessor 's office , he would " rather be known for my expertise in marketing and finance ventures . "
USC , already under review by the NCAA and Pac - 10 regarding accusations that running back Reggie Bush and basketball star O.J. Mayo received improper benefits during their time at the school , is investigating McKnight 's use of the vehicle .
If McKnight is in violation of NCAA rules , it could affect his eligibility .
It is against NCAA rules for athletes to accept benefits from agents or marketing representatives , or to accept " extra benefits " based on their ability .
Despite being in attendance for a USC men's basketball game against Tennessee in Los Angeles on Saturday night , athletic director Mike Garrett was not made available to local reporters .
" I read the letter [ by Schenter ] and found it interesting , " said a statement from Garrett , read by a Trojans spokesman to the reporters at halftime as Garrett sat next to him .
" Our compliance people are handling the matter .
I have nothing more to say . "
USC plays Boston College in the Emerald Bowl on Dec. 26 in San Francisco .

TAUNTON , England , March 10 ( UPI ) --
Animal experts in Britain said they have no explanation for why more than 100 starlings dropped dead from the sky onto the garden of a home .
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals said the birds , which had blood oozing from their beaks and claws , fell on a 12 - foot - wide patch of garden next to a Somerset County home Sunday night , the Daily Mail reported Wednesday .

Helen Cohen , an RSPCA spokeswoman , said the cause of the avian deaths is " still a mystery . "
" We were informed that a lady had reported many dead or dying starlings on her property .
This is obviously an extremely unusual occurrence , " she said .
" Tests were carried out on some of the birds and they were found to have physical injuries but we could find no evidence of any health issues which could explain what had happened .
" The only possible explanation we can think of is that something has caused the flock to suddenly change their direction of flight and caused them to hit the ground , " Cohen said .
" It could have been that a bird of prey could have scared them into doing this , but it is still a mystery really . "

Are we some Third World Banana Republic unable to keep gaudy hues off the face of our worthless currency ?
Mortifying .
It 's a good thing only a few dozen Americans are wealthy enough to possess one of these " hundred dollar " monstrosities .
Give me the old version and let me be on my way to my counterfeiter , thank you .
Our bodies are wired to move , and damaged wiring is often impossible to repair .
Strokes and spinal cord injuries can quickly disconnect parts of the brain that initiate movement with the nerves and muscles that execute it , and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson 's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) draw the process out to the same effect .
Scientists have been looking for a way to bypass damaged nerves by directly connecting the brain to an assistive device — like a robotic limb — through brain - computer interface ( BCI ) technology .
Now , researchers have demonstrated the ability to nonintrusively record neural signals outside the skull and decode them into information that could be used to move a prosthetic .
Past efforts at a BCI to animate an artificial limb involved electrodes inserted directly into the brain .
The surgery required to implant the probes and the possibility that implants might not stay in place made this approach risky .
The alternative — recording neural signals from outside the brain — has its own set of challenges .
" It has been thought for quite some time that it was n't possible to extract information about human movement using electroencephalography , " or EEG , says neuroscientist and electrical engineer Jose Contreras - Vidal .
In trying to record the brain 's electrical activity off the scalp , he adds , " people assumed that the signal - to - noise ratio and the information content of these signals were limited . "
Evidently , that is not the case .
In the March issue of The Journal of Neuroscience , Contreras - Vidal and his team from the bioengineering and kinesiology departments at the University of Maryland , College Park , show that the noisy brain waves recorded using noninvasive EEG can be mathematically decoded into meaningful information about complex human movements .
" This means we can use a noninvasive method to develop the next generation of brain –computer interface machines , " Contreras - Vidal says .
" It can expand considerably the range of clinical and rehabilitative applications . "
Instead of undergoing brain surgery , users would wear an electrode - covered head cap that records the electric impulses from neurons — the only mess involved is the clear gel applied to the head to enhance conduction .
Some patients have already used the caps to communicate via word processors .
( The recognition of a letter flashing on a screen signals the word processor to choose that letter . )
The next step is to put the decoded movement information to work .
" We hope to show that a person with a stroke or an amputee would be able to control an assistive device , " Contreras - Vidal says .
He already has healthy volunteers testing two different setups :
One has them moving a computer cursor on a screen ; the other has them controlling an artificial hand .
Contreras - Vidal also hopes to integrate sensory feedback into the system to optimize the user 's control over the device .
" In all the studies so far people have used visual feedback to close the loop between the user and the machine , " he says .
" We think it 's important to use other types of feedback , too , because vision is a slow signal " compared with the sensory signal a person would get from an intact limb .
Whether such a system would work for patients with longstanding nerve damage is unknown .
Such patients have n't activated their movement - generating neurons or received the related sensory feedback for many years and could generate abnormal brain wave –based movement information .
" We 're starting to look at patient populations to answer that question , " Contreras - Vidal says , naming stroke patients and below - elbow amputees as the first test subjects .
" We know the brain is highly redundant , so we think that even if there 's a deletion in the brain , we might be able to decode from another place .
One advantage to using electroencephalography is access to the whole brain , not just a specific area . "
Claims of cruelty at zoo Current and former staffers allege suffering and death at facility December 13 , 2009 By Sam Cooper , The Province Animals at a " world - class " Fort Langley zoo are neglected , abused and dying -- their carcasses tossed at times to packs of wild dogs -- according to employee allegations now under investigation by the B.C. SPCA .
The shocking charges include case files on about 50 deaths at the endangered - species facility known as the Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre , whose services are used by B.C. 's environment ministry .
The allegations -- which the zoo 's founder denies -- are drawn from an extensive list of claims made by eight current and former employees of the centre and include : - Management 's refusal to provide veterinary care for sick or injured animals ; - A cruelly botched " mercy killing " carried out by hitting an animal repeatedly on the head with a hammer and , in other cases , the slitting of throats and use of a low - calibre rifle to shoot animals so that killings " take a very long time , [ take ] multiple bullets and [ cause ] a great deal of unnecessary animal suffering ; " - Dead animals disposed of by being fed to packs of African wild dogs at the facility .
During the SPCA investigation into these allegations , an adult and baby giraffe died at Mountain View within a day of each other last weekend .
Marcie Moriarty , general manager of cruelty investigations for the B.C. SPCA , confirmed she is leading an in - depth probe into the employee allegations .
She also confirmed that the two giraffes had died , and that there are " husbandry " -- or breeding -- concerns at the centre .
Moriarty said she was " surprised " by the allegations , as Mountain View has a " world - class " reputation .
" This is an institution where we 'd never received complaints before , " she said .
The alleged breaches are generally driven by management 's focus on saving money , the employees allege .
If true , it 's a unique state of affairs for a facility founded in 1986 by president and CEO Gordon Blankstein , a charismatic multimillionaire and international financier .
Blankstein has successfully sold many small start - up companies , but his net worth is not what it was when he and wife Yvonne purchased 50 hectares of farmland to launch Mountain View .
Blankstein confirmed to The Province that he lost about $ 100 million when the technology stock bubble burst 10 years ago .
He has branded Mountain View as a modern ark and has gained a reputation in the media as a " new Noah " for his work as an " environmental philanthropist " who has poured up to $ 500,000 a year into Mountain View -- which is now a non -profit society with many donors , he says .
" We are breeding endangered animals for release back to the wild and we are involved in high - profile projects and release work around the world , " Blankstein told The Province .
One of the most prestigious programs at the centre is Blankstein 's award - winning work with the environment ministry on a recovery program for endangered spotted owls .
" We have letters from the province all the time talking about what a great job we are doing , " Blankstein said .
He explained his mission to save animals in grandiose terms to Maclean 's magazine in 2005 : " God put them here , " he said .
" Do we think we have the right to take them away ? "
The eight horrified animal handlers who spoke to The Province paint a picture different from Blankstein 's self - portrait as a saviour of beasts .
They say that under his cost - saving directives , animals are killed inhumanely , sometimes in horrific and bloody scenes .
Employees claim that bullet - riddled animal heads are lopped off and fresh carcasses thrown to the African dogs .
They say exceptions are made when " Gordon wants the animal 's head or hide for a taxidermy mount for his house . "
On Dec. 1 , The Province conducted an extensive interview with a group of seven Mountain View whistle - blowers .
Also present were representatives of the Vancouver Humane Society and the national animal - protection charity Zoocheck .
The group agreed to be interviewed only if their names were not published .
A number of them say they fear lawsuits for speaking out against Mountain View 's management .
In a separate interview , The Province spoke with former staffer Thomas Knight , a graduate of Princeton University with a master 's degree in ecology and evolutionary biology .
Knight was bird / hoofstock manager at the centre , but was laid off this year .
The employees offered detailed accounts alleging animal neglect and cruelty and voiced public - safety concerns about the centre .
They cited case histories of about 50 animal deaths at Mountain View , dating back to 2004 .
Deaths included at least 10 instances of euthanasia by shooting and 25 cases where dead animals were " fed out " to African dogs .
They produced photographs of logbook entries as supporting evidence .
In most cases , necropsies to determine cause of death were not performed -- for cost reasons , they alleged .
The employees say Blankstein required that they seek his personal approval before a vet could be called to treat an animal , and this permission was rarely given .
One woman said a manager ordered her never to call a vet again after she tried to get treatment for a falcon that appeared to be losing an eye .
" I hear story after story of people being reprimanded , " said Julie Woodyer , spokeswoman for Zoocheck , after listening to more than three hours of testimony at the meeting .
Woodyer said that in her 15 years of assessing zoos across Canada , she had only experienced one case with more serious allegations .
She said that if the allegations prove true , " with the animal neglect and shooting and slitting throats and beating animals to death , and not calling in vets . . . if the ministry of environment does n't pull out every species . . . then everyone should be held liable . "
Peter Fricker of the Vancouver Humane Society called the allegations " appalling . "
He said the ministry should launch an investigation of Mountain View immediately and make the findings public .
The Environment Ministry said it was aware of the SPCA investigation but would not comment while it is under way .
Bill Peters , national director of the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums , referred questions about humane euthanasia practices to Doug Whiteside , president of the Canadian Association of Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians .
Whiteside told The Province that " euthanasia should always be performed . . . [ so ] that the animal 's induced death is as peaceful , humane and as quick as possible . "
Whiteside also said that in his experience , euthanasia should generally be performed by lethal injection .
Thomas Knight and the seven employees claim that vets are generally not used for euthanasia at Mountain View and lethal injection is avoided because if drugs are present in animal carcasses , they can not be " fed out " to the African wild dogs at Mountain View .
" For the staff , it is made clear that [ the reason ] is cost savings , " Knight said .
In a separate interview , a senior employee said : " We do n't have vets coming in because it costs a lot . . .
If [ a euthanasia drug ] is in the carcass , it would kill the [ African ] dogs . . . and you can't feed [ dead animals ] out if you do the necropsy .
The employees alleged that animals were euthanized with a .22 gauge rifle by Mountain View director and facilities manager Vince Beier , even though " he has been told by infuriated staff repeatedly to use a stronger gun . "
They say one case occurred on the night of Oct. 17 , 2008 , when Knight says he was asked to come with Beier to the pen that held a healthy addax -- a screwhorn antelope -- named Aras .
Aras was a " runt " and " was cute as hell , " one current employee said in a separate interview .
" He was spunky -- he'd get his butt kicked [ by other animals ] but find the courage to fight back . "
Aras was shot six times in the head with a .22 because management decided he was " excess cost , " Knight alleged .
" It was running around after we shot it , " Knight said .
" [ Beier ] ran out of bullets and did n't know what to do . . .
I told him , ' You 'd better finish it .
Go and get a real goddamn gun . ' "
Beier said he could not use the larger gun stored on property because " the neighbours will hear it and they might wonder what is happening , " Knight said .
Knight said Beier then hit Aras in the head about 10 times with a claw hammer , but " that did n't finish it . "
" It was bleeding .
It was screaming , " Knight said . " [ So ] he slit its throat -- and did a really bad job of it . "
Aras bled to death after about 30 minutes , Knight says , while Beier said " just wait , it will die eventually . "
Knight alleges that Gordon Blankstein knows the details about the allegedly botched euthanasia of Aras and the methods generally used in other cases by Beier , but has not ordered a change in euthanasia protocol .
Two employees said that in another case five years ago , they witnessed an addax named Guido euthanized by Beier with about six shots from a .22 rifle .
In a separate case on April 10 , 2008 , a Cuvier 's gazelle named Coco was found injured and slated for euthanization , they said .
Beier decided to kill the gazelle by slitting its throat with a box cutter , employees allege .
One worker said that he and Beier got in a shouting match and that he begged Beier , without success , to use a gun .
" I had to hold [ the gazelle ] in my arms while it was bleeding " for about five minutes , the employee said .
The employee went on to say that he was even more traumatized by the case of a gerenuk -- a long - necked antelope -- named Ferdinand .
He said that Ferdinand was observed limping on June 10 , 2005 .
Staff pleaded for a vet , to no avail .
Ferdinand 's leg eventually fell off and the animal died in December of 2005 .
" It took six months until the tissue rotted away until only a tendon was holding the leg on , " the employee said .
" If it would have been cast , he would have been alive today .
It scarred me pretty bad . "
Beier could not be reached for comment .
Blankstein responded specifically to Knight 's version of the euthanization of Aras in October in 2008 by saying : " I do n't believe it 's factual . "
He said that sometimes at the centre , a euthanasia drug is prescribed by vets and used by staff to put animals down .
Other times , he said , " sick and injured " animals are " euthanized properly " and fed directly to the African dogs .
But Blankstein denied that a .22 rifle is used by Beier in order to conceal shootings from neighbours .
" No , not .22 gauge .
We have rifles , " he said .
" The SPCA has looked at that . . .
They are euthanized properly . "
SPCA officials declined to comment on specifics of the allegations .
Explaining the rationale for feeding out dead animals , Blankstein said : " If [ the African dogs ] can't gorge , they can't be put back in the wild .
We 've been [ feeding out carcasses ] for 25 years and we do n't have a problem with it . "
Blankstein acknowledged that " not every animal [ that dies at Mountain View ] is necropsied .
Whiteside , president of the Canadian Association of Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians , said " there are no current rules regarding the feeding of killed ungulates to carnivores in a zoo situation . "
Kip Parker , a former zookeeper at the Metro Toronto Zoo , who wrote the zoo 's award - winning manual for best practices , said there are legal and ethical concerns with feeding out animals , but it could be appropriate in limited circumstances .
" In any responsible zoo , when an animal dies or is euthanized , a necropsy should be performed to determine cause of death , " Parker said .
Several of the current and former staff members said they have suffered stress and depression resulting from witnessing alleged animal neglect at Mountain View .
" It 's not uncommon for staff members to be medicated for depression , " said one long - time ex-employee .
" You start to see that [ animals ] will die a horrible , painful death . "
Thomas Knight and a current employee both say that in one recent case , Indian rhinoceros Ivan broke his horn off while bumping his head inside his pen .
" Gordon refused to call in a veterinarian , and instead told us to cauterize the wound , " the employees alleged .
" Doing so would have damaged the tissue and probably prevented proper regrowth of the horn . "
Knight and several employees alleged that Ivan poses the most severe public - safety risk at Mountain View , because the powerful beast is only restrained by deer fencing and an electrical wire that 's damaged .
They say Blankstein has been told about the wire but refuses to fix it .
" [ The rhino ] will rampage through Fort Langley , " Knight feared .
Blankstein categorically denied all allegations -- including those of animal neglect and cruelty at Mountain View , and that they are driven by any move to save money .
He stressed that the centre is well - run and yearly budgets are stable .
" Vets are brought in as needed [ and ] always have been , " he said .
Blankstein reasoned that Knight and other former employees are disgruntled and trying to " smear " Mountain View with skewed evidence .
" This stuff is just not factual , " Blankstein said .
" There probably will be a court case and these individuals had better be prepared . "
Mountain View 's animal population does experience a number of deaths and injuries , Blankstein acknowledged , but he stressed that endangered species have unique underlying health issues , and Mountain View 's practices are necessarily different from standard zoos ' because animals are conditioned to return to the wild .
" A lot of these animals are highly inbred because the populations are so small , " he said .
" They are susceptible to [ disease and sickness ] and they are harder to take care of [ and ] keep alive . "
Finally , Blankstein countered the employees ' version of Ivan 's injury .
He said the bloody photo they provided The Province and other authorities as proof of neglect should not be taken out of context .
" [ At Mountain View ] , animals are in large enclosures and they get to live in terrain where they can hurt themselves , [ so ] when the rhino bangs its horn on a tree and it breaks off , [ these ] things occur , " he said .
" They get to be animals .
They do n't get to be lab rats . "
Blankstein said he does not believe the two recent giraffe deaths were caused by hypothermia , and said that Mountain View is cooperating with the B.C. SPCA to determine the cause of death .
Mountain View cruelty allegations require government inquiry December 16 , 2009 Peter Fricker Vancouver Sun Community of Interest
The allegations of animal cruelty at the Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre in Langley have shocked the public .
The alleged incidents described by eight current and former Mountain View staff are truly horrifying and demand a full investigation by the provincial Ministry of the Environment ( MOE ) , which regulates zoos in B.C .
The management at Mountain View has denied the allegations and suggested they are merely part of a " smear " by a few disgruntled employees .
Only a full official investigation can establish all the facts , but suspicions about the motives of the staff are unfair and misplaced .
I sat in a room with seven of the Mountain View staff , along with other representatives of the Vancouver Humane Society , Zoocheck Canada and the media , and listened to three hours of detailed allegations concerning Mountain View 's operations .
These people were qualified , experienced animal care professionals , many with degrees in conservation or related disciplines .
They were articulate but clearly distraught about what they were revealing - some cried when they related their stories , which were backed by photographs and written records .
They were also extremely fearful about lawsuits they cannot afford to fight , losing their jobs or having their future careers in wildlife conservation ruined .
Their fear of Mountain View 's management was palpable .
There have been suggestions in the media that because some of the staff have joined a union , the allegations are just part of some labour dispute .
This is a red herring , as the staff 's complaints having nothing to do with their pay and conditions - they are about animal welfare .
The staff joined a union in hopes of affording themselves a measure of protection once their allegations became public .
It should not be forgotten that one of the former staff , Thomas Knight , has gone on the record with his allegations , which corroborate accounts given by other staff members .
Further corroboration is given in today 's Province , by a former manager at Mountain View .
Suggestions that all the allegations are all anonymous are simply wrong .
And what about the two that giraffes died three weeks ago during cold weather ?
That is a fact that cannot be denied and those deaths should merit an MOE investigation regardless of all the allegations .
It has also been suggested that because Mountain View has had a previously good reputation , the allegations cannot possibly be true .
I think Tiger Woods ' fans might advise that this is not always a valid defence .
The best way to get to the truth about what has been happening at Mountain View is a full - fledged investigation by the MOE .
The BC SPCA 's investigation into the facility , already underway , may be limited to very recent incidents and confined to the society 's powers under the Criminal Code and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act .
For example , it is not in the BC SPCA 's remit to investigate the staff allegations concerning public safety at the facility .
The MoE is responsible for regulating zoos in B.C.
It has worked in partnership with Mountain View on several projects , most notably the Vancouver Island Marmot Recovery Program .
It is currently accepting permit applications from captive animal facilities , including Mountain View .
Only the MOE can determine whether Mountain View is fit to receive a permit .
Despite the clear responsibility the MOE holds for regulating zoos it has yet to establish standards for zoos in B.C. Instead it plans to use Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums ( CAZA ) standards , which Mountain View already meets .
( It has been an accredited member of CAZA since 2006 , following its one and only CAZA inspection . )
Will the MOE consider giving Mountain View a permit without first determining whether there is any substance to the allegations against the facility ?
December 17 , 2009
Thirteen more former employees have come forward to corroborate information first brought forward by eight people last week .
Carmina Gooch has written to the BC government and received a reply from the Ministry of Environment on January 18 , 2010 .
In part : On behalf of the Honourable Barry Penner , Minister of Environment , thank you for your email of December 17 , 2009 , regarding Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre facilities in Fort Langley , British Columbia ( BC ) .
In BC , the Ministry of Environment is responsible for permitting and monitoring captive wildlife as defined under the BC Wildlife Act .
The wildlife species at Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre , which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Environment , include the Spotted Owl , Vancouver Island Marmot and Oregon Spotted Frog .
As such , the Ministry has been providing oversight and ongoing supervision of the breeding programs associated with these species at risk .
A recent visit to the site by wildlife management staff indicated that a high standard of care and husbandry practices associated with these provincially regulated breeding programs continues to be maintained .
The welfare of non-wildlife or exotic animals in captivity is governed by the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act , which is administered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands .
This Act enables the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to monitor and address issues involving the care and welfare of exotic animals .

There has been no response from the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands .
Mountain View centre must be accountable for welfare of captive animals January 22 , 2010 By Peter Fricker , VHS for the Georgia Straight
The deaths of two giraffes at the Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre in Langley raise a simple question :
Why ?
According to necropsy results , one of the two died of peracute mortality syndrome , which has been associated with captive giraffes being kept in cooler climates instead of their natural tropical climate .
Basically , the giraffes die when their diet does n’t ensure they have enough fat to withstand cold temperatures .
( The necropsy results for the second giraffe — a three - month old baby — have not been made public . )
The syndrome is not new , having been researched since 1978 .
( One literature review even cites cases going as far back as 1854 . )
A 2005 study makes specific recommendations on how to prevent PMS : “ to reduce the risk of serous fat atrophy in captive giraffe , the provision of adequate levels of energy in the diet would appear to be the most effective preventative step ... Persistent exposure to temperatures below 20 °C should be avoided unless the energy intake can be substantially increased . ”
Yet Mountain View was keeping its giraffes in an unheated barn during freezing temperatures last December .
What ’s more , according to media reports , the consultant veterinarian for the centre said the giraffes were not getting enough energy in their diet and were therefore not retaining enough fat .
His reported prescription for keeping captive giraffes alive was simple : “ You need a diet that is as good as possible , good ventilation , insulation and warm housing .
That ’s all you need . ”
But a good enough diet and warm housing were precisely what Mountain View failed to provide .
The centre has been described as “ world class ” and “ superb ” by the Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums , yet it apparently was unaware of the well - studied problem of captive giraffe mortality .
Veterinary science aside , would n’t it be common sense to provide heat to tropical animals during sub -zero temperatures ?
Other captive animal facilities seem to think so ; a quick Google search found that zoos in Seattle , Dublin , and Bristol ( all with climates similar to Vancouver ’s ) provide heated barns for their giraffes .
Even the Greater Vancouver Zoo , which is no stranger to criticism about its animal care , has a heated giraffe barn .
Lack of heat for animals is among the allegations made in December by a group of current and former Mountain View staff .
In a document provided to the Vancouver Humane Society and Zoocheck Canada just days before the giraffes died , they stated : “ Heat is a serious issue at Mountain View ... many of the tropical species get no heat at all during the winter months ( e.g. zebras , giraffe , addax , sable antelope ) and the rest get far less heat than they need . ”
Their criticism was subsequently echoed by Douglas Richardson , a former manager who worked at the centre in 2003 - 04 , who told one newspaper , “ One of the main animal - welfare problems I tried to deal with was the lack of heating for the giraffes . ”
He was terminated in 2004 .
Mountain View ’s response to media questions about the giraffe deaths has been complete denial of responsibility .
“ All I know is we ’ve had giraffes for 10 years and there has never [ before ] been an issue , ” said spokesperson Malcolm Weatherstone to one reporter .
Only after the giraffes died , and under orders from the B.C. SPCA , did the centre install heating for its remaining giraffes .
The SPCA ’s investigation into other allegations made by the staff group is still underway , and it remains to be seen if any charges will be laid .
But one thing is clear : in December , an animal designed by nature to live under the African sun died needlessly in a freezing cold barn in Canada .
The technical question of why this happened has been answered by the necropsy .
But the moral question of why the giraffes died has not .
The giraffes at Mountain View are not being bred for return to the wild .
They are not part of any accredited species survival plan .
( They are not endangered . )
So why are they there ?
Presumably , they provide some pleasure for those who take the guided tours Mountain View makes available to the public .
Or do they just satisfy a need , common to pre-adolescent boys and some zookeepers , to just collect living things ?
Whatever the reason , people and institutions who keep exotic animals should be held accountable for their welfare .
The B.C. SPCA has limited powers and cannot do this alone .
The B.C. Ministry of the Environment , which regulates zoos in the province , has been virtually silent on the controversy .
The ministry must decide whether to grant Mountain View an operating permit before April 1 this year .
Will it do so while this cloud hangs over the centre ?
It should conduct a full investigation of the centre to determine if it is fit to operate .
Only the ministry can set and enforce standards that could ensure tragedies like the giraffe deaths will not occur again .
Otherwise the welfare of zoo animals in B.C. will depend on the courage of whistle - blowers like the Mountain View staff .
As even they would agree , that ’s just not good enough .
Mountain View giraffe 's fate in vet 's hands today February 2 , 2010 By John Bermingham , The Province Jerome the friendly giant will be in a fight for his life tomorrow at a controversial Fort Langley zoo .
The young male giraffe , which lives at the Mountain View Conservation Centre , has overgrown hoofs and may have to be euthanized if the job of shearing them does n't work .
The veterinarian who'll decide , Dr. Bruce Burton , said he 'll do everything he can to keep Jerome alive .
" He 's probably one of the nicest giraffes you 'll meet , " Burton told The Province yesterday from his Abbotsford practice .
" If we do not think we can help him , unfortunately , we are probably going to have to euthanize him . "
Two giraffes died at the facility in December , and the facility is under SPCA investigation for animal cruelty and neglect .
Jerome , who stands five to six metres high and weighs over 2,000 pounds , will be put under anesthetic in a stall padded with hay .
Burton said it 's vital his neck stay elevated , to avoid bursting blood vessels .
" If [ the neck ] comes down , it can be fatal , " he said .
" They just do n't tolerate anesthetics very well . "
The SPCA ordered the procedure done this week because Jerome has difficulty walking and looks in pain .
" I have some serious concerns , " said SPCA animal protection officer Eileen Drever .
" The investigation is ongoing . "
Mountain View spokesman Malcolm Weatherston insisted that giraffes have n't been neglected .
" It 's just a very unfortunate series of coincidences , " he said .
If Jerome dies , it would halve the Masai giraffe population to three , in as many months .
Todd Streu , who speaks for 30 current and former workers at Mountain View , blamed Jerome 's plight on neglect .
The zoo is not providing heat , diet or veterinary care , he said .
Streu said Jerome 's hoofs should have been shorn months ago .
Peter Fricker of the Vancouver Humane Society said the B.C. government is ignoring the issue -- " just washing its hands . "
But B.C. Environment Minister Barry Penner said his ministry is keeping a close eye on the situation at Mountain View .
February 5 , 2010 Sadly , Jerome died , while under sedation for surgery .
This prompted an outcry from the public , with many people , like Carmina Gooch , choosing to contact the media , reporters , the SPCA , and the provincial government .
Legislation to protect our animals under the PCA
Act is n’t strong enough and neither is federal legislation .
Animals are still considered property in Canada , despite public urging of Bill C - 229 to be passed into law .
Convictions under the Criminal Code of Canada are virtually impossible , as “ intent ” has to be proven .
Despite the first major changes to BC ’s Wildlife Act in 25 years with the passage of Bill 29 in 2009 , the Controlled Alien Species Regulation , accredited zoos , research and educational institutions can continue to acquire , breed and possess the listed species , but they will be required to apply for , and be granted , a permit for each animal in their possession beginning Nov. 1 , 2009 .
The MoE must decide before April 1st , 2010 , whether to grant Mountain View an operating permit .
Individuals who are in possession of a listed animal that was in B.C. before March 16 , 2009 may be able to keep the animal until its death if they comply with a number of requirements and restrictions .
They must not breed or release the animals in question .
There are roadside zoos and private collectors in BC that have exotics .
Enforcement may prove to be a problem , particularly with individuals living in remote areas or those who have large properties .
BC SPCA recommends charges against conservation centre after deaths of three giraffes February 9 , 2010 Neal Hall - Vancouver Sun VANCOUVER —
The B.C. Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is recommending charges of animal cruelty be laid against Mountain View Conservation Centre after a six - week investigation into the care of giraffes at the Fort Langley facility .
Three giraffes have died at the facility , including an adult male named Jerome , who died on Feb.
5 after being sedated for a hoof - trimming procedure .
Marcie Moriarty , head of the BC SPCA ’s Cruelty Investigations Department , said the SPCA is waiting for necropsy results and will submit its recommendation to Crown counsel within the next few weeks , as soon as all necropsy and toxicology reports are available .
The BC SPCA first responded to a complaint about Mountain View Conservation Centre on Nov. 23 , 2009 and immediately issued an order to trim Jerome ’s hooves .
“ This procedure would normally require a squeeze — a standard piece of equipment that the centre should have had available , but did not , ” Moriarty said in a news release .
“ Under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act we are required to give animal owners a ‘ reasonable time ’ to comply with an order .
In this case we gave Mountain View four weeks to comply with the order to trim Jerome ’s hooves . ”
The SPCA made a number of follow - up visits to Mountain View , resulting in further orders being issued in December and January regarding the giraffes and other species .
“ Two giraffes died during a December cold snap and Jerome ’s condition appeared to be deteriorating , resulting in the SPCA issuing yet another order to Mountain View , " Moriarty said .
“ Mountain View ’s failure to ensure that they were adequately equipped to look after animals in their care resulted in this tragedy .
This is just unacceptable . ”
She said that because the case involved exotic wild animals , the SPCA had no choice but to leave the animals at Mountain View during the investigation .
“ This is a perfect example of why the BC SPCA fought so hard last year to see new , stricter regulations passed in B.C. regarding the trafficking and keeping of exotic animals , ” Moriarty said .
“ When a facility like Mountain View acquires giraffes and other exotic species , they have a legal and moral responsibility to provide proper care , equipment and facilities .
This investigation was extremely frustrating for the SPCA because in other animal - cruelty cases we can step in and seize an animal if orders are not followed , but with an exotic animal we do n’t have that capacity . "
The SPCA will be forwarding a recommendation for charges against the facility in the next few weeks .
March 4 , 2010 update from The Province : After winning its war this week to obtain a report on a giraffe death at the Mountain View Conservation Centre , the B.C. SPCA is now filing criminal animal - cruelty charges against the zoo .
M arcie Moriarty , head of the B.C. SPCA ’s cruelty - investigations department , said charges will be filed under both the Criminal Code and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.
Shawn Eccles , B.C. SPCA ’s chief animal - protection officer , said the maximum penalty for an animal - cruelty charge under the Criminal Code is a five - year prison term or a $ 10,000 fine .
Under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act , the maximum is six months in prison and a $ 10,000 fine .
In a March 5 CBC radio interview , VHS 's Peter Fricker said that the two options for Jerome was the risky surgery or euthanasia and that the MoE appears to have no interest in the standards or welfare of the exotic animals at Mountain View .
There is no public body to oversee facilities like Mountain View , and now the government plans to use the national not - for - profit Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums ( CAZA ) standards .
CAZA only checks facilities once every five years .
March 17 , 2010 BC SPCA ’s Marcie Moriarty said she hopes the charges will be accepted by the Crown within the next few weeks .
April 22 , 2010 Mountain
View 's directors have decided to move its exotic animals off the property during the spring and summer of 2010 and will focus instead on endangered native species instead .
Spokesperson Malcolm Weatherston did not provide further details to reporters .
The BC SPCA says it has no jurisdiction over the matter but hopes they will be sent to adequate facilities .
Crown has yet to decide on whether to lay charges .
June 15 , 2010
No animal cruelty charges laid in death of giraffe at conservation centre .
What a disappointment .
The Mountain View investigation focused primarily on Jerome the giraffe , whose hooves were so excessively overgrown that the animal had to rest on his knees at times because it was too painful for him to stand .
Crown counsel stated it is satisfied there is sufficient evidence to support the argument that Mountain View took reasonable steps to address the neglect after BC SPCA issues were ordered .
This is the second time that Crown counsel has decided against proceeding with animal cruelty recommendations against a Lower Mainland zoo .
In 2005 Crown laid charges of animal cruelty in the case of Hazina , a baby hippopotamus kept in a shed at the Greater Vancouver Zoo , but later stayed the charges after the zoo eventually complied with BC SPCA orders to build a proper facility for Hazina .
Why is it that in two cases charges have n’t stuck ?
Justice has been denied .
Willful intent of neglect or abuse must be proven under the Criminal Code of Canada ( virtually impossible ) but not under the PCA Act .
The BC government ’s reply to Carmina Gooch ’s recent concerns on this issue :
Thank you for your March 30 , 2010 e-mail regarding the federal animal cruelty laws and the penalties in British Columbia for persons convicted of animal cruelty .
It is my understanding that there is currently a bill before parliament to address changes in animal cruelty legislation at a national level .
This is a private members bill ( C - 229 ) and if passed it would move animal cruelty offences out the property area and into criminal code offences .
The maximum penalties under the British Columbia Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act are similar to those in other western Canadian provinces .
The provincial government will be initiating a review of current Animal Welfare legislation to ascertain whether new legislation to focus on animal care and protection is required in British Columbia .
You are correct in stating that authorized agents of the British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ( BCSPCA ) under the Police Act ( Act ) may only enter private property under the authority of a warrant to relieve an animal they believe , on reasonable grounds , to be in distress .
However , in extreme circumstances there are allowances in the Act to allow them entrance to almost any area , with the exception of a private dwelling , without a warrant .
Furthermore , there are clear allowances to facilitate speedy access to warrants when required .
These allow for the warrants to be issued based on the submission of information under oath by telephone or other means of communication .
Note :
While a private member ’s bill is before parliament , it has yet to make it to the floor of the House of Commons .
In March of this year private member ’s bill No. 62 was being addressed .
Mark Holland ’s is No. 141 .
There were some changes , such as stiffer penalties for more serious offences of animal cruelty , with the passage of Bill S - 203 on April 9 , 2008 .
Not nearly enough bite , though .

The truth behind animal businesses Zoos : prisons by any other name ; Toronto Zoo elephants moving , update 2015 ; Bowmanville Zoo owner seen on video abusing Siberian tiger Whistler sled dogs
Liu Qingning , deputy director of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Guangxi Regional People 's Congress , wants the National People ’s Congress to punish petitioners with stiff sentences .
Wen Jiabao instead called for better petition procedures .
In the meantime , social unrest grows in the country .
Beijing ( AsiaNews ) – Chinese citizens who petition the government to complain about abuses by local officials , a right recognised under China ’s constitution , could get up to 15 years in jail if Liu Qingning had his way .
Mr Liu , who is a member of the National People ’s Congress ( NPC ) and a deputy director of the Legal Affairs Committee of the Guangxi Regional People 's Congress , wants to put away people who “ seriously disrupt the normal life and work order of local government leaders ” .
If his proposal were accepted , it would turn a long - standing policy on its head .
Indeed , China ’s central government and President Hu Jintao have repeatedly urged ordinary citizens to blow the whistle on corrupt officials by petitioning higher authorities .
A special agency has even been set up to handle such cases to avoid burdening the regular administration .
Even Premier
Wen Jiabao in his opening address to the NPC said that the authorities should value petitions as a useful tool to prevent social conflict because it would allow the right authorities to act .
" We will improve the handling of public complaints lodged via letters and visits , " Wen said in his report .
In his view , actions allowed under current petition rules , like demanding compensation from local government , should be criminalised if they were repeated and caused " serious consequences " .
These actions include chanting slogans , unfurling banners , distributing printed or written material , staging sit-ins , blocking exits of buildings , occupying or overstaying in petition offices , suicide attempts and self - harm .
A jail sentence of up to three years would be given to petitioners when they are involved in one such action , rising to seven to 15 years for " particularly serious cases " .
The proposal by Liu Qingning was slammed by internet users , lawyers and petitioners .
Many wondered whether he was a representative of the people or of “ corrupt officials ” .
Others suggested that he had the mindset of a feudal lord .
One well - known Chinese blogger , Wu Yonglin , made a counterproposal , suggesting that China ’s criminal code be amended to make it a criminal offence when officials fail to do their best in handling complaints and petitions from the public .
In the meantime , social unrest and protests against local government continue across China .
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences released its 2010 Rule of Law Blue Book at the end of February .
In it , it said that the number of criminal and civil cases in China increased substantially in the first ten months of 2009 , reaching 5.3 million and 9.9 million respectively , with the former rising by over 10 per cent and the latter by about 20 per cent .
It found that the rising crime rate and growing social unrest are directly related to the financial crisis and the vagaries of China 's economy .
This year , things could get worse .
In fact , the country has not yet completely recovered from the slump in spite of rising industrial output .
What is more , it still has major social problems to solve , starting with the millions of unemployed migrant workers who are still out of work .

This comic is one of many that are based on conversations between my friend John and me about ridiculous hypothetical topics .
And I think it 's about time pirate actors got more credit for their skills .
Tactical Philanthropy is currently covering the Grantmakers for Effective Organizations conference with the help of a blog team .
This is a guest post by Carrie Avery of the Durfee Foundation .
By Carrie Avery
The two exemplary nonprofit leaders who spoke at the breakfast plenary reminded us of the importance of being patient as funders .
Speaking about his ambitious plans to replicate Manchester Bidwell Corporation ’s model in dozens of cities internationally , Bill Strickland reminded us , “ We ’re not in the miracle business , we ’re in the hard work business . ”
If we want to see the results of that hard work , we need to stick with our grantees and not expect them to deliver miracles .
Similarly , Angelica Salas of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles observed that if funders asked for a budget of her organization ’s time that used line items such as Collaboration , Coalition Building and Networking , CHIRLA would have a healthy balance sheet .
Of course , all of those strategies require large investments of time and relationship building that do n’t always show results immediately .
What ’s your timeline ?
When do you expect to see results ?
The longer I remain in this field , the more I know grantees for three , five , ten years , the more often I see how what we do as funders ( which are not always grants ) can produce long - term , often unexpected results .
At the Durfee Foundation , we have been bringing together our Sabbatical grantees ( outstanding Los Angeles leaders ) together for lunches and retreats for ten years .
Over those years , relationships between these nonprofits leaders have developed at deepened .
They have created partnerships , joined one another ’s boards , and found colleagues outside of their organizations to call to bounce ideas off of .
The longer we host these gatherings , the more the relationships deepen .
Patience pays off .

For those old enough to remember the suffering of the war , the rise of Jobbik feels like a frightening case of deja vu .
" Though I was only six years old in 1944 when the Arrow Cross came to power , I remember the reign of terror that followed , " said Maria Juhasz , a Budapest pensioner .
" I remember when they took away the Jews , including our village doctor , and the young men they hanged at the side of the road with placards round their necks saying ' This is the fate of deserters ' .
The Hungarian Guard and Jobbik , the uniforms , the language and rhetoric all remind me of the Arrow Cross and that era . "
Prévention de la délinquance : le FIPD 2010 revu à la hausse
Financement
Publié le 09/03/2010 • Par Hervé Jouanneau • dans :
A la une , Actu prévention sécurité , Documents utiles , France , Veille documentaire prévention - sécurité
En augmentation de 33 % par rapport à 2009 , le fonds interministériel devra être principalement consacré à la vidéosurveillance .
Destiné à financer les actions locales conduites par les collectivités et les associations , le fonds interministériel de prévention de la délinquance ( FIPD ) s’élèvera à 49,1 millions d’euros pour l’année 2010 , en augmentation de 33 % par rapport à 2009 .
C’est ce qui ressort de la circulaire du 5 mars transmise aux préfets par le secrétariat général du Comité interministériel de prévention de la délinquance .
Une révision à la hausse , directement imputable aux récents arbitrages interministériels à Matignon , qui ont abondé de 13 millions d’euros de crédits supplémentaires le montant voté en décembre par le Parlement dans le cadre du collectif budgétaire ( 35 millions d’euros ) auquel s’ajoute le report des crédits non consommés l’année dernière ( 1,1 millions d’euros ) .
Quatre mois après la présentation du plan national de prévention de la délinquance , le FIPD bénéficie ainsi d’une relance budgétaire significative .
A titre de comparaison , il s’élevait à 37 millions d’euros en 2009 , 40,5 millions d’euros en 2008 et 73,6 millions d’euros en 2007 , année de sa création .
En outre , conformément à la volonté gouvernementale , les crédits du FIPD , dont la répartition est pour la première fois chiffrée par la circulaire , devront être majoritairement consacrés à la vidéosurveillance :
30 millions d’euros ( soit 61,1 % de l’enveloppe globale ) seront dédiés au financement des projets de vidéosurveillance , de voie publique mais également dans les établissements scolaires ( le FIPD pouvant intervenir jusqu’à 50 % du coût du projet ) ,
6,1 millions d’euros , ( soit 12,4 % de l’enveloppe globale ) seront consacrés au « financement des autres actions de prévention de la délinquance et d’aide aux victimes » , dont la maîtrise d’ouvrage est assurée par les collectivités locales ,
13 millions d’euros ( soit 26,5 % de l’enveloppe globale ) financeront les actions de prévention portées par les associations .
A propos de ces deux dernières enveloppes , la circulaire invite les préfets à financer en priorité le maintien des emplois déjà existants d’intervenants sociaux et de référents « violences conjugales » et d’aide aux victimes .
Sont également éligibles les actions de prévention de la récidive , de soutien à la parentalité , de prévention de la violence en milieu scolaire ou encore de médiation sociale et d’aide au fonctionnement du partenariat local ( postes de coordonnateurs , par exemple ) .
Les exclues du financement
Sont en revanche exclus du financement : les mesures de prévention et de lutte contre la toxicomanie , les mesures de sécurité routière , les dispositifs d’accès au droit ( Maisons de justice et du droit , points d’accès au droit ) et les opérations « ville , vie , vacances » .
Autant d’actions , qui , selon la circulaire , peuvent bénéficier d’autres sources de financement national .
Par ailleurs , les études préalables , études d’évaluation , actions de formation et de communication ne pourront pas bénéficier de crédits supérieurs à 15000 euros .
Enfin , au titre de l’évaluation , la circulaire demande aux préfets de dresser un bilan annuel des actions financées par le FIPD .
Mesure inédite , «au moins 20 % des organismes ayant perçu une aide » , pour un projet autre que la vidéosurveillance , feront l’objet « d ’une visite suivie d’un rapport écrit » par des fonctionnaires d’Etat .
The distance between being a Jesus Freak and being a Ziggy devotee turned out to be vanishingly small .
By accepting “ Bowie ’s star - crossed glam Christ ” ( David Fricke1 ) as My Personal Savior , I was simply substituting one leper messiah for another — the Jesus of Cool for Jesus ; a demon lover for a Sweet Savior .
Of course , Bowie was the perfect choice for a surrogate Jesus .
More than any other rock star , he invites ( demands ? ) deification .
This has partly to do with the messianic sense of destiny that propelled him to rock godhood — a precocious child ’s sense of specialness , inflated to Übermenschen extremes by the Nietzsche his older brother Terry introduced him to at an impressionable age .
( “ I always had a repulsive sort of need to be something more than human , ” Bowie confesses in George Tremlett ’s David Bowie : Living on the Brink .
“ I thought , ‘ Fuck that , I want to be a Superman . ’” 2 ) Becoming Ziggy , onstage and off , from ’ 72 through ’ 74 , completed his transfiguration into the doomed alien savior of his dreams ( a volatile mix of Nietzschean will - to - power fantasies and a martyr complex ) .
His Svengali - like manager ’s strategy of limiting media access to the divinity fixed the image of Bowie as aloof and otherworldly in the public mind .
By the New Wave era , says Ann Magnuson ( a boldfaced name on New York ’s downtown scene in the late ‘ 70s and early ‘ 80s ) , Bowie “ had turned into something godlike to certain kids who loved the weird , the edgy , the arty , and the glam .
By that point , he had become deified . ”
3
For those with eyes to see it , there had always been a nimbus of religiosity around Bowie , whose metaphoric language is shot through with spiritual symbolism and religious references .
A Talmudic study of his lyrics , cross-referenced with a close psychoanalytic reading of his life , reveals an inveterate seeker , hungry for gnosis — the hermetic wisdom that will unriddle the metaphysical questions that nag him .
Bowie ’s pilgrimage has taken him through Buddhism to the alien saviors of science fiction and flying - saucer theology and mystical traditions ranging from kabbalism to English magician - scholars such as Aleister Crowley and A.E. Waite to the dimestore occultism of Dion Fortune ’s Psychic Self - Defense to the Maronite Christian mysticism of Kahlil Gibran , whose The Prophet , like Hermann Hesse ’s Siddhartha , was a pick - up - line staple at ‘ 60s love -ins .
Bowie entered his Dharma Bum phase around 1965 , after discovering Tibetan Buddhism through Heinrich Harrer ’s 1952 book Seven Years in Tibet , a title he lifted for a song on his 1997 album Earthling .
( His passion for the Beats , more intellectual trickledown from Terry , had pointed the way to Buddhism , as well . )
Immersing himself deeply in Buddhist practice , he studied with the exiled Tibetan lama Chimi Youngdong Rimpoche and seriously considered becoming a monk .
Bowie memorialized this period in “ Silly Boy Blue ” ( 1966 ) , a psychedelic travelogue starring a Tibetan Buddhist chela ( disciple ) who flouts the rules of his order .
“ It ’s telling that Bowie ’s lyric , while full of Tibetan Buddhist imagery ( the references to chelas and overselves , etc. ) , still sympathizes with the young monk who ca n’t pay attention , who ’s a bit at odds with his culture , ” notes Chris O’Leary on his Bowie blog Pushing Ahead of the Dame : David Bowie , Song by Song .
“ Even in the midst of worship , Bowie has an eye for the heretics . ”
4
By 1971 , Bowie was wading into darker waters .
In his majestic hymn to spiritual exhaustion , “ Quicksand ” ( Hunky Dory ) , he name - checks the notorious occultist and self - styled “ Wickedest Man in the World ” Aleister Crowley and the Golden Dawn , a hermetic order with which Crowley was associated , alongside references to Nietzsche , Nazi occultism , and , fleetingly , Tibetan Buddhism .
Later , in 1975 - ’76 , when he was living in L.A. while working on Station to Station ( 1976 ) , Bowie would burrow much deeper into the occult .
Descending into a drug - warped Dark Night of the Soul , he spent days without sleep , sustained by cocaine as he tried to change the channels on his TV telekinetically , scrawled protective magical symbols on the walls , and buttonholed anyone within earshot about the Nazis ’ quest for the Holy Grail and the witches who wanted to steal his semen .
To create a baby .
To sacrifice to Satan.5
In his essay , “ Occult Rock , ” Greg Taylor discerns traces of Bowie ’s occult dabblings on the eponymous title track of Station to Station , where Bowie “ references the Kabbalah … with the line ‘ one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth , ’ talks of ‘ flashing no color ’ ( part of the Eastern occult Tattva system ) , and also makes a sly tip of the hat to Aleister Crowley ’s book of pornographic poems White Stains in the very last line of the song .
The album ’s art ( at least on the CD version ) also includes a picture of Bowie sketching the Kabbalistic Tree of Life on the floor . ”
6
Fascinatingly , the record also includes an achingly beautiful prayer of a song , “ Word on a Wing ” :
Just because I believe do n’t mean I do n’t think as well
Do n’t have to question everything in heaven or hell …
Lord , I kneel and offer you my word on a wing
And I ’m trying hard to fit among your scheme of things
It ’s safer than a strange land , but I still care for myself
And I do n’t stand in my own light
Lord , lord , my prayer flies like a word on a wing
My prayer flies like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in with your scheme of things ?
In 1999 , Bowie told an audience the song was a product of “ the darkest days of my life … I ’m sure that it was a call for help . ” 7
Soaringly emotional , “ Word on a Wing ” is unabashedly hymn - like , inviting interpretation of Station to Station as a Manichaean struggle between occultism and Christianity .
But it is “ Quicksand , ” more than any other song , that most eloquently articulates the tension in Bowie ’s artistic psyche between belief and disbelief ( of the scarifying , Nietzschean sort as well as the soul - sick existentialist variety ) .
“ I ’m torn between the light and dark , ” he sings .
“ I ’m sinking in the quicksand of my thought . ”
Hedging his bets , he stacks some of his chips on atheism ( or at least cynicism ) , sneering , “ Ca n’t take my eyes from the great salvation / of bullshit faith , ” then makes an about - face , paying lip service to the Buddhism of his hippie days : “ If I do n’t explain what you ought to know /
You can tell me all about it /
On the next Bardo . ”
Finally , just to keep his bases covered , he makes an offering at the empty altar of existentialism : “ Do n’t believe in yourself / Do n’t deceive with belief / Knowledge comes with death ’s release … ”
“ Questioning my spiritual life has always been germane to what I was writing , ” he told an interviewer in 2002 .
“ Always .
It ’s because I ’m not quite an atheist and it worries me .
There ’s that little bit that holds on : ‘ Well , I ’m almost an atheist . [ … ]
There ’s just one niggling thing .
Once I shave that off , we ’ll be fine and dandy , and there wo n’t be any questions left . ’
It ’s either my saving grace or a major problem that I ’m going to have to confront . ”

It would be foolish of me to claim to represent Britain 's " youth vote " , but I would like to share some thoughts about my first opportunity to participate in a general election , and the relationship between politicians and young people .
I have , in fact , voted once before – in the gym of my local primary school , for the European elections last year – and I found it particularly disappointing .
In the end I voted for the Green party , but my lasting memory is of the old man whose sole job seemed to be pushing the large ballot papers into the ballot box with a ruler .
As I walked back up the hill to my house with my mum and two brothers , thinking about the tiny implications of my ballot - crossing , I felt profoundly underwhelmed by democracy .
I hope now that my disappointment was caused more by a considerable sense of insignificance , given the size and facelessness of the EU , rather than early disillusionment at the state of politics .
In recent weeks , though , my sense of optimism for democracy has been renewed , despite the fact that I live in a safe Conservative seat where my vote will be utterly irrelevant .
Perhaps this explains at least some of my electoral excitement – the possibility of proportional representation and the potential value of my vote in future general elections .
The prospect of a hung parliament is peculiarly attractive to me ; it feels like one big act of political rebellion .
Now that we apparently live in a three - party system , I can only look jealously on as my friends vote in swing constituencies .
Some of them ( though not me ) are currently at posh universities , and so , perhaps unsurprisingly , almost all of them are planning to vote Tory .
I would like to think that they have at least carefully weighed up party policies and have reached their unfortunate conclusions painfully , but it seems more likely that they are merely attracted by the prospect of low taxes on the types of career they plan to pursue .
Perhaps this has been the most striking aspect of my first general election : the extent to which people vote purely according to their own interest .
My dad , too , has voted Labour in the past , despite disagreeing with most of their policies , as a token of his gratitude for letting him live in Britain ( he came from Turkey in 1976 ) .
Nevertheless , I find it quite depressing that so many of my friends are voting Conservative at only 19 .
But at least they are voting .
Indeed , I know 17 - year - olds who plan on trying to vote and some friends who say they will vote twice .
I 'm not sure if they are serious , but I suppose it is better than widespread political apathy .
And in the past , who could have criticised youth apathy ?
Historically , young people do not vote and so parties waste little time in courting their vote .
The few attempts to break this self - perpetuating cycle – by claiming an interest in the Arctic Monkeys or the Killers – are at best condescending and transparent .
If one message has been reaffirmed during this campaign , after the embarrassing Bucks Fizz karaoke , is that British politics cannot and should not act cool .
While friends were enjoying their first term at university , I spent three - and - a - half months after leaving school in rural Chile where there was also a general election .
Despite the unbelievable number of campaign posters in little Coyhaique , the activists dressed up as Barney the Dinosaur and the portable bands playing campaign songs in the back of pickup trucks , I was told that the youth vote was still not high .
( Not even a ban on the sale of alcohol 48 hours before the vote to prevent hungover Chilenos sleeping through election day seemed to help . )
All of which must tell us that policies and not gimmicks will bring young people back to politics .
This is perhaps a small reason for the surge of Liberal Democrat support and the recent online registration of thousands of new voters .
Their policies – to scrap tuition fees , their opposition to the Iraq war and their plan to scrap cold - war weapons systems – resonate with the pragmatic idealism of youth .
In Britain , the TV debate and the prospect of electoral reform , from my limited perspective , seems to have renewed youth interest in voting .
It would be a shame to waste it again by further patronising young people .

Italian school angers the Vatican by installing condom machines on campus
The Vatican today condemned a controversial decision by an Italian school to install a condom machine on its campus , saying it ' trivialises sex . '
Cardinal Agostino Vallini , the Pope 's chief vicar of the diocese of Rome , spoke out after the dispensers were installed in the boys and girls toilets of the Keplero secondary school .
Cardinal Vallini said he was ' very worried ' by the move , which is the first of its kind in an Italian school , and added : ' This trivialises sex and will not find agreement in the Church community of Rome or with Christan families who will be seriously considered about children 's education . '
Cardinal Agostino Vallini , pictured with Pope Benedict XVI , has spoken out against an Italian school 's decision to install condom machines
The Roman Catholic Church is strictly against the use of condoms and any other form of contraception - although privately some priests are in favour of them to cut down the spread of AIDS especially in Africa .
Council officials approved the installation of the machines after meeting with student representatives and they will sell three condoms for € 2 ( £ 1.80 ) , which is around half the usual retail price in chemists .
Aids campaigners have welcomed the machines and they hope to install them across the country and are planning a campaign with the slogan : ' Want to make Love ?
Then use your head get your school to install condom machines . '
Today students at the Keplero , which is three miles south of the Vatican , also backed their introduction with many saying it was the 'logical way to cut down on pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases . '
A teenage boy interviewed on Italian TV news said : ' It 's a good ides because it also cuts out the embarrassment of going to the chemist and buying condoms and also they are cheaper at school . '
Headmaster Luigi Barbato said : ' We decided to introduce these machines after talks with the students and with council chiefs .
It was agreed unanimously even by the parents .
According to he latest figures available from the Italian Ministry of health the teenage pregnancy rate is six per 1000 girls aged between 15 and 19 , compared to 26.4 in the United Kingdom - one of the highest in Europe .
In a recent survey of 7482 students in Italy by the Ministry of Health on sexual knowledge 18 per cent admitted regularly having intercourse without using a condom , which officials said had contributed to rises in sexually transmitted diseases .
The Keperlo school , which specialises in science and technology , is named after Johannes Kepler , a German 17th Century mathematician , astronomer and astrologer , who defended and cleared his mother when she was accused of being a witch .
In Britain the issue of condom machines in schools has caused controversy .
Some schools have announced they are considering such a move but so far none have introduced the machines .
Last month it was revealed that Labour was considering the use of machines in schools as part of its drive to cut down on the country 's teenage pregancy rate but critics have labelled the idea as a ' disaster . '
Researcher and author Patricia Morgan said : ' They say they want to help girls resist pressure for early sex but this will encourage the opposite .
' It will legitimise sex - far from helping girls resist pressure , it will help boys bully girls into sex . '

In addition to marking the 40th anniversary of Earth Day , this week also marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope -- the first of NASA 's four " great observatories " launched to observe the heavens from the heavens .
( The other three are the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory , which was deorbited in 2000 , and the Chandra X- ray Observatory and the Infrared Spitzer Space Telescope , both of which are still working ) .
Hubble , of course , is the best - known of the four , since it collects data in the visual range of light waves , giving us the spectacular Eagle Nebula starbirth photos , the Deep Field image of thousands of galaxies hidden in a tiny dark point of space , and a multitude of other awe - inspiring glimpses of the universe beyond our physical reach .
But the Hubble also represents a rare collision of worlds far closer to home , within NASA itself .
Because for 20 years , it has been one of the only NASA programs to merge the human space flight side of NASA with the agency 's scientific and robotic space flight contingent .
The Hubble itself is a scientific instrument that does its work remotely , like any other scientific satellite .
But unlike almost all other satellites , it was hand - launched by astronauts from the bay of the Space Shuttle and has been repaired by human astronauts no fewer than five times .
So in the highly segmented world of NASA , is the Hubble a triumph and justification for human space flight ?
Or proof that we can be equally thrilled , excited and humbled by our robotic explorations in space ... and proof of how much more we can learn from non-human voyages and missions ?
Dr. Story Musgrave has a unique perspective on the question , because he is , on the one hand , one of the most experienced and longest - serving astronauts in NASA 's human space flight program , a veteran of six space missions over the course of a 30 - year career .
But he also worked on the development of the Hubble from 1975 onward and was one of the lead astronauts on the famous 1993 Hubble repair mission that corrected several early problems with the telescope , including a serious flaw in its primary mirror .
And in an interview I did with him in anticipation of the Hubble anniversary , he was very clear about what he thinks NASA 's priorities should be .
" Thank God they decided [ the Hubble ] needed to be fixable by people , because there were 13 early failures , which means you had problems in the basic design , materials , or quality , " he said .
" But the non -human program is more important to me than the human program . "
Why ?
Because Hubble , Voyager , and other non-human satellites can reach further , address far more complex questions , and therefore have a far more inspiring and significant impact .
" I think [ the Hubble ] is as good a reason for being in space as there is , " Musgrave says .
" It 's not a very powerful machine , but people are massively excited about it because it's a mirror for who they are .
The whole thing about Hubble is , it gets after two existential questions .
It does n't answer them , and those questions will never be answered , but they are :
What is the meaning , and what is the hope , of life here on Earth ?
Hubble is symbolic for a knowledge machine that is potentially able to link cosmology , theology , philosophy and astronomy .
It is able to hold a mirror to humanity -- the kind of mirror that says ' What kind of universe is it , and what is our place in it ?
Who are we , and who should we be ? ' "
In contrast , Musgrave is sharply critical of the International Space Station , which he calls a " $ 100 billion mistake . "
" [ The Space Station ] does nothing for nobody and it never has , " he says .
" The cost of space station is 300 Voyager - class satellites .
We could have had multiple Voyagers landed or floating in the atmosphere on every planet and on every moon of every planet .
That is what we gave up when we went with a jobs program , which is what the space station is .
And that 's an ungodly sin .
And yes , I 'm a human space flight person , but listen to me .
That 's what we could have offered the public . "
But what about the inspiration that the astronaut program offers school children and the public at large ?
Musgrave scoffs .
" If you sent multi-media robotic machines [ into space ] , people would be unbelievably excited about going everywhere out there .
And we could have gone everywhere .
But we opted to stay in low earth orbit and do a jobs program because we had no imagination . "
So what should NASA do next ?
Would Musgrave have NASA cancel the human space flight program entirely , when the Shuttles retire ?
Not completely .
But he argues that NASA 's segmentation into human and non-human space flight is a crippling division that needs to end .
" What needs to be done is to combine the robotic program with the human program .
The programs should have been the same all along , " he says , " and they should have served one another .
I think human space flight needs to be put in partial hibernation .
You continue to develop the capability , but send the robots first .
They not only are there first to mine materials and show you how to live off the land , they themselves , in their exploration , would raise the question : do we need to send humans and , if so , where do we send them ?
The robots would pave the way , and answer your questions along the way .
But that 's not what NASA 's doing .
We 're still talking ' the human program . ' "
In that light , how does Musgrave view President Obama 's new space policy ?
He 's critical -- but not for the usual reasons people put forth about the importance of NASA centers for jobs , human space flight , the Moon , or Mars .
He has concerns about building redundant capability if the commercial sector has to build its own launch and mission control facilities , as well as concerns about the safety and viability of a commercial space effort .
" There has never been any money to be made in space except for commercial satellites , " he notes , adding that private efforts to master space flight have not fared particularly well , in terms of safety and success , over the years .
But his big critique of Obama 's policy is that it lacks what he considers two essential elements for success : specific vision , and a solid project management approach .
To Musgrave , the specific goal is unimportant -- there are valid and inspirational reasons we could go back to the Moon , or to an asteroid , or send satellites to other planets or into deep space .
All of which could help pave the way for future exploration , answer additional questions about the universe , and help develop " game - changing technologies . "
But to achieve any of those things , he said , you have to take the approach NASA made famous in the 1960s , and which successful business program managers implement every day .
" You say , here 's what I want , here 's when I need it , here 's the approach , here 's the requirement , " Musgrave explains .
" You put a Statement of Work out there , and you get the most creative people working on it , and you take the best ideas that come from that .
That 's project management .
It 's the way you drive new technology .
And that 's the way you DO something .
We 're no longer at the point where you do technology for technology 's sake and then figure out how to apply it . "
Musgrave is not a young man , and he's well aware of the obstacles to effecting change in an organization that involves as many Congressional interests and individual fiefdoms as NASA does .
He understands Congressional resistance to any changes that might affect jobs back home , as well as how entrenched the different camps at NASA are .
Indeed , he says it 's a " valid question " whether the operational structure and approach of NASA could even be changed at this point without disbanding the organization as it now stands and rebuilding a new research institution from scratch .
But Musgrave believes it still could happen .
" If you have a strong enough leader with an artistic vision of where we go next , " he says , " the public is going to get behind it .
Congress is not going to give you a good space program .
You have to create it and sell it to the public , and the public forces it to happen .
And you 've got to do that in terms of good project management with a specific and achievable goal and a specific timeline , like we did in the 1960s . "
Even if , he says , the goal has to be less costly , because the funds are more precious now .
I 've written six books for NASA and conducted hundreds of interviews with NASA managers , astronauts , employees , researchers , scientists and contractors in the course of researching those and other writing projects .
And while the issues , choices , and challenges are complex , many of Musgrave 's thoughts and critiques resonate with what I 've heard from other sources .
In any event , it 's food for thought , as the Hubble marks 20 years in space , and we start looking at what and where we explore next , and how we go about it .
A Christian group running an ad campaign on the TTC has pulled a poster that asks “ Does God care if I ’m gay ? ”
The website listed at the bottom of the ad went to a page that stated , in part , “ We know from passages throughout Scripture that God hates homosexual acts … . ”
It was part of a campaign of 24 religious questions being posed by Bus Stop Bible Studies , a Toronto - based group that runs transit ads in a number of Ontario cities .
The posters went onto the outside of busses and streetcars on March 18 .
On Wednesday , the TTC said it was reviewing the ad after a number of complaints .
Later Wednesday , Bus Stop Bible Studies took the long response to the gay question off its website .
A replacement statement read , in part , “ It has become apparent that , while one is free to ask the question , ‘ Does God care if I ’m gay ? ’ one is not so free to answer the question from a Biblical perspective . ”
On Thursday , Bus Stop Bible Studies president David Harrison told the Star that while the rest of the campaign would keep running , the “ Does God care if I ’m gay ? ” poster was being taken down .
“ It seems that some are offended that the question should even be asked , ” he said via email .
In an interview Wednesday , Harrison suggested that same - sex couples who were legally married were still sinners .
“ Who made same - sex marriage legal ? ” he asked , “ God or man ? ”
Under the Ontario Human Rights Code , the TTC can’t automatically reject advertising by religious groups .
However , Ontario Human Rights Commission spokeswoman Pascale Demers said ad sellers do have the right to turn down specific ads that discriminate against groups protected by the human rights code .
“ The Human Rights Code does not oblige anyone to take on ads from any person or group , ” said Demers .
TTC spokesman Brad Ross said that the commission ’s advertising committee looked at the listed website before approving the ad , but the page was not yet live .
The campaign is earning the transit system $ 30,000 of its annual $ 15 million in ad revenue .
“ We need to sort out what we mean by religious freedom , ” said Rev. Brent Hawkes of the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto , which performs same - sex marriages .
Hawkes called the message on the Bus Stop Bible Studies page “ despicable ” and “ an abysmal interpretation of scripture . ”
“ Religious freedom was first put in the human rights code to protect the right to worship without interference from the government , ” said Hawkes .
“ It was not meant to protect people who use religion to attack others . ”
On the website , a writer who says he helped generate questions for the campaign , and who identifies himself as “ MDB ” and openly gay , says in a note to “ concerned riders of the TTC ” that “ there was great sensitivity given to my feelings regarding the passages that were posted for this question . …
I do not endorse or agree with the response , but am tolerant and understand the answer ’s origin .
We as homosexuals ask for tolerance of our lifestyles , so we must also respect the lifestyles of others .
For that is true equality . ”
If the TTC had rejected the campaign , or just the single ad referring to being gay , Bus Stop Bible Studies could have made a formal complaint alleging religious discrimination , at which point the case would have been heard by the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal .

In 2009 , the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that two B.C. transit agencies http://www.vancouversun.com/story_print.html?id=1778607&sponsor=did not have the right to reject political advertising .
TransLink and BC Transit had turned down ads from the Canadian Federation of Students and the B.C. Teachers Federation because they could “ cause offence to any person or group of persons or create controversy . ”
The transit authorities did not have the right for a “ blanket exclusion of a highly valued form of expression in a public location that serves as an important place for public discourse , ” said Justice Marie Deschamps at the time .
Groundcover
These are plants which spread across the ground but do not grow tall , so no cutting is required .
An excellent alternative to artificial grass , areas planted in groundcover need little to no maintenance .
Groundcovers are usually chosen for texture , density , and how well they spread and choke out the weeds .
They can be planted in poor soil and even enhance the soil by acting as a mulch .
Some groundcovers are nitrogen - fixing .
Many varieties are available , including flowering groundcovers like creeping thyme , which offer color and add emphasis to the seasons .
Although groundcovers are usually perennials and evergreens , annuals make an excellent groundcovering as well , but do require more work each spring .
Some groundcovers are edible , such as strawberries or low - growing herbs .
Ever -bearing strawberries produce fruit most of the summer and tolerate marginal soils and light shade .
Dwarf dogwood ( also called bunchberry ) and herbs like thyme and oregano work as groundcovers for limited areas .
Many also grow well in shady areas .
During the first year , new plantings of groundcover will require weeding and mulching , but once established , little care is needed .
Groundcovers need an edge barrier to contain them .
A low brick or wood edging , or any lawn edging which cuts down a few inches into the soil will usually be sufficient .
Your garden center can recommend local groundcover varieties and their characteristics for the perfect grass alternative .
Blizzard is n't putting a hard date on the third major expansion to its popular online role - playing game , but the Cataclysm add - on for World of Warcraft is on the verge of going beta .
Blizzard is now sending out beta opt - in invites to press .
Advertisement
The WoW developer is " starting to gear up for the World of Warcraft : Cataclysm beta , " accepting sign ups for the early look at the expansion until April 15 for members of the media .
April 15 is not the actual date the beta would go live , we should note , as Blizzard does " not currently have a date to announce for the start of the beta test . "
It 's been a long time since we 've had a chance to go hands - on with World of Warcraft : Cataclysm , but it appears we 'll get a fresh look at the expansion 's major changes and be able to share our thoughts with you about them soon .

Please note that this round of beta invites appears to be for press only .
We 're sure that Blizzard will make a more formal public announcement when the Cataclysm beta goes wide .
Until then , be cautious of any e-mail promising beta access to the World of Warcraft add -on .
During the 2008 campaign , Michael Weisskopf and I wrote a story that argued that if you wanted to know how John McCain and Barack Obama would govern , you need only look at how they gambled .
McCain , a craps player , loved thrill , risk , long shots and yawping tables .
Obama , a poker player , was cautious , cagey , calculating , isolated .
We found out later that McCain ’s penchant for risk would define his campaign .
As Dan Balz and Haynes Johnson reported after the election , the moment when McCain decided to roll the dice on a little known Alaska Governor came down , in many ways , to McCain ’s own admitted gambling disposition .
“ What ’s your bottom line ? ” McCain asked .
[ McCain Campaign Attorney A.B. ]
Culvahouse later told an audience that he responded , “ John , high risk , high reward . ”
He said McCain replied , “ You should n’t have told me that .
I ’ve been a risk - taker all of my life . ”
Which returns us to Obama , the calculated card counter , sitting in a corner trying to game out his adversaries .
It may still be too early to know if this trait will define his presidency , but we can say that Obama has already made perfectly clear that he does n’t much like risk .
Here is Obama yesterday , at a Town Hall in New Hampshire , again turning his presidential furor on the ways of Las Vegas , which has long been a White House metaphor for Wall Street ( or government ) excess .
Responsible families do n’t do their budgets the way the federal government does .
Right ?
When times are tough , you tighten your belts .
You do n’t go buying a boat when you can barely pay your mortgage .
You do n’t blow a bunch of cash on Vegas when you ’re trying to save for college .
You prioritize .
You make tough choices .
It ’s time your government did the same .
( Applause . )
Pretty mild stuff , unless you are from Vegas .
The backlash has been swift , led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , and last night Obama was forced to walk back his comments in a letter to Nevada ’s senior senator .
I hope you know that during my Town Hall today , I was n’t saying anything negative about Las Vegas .
I was making the simple point that families use vacation dollars , not college tuition money , to have fun .
There is no place better to have fun than Vegas , one of our country ’s great destinations .
I have always enjoyed my visits , look forward to visiting in a few weeks , and hope folks will visit in record numbers this year .
Sure , Mr. President , whatever .
No one thinks you have anything against the place , or the idea of tourism in Nevada .
But who can doubt that deep down you basically detest the sort of excess , waste , chance and debauchery that Vegas has long embodied , not just in practice ( see : Tiger Woods ) but in the American subconscious ?
No letter is going to walk that back .
At that point he was feeling neither spry nor lucky .
His mother was ill , he was drinking on and off , his back pain was serious and he was feeling too down even to shave , which explained the long beard .
He might have ended up like his father , who was also five feet tall and suffered chronic pain , and who ended up a heavy drinker .
He could have felt perpetually insulted that people kept telling him he looked like a mischievous mythical gnome .
Instead , “ I finally figured out I liked it , ” Mr. Buzzutto said recently .
He was dressed , as usual , in a green hooded sweatshirt and green pants .
“ And other people liked it .
So why not ? ”
He started embracing the role , putting shamrock and leprechaun pins on his hat , wearing all green , all the time .
Well - wishers who might have feared offending a short man with a red beard instead felt permission to approach him .
“ Anyone who looks like this , and does n’t know he looks like a leprechaun , ” Mr. Buzzutto explained , “ is a dunderhead , for crying out loud . ”
Over the years , Mr. Buzzutto has become a quasi-mythical creature whom Yonkers locals delight in spying in the mundane tasks of life : shopping at Stew Leonard ’s , drinking a glass of milk at a bar , sitting on the wall outside his house .
As he works in his garden , an elaborate display in a mostly industrial neighborhood , passing cars honk their hellos , one after the other .
Mr. Buzzutto graciously tips his hat each time .
“ By now , it ’s Pavlovian , ” he said .
“ I go to New York City , and every time a car honks , my arm flies up . ”
When someone — and it ’s not only small children — asks if he ’s a real leprechaun , he answers diplomatically , “ I ’m the realest leprechaun you are ever going to meet . ”
Mr. Buzzutto , who grew up small in Yonkers public housing and feels he ’s been fighting to prove himself ever since , developed a vague sense of his own celebrity , but the modern age has delivered a much more satisfying measure of it .
Someone created a Facebook page in his honor ( “ The Yonkers Leprechaun That Lives on Roberts Aveee ” ) , and it now has 6,951 fans .
A few of them have suggested he run for mayor ( of Yonkers ) .
Someone named Sahar Rabadi posted that “ my mom makes me beep the horn at him because she thinks he will bring me luck and I will get married . ”
Said Mr. Buzzutto , “ It ’s an ego trip . ”
For those concerned with authenticity , there is the matter of Mr. Buzzutto ’s last name .
Is he even Irish ?
“ A little , ” he said , a guilty look flashing across his face — at least one quarter .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A potentially deadly strain of fungus is spreading among animals and people in the northwestern United States and the Canadian province of British Columbia , researchers reported on Thursday .
The airborne fungus , called Cryptococcus gattii , usually only infects transplant and AIDS patients and people with otherwise compromised immune systems , but the new strain is genetically different , the researchers said .
“ This novel fungus is worrisome because it appears to be a threat to otherwise healthy people , ” said Edmond Byrnes of Duke University in North Carolina , who led the study .
" The findings presented here document that the outbreak of C. gattii in Western North America is continuing to expand throughout this temperate region , " the researchers said in their report , published in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Pathogenshere .
“ Our findings suggest further expansion into neighboring regions is likely to occur and aim to increase disease awareness in the region . ”
The new strain appears to be unusually deadly , with a mortality rate of about 25 percent among the 21 U.S. cases analyzed , they said .
“ From 1999 through 2003 , the cases were largely restricted to Vancouver Island , ” the report reads .
“ Between 2003 and 2006 , the outbreak expanded into neighboring mainland British Columbia and then into Washington and Oregon from 2005 to 2009 .
Based on this historical trajectory of expansion , the outbreak may continue to expand into the neighboring region of Northern California , and possibly further . ”
The spore - forming fungus can cause symptoms in people and animals two weeks or more after exposure .
They include a cough that lasts for weeks , sharp chest pain , shortness of breath , headache , fever , nighttime sweats and weight loss .
It has also turned up in cats , dogs , an alpaca and a sheep .
Freezing can kill the fungus and climate change may be helping it spread , the researchers said .

This entry was posted on Wednesday , January 17th , 2007 at 2:05 pm and is filed under My failings .
You can follow any responses to this entry through the RSS 2.0 feed .
You can leave a response , or trackback from your own site .
Social media can be a huge boon for non-profits , NGOs and causes .
Many are finding ways to let folks help those in need with small actions and donations .
Here are nine ways you can make a difference in people 's lives with just a few minutes of your time or a few dollars from your PayPal account .
Of course , if you want to spend more than five minutes or $ 25 , you could do a lot more good for folks in need .
But this is a great way to begin cultivating a personal attitude of philanthropy in your spare time and with your spare cash .
1. Free Rice , Cost : $ 0 , Time : 5 Minutes
Play a simple game of multi-choice questions , and help the World Food Programme fight hunger — and perhaps improve your own knowledge in subjects such as art , vocabulary , history and math .
Since October 2007 , this initiative has generated more than 77 billion grains of rice ( around 20 million servings ) for hungry people around the world .
The rice is paid for by advertisers , and the project is supported by the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University .
2. Samasource , Cost : $ 25 , Time : 0 Minutes
What many women , youth and refugees need all around the world is a dignified way to earn money and support themselves .
What Samasource lets you do is donate as little as $ 25 to help find work for and train folks to do Internet - and computer - based work .
Donations can be made through PayPal , as well .
Here 's a TEDx talk from Samasource founder Leila Chirayath Janah explaining how marginalized people can break through the " culture of handouts " and find real opportunity .
3. CauseWorld , Cost : $ 0 , Time : 5 Minutes
Similar to Foursquare , this iPhone and Android location checkin app allows you to earn karma points , then donate those points to the charity of your choice , from climate change NGOs to hunger - fighting non-profits .
While you earn badges , rack up points and make donations , you can also choose to share your accomplishments with your other social networks .
If you 're a location junkie who is passionate about stopping child abuse , supplying clean water or helping to fight cancer but short on time and funds , this might be the app for you .
Funding is provided by Procter & Gamble , Citibank and Kraft Foods .
4. Vittana , Cost : $ 25 , Time : 5 Minutes
If you care about higher education , this microlending site might be right up your alley .
Vittana lets you find students in the developing world who are struggling to pay their college tuition .
You can search by gender , by major and by the amount of money needed .
Loans can be made in increments as small as $ 25 and can be made through PayPal .
5 . The Extraordinaires , Cost $ 0 , Time : 5 Minutes
This site proves you do n't have to have a lot of time , energy or money to do something extraordinary for your community or the wider world .
It allows users to take microactions — simple things they can do in seconds from a computer or mobile phone — to help be part of a larger solution .
For example , after the earthquake in Haiti , users were able to match photos of missing persons with photos of those who had actually survived the quake .
Users can choose from a variety of " missions " to tag or match images , do research or map something .
From finding job leads for unemployed folks to mapping safe places for kids to play , The Extraordinaires is a world of opportunity for those who want to do good with few resources .
There 's also an iPhone app available .
6. Kiva , Cost : $ 25 , Time : 5 Minutes
By now , most of us are familiar with Kiva .
This microlending organization lets users find an entrepreneur or group of entrepreneurs in a developing area and lend as little as $ 25 to support the growing business .
Users can search for entrepreneurs by gender , type of business and geographic area .
Check out this PBS report on how Kiva 's brand of microfinance has impacted one community in Uganda :
7. Deki , Cost : $ 15 , Time : 5 Minutes
Deki is similar to Kiva , but this UK - based site does n't collect any percentage of donations for its own operating costs , and its loan recipients are found in far fewer areas — right now , just the UK , Ghana and Nepal .
Users choose a microloan recipient , the loan amount is forwarded to a field partner in the local currency ( to mitigate the risk of financial loss due to currency fluctuation ) and the loan is repaid over a 6 - to 12 - month period .
The field partners are grassroots organizations already well - versed in mircofinance in their regions .
Donations can be made in amounts as small as £ 10 , or just over $ 15 .
Credits can be added to a Deki account via PayPal .
8. Give Work , Cost : $ 0 , Time : 5 Minutes
This iPhone app helps increase the working wage of African refugees .
Users virtually " help " a refugee with microwork tasks , earning points and increasing the quality of work .
The points system equates to real - world help for working refugees .
According to research from Crowdflower , one of the app's sponsoring organizations along with Samasource , five points in the app equates to a refugee being able to buy a tomato , a large banana or a small bunch of greens .
Ten points means the refugee can afford to send a single SMS message ; with 50 points , he or she could buy 10 sweet potatoes .
This video explains more about the app and the program :
9. SocialVibe , Cost : $ 0 , Time : 5 Minutes
This organization pairs brands with consumers and ad dollars with causes in a way that 's good for everyone involved .
Brands create microaction - focused games and activities , and users complete them .
Brands pay for this interaction by donating to a cause of the user 's choice , such as feeding the hungry or preventing suicide .
Users get to spread the word , both about the charities and the brands .
Everyone wins .

Ons land zit zonder regering .
Koning Albert heeft het ontslag van de regering Leterme II vanavond aanvaard .
Verkiezingen lijken nu onvermijdelijk .
Leterme bood vorige week donderdag al het ontslag van de regering aan , maar de koning hield zijn antwoord in beraad .
Hij stelde Didier Reynders aan als koninklijk bemiddelaar .
Vandaag werd duidelijk dat de verschillen binnen de regering te groot waren om door te gaan met onderhandelen .
Reynders gaf daarom vanmiddag zijn opdracht als bemiddelaar terug .
Meteen was het einde voor premier Leterme in zicht .
Noodregering ?
Omdat de gesprekken over de splitsing van Brussel - Halle - Vilvoorde compleet vastgelopen zijn , waren er voor de koning nog weinig andere mogelijkheden dan het aanvaarden van het ontslag van Leterme II .
Sommigen , waaronder PS - voorzitter Elio Di Rupo , suggereren een noodregering , De koning kan een nieuwe bemiddelaar , een informateur of zelfs een formateur benoemen .
Maar na de mislukte poging van Didier Reynders als bemiddelaar lijkt zo 'n keuze weinig evident .
Verkiezingen
Waarschijnlijk stevenen we daarom af op federale verkiezingen .
De meest geciteerde datums daarvoor zijn 6 en 13 juni .
Verkiezingen moeten plaatsvinden binnen de veertig dagen na de ontbinding van het parlement .
Het is mogelijk dat voordien een lijst wordt samengesteld met grondwetsartikels die door de volgende regering herzien kunnen worden .
Congo
België zit door de politieke crisis in moeilijke papieren .
Eind juni gaat de koning naar Congo voor de vijftigste verjaardag van de onafhankelijkheid van de voormalige Belgische kolonie .
Begin juli start dan weer het Europese voorzitterschap .
Wellicht zal er op dat moment nog geen regering zijn , want na verkiezingen ligt het probleem Brussel - Halle - Vilvoorde meteen weer op de tafel .
In principe kan een regering in lopende zaken nog een hele tijd blijven doorwerken .
Zo bleef de regering Verhofstadt na de verkiezingen van 10 juni 2007 doorwerken tot december van dat jaar .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Car and truck manufacturer Daimler AG allegedly earned $ 1.9 billion in revenue and at least $ 91.4 million in illegal profits from transactions tainted by bribes , according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
There were more than 200 transactions in which it made at least $ 56 million in improper payments to foreign officials , the SEC said in its own charges filed this week with a U.S. court , offering new details about the breadth of the deals .
Daimler plans to settle the SEC and Justice Department ’s allegations by paying $ 185 million , and the company ’s Russian and German units will plead guilty to violating U.S. anti-bribery laws , court documents filed this week said .
The company will neither admit nor deny the SEC ’s charges , according to the proposed consent order .
A Daimler spokesman was not immediately available for comment .
The transactions in at least 22 countries spanned almost a decade and involved at least 6,300 commercial vehicles and some 500 passenger cars , including luxury sedans given to senior foreign government officials , according to the SEC charges .
Some of the payments in question were routed to U.S. bank accounts or to foreign bank accounts of shell companies in the United States , the government has alleged .
In an example of the gifts extended , Daimler tried to curry favor to enter the Turkmenistan market by giving two armored vehicles worth at least 550,000 euros to a senior government official , the SEC said .
The company also had a book authored by the official translated into German as a gift .
In another instance , Daimler set aside 11,000 euros to pay for a lavish vacation through Europe including Paris and Venice for six Chinese officials , the SEC said , adding that the company paid for 16 such trips in connection with $ 120 million in vehicle sales to the Chinese government customers .
Additionally , the SEC accused Daimler of paying kickbacks in the United Nations ’ Oil for Food Program in Iraq that earned the company more than $ 4 million in profits from contracts involving the sale of vehicles and spare parts .
The securities regulator began its probe in 2004 when an auditor complained he was fired for protesting secret bank accounts used to pay foreign officials .
Daimler has previously acknowledged payments that raised concerns about legal violations and has said the company was cooperating with investigations by the Justice Department and the SEC .
A court hearing is set for April 1 to present the settlement agreement to a U.S. judge who must approve it .
If sanctioned , it would be the latest in a series of high - profile bribery cases concluded by the U.S. government .
Earlier this year , BAE Systems Plc settled charges by the United States and Britain , agreeing to pay about $ 450 million .

Well , it looks like the the foreclosure virus is becoming more egalitarian every day ; its even moving into tonier neighborhoods :
RealtyTrac is forecasting that Houses with $ 5 million + mortgages will likely be the next class of loans to go belly up .
While the overall numbers are small , they expect to see a sharp rise in foreclosures this year .
In all of 2009 , there were 1,312 houses with $ 5 M + mortgages scheduled for foreclosure auction .
The spike is apparent this year — in the month of February alone , there were 352 homes nationwide in this category .
Here ’s the Journal :
“ Mortgage defaults began to surge in late 2006 , mostly among borrowers with subprime mortgages , those for people with weak credit records or high ratios of debt to income .
Over the next few years defaults spread rapidly to better - heeled borrowers , especially those who got loans without documenting their income .
At the end of 2009 , nearly eight million households , or 15 % of those with mortgages , were behind on mortgage payments or in the foreclosure process .
. .
Big borrowers are more likely to default than ordinary people , according to data from First American CoreLogic .
Its loan database , reflecting more than 80 % of the overall home - loan market , includes 1,700 loans with balances of $ 4 million or more .
About 14.8 % of those loans were 90 days or more overdue at the end of January , compared with 8.7 % for all home loans tracked by First American . ”
It turns out that the wealthy are not any better at forecasting their own future economic circumstances than the unwashed masses were . . .

We reported on Wednesday that 18 House Democrats are calling for a criminal investigation of Goldman Sachs .
As of today , that number has more than doubled , reaching 44 lawmakers .
You can see the full list of signing members at the website of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee ( PCCC ) , which is organizing a grassroots campaign to get more lawmaker support .
The SEC has of course filed a civil action against Goldman for allegedly selling investmant packages that were designed to fail .
The SEC does not have authority to launch a criminal investigation , however , so the letter - signers are urging the Department of Justice to open their own probe .
The effort was spearheaded by Rep. Marcy Kaptur ( D - Ohio ) .
Bryan Danielson can easily be considered a cult icon .
After touring the country , the man known as The American Dragon developed a unique , physical style of offense that includes exciting high - flying maneuvers and never - before - seen submissions .
Silent yet deadly , Bryan Danielson has gone toe - to - toe with some of the best workers to ever lace up a pair of boots .
As a man who wrestles bigger than his sub -200 pound frame , Bryan Danielson has earned the respect of hundreds of wrestlers , and thousands of fans across the globe ( if not more ) .
By learning from the likes of William Regal and Shawn Michaels during his 10 - year journey in pro wrestling , Bryan Danielson has became nothing short of a sensation .
In a technologically advanced world , where Internet videos have become home to some of the best - kept secrets in life , Bryan Danielson is professional wrestling 's go - to guy for a jaw - dropping YouTube highlight reel .
While many mainstream fans are unfamiliar with his work ( and there 's nothing wrong with that ) , one can easily be caught up to speed upon learning one of Bryan Danielson 's other nicknames .
A nickname in which he truly earned : The Best in the World .
Now pardon the WWE while they hit the reset button .

Daniel Bryan is a loser .
With the personality of a shrimp 's testicle , watching this undersized pissant attempt to cut a promo has become one of the many cruel joys of a machine that has built its empire on keeping outsiders in check ( Hoss Funk ) .
Daniel Bryan 's strengths are irrelevant , and if you blink , you will fail to see them quickly highlighted before he is the casualty of yet another squash match .
Bryan 's losses have compounded to the point where he is now 0 - 7 on a WWE NXT show designed to introduce the next generation of potential WWE Superstars .
Despite what , on paper , seems to be jobber treatment , Daniel Bryan has actually earned the ( kayfabe ) respect of the pros enough to become the No. 1 ranked rookie on WWE NXT .
Confused yet ?
Allow me to attempt to explain the WWE 's booking of Daniel Bryan from the mindset of a pickup artist .
A few years back , for entertainment purposes , I read a book that claimed to have finally cracked every intricate code to picking up women .
Through the pages of Neil Strauss '
The Game I learned of an entire community of T&A smarks who had come up with their own system ( complete with theory and terminology ) of picking up women .
Of the many slang terms in this entertaining tour de force of women , the most prominent was the term neg .
A neg , of course , is when a man teases a woman by charmingly making mention of a characteristic , accessory , etc. of hers that plays on her insecurities .
These negs were designed to slowly chip away at the ego of the typical attractive woman , who feels that every guy is trying to hit on her , thus bringing her down to our level .
If used correctly , negs eventually created the illusion that the hard - to - please , teasing male is the prize to be sought after .
Not the once indomitable , defensive broad .
Before you go out and try this new tool at your local Hooters , let 's put it into perspective .
The WWE is negging Daniel Bryan .
Once ( and still ) thought of by many as the best in the world , the WWE 's up and down booking of Daniel Bryan is their way of saying : " We like you , but you had better recognize who 's in charge here . "
The key to a neg is to use it correctly .
Subtlety is key .
Obnoxiousness is a killer .
Teasing a girl about her laugh is one thing , but if you start going after her weight , she just might offer you a free drink in the form of a cranberry vodka .
In your face .
The WWE is now starting to walk that very fine line with Daniel Bryan .
No longer is Bryan enjoying the subtleties of being booked as the charming underdog who is fighting conquerable forces .
It 's getting to the point where he just looks like a loser .
It 's starting to get obnoxious .
This past week on WWE NXT , the WWE once again placed a glaring spotlight on one of Daniel Bryan 's perceived weaknesses .
Matt Striker asked ' Mr. Personality ' to cut a promo on a surprise topic in front of a live crowd .
This entire segment would have been an abject trainwreck had it not been for rising star Wade Barrett , who cut two scintillating promos in front of his home country , making Daniel Bryan look even more minor league .
Bryan then went on to suffer yet another uninspiring loss to , WWE Superstars mainstay and former trainer , William Regal .
Of course , Bryan 's loss was not before being told by The Miz that he is not a star and could n't hold David Otunga 's jock .
The WWE is beginning to fumble the ball with Daniel Bryan .
It 's one thing to infer that Jack Swagger is an undeserving champion .
This is not the burial that many are making it out to be .
The guy is a heel who won the belt in a match where his opposition was still wearing slacks .
Would you respect the intern who took your job if you got fired during your lunch break ?
Did I mention that Jack Swagger is a World Champion ?
It also helps that this young , heel World Champion will have a chance to prove himself against a top star at a pay - per - view in about two weeks .
That just sounds like a good story .
Like a work of art , the object of great storytelling is to paint a mental picture and leave it up to the listener / viewer to interpret the rest for themselves .
With the work of art that is Bryan Danielson , the WWE has scribbled on a mustache , penciled in devil horns , and renamed it Daniel Bryan .
Believe it or not , I almost always give the WWE the benefit of the doubt when it comes to their long - term booking .
I 'd have a hard time explaining how I 've been a fan for so long if I did n't .
However I must say , as a longtime fan of Bryan Danielson , this whole Daniel Bryan NXT experiment scares the shit out of me .

Mr. Keyboard ( from Derek )
I used to be a Genius™ .
Not an actual genius , mind you , but just a tech support guy who worked at the Apple Store and , therefore , got the prestigious title of Genius™ .
One day , a gentleman came in with his brand - spanking - new Mac complaining of keyboard troubles .
He had just set his computer up , and from the moment he took it out of the box , the keyboard never worked properly .
Whenever he tried to type , seemingly random gibberish appeared .
I plugged in his Mac and verified the problem : none of the letters corresponded to what was on the keyboard .
The computer seemed to be working perfectly otherwise , so I was at a loss .
I showed a fellow Genius™ , and he too was stumped .
Bad keyboard ?
Corrupt drivers ?
And then I noticed something : the man ’s last name was “ Dvorak ” .
Acting on a hunch , I clicked around until I found the keyboard layout .
Sure enough , he had selected Dvorak , presumably because it matched his own name , as his default keyboard layout during the initial setup of the computer .
Problem solved !
I shared the story with my fellow Geniuses™ , so now they should know what to do if they ever meet someone with keyboard problems whose last name is " Armenian -- HM QWERTY " .

The world ’s biggest search engine , Google , recently decided to pull out of China , relocating its operations to Hong Kong whose semi-autonomous status allows it to operate outside of prior agreements negotiated with the Beijing government .
Google ’s decision was initially announced in early January following a hacking of its California servers by a source it claims originated from China .
Contributing to Google ’s decision were objections to China ’s requirement that the search engine censor political and sexual content the government found objectionable .
China , which potentially has the planet ’s largest online market , has erected what is called in the West “ The Great Electronic Firewall ” to keep out what authorities consider objectionable material .
Google , in an agreement negotiated several years ago , agreed to comply with Chinese law governing Internet content .
The Chinese Communist Party and government reacted sharply to Google ’s move , saying the company has politicized its dispute over the hacking .
“ For Chinese people , Google is not god , and even if it puts on a show of politics and values , it is still not god , ” said the People ’s Daily .
It continued , “ In fact , Google is not chaste when it comes to values .
Its cooperation and collusion with the U.S. intelligence and security agencies is well - known . ”
The Beijing government ’s foreign affairs department struck a different tone .
While calling it a “ big mistake ” for the company , they separated Google ’s action from U.S. - China state - to - state relations .
“ The Google case will not affect China - U.S. relations ‘ unless someone politicalizes the issue , ' ” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said on Tuesday .
The Xinhua news agency continues , “ Qin told a regular press conference that the Google case is just a business case and will not damage the image of China .
He blamed the move to relate the case to China - U.S. relations as ‘ making a fuss ’ and ‘ overstating the issue . ' ”
Google stands to lose its place in China ’s domestic market , second only to Baidu , the country ’s national search engine , which holds a commanding 58 percent of the market to Google ’s 35 percent .
Internet users inside China are able to access Google ’s Hong Kong servers but they have “ found access to the new search portal was very unstable , ” said Xinhua .
Internet access and freedom of the press in China is a complicated issue with more involved than meets the eye .
Many observers , while acknowledging China ’s restrictions , note that there is a fairly widespread ability within the country to express differing points of views , including sharp criticisms of the Communist Party and government .
The western press reported erroneously , for example , that President Obama ’s university speech and town hall meeting last year was blacked out of China ’s domestic press .
Obama ’s remarks made mention of the issue of Internet freedom .
Still it is undeniable that China enforces what many consider to be an anachronistic and unworkable Internet policy .
Filters on Google searches , for example , can be easily overcome with slightly different spelling of restricted names .
Other search engines are also accessible albeit at slower speeds and less reliable connectivity .
More broad , however , is the issue of free speech and censorship itself .
Here it should be noted that China is not the only country to censor speech .
France and Germany both prohibit Nazi and anti-Semitic speech such as Holocaust denial .
Rarely are they taken to task for it .
China , on the other hand , concerned with stability and economic growth and rightly jealous of its national sovereignty , attempts far more to control the flow of information .
Indeed this appears to be at the heart of its political model .
Yet is it really at its heart ?
Attempts at what was called socialism in the 20th century were organized around a forced march in economically underdeveloped countries facing a hostile environment .
To those in charge , controlling information seemed essential .
But controlling the flow of information in today ’s world is a shortcut that is not only impossible , but undesirable .
Open debate , engagement , artful communication – these are the only viable options for power and consent in the Internet age .
People need to be convinced , not ordered and denied information .
Bureaucratic and administrative shortcuts are disarming and ultimately disastrous .
That said , it is up to the Chinese people and leadership to work out these issues for themselves .
Should 50 - 50 shared custody of children be abandoned ?
* Results
NO – 61.61 % ( 1343 votes )
** YES – 38.39 % ( 837 votes )
** This online poll was published in the midst of a mis-leading and subsequently discredited newpaper article that has mis-represented the facts of the relevant 2006 Family Law amendment reviews .
The implications in this article that “ children are at risk ” in shared care is contradicted by the relevant government reviews , and IS NOT supported by the federal Attorney General , Robert McClelland .
The Australian Institute of Family Studies review of the Shared Parenting amendments have concluded that :
“ There is no evidence to suggest that family violence and highly conflictual inter-parental relationships are any greater in children with shared care time than for children with other care time arrangements ” .
Despite this highly inaccurate newspaper article , of 2,180 people polled , the was STILL a vast majority in support not only of shared care , but presumably of a rebuttable presumption of equal parenting time after separation .

Each year on a day in January — the 15th , to be precise — I go to a Web site and post a message to hundreds of women I ’ve never met , saying , essentially , “ I ’m still here . ”
Within days , a thunderous chorus comes back , 200 voices , 300 .
A few of them ask , “ How can this be ? ” Sometimes they begin , “ I ’m crying . ”
Many answer in kind : “ I ’m here , too .
It ’s now three years . ”
“ Five years . ” “ Three months . ” “ Seven . ”
What we ’re doing , in a way , is checking for lights in the darkness .
Now there probably are n’t a lot of Web sites where the announcement that you ’re around and breathing would cause anyone to take notice , let alone respond .
But this is a site for people with Stage 4 breast cancer , something I ’ve had for 17 years .
The average life expectancy with the diagnosis is 30 months , so this is a little like saying I ’m 172 years old : seemingly impossible .
But it ’s not .
I first found I had the illness in 1988 , and it was rediagnosed as Stage 4 in 1993 .
That ’s 22 years all together , which is the reason I post each year on the anniversary of the day I learned my cancer was back : to let women know that it happens , that people do live with this for years .
I tell them that when the cancer returned , it came on so fast , spread so quickly , that I was given a year or two to live .
Within months , the disease turned vicious .
It started breaking bones from within , and was coming close to severing my spinal cord .
IN northern Europe , broad four - year oscillations in small rodent and raptor populations are synchronous over hundreds of square kilometers 1 –6 .
Crashes in vole populations can induce wide emigration (> 1,000 km ) of their predators7 –9 , but almost nothing is known about how predators rapidly detect areas of vole abundance .
Here we report on laboratory and field experiments on voles ( Microtus agrestis ) and kestrels ( Falco tinnunculus ) .
Voles mark their runaways with urine and faeces , which are visible in ultraviolet light .
Wild kestrels brought into captivity were able to detect vole scent marks in ultraviolet light but not in visible light .
In the field , kestrels hunted preferentially near experimental nest - boxes where artificial trails were treated with vole urine and faeces .
We suggest that kestrels flying over an area can see and use vole scent marks to assess vole numbers .
This ability would enable kestrels to ' screen ' large areas in a relatively short time .
Our results provide a novel explanation for how raptors detect patches of high vole densities without prior knowledge of local food resources .
GRAZ , Austria — Barbara Rozenkranz , the dour , embattled far - right candidate for Austria 's presidential election on Sunday , will likely come in a distant second .
But she is also on track to show that many Austrians are willing to back a known Nazi sympathizer .
Polls say Rosenkranz , a member of the Freedom Party , will take upward of 13 percent of the vote while Social Democrat incumbent Heinz Fischer will win with about 80 percent .
Rosenkranz says her goal is 17 percent , which would top her party 's previous presidential best in 1980 and match its share in the 2008 parliamentary elections .
The election will take a census of Austrian attitudes toward Nazism , unlike previous results .
Unlike the typically murky views of Rosenkranz 's Freedom Party peers , her own opinions on the issue have taken center stage throughout the campaign .
Days before it officially started she triggered a media storm by saying anti-Nazi " Verbotsgesetz " laws should be scrapped , a statement she later said she made because her interviewer " treated her like a schoolgirl . "
In the same interview she was also less than emphatic when asked if Nazi poison gas chambers existed , saying , " I know everything which was taught in school between 1964 and 1976 . "
Saying no more than required by law sends out the clearest possible signal of Nazi sympathy an Austrian politician can make .
Confronted with the same question as she prepared to enter the last week of the campaign , she said , simply , " Of course there were gas chambers . "
This is not Rosenkranz 's first foray on the campaign trail .
Her political career began in 1993 when she became a deputy in the Lower Austrian Parliament , rising to become the region 's minister for construction law and animal welfare in 2008 .
Earlier in the campaign , she had secured the support of the newspaper Krone Zeitung , whose 89 - year - old owner , Hans Dichand , approves of her candidacy mainly because of her virulently anti-European Union stance .
In order to retain that support after the debacle over her call to end anti-Nazi laws , Rosenkranz had to send a signed note " distancing herself " from Nazism .
The newspaper repaid her concise renunciation by publishing a poem ridiculing her Socialist opponent , Fischer , in the last week of the campaign .
Rosenkranz 's family is also a subject of fascination .
Those who doubt her sincerity point out that for the last 31 years the 51 - year - old has been married to Horst Rosenkranz , former member of the now banned neo - Nazi NDP party and publisher of a far - right magazine , " Fakten . "
The couple has 10 children , six daughters and four sons , some with strikingly outmoded Germanic names such as Alwine , Hildrun , Mechthild , Sonnhild and Wolf .
Having left the Catholic church , they attend Germanic summer and winter solstice rituals at which Barbara Rosenkranz calls on those assembled to recognize the destructive and creative force of fire .
The candidate protests that she should not be defined by the views of her husband and that she has suffered an " unprecedented campaign " against her .
Indeed , the adverse reactions to her views do seem to weigh on her : Rosencranz appeared awkward and twitchy when facing questions from the media at a recent visit to Graz .
Her speech at the rally afterward tipped from appropriately strident to rattled when she was confronted by a crowd of protesters jeering and lobbing the occasional object , which her minders fended off with umbrellas .
But she defiantly plowed on delivering her warning of the threat posed by the EU , feminism , immigration and Islam .
Rosenkranz 's suspicion of foreign influence does not stop her taking ideas and inspiration from abroad .
Her party hailed the recent far - right victory in neighboring Hungary and Rosenkranz praises Switzerland 's referendum decision to ban minarets : " I am in favor of protecting religious freedom , but minarets are a political symbol not a religious one . "
She also calls on Austria to require radio stations to play a certain amount of music with German lyrics , a nod to the language quota system in place in France .
The Freedom Party 's leader , Heinz - Christian Strache , has distanced himself from Rosenkranz , choosing not to come to the formal opening of her campaign at the height of the Verbotsgesetz furor .
Even so , she says she feels " sufficiently supported . "
And she may earn Strache 's gratitude on Sunday , paving the way for further far - right gains by proving how many Austrians are unafraid to ignore the Nazi past .
Tonight Sheldon wants to ask Stan Lee how the Silver Surfer uses his silver surfboard to accomplish interstellar flight .
As well he should !
Nobody , not even Sheldon , knows how we are going to travel between stars .
Proxima Centauri is our best bet .
It is the closest star to our home orbiting around our own star , Sol. Proxima Centauri is an unremarkable red dwarf star named appropriately from the Latin proxima , which is “ next to ” , as in “ proximate ” .
It is not so - named because it is close to us , but rather because it is close to the star Alpha Centauri , a star in the constellation Centauri .
Alpha Centauri is the third brightest star in the night sky , but mostly just because it is so close .
We may want try to visit someday .
After all we are neighbors and have yet to bring them so much as a fruit basket .
“ Close ” is a funny word to use on interstellar distances .
Proxima and Alpha Centauri are so far away it takes light 4.2 years to arrive .
Nothing we know of can allow us to travel faster than light , our ultimate speed limit .
Even the television transmissions of the pilot episode of Big Bang Theory , which have been traveling at the speed of light since late 2007 , are only halfway to whoever might inhabit the rocks orbiting those stars .
Not even Hulu.com in Alpha Centauri has TBBT available yet .
( Life near Alpha Centauri has that in commonwith Earth . )
Alpha Centauri , being so bright , has probably been known to the earliest hominids who bothered to look up .
But Proxima Centauri being so dim was only discovered using powerful telescopes in 1915 .
We may not be done yet .
Even dimmer stars known as brown dwarfs may be traveling the galaxy even closer to us than Proxima Centauri .
These stars are so cool , you have to look for them in infrared light .
Finding such nearby stars is one of the key missions of the newly launched WISE satellite .
When I told one of the BBT writers / exec producers we may soon find closer stars than Proxima Centauri he said “ The Federation may be closer than we think ” .
Right now our plate is full just with interplanetary travel within our own solar system .
A trip taking astronauts to Mars , as recently imagined by NASA , even at its closest approach will take over half a year .
Proxima Centauri is 750,000 times farther Mars ’s closest approach to Earth .
At the same speed , that would take over a quarter million years to get there .
We must invent something faster .
Suppose our human engineers develop a technology that allows us to travel 1 % the speed of light on average to Proxima Centari .
The astronauts only need now to spend 400 years on the spacecraft .
( I ’m ignoring the tiny benefit due to time dilation slowing the astronaut ’s lifespan as we discussed earlier for the story of Paolo and Vincenzo . )
The astronauts wo n’t survive to get there , but if they keep having children their 16th generation could make it .
I do n’t think the intermediate generations will be particularly happy with their forbears for condemning them to a lonely flight through interstellar space .
If one generation rebels , and refuses to procreate the mission will be a failure .
Even if that 16th generation arrived successfully , they would hardly be Earthlings .
I think we can prove that we humans will never attempt interstellar transit until we know how to travel at least 25 % the speed of light .
( The mission to Mars discussed above is only 0.001 % the speed of light . )
Suppose a mission really was undertaken to travel to Proxima Centauri with a fantastic new technology that would take us there at 1 % the speed of light .
It will take 400 years .
Now suppose anytime in the next 200 years , a new technology is developed to increase that average speed to 2 % per year .
Given the rate of technological progress that is not a bad bet .
So the spacecraft that launches later would beat the earlier craft .
So not until a technology reaches some reasonable fraction of the maximum speed limit , the speed of light , would anyone bother to take an early flight .
The speed would have to be as large as 25 % the speed of light to nearly guarantee this would not be a problem .
At least then the same generation will arrive as left the Earth .
It may not ever be possible , but the argument shows it is unlikely any such mission would be mounted until that is possible .
( If some smarty - pants wants to suggest worm - holes or other space - bending technology , keep in mind that these ideas do n’t even work on paper . )
This says nothing of the many other technological hurdles must be met .
Traveling even at 1 % the speed of light , the spacecraft would suffer terrible damage from interstellar gas and dust .
The rate of cosmic rays , charged particles flying throughout interstellar space , would likely give fatal cancer to anyone who tried this mission and they would arrive long dead .
So it pays to go back and understand what is special about the Silver Surfer ’s surfboard that allows interstellar transport .
Often science fiction writers will come up with an idea before engineers and scientists .
Perhaps with the Silver Surfer there is an idea we ’ve missed .
A good place to start with any such questions is James Kakalios ’s terrific book “ The Physics of Superheroes “ .
Yet no explanation of Silver Surfer can be found — maybe it is just because Silver Surfer started out as a super - villain , not super - hero .
Fortunately someone actually asked the Silver Surfer ’s creator , Jack Kirby , why he uses a surfboard .
To which he explains :
“ Because I ’m tired of drawing spaceships . ” - Jack Kirby
Excelsior !

Lew Rockwell garners updates from Ron Paul , the great libertarian Congressman , whose public life has inspired so many .
First we want to know the current state of Paul ’s Audit the Fed Bill .
But then , just who is the Congressman from the Bank of America ?
Can we expect the Fed to fight this audit in the courts ?
What ’s the main benefit that will come from the audit ?
Did the financial crisis hurt or help this campaign ?
What will happen if prices really start to rise ?
Obamacare is a disaster .
Where will it end up ?
Can the doctor - patient relationship survive ?
What is the worst part of this Health Care Bill ?
Why is government health worse than government education ?
What can be expected from Medicare in the future ?
Will private practice be made illegal ?
What shocking thing did Obama admit ?
Can you really give thirty million additional people free medical care and reduce the deficit , too ?
Will Paul ’s sub - committee chairmanship be taken away from him ?
Are the claims about earmarks red herrings ?
Just what might happen if bank forces should attempt to remove Ron Paul from his positions ?
More from Ron Paul :
He has written many other books .
See the Ron Paul Collection and the Ron Paul Files .
He has an archive of LewRockwell.com articles .
He was previously featured in episodes :
CLIMATE - change legislation , dormant for six months , is showing signs of life again in Washington , DC .
This week senators and industrial groups have been discussing a compromise bill to introduce mandatory controls on carbon ( see article ) .
Yet although green activists around the world have been waiting for 20 years for American action , nobody is cheering .
Even if discussion ever turns into legislation , it will be a pale shadow of what was once hoped for .
The mess at Copenhagen is one reason .
So much effort went into the event , with so little result .
The recession is another .
However much bosses may care about the planet , they usually mind more about their bottom line , and when times are hard they are unwilling to incur new costs .
The bilious argument over American health care has not helped : this is not a good time for any bill that needs bipartisan support .
Even the northern hemisphere 's cold winter has hurt .
When two feet of snow lies on the ground , the threat from warming seems far off .
But climate science is also responsible .
A series of controversies over the past year have provided heavy ammunition to those who doubt the seriousness of the problem .
Three questions arise from this .
How bad is the science ?
Should policy be changed ?
And what can be done to ensure such confusion does not happen again ?
Behind all three lies a common story .
The problem lies not with the science itself , but with the way the science has been used by politicians to imply certainty when , as often with science , no certainty exists .
What went wrong and what did not
When governments started thinking seriously about climate change they took the sensible step of establishing , in 1989 , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
It was designed to get scientists to work out what was happening to the climate , and to get governments to sign off on the scientists ' conclusions .
It has done the job of basic science pretty well .
There have been occasional complaints both that it has overstated the extent of the problem , and that it has understated it .
Its reports trawl through all recent climate science .
The wide range of the outcomes it predicts — from a mildly warming global temperature increase of 1.1°C by the end of the century to a hellish 6.4°C — illustrate the uncertainties it is dealing with .
But the ambiguities of science sit uncomfortably with the demands of politics .
Politicians , and the voters who elect them , are more comfortable with certainty .
So “ six months to save the planet ” is more likely to garner support than “ there is a high probability — though not by any means a certainty — that serious climate change could damage the biosphere , depending on levels of economic growth , population growth and innovation . ”
Politics , like journalism , tends to simplify and exaggerate .
Hence the advertisements that the British government has been running , using nursery rhymes : “ Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water .
There was none as extreme weather due to climate change had caused a drought . ”
Such an approach may , in the short term , have encouraged some voters to support measures to combat climate change .
But implying that Britain 's children face some sort of Saharan future is wrong , and dangerous .
This week Britain 's Advertising Standards Authority slapped the government for its infantile advertisements .
And there has been worse .
In November , shortly before the Copenhagen climate summit , a stash of e-mails from and to various researchers at the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia somehow found its way onto the web .
They revealed an unwillingness to share data which broke the spirit , if not the letter , of Britain 's Freedom of Information act , an aggressive attitude to the peer review of papers by opponents and an apparent willingness to hedge science in the face of politics .
Around the same time it emerged that the most recent IPCC report had claimed that the Himalayan glaciers were going to disappear by 2035 , instead of 2350 .
The panel 's initial unwillingness to address this mistake , and the discovery of further problems with its work , raised troubling questions about its procedures .
How bad is this ?
Sceptics point out that each mistake has tended to exaggerate the extent of climate change .
The notion that the scientific establishment has suppressed evidence to the contrary has provided plenty of non-expert politicians with an excuse not to spend money reducing carbon .
So the scientists ' shameful mistakes have certainly changed perceptions .
They have not , however , changed the science itself .
As our briefing explains in detail , most research supports the idea that warming is man-made .
Sources of doubt that have seemed plausible in the past , such as a mismatch between temperatures measured by satellites and temperatures measured at the surface , and doubts about the additional warming that can be put down to water vapour , have been in large part resolved , though more work is needed .
If records of temperature across the past 1,000 years are not reliable , it matters little to the overall story .
If there are problems with the warming as measured by weather stations on land , there are also more reliable data from ships and satellites .
Insuring against catastrophe
Plenty of uncertainty remains ; but that argues for , not against , action .
If it were known that global warming would be limited to 2 °C , the world might decide to live with that .
But the range of possible outcomes is huge , with catastrophe one possibility , and the costs of averting climate change are comparatively small .
Just as a householder pays a small premium to protect himself against disaster , the world should do the same .
This newspaper sees no reason to alter its views on that .
Where there is plainly an urgent need for change is the way in which governments use science to make their case .
The IPCC has suffered from the perception that it is a tool of politicians .
The greater the distance that can be created between it and them , the better .
And rather than feeding voters infantile advertisements peddling childish certainties , politicians should treat voters like grown - ups .
With climate change you do not need to invent things ; the truth , even with all those uncertainties and caveats , is scary enough .
Democracy Now ! -- April 22 , 2010 .
Cormac Cullinan , South African environmental lawyer and an anti-apartheid activist , is co-president of the people 's conference Rights of Mother Earth Working Group .
He reports on its findings ( full transcript of interview below ) .

People ’s summit adopts ‘ Cochabamba Protocols ’
By , Cochabamba
( See the end of this article for a link to the People ’s Agreement text in Spanish . )
April 23 , 2010 — Censored News via Capitalism and Climate — The World Peoples Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth culminated Thursday and released the final declaration , the Agreement of the Peoples , calling for the establishment of an International Climate Court to prosecute polluters , condemning REDD and holding polluters responsible for their climate debt .
With the release of the final declaration , Indigenous Peoples proclaimed the outcome as , “ The Cochabamba Protocols . ”
Describing the damage to Mother Earth and the catastrophic effects of global temperature increases , the Agreement of Peoples states that the so - called developed nations are seizing the bounties of Mother Earth for profit without regard to the consequences for the people or the earth .
The Agreement , released in Spanish Thursday night , states that capitalism requires a strong military industry for the process of accumulation and the control of territories and natural resources , which suppresses peoples ’ resistance .
It is described as “ an imperialist system of colonization of the planet . ”
The Agreement of the Peoples proposes a draft Universal Declaration of Mother Earth .
Further , it states that the people deplore the attempt by a group of countries to cancel the Kyoto Protocol , the only specific binding instrument for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in developed countries .
The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples must be fully recognized , implemented and integrated in the climate change negotiations .
The best strategy and action is to avoid deforestation and degradation and protect native forests , while recognizing the rights of Indigenous Peoples , it states .
The market mechanism of REDD ( Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ) is condemned , which violates the sovereignty of peoples and their right to free , prior and informed consent and the sovereignty of nation states .
REDD violates the rights and customs of Peoples and the Rights of Nature .
The carbon market is described as a lucrative business of commercializing our Mother Earth .
Instead of tackling climate change , it is an act of looting and ravaging the land , water and even life itself .
The Agreement of Peoples states the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples must be fully recognized , implemented and integrated in the climate change negotiations , with forests protected from degradation , especially considering most of the forests are in Indigenous territories .
The final declaration calls for leading industrial nations to cut emissions by 50 percent .
With the release of the final declaration , Bolivian President Evo Morales said the human race can benefit from the wisdom of the world ’s indigenous peoples , who understand that humanity must live in harmony with nature .
“ The peoples of the Andes believe in the concept of ‘ living well ’ instead of wanting to ‘ live better ’ by consuming more regardless of the cost to our neighbors and our environment .
It is with these ancient teachings in mind that , exactly one year ago , the United Nations General Assembly accepted Bolivia ’s proposal to celebrate International Mother Earth Day on April 22 , which coincides with the final day of our conference .
“ We now propose to go one step further and begin collectively drafting a Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth .
This will establish a legal framework for protecting our increasingly threatened natural environment and raising the global consciousness about Mother Earth , on which we all depend for life . ”
Indigenous Peoples came from throughout the world to speak out for the Rights of Mother Earth .
Western Shoshone grandmother Carrie Dann , 75 , fighting new gold mining on sacred Mount Tenabo , and Timbisha Shoshone Chairman Joe Kennedy were among the grassroots American Indians attending .
Maori from New Zealand , Navajo , Gwich ’in , Lakota , Acoma Pueblo , O’odham , Dakota , Mohawk , Yaqui and Oneida joined First Nations and an Alaskan delegation to uphold the rights of Mother Earth and Indigenous Peoples in Bolivia .
Indigenous delegations from the north and south joined President Morales to open the conference with a blessing ceremony .
The Indigenous Environmental Network exposed the deception of REDD .
“ REDD is a predatory program that pretends to save forests and the climate , while backhandedly selling out forests out from under our Indigenous People , ” said Tom Goldtooth , director of the Indigenous Environmental Network ( IEN ) , based in Bemidji , Minn .
“ REDD will encourage continuing pollution and global warming , while displacing those of us least responsible for the crisis , who have been stewards of the forests since time immemorial . ”
The declarations forged by the working groups in Cochabamba will be taken to the Cancún summit by President Morales as a counter - proposal to the widely criticized Copenhagen Accord .
Movements of Indigenous Peoples , trade unions , farmers and environmentalists are also building momentum out of Cochabamba with plans for mass demonstrations in Cancún .
The Bolivian government said the protection and rational use of natural resources was the main proposal of the conference this week , which also advocated the penalization of nations harming the environment .
The creation of an International Court for Climate Justice to judge violators of environmental agreements was presented by Bolivian President Evo Morales .
Morales said the new structure should be validated by the United Nations .
The US media was noticeably absent from the conference in Tiquipaya , which began Monday .
However , the Summit had a significant international impact , according to experts interviewed by Telesur .
They assured that it has been fully justified and had an international scope with views to the Mexico climate summit slated for the end of the year and after the Copenhagen fiasco .
The Agreement of the Peoples in Spanish :
ACUERDO DE LOS PUEBLOS Conferencia Mundial de los Pueblos sobre el Cambio Climático y los Derechos de la Madre Tierra
Evo Morales calls for an International Court of Climate Justice
Prensa Latina
Cochabamba , Bolivia -- April 21 , 2010 -- Bolivia 's President Evo Morales stated on April 21 that the action by the peoples of the world will make others accept the International Court of Climate Justice proposed at the World People 's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth underway in Cochabamba .
" We know that capitalism will not admit such a thing , but only with the strength of the peoples , will we make them accept ... the need to punish those nations which do not protect the environment " , he said while addressing the conference .
According to Morales , strong social movements should be created in those countries where governments are not hand in hand with its peoples .
He expressed confidence that the Court of Climate Justice has quite a strong acceptance among social movements around the world .
Morales referred , too , to the failure of the UN climate summit in Copenhagen , Denmark , 2009 , and said this is a good moment to think about the Earth .
He also talked about an international referendum on climate also being discussed at the conference , and proposed a new organisations with the names Intercontinental Coordinator for Mother Earth ( Cimatierra ) and Movement for Mother Earth ( Mamatierra ) .
They would be responsible with submitting demands to the International Court of Justice .
It has been reported that the World People 's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth will now take place very two years .
Bolivia climate conference moves to establish Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth
Democracy Now ! -- April 22 , 2010
AMY GOODMAN : On this Earth Day special , we ’re broadcasting from the World Peoples ’ Summit on Climate Change and Rights of Mother Earth here in the Bolivian town of Tiquipaya .
One of the key initiatives of the climate conference here in Bolivia is to come out with a Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth .
South African environmental lawyer Cormac Cullinan is the co-president of the Rights of Mother Earth Working Group here at the summit .
He arrived at the climate change conference with a draft Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth that form the basis of the discussion here .
Cormac Cullinan joins me here in Tiquipaya .
We welcome you to Democracy Now !
CORMAC CULLINAN : Thank you .
It ’s good to be here .
AMY GOODMAN : Explain what is happening with this declaration .
CORMAC CULLINAN : Well , it ’s been a slightly chaotic process , but with incredible participation by everybody .
Every day in the working group , we ’ve had more than 400 people .
And yesterday at the plenary group we had well over that number , probably possibly a thousand people .
And everybody ’s been contributing directly to the text and to the substance of it .
There was a text which was produced beforehand , and then that was workshopped at a pre-conference here in Bolivia .
But there have been contributions from all over the world .
So the challenge really has been to ensure that we ’ve integrated all the different comments and points of view .
And it ’s been an amazing process .
One of the difficulties is that we are essentially expressing an entirely new worldview , particularly arising from an Indigenous perspective , in legal language which is understandable by essentially another culture .
So that ’s been quite a challenge in drafting .
AMY GOODMAN : Explain what this declaration is , though .
CORMAC CULLINAN :
What the declaration is , essentially , is — it ’s intended to complement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of — on the Human Rights .
So the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights only recognises that human beings have got inherent rights .
In other words , it says just because you exist as a human being , you have these rights , regardless of whether your country or government tries to take them away from you .
What we ’re saying is that everything has inherent rights .
By virtue of the fact that the Earth exists and all other creatures and mountains and rivers exist , they must also have inherent rights .
At least the right to exist , to play their part in the evolutionary processes of Mother Earth .
So the problem is , because we ’ve only recognised human rights , we ’ve created an imbalance .
So human rights trump everything else , because they do n’t have rights .
And we ’re trying to redress that balance by recognising the rights which surround human rights .
AMY GOODMAN : And how does it stand at the United Nations ?
CORMAC CULLINAN :
At the moment , it would require a state , such as Bolivia , to raise it at the United Nations and get it onto the agenda .
So at this stage , it ’s still very early in the process .
But I think the important thing about this in relation to climate change is this an initiative that looks at the causes of climate change .
It ’s not about arguing about the technicalities of cap and trade or technology , etc .
This is saying why do we have — why is climate change arising ?
And it ’s because of our relationship with Mother Earth .
And this is attempting to heal that relationship .
AMY GOODMAN : Your book was called Wild Law : A Manifesto for Earth Justice .
Why Wild Law ?
CORMAC CULLINAN : I was trying to draw attention to the fact that our legal systems are aimed at controlling and dominating nature , essentially , and that we need to change to an attitude of participation , and that wildness , in a sense , is a kind of a synonym for the natural creative energy of the universe , and that we need laws that enable that to flourish , rather than attempt to dominate it .
AMY GOODMAN : And where does all of this stand in South Africa ?
How is this received ?
CORMAC CULLINAN : Well , it ’s by no means accepted .
There are little bits and pieces in legislation that I ’ve drafted .
But really it ’s something that ’s happening all over the world .
So , in the United States , you have the Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund working for local communities on these issues .
In India , you have the Earth democracy movement , led by Vandana Shiva , as she ’s been a major player in that .
In Africa , these ideas of Earth jurisprudence — in other words , an Earth - centered approach to law — are spreading .
There are wild law conferences in England every year , and Australia has just started .
So it ’s really beginning to spread throughout the world .
AMY GOODMAN : Finally , the criticism of the conference , what does it mean ?
How is it binding ?
Or do you look at it as a gathering of people , 15,000 people , that would never have been able to participate in these world UN conferences ?
CORMAC CULLINAN : I think it ’s a symptom of much more important shift in global governance , because democracy used to be something that happened between diplomats behind closed doors , etc .
Now we are saying — you ’re seeing people saying , “ This is too important .
We cannot leave this to governments .
We have to take responsibility for addressing these issues . ”
So this is about people saying , “ We ’d like the UN to take this up , but even if it does n’t , we are — this is what we believe , and we ’re going to work on these issues right now . ”
AMY GOODMAN : Also , the history of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , how does that fit in ?
CORMAC CULLINAN :
That essentially came out the horrors of the Second World War , you know , and people feeling that something had to be done , this ca n’t go on anymore .
And we ’re in a similar position in history .
We are sitting here saying climate change is threatening humanity and many species , etc .
And what ‘s happening through these very formal negotiating processes between governments are n’t fast enough and do n’t go far enough and do n’t address the root causes .
And so , this is an initiative which comes out of a similar period of crisis to say we ’ve go to cut to the chase : what is wrong is our relationship with Mother Earth , and we must heal that .
So a lot of this declaration is about human responsibilities to Mother Earth , as well as the rights of Mother Earth .
AMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you very much for being with us , Cormac Cullinan , South African environmental lawyer , co-president of the Rights of Mother Earth Working Group here in Tiquipaya .
He arrived at the climate change conference with this draft Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth that ’s forming the basis of much of the discussion here .
People are chanting outside on this Earth Day , on this concluding day of the World Peoples ’ Summit .

Indigenous in Cochabamba condemn predatory REDD forest programs
By the Indigenous Environmental Network , Cochabamba
April 22 , 2010 -- Indigenous Peoples from across the Americas are in Cochabamba , Bolivia today to close the historic conference on climate change and the “ rights of Mother Earth ” hosted by President Evo Morales .
Morales , the only Indigenous head of state in the world , called this conference in the wake of failed climate talks in Copenhagen .
As the world prepares for the next round of talks in Cancún , Mexico , Indigenous Peoples vowed today to push for proposals that keep fossil fuels in the ground , protect Indigenous rights and reject predatory policies like Reducing Emissions Through Deforestation & Degradation ( REDD ) scheme .
“ REDD is branded as a friendly forest conservation program , yet it is backed by big polluters and climate profiteers .
We cannot solve this crisis with out addressing the root cause : a fossil fuel economy that disregards the rights of Mother Earth ” , said Alberto Saldamando , legal counsel for the International Indian Treaty Council .
“ President Morales has heard our recommendations on the structural causes of climate change and predatory carbon schemes like REDDs , and will bring our voices to the world stage in Cancún later this year . ”
This morning President Morales was joined by representatives of 90 governments and several heads of state to receive the findings of the conference on topics such as a climate tribunal , climate debt , just finance for mitigation and adaptation , agriculture and forests .
The working group on forests held one of the more hotly contested negotiations of the summit , but with the leadership of Indigenous Peoples , a consensus was reached to reject REDD and call for wide - scale grassroots reforestation programs .
The final declaration on forests states , “ We condemn the mechanisms of the neoliberal market , such as the REDD mechanism and its versions REDD + and REDD ++ , which are violating the sovereignty of our Peoples and their rights to free , prior and informed consent and self determination . ”
The working group on forests also challenged the definition of forests used by the United Nations , which permits plantations and transgenic trees , saying , “ Monocultures are not forests . ”
“ REDD is not a solution to climate change ” , said Marlon Santi , president of Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador ( CONAIE ) , the largest Indigenous organisation in that country .
“ REDD has been created by multilateral institutions like the World Bank that routinely violate Indigenous Peoples ’ rights and pollute Mother Earth .
It is perverse that these institutions are pretending to have the ‘ solution ’ when they have actually caused the climate crisis .
REDD should not be implemented in any country or community . ”
“ REDD is a predatory program that pretends to save forests and the climate , while backhandedly selling out forests out from under our Indigenous People ” , said Tom Goldtooth , director of the Indigenous Environmental Network ( IEN ) , based in Bemidji , MN .
“ REDD will encourage continuing pollution and global warming , while displacing those of us least responsible for the crisis , who have been stewards of the forests since time immemorial . ”
The declarations forged by the working groups in Cochabamba will be taken to the Cancún summit by President Morales as a counter - proposal to the widely criticised “ Copenhagen Accord ” .
Movements of Indigenous Peoples , trade unions , farmers and environmentalists are also building momentum out of Cochabamba with plans for mass demonstrations in Cancún .

People ’s climate summit seeks to halve emissions by 2020
April 22 , 2010 -- PWCCC -- A “ people ’s conference ” on climate change agreed in Bolivia on April 22 to call for the halving of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 , at the next UN climate meeting in Mexico in December .
Some 20,000 environmental activists , Indigenous leaders and unionists called for “ collective , then individual , obligations for the reduction of greenhouse gases ” , instead of the non-binding accord adopted at the end of last year in Copenhagen , which the group dubbed a “ failure ” .
Bolivia 's UN ambassador , Pablo Solon , said that a 50 per cent reduction could limit the warming of the planet to 1.5 degrees Celcius , instead of the two degrees agreed to in Copenhagen but which would not be met under current individual country pledges .
The three - day Cochabamba forum , organised by Bolivia 's leftist President Evo Morales , also recommended the creation of an international climate tribunal to judge countries on global warming .
It promised to take steps to create a declaration of Earth rights and to organise an international referendum on the environment to coincide with the next Earth Day , on April 22 , 2011 .
The conference followed a preparatory meeting between representatives from the world ’s leading economies in Washington ahead of the December UN summit in Cancun , Mexico .
The United States on April 19 downplayed hopes of clinching a new climate treaty this year , warning against unrealistic expectations despite what it said was growing agreement among major nations .
Lessons from Cochabamba on borders , labels and justice
By Michelle Chen
April 22 , 2010 -- RaceWire --
It ’s fitting that migration has been a major focus at the World People ’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth , which brought thousands from all around the world to gather and discuss the racial , socioeconomic and human rights issues that were all but ignored last year in the disastrous Copenhagen summit .
The surge of activists in Cochabamba was a reverse reflection of the kind of climate migration that has exploded around the globe , as environmental turmoil begets mass displacement and the destruction of communities and Indigenous cultures .
The working group on climate migrants linked population migration and the framework of social , environmental and cultural rights at the crux of the climate justice movement .
The conference participants hope to encourage the recognition of so - called environmental refugees in law and society .
Some of the principles put forward for dealing with climate migration involve basic legal protections and regulations , such as :
1 . To demand that international agreements consider the definition of climate migrant and that all states of the world comply with its determinations .
2 . To design global policies from the peoples , addressing climate change for governments to structure their local policies and internal regulations , respecting the systematic participation of peoples and territories involved .
3 . To develop a declaration of human rights for climate migrants , valid and recognized globally .
4 . To create an international peoples ’ organism that promotes a permanent investigation on political , social , cultural and economic situation of climate migrants , and controls as well the implementation of the policies proposed in this document .
5 . To demand the creation of an economic fund exclusively integrated by developed countries classified by the UN as the ones primarily responsible for climate change , in order to seek attention to internal and external climate migrants .
6 . To create mechanisms that regulate migration due to climate causes towards our countries , in order to prevent the occupation of our territories within a policy of migration control .
Many of these points dovetail with the overarching agenda for a just immigration policy advanced by activists in the United States .
The concept of migration as a reflection of human needs ( and of government imposed social and economic frustration ) is often sidelined or overlooked in the wrangling in Washington over quotas , visas and border patrols .
Yet Yasmine Brien , an activist with UK - based No Borders , questioned the entire system of categorisation , raising an interesting point about how classification of outsiders often serves to divide and control , rather than protect .
There 's a real push for trying to get recognition and protection for a new category of migrants .
But currently we have a system in Europe and in North America where the categories that we have are n't serving to protect people .
Refugees are n't treated with humane conditions or with dignity .
In Europe , we have immigration prisons , we lock children up indefinitely ...
And we just think it 's really important in terms of these discourses around climate migration , we 're really realistic about what it is that we 're working towards .
And while I have kind of engaged with the process here today , I think ultimately it can only be a very short - term position to try and ease some of the pressures .
But ultimately we need to be abolishing all of the border systems and stopping any categorisation of human beings .
We 're one human race , and we 're in this mess together .
And until we kind of consider that , and step out of these legal frameworks that are imposed on us by our nation - states , we 're not really going to solve the problems .
Okay , the abolition of national borders may seem far flung , particularly from the vantage point of the myopic political dialogue on immigration in Washington .
Yet Brien 's perspective on the social implications of legal categories for immigrants is particularly trenchant in the US context .
Officials and communities are constantly expected to siphon people according to their economic roles and legal status : illegal versus legal , guestworker programs , T - visas , U - visas , temporary protected status , green cards and taxpayer identification numbers .
After 9/11 , there was " special registration , " designed to blur the line between " terrorist " and " foreigner " .
Today the United States processes refugees and asylees , maintains no fly lists , demonises criminal " aliens " .
We hear that word " amnesty " being bandied about as both an aspiration and an epithet .
And we have clogged courts , tasked with sorting these strangers into a cold taxonomy .
As chaos of climate change forces unprecedented demographic shifts , we may see yet more labels , more borderlands turned into disaster zones or even battlefields .
The United States , for now , has been spared some of the heaviest impacts of climate migration , which are concentrated in " developing " regions .
Still , our current immigration crises has provoked plenty of anxiety in response to people being driven from their homes and desperately seeking a piece of North American privilege .
What some might call a demand for economic justice , others may see as an unjust taking -- and the legal categories the government tries to impose reveal the futility of codifying an arbitrary moral spectrum .
That 's why Arizona State Sen.
Russell Pearce can defend his state 's anti-immigrant bill by proclaiming , ' Illegal ' is not a race - - it 's a crime " ... and we 'll all know what he means .
Inside our borders and beyond , we see labels being wielded to exclude others rather than to serve justice .
Use with caution .
If you ’ve been hanging onto one Eclipse workspace for the last couple of years , you ’ll probably have dozens of projects cluttering up your workspace .
If you ’re an Eclipse RCP developer , you may be sitting with around 50 + projects easily .
The thing is that you ’ll often only work with 1 or 2 at a time , not the whole lot .
And sometimes you want a convenient way of only browsing projects belonging to a specific product / feature / layer / any - other - grouping - that - makes - sense .
Having all projects in a long list makes it difficult to manage and more difficult to browse .
That ’s why the Package Explorer and Project Explorer have a nice feature that reduces the clutter and allows you to organise your project into categories that make sense .
So instead of the Package Explorer looking unwieldy and flat like this ,
it could look like this :
Advertisement
How to categorise projects
This feature works closely with another Eclipse feature called Working Sets .
A working set is just a grouping of resources ( ie. files , folders and projects ) .
Each category is just a working set .
To categorise projects , we ’ll first create some working sets and then enable the feature in the Package Explorer .
To create a working set do the following :
Open the Package Explorer ( or Project Explorer ) and in the View Menu ( triangle in the upper , right corner ) , click Select Working Set… Click New … in the Select Working Set dialog .
Select Resource working set type and click Next .
On the next page select all the projects you want to include in the working set and pick a descriptive name for your working set .
Repeat the process for any other working sets you want .
Click Finish .
Here ’s an example of what the working set dialog should look like :
Now to enable the grouping feature .
Open the Package Explorer ’s View Menu again and enable Top Level Elements > Working Sets .
If it ’s the first time you do this , Eclipse will prompt you to configure working sets – a way to ask you which working sets to display in the Package Explorer .
Select all the working sets you created and click Ok .
You should now see your working sets in the Package Explorer and if you expand it , all the projects you selected will be shown .
Here ’s a quick video to give you an example of how this works and looks .
In the example , there are 8 projects , 3 belonging to the UI and 3 to the model .
The working sets will group them according to UI and Model .
There are also 2 projects that are scratchpad projects , so for now they wo n’t be categorised .
Notes :
A project can belong to as many working sets as you want , so it can appear in a number of categories .
You can choose which working sets display in the Package Explorer by choosing Configure Working Sets … from the View Menu and then selecting / deselecting the relevant working sets .
NB !
This menu item is not available if you ’re not in the Working Set layout .
… from the View Menu and then selecting / deselecting the relevant working sets .
NB !
This menu item is not available if you ’re not in the Working Set layout .
To get back to the normal view , select Top Level Elements >
Projects from the View Menu .
from the View Menu .
Any project not assigned to a working set goes to a category called Other Projects .
This is n’t really a working set , but a default category that Eclipse assigns to group unassigned projects .
You can reorder working sets by dragging and dropping them anywhere .
New projects can quickly be assigned to working sets by either dragging and dropping them onto the working set or right - clicking on the project and selecting Assign Working Sets .
Limitations :
Although working sets help you organise resources , any new resources wo n’t automatically be added to a working set , even if their parent already belongs to that working set .
In our case , this means that any new project needs to be explicitly added to a working set , otherwise it will appear in the Other Projects category .
Normally you can do this on New Project wizards , so watch out for these .

Some good reasons why you should categorise your projects
Now that you know how to group projects , you might be wondering why you should .
Well , apart from just looking a lot cleaner and less cluttered , it also means that you can act on a group of projects at a time .
For example , you can right - click on a working set in Package Explorer and open , close or refresh all projects in that working set .
The same applies to Team commands ( nice for selective updates ) .
Another reason is that you can now selectively search only those projects by telling Eclipse to only search certain working sets .
Now you do n’t have to pick up occurrences in test or scratchpad projects if you do n’t want to .
There are a host of other Eclipse commands that act only on individual working sets ( eg. build , problems , etc ) .
And the last reason is that now it ’s a lot easier to navigate the Package Explorer with the keyboard .
Another reason to start learning Eclipse keyboard shortcuts and also impress your colleagues .

Jiegu , China ( CNN ) --
Unstable bridges and collapsed roadways kept rescuers and their heavy equipment away Thursday from Jiegu , China -- the town nearest the epicenter of a 6.9 magnitude earthquake that killed nearly 600 people and injured thousands more .
Twenty - four hours after the Wednesday quake , most of Jiegu 's dead were in the dusty rubble of a hotel that crumbled under the strain of the initial quake and a series of strong aftershocks .
Residents painstakingly picked through the debris with shovels and ropes , ever mindful that time is a formidable obstacle to finding survivors .
" We have to mainly rely on our hands to clear away the debris as we have no large excavating machines , " police officer Shi Huajie told the state - run news agency Xinhua .
Injured survivors are n't clear of difficulty either -- the remote , mountainous and impoverished region in Qinghai province has few doctors and rapidly dwindling medical supplies .
And then there was the lack of electrical power -- the quakes cracked a hydroelectric power plant , forcing authorities to shut it down , making even a nearby airport unusable until portable generators could go online .
Are you there ?
Send your photos , video , stories
Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao ordered local authorities to " go all out to save the disaster - stricken people , " Xinhua said .
Vice Premier Hui Liangyu was dispatched to the region .
The quake shook the region shortly before 8 a.m. Wednesday ( Tuesday 8 p.m. ET ) , when many residents were still at home and schools were just getting started for the day .
Nearly 60 of the dead were students at several schools in the province , authorities told Xinhua , and more than 50 are trapped in the debris with little chance of rescue .
Xinhua reported that 25 students were rescued from a vocational school , and another 23 from a primary school .
Can buildings be made earthquake - proof ?
" Our top priority is to save students , " Kang Zifu , an army officer in Jiegu , told Xinhua .
" Schools are always places that have many people . "
China 's state run CCTV reported that more than 1,000 people had been rescued , but authorities said they expected the death toll to rise .
Qinghai province in northwestern China , home to about five million people , is considered a gateway to Himalayan Tibet .
More than half its people are Han Chinese , but the area is home to more than 40 different ethnic groupings , including Tibetans , Hui and Mongols .
How to help : Impact Your World
Jiegu is in Yushu prefecture , a Tibetan region with a population of about 350,000 people -- about a third of whom live in Jiegu .
Most are poor , making their living as farmers and herdsmen .
But the region is also rich in natural gas and marked by copper , tin and coal mines .
The region has a long history of earthquakes , 53 with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater since 2001 , according to China 's Earthquake Administration .
One Jiegu resident told CNN that when his house began to shake , he grabbed his family and ran outside .
Then came another quake , and his house collapsed .
His family is now in tents , he said , but he had managed to buy water .
He said they had seen no government assistance .
World 's biggest earthquakes since 1900
People were living in fear , the man said , and some were headed up into the mountains to escape the threat of flooding should the reservoir -- also cracked in the quake -- break .
More than 85 percent of the mostly wooden and earth - walled houses in Gyegu had collapsed , a prefecture official told Xinhua .
In Yushu , 90 percent of the houses collapsed , leaving many homeless , the Hong Kong Red Cross said .
Temperatures in the area are forecast to be around the freezing mark at night , the Red Cross said , so " provision of emergency shelters for the victims remains a high priority . "
CNN 's John Vause and Eve Bower contributed to this report .

Mercedes GP boss Ross Brawn says his team is aiming to win the season - opening Bahrain Grand Prix , despite admitting that his outfit is not as prepared as it would like to be .
" Bahrain .
Our objective is to start in Bahrain , " he told the official Formula 1 website when asked when he expected to win races .
" Once we see where everybody is , we 'll see what sort of task that we have to carry out and how we need to react .
Our target is always to win the next race .
And the next race is Bahrain . "
Brawn said , however , that Mercedes was still not 100 per cent ready and that the winter had been difficult .
" We are not quite as well prepared as I would like to be , but we are getting there , " he said .
" It 's been quite a difficult winter .
I think as it was the first winter with 450 people , as opposed to 700 , we 've felt the loss in a few areas .
" But I 'm reasonably happy with the car .
It 's showing good promise .
We need to keep up our development speed , and then we should be okay . "
The Briton admitted his team was somewhat off the pace of the leading squads , but claimed he was not too worried about it .
" I do n't think that it is a second , " he said of the gap to Ferrari and McLaren .
" You have to look into the details of what has been done .
I think that on our high fuel runs and our race runs , when we get the car right , we are competitive .
It 's just a little tricky to get the car right .
Michael has n't carried out a proper low - fuel qualifying run , but Nico ( Rosberg ) had a go with lower fuel and it was definitely not bad .
He ended the third test day with the best overall time .
So I do n't think that we are a second away .
As I said before , we are not quite where we would like to be yet , but it 's a moving target .
" That 's the nature of our business .
The team that is leading is always the target for everyone else , and there is only one team that can lead - all the rest have to play catch up .
" We go through phases of being the leader , and phases of being the ones trying to catch up .
At the moment we 've probably got more catching up to do , but I am not overly concerned . "
And Brawn confirmed the team will introduce a major upgrade to its car for the first race of the season .
He added : " We have an update for Bahrain .
We decided not to bring it to Barcelona but leave it until the last moment .
We 've learnt to assess and run pieces without testing them .
It 's crucial when you have seasons without testing , as you have to bring upgrades to races during the year .
" In Barcelona we had little bits and pieces , but the major upgrade will be introduced in Bahrain .

If you 're tired of being tied down to a two - year commitment , it may be time to rethink why you 're still hanging onto that expensive ball and chain .
Below , we 'll take a look at what benefits you may enjoy from a prepaid plan over a contract , then we 'll examine the prepaid vs. contract cellphone plans for several of the U.S. carriers to give you a better idea of whether or not you might benefit from ditching your contract and going prepaid .

Prepaid vs. Contract : The Pros and Cons
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
In many countries , you can go to your local convenience store , buy a prepaid SIM for relatively cheap , and you 're ready to make calls in minutes with no contract .
The downside ?
Often you 'll need your own phone .
With a contract , carriers often subsidize the retail value of a phone in exchange for a fixed commitment from the customer .
You 're basically paying for the discount .
So what 's the real price you 're paying for that two - year contract , as opposed to going prepaid ?
Examine Your Habits
Before you make any decision about going contract or going prepaid , you need to know your talking habits well .
There are a variety of prepaid options :
You can pay for X number of minutes , or you can pay by the day that you need access .
Things to consider include how much in - network calling you do , and whether you call during nights and weekends .
So , look at your recent phone statements , and look at them well .

The Money and Phone Issue
You 've got several reasons to consider prepaid .
If you suspect that what you pay in contract is more expensive than what you could pay prepaid , looking into this option is a valid alternative .
( You might also want to try BillShrink to see other ways to cut down on your phone service . )
Even if you 're currently out of contract , but your talking and data needs have changed , changing your plan will often obligate you to commit to a new contract for another two years , regardless of what provider you use .
For the commitment - phobic , early phone adopters , or constant phone switchers , contracts can be huge detriments .
Keeping Your Number
While contract plans can seem like the adult grown - up version to the prepaid equivalent , this option is n't just an alternative for unwieldy teenagers .
The major carriers will allow you to port your existing number to prepaid plans , and if you 're already using a Google Voice number to manage your existing numbers you wo n't have to change a thing to get started .

Note :
For the following non-scientific comparisons , we compared the features of the contract version to the prepaid version that each carrier offered .
To simplify things , we did not account for SMS and data packages .
Since the cost of a cellphone could vary widely , we opted for a free non-smartphone whenever possible and noted this circumstance wherever we could .
AT&T : GoPhone 's Pay by the Day or Prepaid Plan ?
Advertisement
For AT&T , we started off with an individual plan that would most likely fulfill everyone 's needs .
If you switched to AT&T's GoPhone prepaid monthly plan , you would pay $ 10 more every month for less anytime , and night and weekend minutes .
Over a contract span , that 's $ 240 more expensive than the contract .
Their two - year commitment Nation 450 contract plan , on the other hand , costs $ 959.76 over two years .
If you stuck with the prepaid monthly plan for two years , it would cost roughly $ 1200 .
The monthly prepaid option in this case is not ideal for a long - term solution , but if you wanted the freedom to change carriers at any time , you'd be able to opt out of service without paying any cancellation fee , which would likely level the playing field .
AT&T's GoPhone Pay - by - the - Day option is a much better value over the Nation 450 with its unlimited calling feature , but only if you use your phone less than 13 days out of the month .
But there 's another prepaid plan worth noting : AT&T 's Simple pay - as - you - go plan allows for unlimited talking and texting for $ 60 ( you can even text internationally for free ) .
If you need an unlimited plan , it 's much better than the contract unlimited version that requires you to pay $ 69.99 per month without text .
The contract requires you to pony up $ 240 more , which , not surprisingly , is enough to buy a phone .

AT&T also allows the option of adding text and data plans to prepaid options .
If you have a smartphone , this feature can easily translate to savings if you know what you 're doing .
You could , for example , have Google Voice route your call to Skype for free calls and utilize it for texts .

Verizon : Contract is Better Than Prepaid
Advertisement
Out of all the major wireless carriers that we surveyed , Verizon offers the most expensive prepaid plans .
There 's no option to buy minutes — instead , you 'll be paying for access by the day .
While the decision between contract and prepaid depends a lot on your situation , prepaid generally seems like a poor value on Verizon .
If you want the best prepaid deal with Verizon , you 'll pay $ 3.99 a day for " unlimited " access .
Verizon also offers a messaging bundle , but no data package for its prepaid options .

T- Mobile 's Contract and Contract - Less Plans : You 're Better Off Without the Contract
T- Mobile has prepaid options like any good major wireless carrier should .
But what distinguishes this carrier from others is the new ability to stay on a plan and go contract - less .
Called the Even More and the Even More Plus plans , both plans feature free in - network calling , and free nights and weekends .
Each feature the ability to add on SMS and data packages , with the only difference being contract length and phone discounts .
The Even More plan requires a two - year contract and offers a phone discount , while the Even More Plus plan requires no contract and does n't offer a phone discount .
Advertisement
We crunched the numbers , picking a 500 - minute plan as our basis .
The results :
Advertisement
In the analysis above , we can see that the Even More Plus 500 ends up cheaper than its contract version .
Since the huge variable factor is the phone , we ran an eBay search and returned the Samsung Gravity 2 for around $ 100 .
If you 're willing to purchase from a third - party , that brings the overall cost of the Even More Plus 500 down to $ 819.75 , making it about $ 140 cheaper to stay out of contract .
( The longer you stay , the better value you get for the Even More Plus plan .
But based on the above values , if you do n't plan to stay for at least 20 months , the Even More Plus is seemingly more expensive — until you realize , regardless , you 're locked in for two years with the Even More plan . )
We did n't compare T - Mobile 's true prepaid plans , but seeing as how the main draw of prepaid plans is the ability to stay contract - less , we opted to focus on the Even More Plus plan .
In the end , Even More Plus remains a better value than any of T - Mobile 's other prepaid options unless you talk only at night to other T - Mobile customers and you do not talk every day .
T - Mobile prepaid options also lack the ability to add a SMS or data package .

So What 's The Point ?
At the end of the day , the point is n't just to save more money ( even though that 's often a big factor ) .
It 's about not being tied to a particular carrier or phone for two years just because you signed a contract , or just so you could save a little money up front on a phone you 'll want to replace in less than two years , anyway .
With prepaid , contract - free plans , you can focus on what should matter most : the quality of coverage and service a carrier provides .

Everyone 's been stuck in a contract or two , so let us know your thoughts below .

The Catholic abuse scandal just keeps getting bigger .
As more information comes to light about the pope 's involvement in abuse coverups -- the New York Times follows yesterday 's astounding story on the Wisconsin cases with more evidence of the pope 's involvement in a Munich case -- questions about the Catholic church 's response are growing .
As Choire Sicha of irreverant blog The Awl puts it , echoing the thoughts of many : " So the very head of the Catholic Church is directly implicated in multiple coverups of and inaction regarding child abuse .
Whatever do we think the Church will do ? "
Good question .
Many are beginning to call for the pope 's removal or resignation -- the Wire covered Andrew Sullivan 's dramatic piece on the subject here -- but are those really possibilities ?
Here 's the guide to the debate over what 's possible , what 's plausible , and what 's necessary .
Resignation as Penance
In a letter to The Independent , Maureen McCulloch writes of learning , as a young Catholic , that confession is " essential but not sufficient " for absolution of sin .
" One had to have serious repentance , and could demonstrate this ( to God , oneself and others ) by doing penance . "
What does that mean here ?
" Cardinal Brady should resign and hand himself to the authorities in Ireland .
Pope Benedict should do the same in Germany and all the others who were part of this terrible affair all over the world should examine their consciences and follow suit . "
It 's not about blame but about " these men as devout Catholics , by examining their own consciences , seeing that they have sinned and realising that they need to do penance .
They do n't need me , or anyone else , to tell them that . "
Resignation , End to Celibacy
That 's what Andrew Sullivan calls for , as we covered yesterday .
' Full Criminal Investigation of the Vatican '
That 's what self - identified Catholic singer Sinead O'Connor is calling for , interviewed by Henry Chu in the L.A. Times .
She does n't specifically mention resignation .
The Definitive Guide to Getting Rid of the Pope ( Summary : It 's Really Hard ) Slate 's Christopher Beam gets down to business .
The pope cannot be removed from office --" according to church law , there is no higher authority than the pope . "
Nor can the pope be prosecuted under secular law - - he has immunity with regard to local law , and for the purposes of international law is also immune , as he is considered a head of state .
Clearly , there have been exceptions to " the sovereign - immunity rule , " but Slobodan Milosevic is n't likely to serve as a precedent for dealing with the pope .
Technically , continues Beam , once heads of state leave office , they can be prosecuted for crimes committed before they took office ( before the immunity period began ) -- but " the pope almost never retires . "
The one option open :
A pope may resign , but his resignation must be " made freely , " and he does n't have to tender his resignation to any particular authority .
( The last pope to resign was Gregory XII , who did so in 1415 to end the battle for the papacy known as the Western schism . )
Do n't Expect a Resignation " Inevitably , " writes the Guardian 's Madeleine Bunting , " people ask dramatic questions such as can the pope survive , can the Catholic church survive ?
No pope has resigned for centuries , " she states flatly .
" The pope is likely to stagger on , the prestige of his office much battered . "
No Joke -- Look at the History , adds Mary Ann Sorrentino , who has a long adversarial relationship with the Catholic hierarchy -- a Catholic , she was excommunicated for her directorship of the Rhode Island chapter of Planned Parenthood .
The church has a long history of protecting its pontiffs , even when they 've ordered killings , allowed the faithful to be slaughtered , fathered illegitimate children , stolen and worse ...
Short of the unlikely revival of the feudal tradition ( rumored to have been used last on Pope John Paul I ) in which pontiffs making waves might be poisoned ( or tossed in the Tiber , or fatally injured by an arranged fall off their horse ) , Ratzinger will be pope until his natural death .
The brutal politics of Rome make anything inside Washington 's Beltway -- or in the darkest political reaches of Iran , Russia or Beijing -- look benign by comparison .
Resignation Is n't the Worst that Can Happen " The danger , " writes Catholic David Gibson at Politics Daily , " is not so much that the pope will resign -- that wo n't happen , " he agrees , " and maybe can't happen , under the church 's arcane rules and traditions . "
Rather , he continues , " the real risk is that with new reports of his own record emerging seemingly daily ... the bishop of Rome , despite the aura and authority of his office -- handed down from St. Peter himself - - will begin to look like every other bishop these days . "
That 's bad for the Church , Gibson says .

With the Liberal Democrat surge showing the deficiencies of Britain 's electoral system , our Charlemagne columnist warns that government by coalition has its own pitfalls
IN BRITAIN , surging support for the country 's third party , the Liberal Democrats , has come as a shock after decades of dominance by Labour and the Tories .
Elsewhere in Europe , the popularity of the Lib Dem leader , Nick Clegg , has inspired a different reaction : is Britain about to become a more normal country , and shed its aversion to compromise and coalitions ?
Writing in El País , a former Spanish diplomat once posted to London observed the fuss being caused in Britain by the prospect of a hung parliament ( or , as the Lib Dems prefer to say , a “ balanced parliament ” ) , and gently noted : “ In no continental European country would the question have the slightest importance . ”
A correspondent for Europe1 , a French television station , said of the Lib Dem surge : “ Great Britain , the home of two party politics par excellence , can't make head nor tail of it ” before sadly reporting a BBC analysis that even with a third of the vote each , Labour could win some 276 seats , the Conservatives 226 seats and the Lib Dems just 119 .
In the Netherlands , where a coalition government has just fallen in a row over Dutch troops in Afghanistan , triggering early elections ( but not riots in the streets ) , an editorial in NRC Handelsblad called for a change in the “ first past the post rules ” used in British general elections , saying :
“ In London , compromises are seen as a first step towards political instability .
But this simple fear of novelty could quickly be overcome .
Most countries on the European continent have a far more representative electoral system than the UK does .
Since the British devolution of government powers , Scotland has adopted a system that gives political minorities a fighting chance .
This proves it can be done . ”
For the past five years , your correspondent has been based in Brussels .
The city is home to a lot of coalitions .
All levels of Belgian federal and regional government involve an array of parties .
Then there is the European Parliament , a strange legislature that has no majority or opposition , and often seems like a never - ending session of multi-party horse - trading .
Thus Brussels is a hard place to defend the British fondness for majority governments , and its winner takes all electoral system .
And yet , for all that Britain 's electoral system looks like an outlier of dubious fairness , living in Brussels teaches another lesson .
In its practical day to day consequences , coalition rule stifle democracy , too .
a government that included every party would enjoy the support of 100 % of voters , and be perfectly democratic
A while ago , your correspondent debated Louis Michel , then Belgium 's EU commissioner and a long - time party baron of the Francophone liberal party , Mouvement Réformateur .
In Britain , rumbled M Michel , the Liberal Democrats can win a quarter of the popular vote and be totally excluded from power .
How is that democratic ?
In Belgium , he went on , the current five party coalition enjoys the cumulative support of two thirds of the electorate : now that is democracy .
Is it really ?
Take Mr Michel 's argument to its logical extreme and a Belgian government that included every parliamentary party would enjoy the support of 100 % of voters , and be perfectly democratic .
The practical problem with coalition politics is all too visible after Belgian elections .
Parties can be rewarded and punished by voters , as their share of the vote rises and falls .
Such changes can evict a prime minister , who by Belgian convention must come from the party with the most votes .
But there the power of voters largely ends .
Once an election is over , a process of coalition formation starts that can take many months , and which is entirely opaque .
At the most recent national elections , the French and Dutch speaking socialist parties were clear losers , as was the Flemish liberal party .
Two of the three parties ended up with ministers back in the new government .
At the 2009 European Parliament elections , the largest left - wing block , the Party of European Socialists , was thumped , shedding 31 seats .
A short while later , the socialists held private talks with the centre - right block that had beaten them and stitched up a deal to share out the European Union 's top jobs between them : thus the European Commission presidency went to a conservative man from a small southern country José Manuel Barroso , and the new post of foreign policy chief went to a centre - left woman from a big northern country , Britain 's Catherine Ashton .
In both Belgian and EU politics , the stitch - ups are endless , with one constant : party leaders use the system to control rank and file parliamentarians and increase their power ( not for nothing has a Belgian senator described the system as a “ Party - ocracy ” ) .
Belgian political coverage is only sparingly about policy differences .
Day after day the press traces the squabbles and feuds of factional leaders , and speculates about whether this or that coalition or pact is about to fall apart .
In the European Parliament , voters cannot choose between fish or fowl : every course is soup
In the European Parliament , the big trans-national blocks function as cartels , with little heed to ideological coherence .
Perhaps a European voter may have strong views on globalisation , for instance .
Alas , thanks to those baggy power cartels , and the endless deals they strike with each other , it is hard to cast a ballot that will have the slightest effect on the parliament 's actions .
Take the largest centre right group , the European People 's Party .
Is it for or against free enterprise ?
Well , it depends .
It includes some free - marketeering parties , like Sweden 's ruling Moderates .
But it also contains parties from France , Greece or eastern Europe which are rather corporatist in outlook , and frankly warier of free enterprise than some members of Europe 's main centre - left block , such as the British Labour Party or the Swedish Social Democrats .
Real power rests in the hands of key members of specialist committees and party bosses , who strike complex voting deals with each other .
Voter preferences could not matter less .
In the European Parliament , voters cannot choose between fish or fowl : every course is soup .
Coalition government does not mean a country is badly run as a matter of course .
Belgian deal - making sometimes produces compromises that are genuinely centrist .
The federal government spent months wrangling about unlawful immigrants living in the country , including failed asylum seekers .
Ministers agreed a modest amnesty for those with longstanding ties to Belgium who had made credible attempts to become legal : that reasonably humane policy probably reflected the centre of political gravity , though it would have been hard for some ruling parties to put it in their manifestoes before the election .
But such successes can still feel like a victory for a technocratic rule by an elite , over the conscious shaping of policies by voters .
British majority rule may look like an elected dictatorship to outsiders , but it does have the virtue of transparency and accountability .
At best , you can argue ( in the words of one senior figure ) that all British parties are coalitions in their own right , with a wide span of views from left to right within the Conservatives , Labour and the Lib Dems .
That allows voters to choose the “ coalition ” that best suits their views , and to know what policies they are likely to get .
If that seems a bit of a stretch , try this : at least bad ideas can be tested to destruction in the British system .
In Belgium or the European Parliament , fewer voters feel left out , but few politicians are accountable directly for very much at all .
Small wonder , perhaps , that turnout in Euro- elections has fallen with each poll since direct elections began .
Voting in Belgium is compulsory , which is one reason why citizens bother to vote .
The other is to defend the electoral quota assigned to their tribal faction in society .
( As well as the usual right , left and centre divides , all parties are split into separate French and Dutch speaking entities ) .
With so many interests to please ( Belgium is a fractious place ) , it is no accident that , in per capita terms , Belgium 's public sector employs more adults than any other in the developed world .
In a country run by coalitions , all must have prizes .
The SNP manifesto amounted to a demand for money
It is true that coalitions can protect minority interests .
But they can also give minorities disproportionate clout .
It is common in Europe to find small parties that exist largely to demand money , public services and rights for specific groups : Swedish - speakers in Finland , Hungarian - speakers in Slovakia , ethnic Turks in Bulgaria and so on .
As such parties are ideologically flexible and reliably elect a phalanx of deputies to each parliament , they are the ideal ally for bigger parties trying to build majority coalitions .
In the most benign cases , such parties are almost always in power , even when their ministers are not terribly good .
At worse , especially in the ex-communist block , such ethnic special - interest parties can be notoriously corrupt , demanding posts like the ministry of public works and using them to distribute contracts and public money .
Right on cue , the Scottish National Party issued its manifesto for the British general elections on April 20th , setting out its hopes for a hung parliament on May 6th ( though the SNP likes to talk about a “ balanced parliament ” ) .
The manifesto amounted to a demand for money , in exchange for SNP support of a future coalition government .
Let England talk about budget cuts to tackle the deficit , the manifesto promised in effect : vote SNP , and Scotland will be spared austerity .
In theory , Europe 's coalitions sound more legitimate .
Up close , they do not always look very good for democracy .
Call it a European paradox .
If Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems do not fizzle out before the general elections on May 6th , it may become a British paradox too .

The government forced through the controversial digital economy bill with the aid of the Conservative party last night , attaining a crucial third reading – which means it will get royal assent and become law – after just two hours of debate in the Commons .
However it was forced to drop clause 43 of the bill , a proposal on orphan works which had been opposed by photographers .
They welcomed the news : " The UK government wanted to introduce a law to allow anyone to use your photographs commercially , or in ways you might not like , without asking you first .
They have failed , " said the site set up to oppose the proposals .
But despite opposition from the Liberal Democrats and a number of Labour MPs who spoke up against measures contained in the bill and put down a number of proposed amendments , the government easily won two votes to determine the content of the bill and its passage through the committee stage without making any changes it had not already agreed .
Tom Watson , the former Cabinet Office minister who resigned in mid-2009 , voted against the government for the first time in the final vote to take the bill to a third reading .
However the vote was overwhelmingly in the government 's favour , which it won by 189 votes to 47 .
Earlier the government removed its proposed clause 18 , which could have given it sweeping powers to block sites , but replaced it with an amendment to clause 8 of the bill .
The new clause allows the secretary of state for business to order the blocking of " a location on the internet which the court is satisfied has been , is being or is likely to be used for or in connection with an activity that infringes copyright " .
The Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming protested that this could mean the blocking of the whistleblower site Wikileaks , which carries only copyrighted work .
Stephen Timms for the government said that it would not want to see the clause used to restrict freedom of speech – but gave no assurance that sites like Wikileaks would not be blocked .
Don Foster , the Liberal Democrats ' spokesman for culture , media and sport , protested that the clause was too wide - ranging : " it could apply to Google , " he complained , adding that its inclusion of the phrase about " likely to be used " meant that a site could be blocked on its assumed intentions rather than its actions .
The Lib Dem opposition to that amendment prompted the first vote - known as a division – on the bill , but the Labour and Conservative whips pushed it through , winning it by 197 votes to 40 .
The next 42 clauses of the bill were then considered in five minutes .
Numerous
MPs complained that the bill was too important and its ramifications too great for it to be pushed through in this " wash - up " period in which bills are not given the usual detailed examination .
However the government declined to yield – although it had already done a deal with the Tories which meant that a number of its provisions , including clause 43 and the creation of independent local news consortia , would not be part of the bill .
Nico Hulkenberg wo n’t drive a better circuit than this in 2010 .
The Williams driver lapped the Nurburgring Nordschleife in a Porsche 911 GT3 R Hybrid .
The car uses F1 - derived KERS technology supplied by Williams Hybrid Power .
Hulkenberg was equally enthusiastic about the car and the 20.8 km ( 12.9 miles ) , 154 - turn track :
This test was great fun .
I ’m impressed with how well the hybrid system works in the Porsche .
This circuit is unique – you ca n’t compare it to any other track in the world .
This is certainly not the last time I ’ll drive here .
Surprisingly , in the slow corners , the 911 is not far off a Formula 1 car .
The mechanical grip is impressive .
Nico Hulkenberg
Porsche did n’t issue any lap times for his three - lap run .
Hulkenberg added : “ Great car , fascinating technology and an incomparable track . ”
The car uses two 82 bhp electric motors and flywheel generators to provide a power boost which the driver can use on - demand , similar to the system Williams developed for F1 last year but never raced .
Porsche believe the system is more efficient than a battery - based Kinetic Energy Recovery System :
Compared to a battery , the flywheel generator has the advantage of storing and delivering high amounts of energy considerably quicker .
Thanks to its sophisticated electronic control , the innovative hybrid drive of the 911 GT3 R Hybrid automatically provides optimal efficiency at racing speed .
The combination of the combustion engine and electric motors fulfils a simple objective : Less fuel consumption without compromising performance .
When overtaking or accelerating out of a bend , the driver can manually override the controls by pressing the boost paddle on the steering wheel and sending energy from the charged flywheel generator to the front axle .
This additional power of 120 kilowatts is available to the driver after each charge process for approximately six to eight seconds .
The 911 GT3 R Hybrid will content the Nurburgring 24 Hours at the circuit on May 15th and 16th .

My favourite Russian helicopters are those designed by the Kamov design bureau , which specializes in helicopters with contra-rotating rotors , which do n't require the tail rotor needed to counteract the torque created by a single main rotor .
The tail rotor requires a significant amount of power , anywhere from 10 % to 25 % of the total , so a contra- rotating design is inherently more efficient , potentially allowing great lifting capacity and speed , and the lack of a tail rotor is also a significant benefit from the point of view of safety of people operating around the craft .
Two different configurations of the Kamov Ka-226 Sergei light multi-purpose helicopter were shown , this one hauling some drums and another one with a rear cabin occupying the space behind the cockpit .
The Ka-226 is an update of the Ka -26 " flying chassis " first delivered in 1965 .
The detachable cabin can be used for medical evacuation or transport of personnel , or other equipment can be fitted for agricultural or other commercial work .
Bears in a Honey Trap
The phone call came in the middle of the night .
The tape , the caller said , was already online .
It was past two , but Viktor Shenderovich , Russia ’s pre-eminent political satirist , knew he had to move , to get his side of the story out before Moscow awoke to watch video of him , naked , hairy , and vulnerable , having sex with a young woman named Katya , already infamous for luring a who ’s - who of the Russian opposition to her bugged apartment for kinky sex and drugs .
Shenderovich had been anticipating this moment and now it had arrived , two days before his daughter ’s wedding day .
Shenderovich , who says he is happily married , fessed up .
Yes , he wrote on his blog , " I fucked Katya . "
In any other country , the confession would have hit like a thunderclap .
Sure , the first wave of the kompromat had already broken in March , when Mikhail Fishman , the editor - in - chief of the liberal Russian Newsweek , was caught on a clumsy Internet video cutting lines with a half - naked Katya , who apparently also went by Moomoo .
The revelation prompted Ilya Yashin , an up - and - coming young opposition politician , and other opposition members to preemptively post their stories of being seduced by the same woman .
Yashin , Fishman , and Dmitry Oreshkin , a liberal commentator , were also shown attempting to bribe traffic cops .
But the resultant scandal — if one can call collective eye - rolling a scandal — focused entirely on the sloppy , dirty tactics used to entrap the young men , not on their behavior .
With Shenderovich , however , it might have been a different story .
Shenderovich is , after all , nothing short of a Russian household name .
For well over a decade , he has been speaking truth to power in the best traditions of political comedy .
His political TV show Kukly ( or " puppets , " for the dolls representing the country ’s elite ) , running from 1994 to 2002 , first needled Boris Yeltsin , then Vladimir Putin .
It earned Shenderovich two indictments and the show ’s cancellation , and contributed to the state ’s takeover of the show ’s host channel , NTV .
Shenderovich is Russia ’s Jon Stewart , if Jon Stewart had been on the air longer — and if the Bush era had never ended .
And here was Shenderovich , on tape and in the lewdest , most embarrassing way possible — " Well , I guess I ’m not hopeless if I ’m still a little bit appealing to girls , " he says in the tape , as he undresses for the waiting Moomoo — cheating on his wife with a girl his daughter ’s age .
In a fedora .
Yet nothing much happened that Thursday morning :
For the most part , the story sank like a stone .
In fact , the main thing people wondered about was why Russia ’s opposition — a splintered , leaderless scrum already so effectively neutered by the Kremlin that they do n’t have a single seat in the Duma — would be the focus of such an elaborate hit job .
There are no elections coming up , and none of those targeted have made a bid for power recently — because they know they ’re hopeless .
Even Shenderovich is no longer the star he used to be .
He lost his television platform when NTV was wrested away by the government , and he has been effectively blacklisted ever since .
Moreover , Russians have always loved womanizers .
It is central to the concept of muzhik , the manly salt - of - the - earth man .
Whenever a rumor of another Yeltsin woman surfaced , his ratings spiked instantly .
When Alina Kabaeva , the rhythmic gymnast with R- rated flexibility , was said to be the new Mrs. Putin — and mother of his only son — it did not hurt the prime minister one bit .
Even the most recent sex tape scandal — in 1999 , prosecutor Yuri Skuratov , who antagonized both Yeltsin and Putin , was filmed in bed with two young women — had no serious ramifications .
Skuratov was already in trouble for exposing government graft , but the sex tape , promoted by Putin on national TV , just made the Kremlin look bad , and the person deemed responsible for making it was quickly fired .
In typical muzhik fashion , Shenderovich and the two other opposition figures caught on the tape blew the whole thing off with a bravado that seemed to hold only a bit of defensiveness .
" I possessed Katya without any particular enjoyment , " Shenderovich wrote on his blog .
" In the process , my colleague was boring , like all you vile Gestapovites . "
( " I would have been better off had I gone to the gym , " he told me later .
" I would have burnt more calories .
It would have been better for my health in every sense . " )
When we met for coffee the day after the tape hit the Internet , however , Shenderovich admitted that the exposure stung .
" I have a reputation , and I treasure it , " he said .
" Imagine knowing that all those people , everyone you know , have seen this tape . "
But for the most part he played the unrepentant swinger : " I have never written anywhere that I am a saint .
I have never announced anywhere that I am monogamous .
If I had and then got tangled up in this , then they could say , like with Clinton , ‘ Guys , turns out he ’s lying ! ’ "
Moreover , the brainy , stocky Shenderovich joked , the tape in no way discredits him .
" If anything , I ’d say I dispatched my male duties satisfactorily . "
The cultural difference between Shenderovich and his American counterparts is striking .
Caught in embarrassing moments , American public figures prostrate themselves before the public , and before their families — in public .
Russians , however , lack what they see as this deeply Puritanical impulse , so they swagger and mock , or yawn .
" People who expect this response " — that the opposition should wither in contrition — " are not getting the particularities of the Russian mentality , " Yashin , who also shook off his tryst with Moomoo , saying he ’d weathered far worse political storms , told me .
" It ’s a reason for impeachment in America .
Here it ’s ‘ big props . ’
Even when they see Shenderovich in this tape , they say , ‘ Not bad !
The guy ’s already 70 and he ’s so energetic ! ’ "
( Shenderovich is 51 , but much of the Russian blogosphere was similarly congratulatory . )
Echoing pretty much everyone else I spoke to , Yashin added that Shenderovich may be a public figure , but his private life is inviolate .
" What does this have to do with anything ?
You can also install a camera in the bathroom and catch him pooping , if you want !
The only people who can ask him about this are his wife and his daughter .
Everyone else — it ’s not your fucking business , okay ? "
( Yashin also noted that getting caught with Moomoo was n’t as bad as the alternative .
" What would be political murder is if they published someone with boys , " he said .
" And they did n’t find any gays among the opposition in two years [ of trolling for dirt ] . " )
When I asked Shenderovich if , as a prominent critic of the government , he should be held to a rigorous standard of behavior , his response echoed Yashin’s .
" I do behave myself , " Shenderovich told me .
" I behave myself in the sense that I pay for myself in any group , with any millionaires and billionaires .
I try to at least cover my half .
I never take money for my publications , except for honorariums .
I am completely transparent in my taxes .
And I behave myself .
In everything that allows me to walk down the street and look my fellow citizens in the eye .
Because I really am a public figure . "
As for the rest ?
Irrelevant and forgivable — even by his wife , at least according to Shenderovich .
" My wife reacted completely wonderfully , " he said .
" I have this habit when traveling of taking the shampoo from the hotel as a memento of the trip .
It always really irritated my wife .
Yesterday , she said , ‘ See , I told you :
You should never take free shampoo . ’ "
Not only did she forgive him , she calmed down Shenderovich ’s 80 - year - old mother .
His daughter laughed it off and went on with her wedding planning .
Fishman ’s wife got a T - shirt saying , " Smile !
You ’re on camera ! "
Tracing the goopy trail of the honey trap , the victims and their sympathizers saw all the overeager , sycophantic clumsiness of the Kremlin youth group , Nashi .
On Monday , Yashin filed a complaint with the State Prosecutor ’s office for invasion of privacy and distribution of pornography , citing Vladislav Surkov , the Kremlin ’s Karl Rove , and Vasily Yakimenko , a federal official who curates all things youth - related and who was once in charge of Nashi .
Oreshkin , who was also targeted by Katya but managed to decline her invitation to see her new apartment , wrote that his sources inside the government said Yakimenko was behind the campaign , with the Kremlin ’s approval and financing .
It ’s not a far - fetched conclusion , given that real police cars were used in the traffic cop-bribing video .
The Interior Ministry denies it was their policemen or their car ; but , as Shenderovich quipped , " What service can rent a police car , stuff it with electronics and surveillance equipment ?
Who can do this ?
I do n’t think these are students of the Conservatory . "
Robert Schlegel , a 25 year - old Duma deputy and federal commissar of the Nashi movement , maintained to me that his organization was not involved , although he seemed to know a disconcerting amount of detail about the smear campaign and had extremely well - thought - out opinions on the matter .
" It ’s because this group of journalists has turned into a gang that does n’t betray its own , " he said , his voice rising angrily .
" They really have a strong sense of complete righteousness , that ’s one .
Two , they are not ready to live according to the law — that is 100 percent true .
That the law is n’t written for them .
They see themselves as a separate political force .
That ’s crazy . "
And he , too , explained why Russians did n’t find anything shocking in the tapes .
" Russia has a significantly freer culture , " he claimed .
" For us , cheating on your wife , for the majority , is not something unusual .
Moreover , for us , snorting cocaine — what ’s unusual about that ?
Everyone snorts it . "
Especially , he said , " all journalists .
And if they do n’t snort , they drink .
Or huff . "
Schlegel could not reconcile to me the apparent pointlessness of smearing someone with a charge that in Russia , usually works to build your reputation — nor explain the use of smearing the feeble Russian opposition in the first place .
The week since Shenderovich was awakened by the call has brought some clarity , however .
For the most part , not much has changed .
Shenderovich ’s daughter got married .
His mother has calmed down .
As expected , the authorities have yet to launch a real investigation , although the tenacious Yashin has gone on the offensive :
With the help of some local journalists , he discovered Katya ’s now empty apartment ( you can rent it for $ 1,200 a month ) and her ex-boyfriend .
But then , on Tuesday , Nashi filed a court complaint against Yashin .
It claimed " insult " and " false accusations , " but also called for legal consequences for the crime caught on tape : bribing police officers .
The tactic is a strange double - feint : Nashi is insisting it had nothing to do with the videos , while also drawing more attention to them and carrying out what now appears to have been the video ’s grand purpose all along , proving that opposition members are just common , petty criminals .
Shenderovich , meanwhile , is taking the apparent Kremlin attention as a " badge of honor . "
In the best traditions of Russian martyrdom he recounted to me all the ways he ’s needled the government over the years and the ways he ’d been singled out before : break - ins , round - the - clock surveillance , blackmail .
Last week , he said , they torched the St. Petersburg apartment of the man who organized his latest play .
" I deserve a lot from them , " he told me .
" And I understand that I ’m alive only because I am fairly famous and they understand that will be too costly for them , PR - wise . "
When we had wrapped up our interview , a man came up to Shenderovich and fervently shook both his hands .
He thanked him again and again for his work , and Shenderovich began to beam from behind his beard .
" It ’s impossible to live in this country , " the man said .
Then he leaned in and whispered something :
He worked for the state prosecutor .

Trees once covered almost the entire eastern seaboard of the U.S.
Vast forests supported a rich ecosystem , including flocks of the extinct passenger pigeon big enough to blot out the sun .
But by the 1920s at least half of this forest was gone — a victim of tree - clearing for farming , forestry or fossil - fuel extraction .
Then , the forest rebounded for several decades as once - farmed fields were left fallow .
But a new study reveals that since the 1970s eastern forests have begun to diminish again ; roughly 3.7 million hectares of forested land — an area larger than the state of Maryland — have been transformed into subdivisions , tree plantations and lunar - esque landscapes resulting from mountaintop removal mining .
In fact , the latter activity alone eliminated 420,000 hectares of woodlands in the past two decades .
" Human land use is a primary driver of environmental change , " says geographer Mark Drummond of the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) , who collaborated on the study in the April issue of BioScience with USGS Earth observation scientist Thomas Loveland .
" The cumulative footprint of human activities on the land surface is causing a significant net decline in forest cover . "
Suburban sprawl was the leading cause of the forest 's recent retreat in much of the east .
The megalopolis that stretches from Boston to Washington , D.C. , has grown in extent by 90 percent since 1970 , resulting in the cutting of 1.9 million hectares of trees .
The southern coastal plain , northeastern highland and the Piedmont — the hilly region between the coastal plains and the Appalachian Mountains stretching from New Jersey into Georgia and Alabama — lost the most forest cover .
That 's bad news for the wildlife that had rebounded along with the woods .
It also means that the newly lost trees are not incorporating more carbon dioxide — the most common greenhouse gas changing the climate .
Since the early 20th century U.S. forests had been soaking up extra CO2 , and this timberland was expected to play a role as an " offset " for greenhouse gas emissions from other sources ( like the coal - fired power plants burning through the products of mountaintop removal mining ) in any legislation to combat climate change , such as the bill currently being written in the U.S. Senate .
" Over the past 30 years , the strength of the carbon sink may have decreased by as much as two thirds in some eco-regions of the east , " the USGS researchers wrote .
" We need to improve our understanding of how the U.S. landscape is changing as a result of human activities , " Drummond says .
" The amount of decline in carbon sequestration is still being examined . "
The USGS scientists used Landsat satellite data since 1972 , combined with field visits , to more precisely estimate forest cover in the 162 million hectares of the eastern U.S. Previous efforts from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and U.S. Department of Agriculture had found that forested areas in the eastern U.S. were still expanding overall , if only marginally , based on estimates .
Nor is this trend confined to the eastern U.S. Whereas FAO figures note that deforestation may be slowing globally — from 16 million hectares a year in the 1990s to 13 million hectares per year in the 2000s — that trend may have stopped or reversed in the developed world .
" The recent declines in eastern forest cover that we are seeing may herald similar trends elsewhere , in other regions or nations , " Drummond says .
" We see net forest declines in the west and areas of the south - central U.S. caused by land - use change . "
From Conservapedia
The Treaty of Tripoli was a peace agreement made between the United States and Tripoli .
It was drafted and signed by the Bey in Algiers in 1796 , the ratified by Congress and signed by President John Adams in 1797 .
The treaty has been lauded by atheists in modern times because of Article 11 , which states , in part , that " the Government of the United States of America is not , in any sense , founded on the Christian religion . "
Authored by American diplomat Joel Barlow in 1796 , the following treaty was sent to the floor of the Senate , June 7 , 1797 , where it was read aloud in its entirety and unanimously approved .
John Adams , having seen the treaty , signed it and proudly proclaimed it to the Nation .

Annals of Congress , 5th Congress

And by the agent Plenipotentiary of the United States of America ,
JOEL BARLOW .
SACRAMENTO , CA — Claiming that it is " something every man deserves to do once , " local resident Carl Hilland , 32 , told reporters Monday that , before he dies , he would like to throw a good , clean punch to somebody 's face .
Hilland stands on a street that would be a perfect location for such a punch .
Advertisement
" I want to make a guy 's head snap back like in the movies , " Hilland said .
" All I want is the satisfaction of knowing that at one point in my life , I threw a straight right hand with complete balance and did n't look foolish doing it , and in a situation where my actions were completely justified . "
" Pow , " he added , punching the air .
" I honestly do n't think that 's too much to ask . "
Advertisement
Hilland , who is right - handed , characterized the ideal punch as " quick and clean , " adding that he has no interest in throwing a " crazy " punch , such as an uppercut or a left hook .
The husband and father of three also insisted that he is realistic in his expectations for the punch , and does not want to cause permanent damage or knock the victim out immediately .
All he wants , Hillard said , is to throw the punch at an age when he will at least be able to " stun the guy a little . "
" This is n't about cowardice , hysteria , or blind rage , " Hilland said .
" It 's about me , as a man , getting the chance to act like a man for once in my life . "

Hilland , who works as a group benefits consultant and characterizes himself as " pretty reserved , " said that the approximately five punches he has thrown through the years do n't count because of their nonviolent nature and social context .
In each case , he was either hitting a friend in response to seeing a car with a burnt - out headlight or testing how much force he could generate with only a two - inch windup .
" I did punch a wall once , " said Hilland , who admitted that he took little satisfaction in it .
" First off , I was just trying to make a scene , and everyone knew it .
And secondly , a little scuff mark is n't the same as seeing blood stream out of a guy 's nose , which is what I think will happen if I really get all my weight behind it . "
Advertisement
Added Hilland , attempting another air swing : " Boom . "
Hilland said the primary obstacle he faces is that he is seldom , if ever , in a position to punch anyone .
He has not been in an angry physical altercation since the fourth grade , and even during those years was impeded by an unspoken " no - face " rule during fights .
As a result , almost all schoolyard clashes consisted of one contestant wrestling the other to the ground while administering a headlock .
Advertisement
" There was some whaling on people 's backs , but it was all pretty sloppy , " he said .
" And besides , a punch is n't really a punch unless you hit a person , then immediately shake your hand because the impact was surprisingly painful .
Right ? "
The best - case scenario , which Hilland outlined at length , would include throwing the defining blow while defending his wife when " lots of people are watching . "
However , in order to carry the necessary psychological weight , the situation " has to happen organically , " Hilland said .
Advertisement
" I 'm just going to go on with my day - to - day routine and be patient , " Hilland added , though sources at his workplace noted that lately he seems to be escalating verbal disputes rather than defusing them .
" I would even settle for hitting someone in the stomach , but it would have to be one of those body shots where they fall to the ground after gasping for air for a few seconds . "
" No , forget that , " he continued .
" It has to be to the face . "

Washington ( CNN ) --
A majority of Americans think the federal government poses a threat to the rights of Americans , according to a new national poll .
Fifty - six percent of people questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey released Friday say they think the federal government has become so large and powerful that it poses an immediate threat to the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens .
Forty - four percent of those polled disagree .
The survey indicates a partisan divide on the question : Only 37 percent of Democrats , 63 percent of independents and nearly seven in 10 Republicans say the federal government poses a threat to the rights of Americans .
According to CNN poll numbers released Sunday , Americans overwhelmingly think that the U.S. government is broken , though the public overwhelmingly holds out hope that what 's broken can be fixed .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted February 12 - 15 , with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey .

Every one of us living in these bustling metropolises has always dreamt of a city devoid of traffic snarls , incessant honking and pollution .
FreMo , India ’s first bicycle sharing programme is a step in that direction .
FreMo derived from ‘ Freedom To Move ’ gives the commuter freedom to move from one place to another , without depending on the public transport or using their own car / bike .
Various FreMo depots have been established in Thane .
All one has to do is register with them , take a cycle from one of these depots and deposit it in the depot nearest to his / her destination .
They have various membership plans , depending on the usage .
Every FreMo member is entitled to a personal accident assurance of Rs. 5 lakh .
Here ’s an interview with V. Ramesh , Founder CEO & Director of FreMo .
Q : What triggered you to start Freedom to Move ?
After visiting Barcelona in early 2008 , when I came to India , there was a huge petrol price hike .
And I saw many people trying to cut down their expenditure on petrol as much as possible .
This prompted me to think that making the use of bicycles convenient would make people accept the idea of cycling for daily activities .
Once a person signs up with us , he need not depend on autos or buses and has the freedom to move .
Thus , FreMo ( short form for Freedom to Move ) was born .
Q : Tell us about the hurdles you came across while setting up the venture ?
The hurdles started with people being surprised that I am moving out of a comfortable job as a CEO in a NBFC ( Non- banking finance company ) to become a “ cyclewalla ” and telling me not to do it .
Then came the struggle to get people to accept this as a workable idea .
Getting funds was the worst experience of my life .
All so called ‘ venture ’ capitalists never wanted to venture in to this social concept .
They were only interested in two things ( a ) How much will I make out of this investment ( b ) what is the exit route for me .
This gave me a confirmation that all those guys are only “ investors ” and not ‘ venture capitalists ’ .
Even the requirement of a small amount of Rs. 2 crores did not find donors .
Then I started looking to banks to support this project .
All of them , except one were unresponsive .
Finally , Bank of Baroda supported this project .
Then there was a struggle to try and meet up with the government authorities like TMC whose support is vital for the success of this programme .
I drew a blank in their response .
Finally , the struggle was to get staff .
Many of them did not feel that this was a business they wanted to be associated with .
Most of them wanted to work in a call centre or IT or other such businesses which are well known .
Promotion
FreMo has been designed to work in conjunction with other modes of transport , to get around the problem of transporting bikes on buses and autos etc .
Various depots are established at strategic locations across the city .
Register yourself with FreMo and take a membership .
With your membership card just pick up a cycle from any depot convenient to you .
Just cycle to your station / bus stop / shopping / or any short trip .
Return the cycle to any depot of your choice ; the one you hired from or at a depot close to your destination .
Q : What is the general feedback of the customers ?
Both customers and potential customers have excellent words to say about this project .
All of them feel that we need this project in the current context since the environmental situation is getting from bad to worse .
Besides , the traffic issues are so many that people traveling short distances are fed up with them .
They are also victims of high unpredictability on their travel time .
If one day they get an auto or a bus in 5 minutes , the next day they may end up waiting for 25 minutes .
Their plans often go awry .
The best aspect of this service is the predictability for a person to reach a station .
Every day , one reaches the station in 15 minutes .
Besides saving time and money .
Q : What is the kind of social impact your organization has succeeded in bringing about ?
Social impact from this project is multi-pronged .
We will reduce the traffic congestion when more and more people start taking the bicycle route to travel .
Reduction in traffic means immediate reduction in pollution , both air and noise .
Health of the people will improve as they will be exercising daily as a part of their travel and also they will start breathing cleaner air .
Besides , since the unpredictability is removed , the stress level of people also reduces .
Due to reduction in travel expenses ( which is at least 30 - 40 rupees daily , i.e. about 1000 rupees every month ) , the purchasing power of the people will increase , thereby improving their living standard .
It will release some parking space in the city because , there will be less and less people using cars for the local 3 - 4 kms travel .
People will save time ( perhaps at least one hour daily ) and be able to do more things .
Finally it will also change the way we live .
Q : What are the future plans for FreMo ?
Are you thinking of expanding to other states ?
Yes .
Fremo intends to move to all other cities and make this a phenomenon across various cities .
Next we would look at launching it in Pune , Bangalore , Chennai and New Delhi .
*****
We hope the idea is a runaway success and we all get to reap its immense benefits at the earliest .

“ Why , they must spit two or three gallons a day !
They ai n’t died fast enough , these old men ! ” — Mrs. T.E. Bagley , Whitney , Texas , 1949
This is a great small America story about sitting .
Or old men sitting , and spitting .
Sitting and spitting on a long piece of thick timber outside a drug store , bricks and advertisements as back support , in Whitney , Texas ( population ca. 1,500 ) , in 1949 .
I can just about hear them on a hot summer evening , right now , only probably I could n’t — they ’d probably ’ve shut up until the stranger walked by , giving me their silence and keeping their confidences .
Or not .
Maybe I would ’ve been invisible , and the whittled bits would 've fallen to the street along with the tobacco juice , cusses and gossip , unabated .
Maybe they surrounded themselves with a stained - moat of spittin ’s across or close to which no one would stray .
It is n’t , I guess , so much a story about their sitting as it is a story about their not sitting , about how it came to be that their lumber was removed and the men forced to find another place to take in the sights and construct their great edifices of commentary and asides .
The story appears in LIFE Magazine of 15 August 1949 , and lays the whole drama out in two splash pages , with bare editorializing and some great photos .
The story goes like this : “ In 1922 D. ( Doctor Dee ) Scarborough , the druggist in Whitney , Texas , put up a bench outside his store , and immediately it became a loafing headquarters for the gaffers of . the Brazos River Valley .
' Year after year they sat there looking like a jury of irritable terrapins , whittling , spitting and passing judgment on everything that passed .
But finally reform caught up with them . ”
It caught up to them , even if everyone was wearing a collared shirt .
It came to the mayor of Whitney , Frank Basham , to appease “ a delegation of local housewives ” who were fed up with the old men , and wanted the “ unsightly bench ” gone .
It was probably a lot more than the bench , as the quote above by Mrs. T.E. Bagley contends : “ Why , they must spit two or three gallons a day !
They ai n’t died fast enough , these old men ! ” .
Perhaps a dozen old farmers / ranchers / cowboys sitting on a bench all day long spitting and watching the world go by was n’t the most attractive thing for downtown Whitney .
And so it came to pass that the lumber was removed , but not the men — they returned with nail barrels and took up residence , unabated , “ sitting wrathfully ” on the kegs .
The police then threatened to confiscate the kegs , and then the men : tensions flared , and a special election was held , a referendum on whether or not to restore the bench .
“ I ’ve never heard of such foolishness ” , ‘ cried 97 - year - old Tom Rose , dean of the bench sitters ’ .
“ Come here in ’ 77 from Tennessee .
Been married 76 years , and my wife ai n’t whipped me yet . ”
The vote was held and the forces of bench - removal - evil were “ horribly ” beaten , the vote for favoring restoration coming in at a convincing 124 to 67 .
The picture below shows the men “ triumphantly ” hauling the bench back into position , sitting back down once more , “ loafing , whittling , spitting and passing judgment on everything that passed ” .
As I said , this is a beautiful drama of high emotion , way - of - life small consequence played big , a heaping slice of American life witnessed in a small East Texas town just after World War II .
I would love to hear the voice of Mrs. Lizzy Smith ( pictured here ) as she was thinking - out - loud , casting her vote in this debate with a pencil no longer than a finger joint .
( Where did that hat / shawl come from ?
Is it her mother 's ?
Mrs. Stewart 's mother would 've been born around 1840 , which means that the sensibility for that head cover was at the very least of pioneer vintage , and possibly older .
It looks like living history to me , a snapshot into something from the deep past , right there in the present .
This does n't happen very often ; but when it does , it is a celebration . )
" We 're all living on borrowed time " she is quoted as saying , and I imagine that she voted for the men to be able to return to their bench to use what time they had left to holding up the walls of that pharmacy .
[ I made a call to Whitney , this morning , and spoke with a gentleman about the Battle of the Bench .
He eloquently relayed the story , and the place that it holds in the town 's history , its small action carried into the future as a very large sensibility -- I 'm thankful for his insight .
I could n't resist asking what it was that was directly opposite the bench ; what were these men looking at when they were n't looking down .
" Not very much " he said .
But the story is n't in the looking , its in the talking ; and as my wife Patti Digh finely points out , stories seem to be best told side - by - side .
And in here is a great little play .
Maybe not so little .

Iridium puts out bulletin seeking hosted payloads
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : March 27 , 2010
The U.S. Air Force is answering a call from Iridium to put payloads , experiments and sensors on the company 's next - generation satellites , a top military official said this week .

" We 've looked at a couple of different potential applications of secondary hosted payloads on Iridium , " said Gary Payton , undersecretary of the Air Force for space programs .
Iridium is in talks with government and international agencies for hosted payloads that would use extra room , power and communications capacity on the company 's NEXT constellation , which is scheduled to begin launching in 2014 .
" We think this is a great opportunity that 's only going to come around once in a decade , or even longer , " said John Campbell , Iridium 's executive vice president for government programs .
" We 're anxious to find the right payload out of the many that we 've looked at . "
Campbell , also a retired Air Force general , is leading Iridium 's negotiations with U.S. government agencies interested in utilizing the extra satellite space .
Payton said the Air Force 's best match with Iridium involves experiments from the Space Test Program , the military 's acquisition service for innovative technology demonstrations in orbit .
" We 've got a list of around 40 to 60 STP space experiments , and many of them are finished and just sitting in clean rooms waiting for a ride , " Payton said in an interview Thursday .
" The Iridium idea might be a good way to work off a lot of those secondary experiments from the Space Test Program . "
Space Test Program experiments have previously flown on dedicated small satellites as secondary payloads on military launches .
" A lot of these experiments really do n't care what orbit they 're in , " Payton said .
" They just want to get into space and see if their technology can or cannot work in space .
The Iridium NEXT constellation will include 66 satellites flying 485 miles above Earth in near - polar orbits .
They craft will be spread apart to provide global mobile voice and data communications continuity as the company 's current fleet of satellites is retired .
Iridium is in final negotiations with Lockheed Martin and Thales Alenia Space for the prime contract to build the fleet .
But Iridium will first have to acquire financing for the project .
" We are now actively engaged in securing funding for NEXT with two export credit agences .
Clearly , an important component of vendor selection will be the level of ECA support , and Lockheed and Thales are fully engaged in this process , " Matthew Desch , Iridium 's CEO , told investment analysts in a March 16 conference call .
Desch said he hopes to award the development and construction contract this summer .
Iridium expects to finalize a list of suitable hosted payloads by the fall of 2011 , according to Campbell .
The Air Force funded an Iridium study last year analyzing how the NEXT constellation could accommodate space situational awareness sensors capable of tracking other objects in orbit .
Space is rapidly becoming more bottlenecked with dead satellites , disposed rocket parts and loose debris from intentional and accidental orbital collisions .
Air Force officials say it is critical to know where these objects are and what they are doing .
" While there 's a great volume of space there in which they can move , they 're all traveling at a very high rate of speed .
As space becomes more congested , it 's even more important that we understand where these objects are and what they 're doing , " Air Force Gen .
Robert Kehler told a Senate strategic forces subcommittee earlier this month .
Kehler is the commander of Air Force Space Command , the organization responsible for air traffic control in space .
Payton said the best solution for the space situational awareness mission is the continued development of a potential fleet of Space Based Space Surveillance , or SBSS , satellites .
The first SBSS demo mission is scheduled to launch this summer .
" From what I 've seen of the space situational awareness applications on Iridium , I do n't think we honestly gain that much , assuming we get SBSS on - orbit successfully , " Payton said .
According to Campbell , no final decisions have been made on space situational awareness or any other payloads on Iridium NEXT .
Other applications for the military include space weather monitoring .
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , or NOAA , is also discussing placing Earth observation and science instruments on Iridium NEXT satellites .
Researchers could also use GPS radio signals between Iridium and navigation satellites in higher orbits to measure atmospheric profile data on humidity and temperatures .
" Many of those sensors would n't take up the whole payload size , weight and power allocation .
Some of them were actually very nice fits to fly multiple missions , " Campbell said .
" I think most likely what we 'll find is we 'll fly a mix of payloads , or potentially even multiple payloads on one satellite . "
Campbell said each satellite has about 110 pounds of mass reserved for hosted payloads .
Secondary instruments would also receive about 50 watts of continuous power and a communications rate of about 1 megabyte per second .
" We really have done quite a bit with the government over the last couple of years to find the right mission for NEXT , " Campbell said Friday .

The Happy Little Tetrad
Once upon a time , just off the coast of New Zealand , there lived a happy tetrad of Deinococcus radiodurans bacteria .
As our tetrad of bacteria exited their sewer pipe , they marveled at the beauty of the ocean .
This specific tetrad happened to be very proud of itself , and rightly so .
A nearby diatom happened to overhear the tetrad , and disagreed loudly .
A small isopod , overhearing the diatom , also stepped in .
The isopod boasted so loudly , that a nearby bony fish could not help but reply .
A tuatara , unimpressed by the fish 's logic , scoffed from a nearby rock .
The tuatara was overheard by a nearby rook , who crowed loudly .
Steve , who had been listening to the entire argument thus far , was ready to set all the others straight .
Verizon CEO
Ivan Seidenberg sat down last week for a talk at the Council for Foreign Relations and talked about how mind - bendingly awesome the US broadband market is .
Seidenberg all but put on a foam finger and started chanting , " We 're number one !
We 're number one ! "
All those studies you 've read that suggest otherwise ?
The fact that Hong Kong residents can now get 1 G bps symmetric fiber for US $ 26 , while New York City residents top out at 100 Mbps and cost $ 100 ?
Capping 3 M bps DSL at 5GB / month ?
All meaningless .
Apparently , we 've been focusing on ridiculous measures like speed and features , when what we should really focus on is broadband penetration .
And , according to Seidenberg , the US is beating the pants off everyone else when it comes to getting broadband into people 's homes .
We decided to fact - check this claim .
As a reminder , here are Seidenberg 's words from the interview :
Seidenberg : Anytime government — whether it's the FCC or any agency — decides it knows what the market wants and makes that a static requirement , you always lose .
So this FCC decided that speed of the network was the most important issue .
So that 's all they measured .
So they will say , if you go to Korea or you go to France , you can get a faster Internet connection .
Okay ?
That could be true in some companies — in some countries .
The facts are that , in the US , there is greater household penetration of access to the Internet than any country in Europe .
In Japan , where everybody looks at Japan as being so far ahead , they may have faster speeds , but we have higher utilization of people using the Internet .
So our view is , whenever you look at these issues , you have to be very careful to look at what the market wants , not what government says is the most important issue .
Let 's take wireless , for example .
Everybody says the European system was kind of better .
Well , that 's very interesting .
If you look at minutes of use , the average American uses their cell phone four times as much — four times as much — as the average European .
If you look at Europe , they publish penetration rates of 150 ( percent ) , 160 ( percent ) , 170 percent meaning that people have more than one phone , two phones , three phones .
You know why ?
Roaming rates are so high .
My guess is you probably have two or three different phones to carry to — to use in different countries because your roaming rates are so high .
And you say , yes .
So my point is it 's a fallacy to allow a regulatory authority to sit there and decide what 's right for the marketplace when it 's not even close .
[ WSJ executive editor Alan ]
Murray :
So on the measures that matter most to you , where does the United States rank in terms of — Seidenberg : One .
Not even close .
Murray : Number one ?
Seidenberg : Yes .
Verizon has put more fiber in from Boston to Washington than all the Western European countries combined .
All .
We have — if you look at smart phones — not us , Apple , Google — they have exploded this market in the US .
Ask any European if they 're not somewhat envious of the advancements of smartphone technology in the US .
So it just seems to me this is just not even close .
Those pesky facts
Does the US has greater household Internet penetration than " any country in Europe " ?
We dug through the OECD 's most recent broadband dataset , from the second quarter of 2009 , and looked at penetration rates in Europe and the US .
Here they are , in chart form :
OECD broadband penetration rankings
Not only is the US getting beaten by plenty of European countries , we 're getting whipped by almost 50 percent in places like the Netherlands , Norway , and Denmark .
We then went back and checked earlier data from the OECD , going all the way back to 2002 , and the same basic pattern held .
In terms of raw numbers , the US has the most broadband subscribers due to its size , but when it comes to penetration rate , it 's just objectively beaten by numerous European countries ( South Korea and Canada are also ahead of us ) .
We then checked data from the United Nations - backed ITU .
Its data , most recently from 2008 , shows the same story : the US broadband penetration rate is 23.46 percent , while countries like Sweden are at 41.19 percent .
But wait — only a quarter of the US population has broadband at home ?
Not quite ; the measurements we 've been citing above all describe the number of broadband subscribers divided by the population .
A moment 's thought will show that most broadband subscriptions serve multiple people in a household .
This fact could skew the data .
If the average household size in the US is higher than that in Europe , it could be that we have a lower percentage of home broadband subscriptions but a higher percentage of actual home broadband users .
So we looked into this , too .
Consulting group Gartner actually gathered this data and put out a press release about it in September 2009 .
When penetration data is sorted by the percentage of households with access , the US comes in ... 14th place , with 60 percent of households having home broadband .
South Korea topped the list at 86 percent , but right behind it were the Netherlands , Denmark , and other European countries .
Let 's complicate matters
Not to put too fine a point upon it , we 're left with the question : is Seidenberg the sort of CEO caricature we love to mock , the leader with marshmallow for brains and a mouth that spews only PR , leaving facts bleeding and bruised in its wake ?
He was certainly wrong on this particular statement , but the real story is much more complex .
Remember that this was a live interview without notes and without editing .
When Seidenberg gave prepared remarks before the interview began , he phrased things differently .
I know this goes against the conventional wisdom that America is way behind in wireless and broadband .
The truth is , that belief is more about the past than it is about the present or certainly the future .
Asia 's cell phone ecosystem developed so fast because the mobile handset — not the PC — has been their primary means for accessing the Internet .
Europe 's wireline broadband infrastructure spread quickly because of state subsidies and a compact geography , among other things .
The US market has developed differently , based on a private investment model and competition among different wired and wireless technologies .
The result is that — today — the US market stacks up very well in the global market in terms of : Choice : with the vast majority of Americans having access to two or more broadband networks ;
Utilization : with higher broadband penetration and wireless data usage than Europe as a whole ; and
Quality : with the most advanced fiber and fourth - generation wireless data networks being deployed in the world today .
Note two things : first , Seidenberg does n't make his " we 're - number - one - and - it 's - not - even - close " claim .
Instead , he offers a more nuanced analysis .
Second , when it comes to discussing penetration rates , his prepared remarks talk about Europe as a whole rather than saying the US beats " any country in Europe . "
This is more helpful , but still not clear .
Is Seidenberg saying that the US should compare itself to countries like Montenegro , Moldova , and Belarus when it comes to broadband ?
A fairer comparison would seem to be Western Europe as a whole , where the US is beaten by numerous countries — yes , even those that are less dense than we are ( including Sweden , Finland , Iceland , and Norway ) .
We checked in with two Verizon executives for clarification .
Though unwilling to speak on the record , they did provide more context for Seidenberg 's remarks .
Verizon 's view of the matter is that a proper comparison is not between the US as a whole and a state like Sweden ; it 's between the US as a whole and the European Union as a whole .
Such a metric raises its own questions .
It leaves wealthy , high - broadband countries like Norway and Switzerland out of Europe 's measurements , making the continent look worse .
It also includes countries like Slovakia and Bulgaria and Latvia and Romania — as beautiful as it is , is Slovakia really a good comparison with the US ?
All such metrics have these problems ; what you find depends in many ways upon what you measure .
Accepting Verizon 's comparison , though , Seidenberg was correct : the US as a whole has a higher penetration rate than the EU as a whole .
In fact , Verizon has compiled a handy chart to make the point .
It breaks the US down into states and compares these against EU countries .
Even the lowest US state for broadband penetration ( West Virginia ) beats countries like the Czech Republic and Slovakia and Poland .
Verizon 's preferred way of looking at the data
According to this data , the US ' average penetration rate was 50.9 percent in 2008 , while the EU rate was 35.4 percent .
Both numbers have increased significantly since then .
One could look at this data in many ways .
Why is it , for instance , that Iceland and Denmark beat out even the wealthiest , densest states in the US ?
( Remember , Iceland is less dense than the US . )
Why is penetration in Slovenia better than five US states ?
Certainly , one of the richest countries on earth could do a bit better on these metrics .
On the other hand , the US has done a solid job of getting basic broadband access to most citizens , beating out the EU in broadband uptake .
Verizon also likes to point out how much fiber it has laid relative to all of Western Europe , and it 's true — FiOS was an impressive , $ 20 billion rollout that showed future vision as opposed to fixation on short - term returns .
That 's great if you can get it — and most Americans can't .
Many New York City residents ( such as our own John Timmer ) can't , and citizens of Boston can forget about it .
And those are solidly within Verizon territory — FiOS is n't passing any more homes , and the rest of the country had better like paying for cable Internet if they want high speeds , because the phone companies have shown little interest in running the necessary fiber to the home .
In conclusion : though Seidenberg 's quoted comments in the interview were in fact incorrect , he was getting at a real point .
In doing so , he reminded us how conclusions depend on what 's being measured — Verizon 's no less than the FCC's .
* Company must wait until 10 a.m. to release most research
* “ Systematic misappropriation ” found -- judge
* Theflyonthewall.com plans to appeal ( Adds details from ruling , third paragraph )
NEW YORK , March 18 ( Reuters ) - A Manhattan federal judge on Thursday barred the financial news service Theflyonthewall.com from issuing immediate news about analyst research from several Wall Street banks , often before recommendations are shared with clients .
Ruling in favor of Bank of America Corp's BAC.N Merrill Lynch unit , Barclays Plc BARC.L and Morgan Stanley MS.N , U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said Theflyonthewall.com engaged in " systematic misappropriation , " essentially getting a " free ride " from its quick publication of upgrades and downgrades that can move stocks higher and lower .
Cote issued a permanent injunction requiring the Summit , New Jersey - based company to wait until 10 a.m. to report research from the three banks that was issued before the market opens , and at least two hours for research issued thereafter .
The bulk of research is typically issued before the open .
While the banks had sought longer delays , Cote said : “ This time frame preserves incentives for the firms to create and disseminate research reports to their investor clients , while still recognizing the inevitable , fast - moving , and widespread informal communication of recommendation on Wall Street . ”
Cote added she could not excuse Theflyonthewall.com ’s activities simply because recommendations are also reported by many rivals , or are otherwise leaked or rumored .
“ The legally salient fact ... is that Fly is exploiting its self - described ‘ hefty relationships with people in the know , ’ ” she wrote .
The judge said Theflyonthewall.com may apply in one year to lift the injunction if the banks do not take reasonable steps to halt the unauthorized distribution of research .
According to the opinion , Theflyonthewall.com said the lawsuit has forced it to ritualistically engage in “ confirming ” the substance of research with two or three sources before publishing -- still , typically , before the market opens .
The company has about 30 employees .
It charges $ 50 a month , or $ 480 annually , for its services , its website shows .
Glenn Ostrager , a lawyer representing Theflyonthewall.com , said the ruling is “ at variance with existing law . ”
He said his client will appeal to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals , and expects the financial press to “ vigorously support ” an appeal .
WIDER IMPACT ?
Like many rivals , Theflyonthewall.com typically posts headlines from research reports and press releases , and longer summaries when available .
It was not immediately clear how the 89 - page ruling might affect the ability of real - time financial news providers such as Thomson Reuters TRI .
TOTRI.N , Bloomberg LP and News Corp's NWSA .
O Dow Jones Newswires to tell clients of potentially market - moving research .
Thomson Reuters spokeswoman Erin Kurtz and Bloomberg spokeswoman Judith Czelusniak declined to comment .
A Dow Jones representative had no immediate comment .
The banks welcomed the ruling .
Merrill spokesman Bill Halldin called it a “ milestone in regaining control over the distribution of our proprietary research and preserving the value of our investment ideas for our clients . ”
Barclays spokesman Mark Lane and Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Carissa Ramirez said the ruling shows the importance of protecting intellectual property .
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK had been one of the plaintiffs when the lawsuit was filed in 2006 .
Barclays took its place when it bought much of that bank 's operations .
The judge noted that Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have already taken steps to limit or delay the media ’s ability to obtain analyst research .
Other banks have acted similarly .
EXCLUSIVITY MATTERS
In her opinion , Cote said the value of analyst research derives not just from its quality , but also from its “ exclusivity and timeliness . ”
She said Theflyonthewall.com “ free - rides ” on banks ’ research efforts because it make no effort to produce the recommendations or contribute to the underlying analyses .
The judge also said such “ illegal conduct ” cannot be excused because rivals might also engage in unlawful behavior .
“ While it may be true that Fly is a news aggregator and is in direct competition with other financial news aggregators , both large and small , each of these news aggregators is in direct competition with the firms when they report the firms ’ recommendations in a timely and systematic manner such that the firms are deprived of the opportunity to communicate them first - hand to their clients , ” she wrote .
While noting the 2003 global research analyst settlement , the availability of discount electronic trading platforms , and the financial crisis might have hurt the banks , resulting in reduced staff , Cote said “ these other events aside , the misappropriation of their recommendations by Fly and others has also had a profound effect on their business model . ”
She also advanced a public policy argument for her ruling .
“ A balance must be struck between establishing rewards to stimulate socially useful efforts on the one hand , and permitting maximum access to the fruits of those efforts to facilitate still further innovation and progress , ” she wrote .

An empirical test of ideas proposed by Martin Heidegger shows the great German philosopher to be correct : Everyday tools really do become part of ourselves .
The findings come from a deceptively simple study of people using a computer mouse rigged to malfunction .
The resulting disruption in attention was n't superficial .
It seemingly extended to the very roots of cognition .
" The person and the various parts of their brain and the mouse and the monitor are so tightly intertwined that they 're just one thing , " said Anthony Chemero , a cognitive scientist at Franklin & Marshall College .
" The tool is n't separate from you .
It 's part of you . "
Chemero's experiment , published March 9 in Public Library of Science , was designed to test one of Heidegger 's fundamental concepts : that people do n't notice familiar , functional tools , but instead " see through " them to a task at hand , for precisely the same reasons that one does n't think of one 's fingers while tying shoelaces .
The tools are us .
This idea , called " ready - to - hand , " has influenced artificial intelligence and cognitive science research , but without being directly tested .
In the new study , Chemero and graduate students Dobromir Dotov and Lin Nie tracked the hand movements of people using a mouse to guide a cursor during a series of motor tests .
Part way through the tests , the cursor lagged behind the mouse .
After a few seconds , it worked again .
When Chemero 's team analyzed how people moved the mouse , they found profound differences between patterns produced during mouse function and malfunction .
When the mouse worked , hand motions followed a mathematical form known as " one over frequency , " or pink noise .
It 's a pattern that pops up repeatedly in the natural world , from universal electromagnetic wave fluctuations to tidal flows to DNA sequences .
Scientists do n't fully understand pink noise , but there 's evidence that our cognitive processes are naturally attuned to it .
But when the researchers ' mouse malfunctioned , the pink noise vanished .
Computer malfunction made test subjects aware of it — what Heidegger called " unreadiness - at - hand " — and the computer was no longer part of their cognition .
Only when the mouse started working again did cognition return to normal .
( One assumes , though the researchers did n't test the proposition , that cognition would also have returned to normal had test subjects stood up and stopped using the computer . )
The results demonstrate how people fuse with their tools , said Chemero .
" The thing that does the thinking is bigger than your biological body , " he said .
" You 're so tightly coupled to the tools you use that they 're literally part of you as a thinking , behaving thing . "
Asked whether computer malfunction — say , the iPhone 's notorious keyboard lag — could thusly be viewed as a discontinuity in our selves , Chemero said , " Yes , that 's exactly what it is . "

Hi , this is Nancy Atkinson from Universe Today .
Right now I ’m at Kennedy Space Center , and I ’ve had the opportunity to see a couple of launches and cover other events that normally , I ’d be back home watching on NASA TV .
Since NASA TV is part of my daily diet of space media , I was very interested to see the newsroom , step in the auditorium where all the press conferences are held , and also talk with some of the people who work at NASA TV at Kennedy Space Center , or KSC TV as they call it , to find out about the work that they do , and also what it ’s like to provide some of the most unique and exciting coverage anywhere on — and off — the planet .
I chatted with producers , directors , technicians and other people who work behind the scenes , plus I also had the good fortune to talk with one of the voices of NASA TV , George Diller .
Here are some of our conversations .
Listen to the audio of this podcast at this link .
Allie Lee , Producer .
Nancy : I ’m now here with Allie Lee and you are a producer for NASA TV ?
Allie : I am , for Kennedy Space Center Television .
Nancy :
What are some of the things you get to do .
Or have to do ?
Allie : I ’m in charge or preparing the launch countdown show prior to launch and all the press conferences and media briefings that we do leading up to launch .
But the most exciting thing that I get to do is work with the launch commentator , which a lot of times is George Diller , and work with him about what elements we ’re going to put in the show , what things do we need to show on NASA TV , and I get to sit in the control room with all the fabulous employees that we have and watch the astronauts and the space shuttle get ready to launch .
Nancy :
How long have you been here ?
Allie : I ’ve been here five years .
Nancy :
Any memorable moments or times , or launches that you have been a part of ?
Allie : I think the last launch was pretty special ( STS - 130 ) .
It happens to be the first one I got to do by myself as a producer .
It was a fun launch , a beautiful launch in the evening .
It was just wonderful to see the astronauts come out and get loaded up into the shuttle and wait for it and hear that countdown .
I would also say that another memorable flight would be STS - 114 , the return to flight .
That was my first launch being here , and I happened to be pregnant with my little boy , so that was a nice launch .
Nancy :
What are some of the challenges ?
Do you have to worry about timing and how you get everybody in and all the shots you want ?
Allie :
You do .
There is a lot of tricks with it .
As the producer you have to work very closely with the director who works closely with the field cameramen and the camera operators .
You have to follow the astronauts schedule very closely and make sure that when a special milestone happens that the NASA TV commentator knows that it is happening , and that the director and the photographers all have that shot up on the TV so that everyone can see it and the commentator can talk about it .
You also have to be listening to the nets , to the loops and you get to listen all the people in the firing room discussing the launch .
You have to listen for weather problems , weather issues .
You have to listen for things that are going well , things that are not going well so that you can advise the NASA TV commentator so that he or she is preparing so they can give notice to the public , should they need to .
So those are the things that are the challenges .
Working as a producer at Kennedy Space Center is a unique job , in that it is the only job like it in the world .
So it is really special to me .
It ’s special to the whole team , but it is great to be part of this team .
Nancy :
So , as you see the shuttle program coming to the end , does it …
Allie :
It ’s really sad .
It ’s really sad because we enjoy it so much and it is so beautiful .
It ’s going to be sad to see it go .
I get to produce rocket launches , too , and those are wonderful .
I ’m excited that I get to be the producer for the last shuttle , I can tell you that .
Nancy :
Thank you very much !
Dimitri Gerondidakis , Director .
Nancy : And now I ’m with Dimitri Gerondidakis .
And you are one of the directors for NASA TV ?
Dimitri : Yes .
Nancy : Can you me about a typical day for you , or the kinds of things you get to do ?
Dimitri : Well , are you talking launch day ?
Nancy : Launch day , that would be good !
Dimitri : OK , because every other day I ’m just one of the troops and go out and get video and stills of different processing .
But on launch day I ’m lucky enough to get to direct the NASA TV launch coverage .
Directing a shuttle launch is a lot different than directing news or sports or anything like that because with the shuttle launch there are actually required shots at certain times , for the paperwork for the engineers .
There is a lot of timing out – at this time we need to show the engine and show the sparklers lighting the main engines .
We need to stay with that shot until , what they call the mach diamonds form , coming out of the engines .
It ’s not the most creative TV directing in the world , but it is no doubt exciting .
The adrenaline really starts pumping .
Nancy :
So , you ’re not only getting shots not only for us watching NASA TV , but for the engineers as well ?
Dimitri : Right .
I believe what I learned is that we were a news feed , so there are no dissolves ; its straight cuts and stuff like that .
And during the polls , we want to show the launch director polling his team .
Whenever there are astronauts and we can see them , it is a required shot , like ingressing .
If you watch the coverage you ’ll notice that once we see astronauts we do n’t get off of astronauts until they are no longer visible , like when they pull those cameras out of the crew cabin .
There ’s room for some creativity , do n’t get me wrong .
I mostly rely on the awesome cameramen we have here that sometimes get to show their “ artsy ” side .
They do a great job of it .
Praise goes to them really .
I just pick the shots I like !
Nancy :
Well , I think it is always interesting to watch the launches for the variety of things you do get to see .
You get to see behind the scenes – the astronauts going into the vehicle .
That ’s very interesting .
Dimitri :
Oh yeah , that ’s always a fun part of the show .
There ’s the part when we go into the Operations and Checkout building and we see them all suiting up and they are waving and this and that .
And it ’s anxious wait for us because we are waiting for them to pop out into that hallway .
So while you ’re trying to put on a decently entertaining good show / news feed , whatever you want to call it , you have your one eye on that hallway camera , because as soon as they come out …
Nancy :
It ’s one thing you do n’t want to miss !
Dimitri :
It ’s an exciting part of the show .
If the show were condensed down to 10 minutes you would probably start from there , the astronauts getting on , and coming out of the 9 minute hold .
Nancy : Right .
For landing , is it kind of a waiting game like it is for the rest of us , you just have to wait and see when it is going to happen ?
Dimitri :
And there ’s a little competition between the guys out there on the cameras who can see it first and get the shot .
It ’s funny , because typically they land from the north to the south , unless winds are … this is my opinion , I ’m not sure if this is fact or not , but it seems to be the majority of the landings here .
Well , we ’re all rooting for a south to north because we have a camera on the VAB roof and you ’ll see when it lands from south to north , we pullout with this big , beautiful shot with Titusville in the background , you got the rivers , the lagoons , and here ’s the shuttle dropping in like a brick , almost .
It just makes for a really cool shot .
So there ’s some friendly competition out there .
Nancy :
So , coming up we have a night landing .
I ’m assuming that makes it a little bit harder ?
Dimitri : Yeah , we do n’t have our long range tracker , we have an infrared tracker which picks up a little heat signature .
The first thing you see on the screen is this little white dot , and you ’re going , is that it ?
Is that it ?
And finally it will start to take the shape of the shuttle and they ’ll start tracking it and its pretty much infrared , which is not the prettiest picture in the world .
Until I get that pilot ’s point of view feed , and I ’m not sure when I get it or why when I get it but you can see their point of view and the runway and the lights and then it becomes a little prettier , no doubt .
Then it gets into the Xenon lights and it gets like daytime .
Nancy : Yeah , I bet !
Any memorable moment that you ’ve had in your time here ?
How long have you been with NASA ?
Dimitri : I originally worked at NASA Headquarters and directed some shows there .
I and a producer , my friend Tony , followed Sean O’Keefe around to different centers and did his NASA Update show .
Came down here , I think it was five years ago .
They were looking for someone to direct , and I asked the wife is she wanted to move to Florida and the kids loved it and so we did .
So the most memorable would have to be return to flight .
The place was buzzing ; it was my first .
I kind of got thrown to the fire .
I asked the bosses , can I watch someone else direct it first , because I have no idea what goes into it .
“ Nah , just get in there and do it ! ”
So there was a lot of adrenalin and there were a lot of us new hires for return to flight , there were a lot of people here , the place was buzzing .
It was probably the one I remember most .
Nancy : OK , thanks Dimitri !
Loren Mathre , Audio .
Nancy :
And now I ’m talking with …
Loren : Loren Mathre .
Nancy :
And what do you do at NASA TV ?
Loren : I work in the audio control room .
We support NASA TV when it comes to any aspect of audio .
For launches we put microphones out at the pad , we have one that ’s maybe 100 feet from the orbiter itself and we pick up from the sparkler , so when you watch it on TV and you see the water dump and you hear that “ whoooosh ” and you hear the sparklers kick on , people just take it for granted that you hear that , but we have microphones out there .
So we have one out there , we have one on the pad perimeter to pick it up as soon as it is launching .
And then we put one on the beach , pointing straight up to get that low level rumbling you hear when the shuttle has launched .
Nancy :
This was my first launch that I was here for , for Endeavour , and the thing that got me was the sound .
Loren :
The sound is impressive !
Nancy :
It engulfs you !
So how do you – and I tried to record it and it just basically distorted everything , so what to you have to do to get good sound ?
Loren :
It is a fine mix .
It is a different mix every launch depending on the weather , the temperature – sound travels at different levels , different speeds depending on what is in the atmosphere .
The microphone we put out on the pad we ’re only on that when the sparklers ignite on .
Once the engines kick on you have to get off that immediately , or you have nothing but overdriven clipping noise .
The pad perimeter mic , it overdrives immediately as well , but you have to ride that a little bit , so it ’s a fine tuning of riding the fader and the trim pot until the microphone at the beach picks up the audio .
Once the microphone at the beach picks up the audio , you ’re pretty much good because the shuttle is so far away .
That ’s where you hear that low level crackling .
Nancy :
How long have you worked here ?
Loren : I ’ve worked here in the TV department for 10 years .
I used to be in the tech control , which is just systems , down in the industrial area .
I do n’t know if you ’re familiar with that area – that ’s where all the payloads are processed .
But I was working down there for 10 years as well before I got laid off and re-called back up here .
But when I was working 10 years up there I did n’t know of any of the operations up here .
It ’s funny how you get stuck in your own little world down there .
So when I came up here it was a whole different aspect of the space program because we work hand in hand with the astronauts , you know , so you get to see them .
And we handle all the press conferences , so you get to see the press conferences and you see the Administrator and Bill Gerstenmaier , all of them coming up , and you ’re able to put a face and a personality to the people that are running the agency , and the astronauts themselves , so it ’s a really good job .
Nancy :
So , since it ’s my first time here , it is my first time being at press conferences .
So you ’re always trying to get a shot at who is talking .
How hard is that when you ’ve got several people talking ?
Loren : Press conferences are pretty easy , even when they are full houses .
I do n’t know if you were here when the NASA Administrator was here .
That was a very big press conference .
Normally we only have one mic handler out there , but we had two mic handlers just to handle questions from the media .
It ’s pretty easy , you just ride the levels .
It ’s nothing compared to a launch .
Mixing launch audio is a tricky thing and when you get it just right you feel really good about it because not very often do you get it just right .
There ’s always something that afterwards you think , ‘oh , I could have gotten off that faster , I could have brought that other mic up faster . ’
It ’s just trial and error each time .
Nancy :
And there is no do - overs .
Loren :
There is no do - overs , right !
A month later or so you get another shot at it .
I have another audio control person out there .
And we switch off launches .
So when I mix a launch , he puts the mics out for me and send the signal back to me , and then when he mixes the launch , I do the same for him .
So this is actually his launch , so I ’m putting the microphones out for launch , and for landing – we put microphones on the runway for landings as well .
Just things you take for granted that you see on TV – anything TV - wise , I always like to say , without audio KSC TV is just like a very expensive surveillance system .
We add the extra to the launches and landings .
Nancy : I know !
I watch NASA TV religiously and I know a lot of our listeners do to , so they will be very interested to hear about this kind of behind - the - scenes stuff .
Loren : Yeah , I went to my niece ’s 5th grade class and talked about it , and you just take it for granted when you do it all the time .
But I talked to my niece ’s class earlier this year in January .
Before me there was a police officer there and when I walked up the police officer was showing the kids his car .
There was a karate instructor giving instructions on breaking boards .
And here I am , I work at NASA TV , and I have a little boxful of astronaut pictures and other memorabilia , I thought , ‘ This is going to be so bad . ’
They loved it — the kids could not get enough about space !
They had so many interesting questions for me – about a space elevator and living on the moon – these 5th graders were really interested and wanted to know more .
They said I was the best – they had me signing autographs afterwards !
I said , all I do is mix sound out there , but they just loved it .
There is a lot of interest in the space program .
Maggie Persinger , Public Affairs / Multimedia
Nancy : And this is Maggie Persinger .
And you get to work with all the fun technological things with video – can you tell us about that ?
Maggie : Still and video .
When anybody in the world from motion pictures , film , movies to newspapers , wants or needs something from KSC , or NASA , they come to me and I provide the research , the product , whatever it is that they need for their story , or for Clint Eastwood ’s movie “ Space Cowboys , ” whatever it is .
So it ’s a lot .
I not only deal with that , I have to make sure the jobs are shot , and that I get the copies , and I have to know the entire space program , what is going on everywhere .
So it ’s a difficult job for one person .
There used to be three NASA people that did videos and two people did stills , so now I do it all .
Nancy :
What has been the most interesting thing you ’ve had to send videos or stills to ?
Maggie : I think the most interesting were things like “ Space Cowboys , ” “ Armegeddon , ” “ Contact , ” things like that .
When they used to come here and film , for a year and a half before they came and did that movie , I worked with the background people .
I did things like provide them blanket pieces , tile pieces so they could build their sets .
I got them the color chart for the ET tank .
It was very long and involved .
So whenever you deal with everybody – there ’s a big Discovery program coming out about Australia .
So I constantly am keeping track of these people and sending them new things .
So there ’s a lot of stories – there ’s of interest around the world that people in Iowa do n’t know realize .
But I do !
Because I deal with them so I know there is a lot of interest in the space program .
Nancy : I know that you are very busy even after press conferences , you are quickly handing out audio for us , it ’s been great !
Maggie :
That ’s the thing , actually launch time is my easiest time .
Even though you guys are here , I ’m just dedicated to launch , all of you for this .
It ’s when you all leave and I have to get back to my routine when it gets tough .
Because I ’m dealing with the entire world , get everything shot , keeping up the library , making room – I ’m constantly trying to make room for things , converting all the Quicktime files , — it ’s busy .
So everybody thinks it ’s just busy at launch time !
But launch time is my easiest time .
I love launch day !
It ’s the rest of the time that is tough !
Nancy :
Well thanks Maggie – it ’s been great talking to you !
Maggie :
It ’s been good talking to you !
George Diller , Public Affairs Officer .
Nancy :
The next voice you ’ll hear you will probably recognize .
He ’s the voice of , I think almost all the launches here at Kennedy Space Center for the past several year .
It ’s George Diller .
Hi George , thanks for talking with us today .
George : I do a lot of the launches but the shuttle launches we tend to spread out between among some of us in the office because there is a tremendous amount of preparation that goes into one of those so its hard for one person to do them all .
I do do a lot more of the expendable launches , the unmanned launches and I really enjoy those particularly because the payloads are so different .
They are deployable spacecraft that tend to be focused on space science , planetary exploration , astrophysics – those are the ones to me that have a certain amount of fascination , and always have way back from when I started here back in the late 70’s .
In fact I cut my teeth as a newsman covering the space center for about five years and became particularly interested in the expendable vehicle launches with Viking , Voyager and Pioneer Venus .
I ’ve been here 29 years now and that still has the same attraction for me .
We did launch those kinds of payloads on the shuttle for awhile and I got to work with those payloads in preparation for launch .
But those all transitioned over to the expendable launch vehicles completely after the Challenger accident and the space shuttle was refocused on building the International Space Station .
If I look back probably at some of the missions that I have most enjoyed working on and doing the launch commentary for , probably the Hubble Space Telescope would the one that would be the highlight because I was directly involved with the telescope and the spacecraft payload testing and doing the commentary for launch , as well as for all the missions that have been done since that have gone up to service the telescope .
So it really is quite a feeling to look back and say that I was a part of that for all of those Hubble Missions , both for the launch and all the flights that have followed to service it .
Probably the most memorable spacecraft that I have been directly involved with have been involved with particularly would be Cassini that went to Saturn and sent a probe down to Titan , one of Saturn ’s moons .
Also Galileo that went to Jupiter and that was such a great success and the Magellan mission to Venus .
So , I think I enjoy those kinds of missions because they are leaving low Earth orbit and going so much farther out that we can only hope that one day we ’ll one day go to those places ourselves .
The shuttle missions have really become focused on the space station , and it ’s kind of been fun on those flights to focus on a particular piece of flight hardware that ’s going up to be attached to the station , and later on when there is some kind of reference to a particular component or something particular that has been attached to it , you can remember some involvement that you ’ve had with it .
But I think the space station , is , when is all finished and we look back at the science that was done over the next 10 or 15 years , I think we are going to look back at it as probably one of the wonders of the world in terms of modern accomplishments just as we have the Hubble Space Telescope , because I think so much will come out of it that is focused to us right down here on the ground .
It will translate to benefits such as new metals , new pharmaceuticals , new computer substrates ; new potential cures for diseases , medicines that we can get to synthesize only in the microgravity – zero gravity environment of The potential of the space station is almost mind boggling .
And I ’m hoping to be around long enough to look back at the history of the space station program and say , well , I was with NASA when we were putting this together , and I may be retired eventually , but I can look back and say , look at all of the great things that now have come from the program .
Nancy :
As you see the end of the space shuttle program coming , what are your personal feelings about that ?
George :
Well , the shuttle is something that gives us the kind of capability and flexibility that we never had before and that we do not have any plans to have again .
It has the tremendous ability in terms of being able to deploy payloads , to take large payloads to space , to be able to services things in space , to be able to service things in space , to be able to construct things in space , also to be able to take things up and bring them back .
And looking forward we ’re going to have more capable rockets but they do n’t have the same flexibility in terms of the weight that they can bring up or bring things back or be able to servicing that the shuttle has become so famous for being able to do for things already up there .
So I think we ’ll miss that , but it ’s going to be fun to be able to look back and say the shuttle gave us the only way could have ever built the space station .
I think it is a very storied program in the history of NASA .
I ’m proud to say I was here for the first launch and I ’ll be here for the last launch and I was in some way a part of that story .
Nancy : Could you tell us about what it takes to put everything together to do a launch commentary for NASA TV ?
George :
The launch commentaries are , when you start planning for one , not only are there all the materials that you have to put together , but you also have to work with the TV people on all the things you want to show during the broadcast .
That means scheduling all the video to be shot over a certain amount of time as the spacecraft is being prepared for launch , then all the things you want to do to tell the story , such as the animations you want to show and you have to figure out where in the broadcast its going to fit with what you are doing .
Then have to schedule for it , so it ’s a lot more than just writing it .
Although there ’s a lot of it now that , as far as the shuttle is concerned , I can work from an outline .
I really do n’t have to read from a script , although if I ’m doing something very mission specific I might need a script for some part of it , if it is very mission specific .
So , for anybody doing a launch commentary , it ’s not something you can just pull together in just an afternoon .
It takes a fair amount of time to pull all that together , and then work with the TV people and tell them where you want to include it and you have to work out your shot sheet of the sequence you want all these things in , so I think it ’s good , in a way , that we kind of rotate the shuttle launches in particular around the office because it takes a fair amount of work to put it together .
It ’s a lot of fun , but it ’s a lot of work !
Nancy : I ’ve noticed that it seems recently you ’ve had extra people come on and talk about different things going on with the mission during the launch countdown .
George :
On the shuttle side , yes .
On the ELV side we ’ve always kind of done that .
Our ELV commentary is usually divided into two parts , because the commentaries run usually between two and two and a half hours , as a rule on an unmanned launch .
The first part of it picks up at a certain point in the countdown , but it is very heavy on interviews and things that are associated with the mission aspect .
Usually you ’re doing all that while they are fueling the vehicle .
So , it gives you the chance to talk about fueling and things going on , but basically it gives you time for the color .
And then the second half of it is really focused on the launch itself and the launch operations .
So it is divided into two parts that way .
On the shuttle , its more of a desire on the part of NASA to include much more activity both in terms of the mission as well as features that tell a story in the countdown and include more background that the average guy watching NASA TV can relate to .
So it has meant more features , and some are related to the mission and some are related to the countdown , some are more related to the astronauts , some are more related to the people that have been involved with it , so we try to broaden it out a little bit .
I think that is the reason behind that , because the count is on for such a long time .
It ’s one for five to five and a half hours .
I think there was a feeling that we needed to do that and we had enough time to do that .
Nancy : I know I always enjoy watching as much as I can because it is fun to watch the whole process of what takes place .
And now that I ’ve been here and have gotten to see that , like the astronauts walking out and seeing it live and in person , its been really fun being here .
George :
There have been a coupel that have almost been extravaganzas because of the nature of the mission , like the John Glenn mission .
That one , there was so much you could include in the commentary because of the history of John Glenn .
And he is so modest .
He did n’t want us to do any more than we customarily do .
But how can you not ?
And he is such a favorite around here .
When he was here for the countdown dress rehearsal and the training , it was hard to get him through these exercises and these tests because he was just being mobbed by the NASA workers and the KSC employees .
They were pulling dollar bills out of their wallets to get him to sign .
And he would never be rushed .
The trainers would try to keep things moving , but he would not be rushed .
He took time to talk to everybody and sign their bills .
When we had the Challenger accident , he was the first person on site after the accident .
He flew down here immediately and was on a briefing that afternoon over in the news center .
He absolutely loves this place .
He ’s never forgotten it and those are the kinds of missions that have a lot of public interest .
Plus the return to flight missions after Challenger and Columbia those were always big because in each case it meant a re-focusing of the program in some way .
And of course the last one will just be a blowout .
Nancy :
Thanks very much for talking with us today , this has been a lot of fun .
George : All right !
Nancy : I hope you enjoyed as much as I did the conversations I had with some of the people from NASA TV .
NASA TV is available through many cable and satellite providers , and you can also watch it online .

Reporting from Kennedy Space Center , this is Nancy Atkinson
Rupert Murdoch 's media giant News International could face a judicial inquiry after a highly critical parliamentary report today accuses senior executives at its top - selling newspaper of concealing the truth about the extent of illegal phone hacking by its journalists .
The 167 - page report by a cross-party select committee is withering about the conduct of the News of the World , with one MP saying its crimes " went to the heart of the British establishment , in which police , military royals and government ministers were hacked on a near industrial scale " .
MPs condemned the " collective amnesia " and " deliberate obfuscation " by NoW executives who gave evidence to them , and said it was inconceivable that only a few people at the paper knew about the practice .
The culture , media and sport select committee was also damning of the police , saying Scotland Yard should have broadened its original investigation in 2006 , and not just focused on Clive Goodman , the NoW 's royal reporter .
The findings provoked calls by the ­Liberal Democrats for a judicial inquiry , and an unusually strong reaction from a cabinet minister , Ben Bradshaw , and Downing Street .
Bradshaw , the media secretary , said the report raised " extremely serious questions " for the Murdoch empire .
" This report … says lawbreaking was condoned and that the company sought to conceal the truth .
We welcome the report and are considering what further action may be needed to be taken . "
No 10 also issued a statement , saying : " The scale of this is absolutely breathtaking and an extreme cause for concern . "
Chris Huhne , the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman , said : " The only alternative to get to the bottom of what actually went on at the News of the World is a judicial inquiry so that a judge can insist on information and can draw out the lessons if we are to avoid such wholesale abuse of privacy again . "
News International questioned the credibility of the committee and accused it of pursuing a " party political agenda " .
The committee has been investigating phone hacking by the News of the World as part of a wide - ranging inquiry that also looked at issues of libel law reform , ­privacy and regulation of the press .
Today 's report makes sweeping criticisms of press self - regulation , describing the Press Complaints Commission as " toothless " ; decries the reporting of the Madeleine McCann story , saying there was an inexcusable lowering of standards ; and recommends changes to libel law and limits on the use of superinjunctions .
But it is the section relating to phone - hacking that could yet have the most impact .
The MPs ' inquiry into the practice was reopened after the Guardian 's revelation last July that the News of the World had secretly paid out £ 1 m in costs and in settlements to Gordon Taylor , chief executive of the Professional Footballers '
Association , and two others , over phone hacking allegations .
The committee , which took evidence from executives from News International , said financial settlements paid by the News Group newspapers left them with " a strong impression silence has been bought " .
The report condemned the paper 's own inquiry into how widespread the practice was " far from ' full ' or ' rigorous ' , " as it had assured MPs and the Press Complaints Commission .
MPs were scornful of the newspaper 's repeated insistence that Goodman , who was jailed for hacking into the private voicemails of royal aides , was a " rogue reporter " , acting alone and that no one else on the newspaper knew about or condoned phone hacking .
Today 's report makes a nonsense of the claim , saying it was " inconceivable " that Goodman was alone in knowing about phone hacking .
It details contradictory testimony by New International executives , and what it termed " collective amnesia " and " deliberate obfuscation " by witnesses .
The organisation 's chief executive , Rebekah Brooks , repeatedly refused to give evidence to the MPs .
In a unanimous finding , the cross-party committee said : " We strongly condemn this behaviour which reinforces the widely held impression that the press generally regard themselves as unaccountable and that News International in particular has sought to conceal the truth about what really occurred . "
The report states that it is now likely the number of phone - hacking victims " will never be known " .
The MPs vindicate the disclosures originally published by Guardian writer Nick Davies , and said that the committee had found new evidence confirming them .
The committee avoids making accusations against the most politically sensitive figure involved , Andy Coulson , the editor of the News of the World at the time and now the director of communications at Tory HQ .
The report says there was no evidence that he knew of phone hacking .
However , the MPs said he was right to quit over phone hacking .
" That such hacking took place reveals a serious management failure for which as editor he bore ultimate responsibility , and we believe that he was correct to accept this and resign , " the MPs say .
Today 's report is also unsparing about the behaviour of two bodies whose original duty it had been to investigate the evidence against the News of the World .
It says the Metropolitan police were wrong not to broaden their investigation into the Mulcaire case in 2006 .
The MPs reject testimony by assistant commissioner John Yates that there had only been " a handful " of hacking victims of the News of the World .
Former minister Tom Watson , a member of the committee , said at the press conference at the Commons : " Scotland Yard are sitting on a whole bank of information and data about very senior people in public life who were hacked , that the public do n't know about . "
He called for the information commissioner to access all the police files and see if any legal breaches had occurred .
Watson , added that the phone - hacking scandal had " gone to the very heart of the British establishment " .
" The police , the military , the royals , the government ministers have been hacked on a near industrial scale , " he said .
The other body which failed in its task was the Press Complaints Commission , the committee report says .
The PCC had rushed out a report purporting to exonerate the News of the World that took the paper 's claims of innocence at face value .
" We find the conclusions in the PCC's November report simplistic and surprising .
It has certainly not fully , or forensically , considered all the evidence . "
The Murdoch organisation reacted by issuing a wholesale attack on the good faith of the committee , which has a Conservative chairman , John Whittingdale .
A statement issued on behalf of News International claimed members were in a political conspiracy with the Guardian , which had originally published new evidence of the hacking , and whose editor , Alan Rusbridger , testified in public at the committee hearings .
The statement said that News International " strongly rejected " the findings .
A statement from the Guardian described the report as " insightful and wide - ranging " .
It said : " The press has a proud record of shining a light into the darkest corners of our public institutions .
As an industry we need to show we are willing to accept the same level of scrutiny and accountability .
We are therefore pleased that the committee has recommended improving the self - regulatory system .
" Also encouraging are the committee 's comments on libel , excessive legal costs and superinjunctions , all of which are being used by corporations and wealthy individuals to suppress free speech both here and abroad .
However , there remains a great deal of work to be done to convert concerns and recommendations into meaningful actions . "
The statement added : " We are surprised that News International has questioned the integrity of a cross- party committee , with a Conservative MP in the chair , ­carrying out an independent inquiry as is its historic parliamentary right .
" Observers will draw their own conclusions about why they have chosen to make this attack .
" According to the report , the MPs took a vote on only four clauses , unanimously agreeing on more than 570 paragraphs .
It is insulting to the committee to question their work in this way . "

The stormtroopers were originally envisioned by Lucas to be failed attempts at bulk cloning by the Emperor of Jedi Anakin Skywalker , of which Darth Vader was the only successful clone .
This was supposed to have been revealed in Episode 6 " Revenge of the Jedi " , in which both Obi-wan 's story to Luke about how Darth had killed his father , and Darth 's claim to be Luke 's father are essentially proven to be technically true .
Lucas , of course , changed course for reasons known only unto himself , and the brilliantly moody atmosphere of " Empire " became the slap - happy shambles of " Return " , instead of the equally grim " Revenge " .
The Ewoks , for example , were supposed to be Wookies ( is anyone surprised ?
no? moving on ... ) , which of course did n't show back up until one of the later " earlier " episodes , and the clones were morphed from Jedi into mercenary ( Jango Fett ) .

If You Said ...
Mostly As : Congratulations !
Your willpower , creativity , and willingness to be part of some truly ridiculous storylines has marked you as the perfect recruit for the Green Lantern Corps !
Green Lanterns are , of course , totally honest , totally fearless , and totally beloved by fans , just as long as their name happens to be Hal Jordan .
Watch out for evil yellow space bugs , and you 'll be fine !
Mostly Bs : With your ability to inspire great lust -- er , love and willingness to show some skin , you 're a perfect fit for the all - girl running crew of the Star Sapphires !
Just remember the three Ses : Sexiness , Sultriness , and Setting Feminism in Comics Back By 20 Years .
Oh , and you might want to start doing crunches now :
Pink latex is n't very forgiving .
Mostly Cs : You 've shown yourself capable of greed to such monumentally Scroogian proportions that you 're almost guaranteed a visit from the Ghosts of Various Christmases this year , but until then , why not sign up as the latest recruit to the Orange Lanterns ?
Mostly Ds :
We hate to tell you this , but you 're basically a creep .
But do n't worry !
Creepiness can come in handy if you want to spread fear throughout the galaxy as a member of the Yellow Lantern Corps !
You 'll fit in perfectly , but keep in mind that you will be represented by a a guy with a pencil - thin moustache and / or a giant yellow space bug .
Mostly Es : Easy , tiger !
We know you 're pissed , and while your constant seething rage would probably land you in a court - mandated anger management course , it 's also your ticket to adventure as the newest Red Lantern !
Assuming you do n't work yourself into a cardiac event before the ring shows up , they 'll be lucky to have you , but keep in mind that side effects do include ... well , let 's just call it a specific brand of nausea .
Mostly Fs : Well , the bad news is you 're dead .
Fortunately , this being the DC Universe , being dead is only slightly more daunting than having a slight head cold ( and with about the same recovery time ) , and even more fortunately , that means you 're eligible for a starring role in the hottest title in comics !
Just make sure you were a character Geoff Johns liked when he was a kid , and you too can strap on a Black Lantern ring and terrorize your former friends !
The Operative : “ Are you willing to die for that belief ? ” Capt .
Malcolm “ Mal ” Reynolds : “ I am … but it ai n’t exactly Plan A. " — Serenity
Passion matters .
If there ’s a lesson to be drawn from many of the films in the New Cult Canon — specifically the ones that died in theaters , only to find a following down the line — it ’s that the passionate few speak louder than the passive many .
That may not always register in dollars and cents , but it ’s what keeps low - rated TV shows alive , sustains talented artists whose appeal often eludes the mainstream , and tends the garden of cinema history long after blockbusters have faded .
In the Internet age , the effect has been amplified tenfold , as nerdy legions have united to wage successful campaigns large and small , from making an 18 - year - old Rage Against The Machine song Britain ’s No. 1 Christmas single to forcing renewals of struggling shows by sending 20 tons of peanuts to network headquarters ( Jericho ) or buying Subway sandwiches en masse ( Chuck ) .

Behold the mighty power of the Whedon cult .
At any other time , and with any other creator , Joss Whedon ’s recent Fox science - fiction show Dollhouse would n’t have made it past two or three episodes .
The creative tension with the network was very public , and it significantly damaged the show in the early going .
The original pilot was scotched , schedulers immediately relegated the show to a doomed Friday slot , and ratings that were unpromising at the beginning slipped to apocalyptic levels as the season wore on .
And yet through some metrics unrelated to Nielsen ratings — hoped - for DVD sales , favorable online and DVR numbers , vague demographic targeting — Dollhouse enjoyed a full , improbable second season that allowed Whedon and company to wrap things up on their own terms .
( Season two ’s brazen refusal to do any handholding was especially notable under the circumstances .
Newbies were thrown right into the deep end . )
Had Whedon ’s brilliant 2002 space - Western series Firefly been around in the age of Twitter and Facebook and DVRs , perhaps it would n’t have been yanked from Fox after 11 of its 14 episodes aired .
No matter .
The passion index was high enough for Whedon to convince Universal to bankroll a modestly budgeted feature to resolve the questions left unanswered by a failed TV show .
And really , there was genuine logic behind it : Firefly ’s core fan base — called “ The Browncoats , ” after the collection of rogue heroes at the show ’s center — could be counted on to buy tickets , and their advocacy ( not to mention the quality of the material ) might persuade the uninitiated to give it a shot .
And thus 2005 ’s Serenity , Whedon ’s feature debut as writer - director , found its way into theaters in the dregs of late September , opened to middling business , and fell predictably into the warm embrace of couch potatoes on DVD .

There are two main points I ’d like to make about Serenity .
1 . It ’s about as good an adaptation as anyone had a right to expect , swiftly paced and full of the humor , adventure , and irreverence that made Firefly so special .
2 . Whenever I ’m inclined to think the ’00s were far more exciting for TV than for cinema , Serenity is Exhibit B. ( Exhibit A being The Wire , of course . )
For Whedon , converting Firefly into a two - hour movie is an act of compression , not expansion .
The film ’s effects are splashier and the choreography is more elaborate , but the job of squeezing in a season ’s worth of mythology — and bringing the story to a real conclusion — is virtually impossible to pull off .
Whedon ’s task was not unlike the recent Star Trek reboot , in that he had to reintroduce a cast of TV characters .
But it was much harder , because Firefly was never part of the cultural lexicon , and thus more difficult to shorthand .
So Serenity has to do two things at once : Satisfy fans who already know these characters and are looking for payoffs and closure , and bring an entirely new audience into the fold .
Whedon does a near - miraculous job negotiating this impossible balance , particularly in the early going , which swiftly , elegantly sets up the Firefly universe , introduces most of the main characters , and puts Serenity ’s plot in motion .
In what ’s later revealed to be propaganda - as - history , spoon - fed to impressionable schoolchildren , a video tells of humanity outgrowing Earth and resettling on dozens of terraformed planets and hundreds of moons in a new solar system .
This sliver of the galaxy is controlled by the Alliance , which won a victory over “ the Independents ” to ensure ( so the video says ) that “ everyone can enjoy the comfort and enlightenment of true civilization . ”
Advertisement
The Alliance controls six “ Central Planets , ” but the outer planets are a dusty haven for Old West - style lawlessness and the occasional raid by a breed of cannibal savages called the Reavers .
On the rickety - but - true ship known as Firefly , war vet Captain Malcolm Reynolds ( better known simply as “ Mal ” ) and his band of outlaws thieve and scavenge their black - market bounty , living in proud defiance of the government .
Played with rascally charm by Nathan Fillion — who leads a cast many have likened to Star Wars populated entirely by Han Solos — Mal “ aims to misbehave , ” and his loyal crew follows suit , including pilot Wash ( Alan Tudyk ) and his ass - kicking wife Zöe ( Gina Torres ) , shifty mercenary Jayne ( Adam Baldwin ) , the adorable ( and affection - starved ) mechanic Kaylee ( Jewel Staite ) , and sometime escort Inara ( Morena Baccarin ) , who starts the movie off - ship .
The wildcards in the bunch are Simon ( Sean Maher ) , a doctor , and his unstable , psychic sister River ( Summer Glau ) , who ’s been programmed by the Alliance as a very dangerous weapon .
How dangerous ?
This dangerous :

Because there ’s so much heavy lifting to be done in the introductions alone , Whedon wisely keeps the plotting simple :
The government wants River back at all costs — as much for the secrets she knows as her potential for destruction — and they ’ve sent The Operative , a Man With No Name - type played with sinister bloodlessness by Chiwetel Ejiofor , to track her down .
Finding out the big secret the Alliance is hiding — a whopper , and one with a strong connection to the technology - as - tool - of - oppression theme of Dollhouse — is the lynchpin to the Firefly series , and Whedon delivers that revelation with the full force it deserves .
A strong vein of libertarian paranoia runs through Whedon ’s work ( “ People do n’t like to be meddled with , ” says young River .
“ We ’re in their homes and in their heads , and we have n’t the right ” ) and Serenity sees it through to a future where a totalitarian government , in seeking to calm and appease the masses , robs them of their humanity .
Yet the need to drive the narrative forward and turn Serenity into a thrilling space adventure — which , again , it definitely is — often betrays the laconic charm of the TV show .
Though it had its share of narrative through - lines and mini-arcs , Firefly was slightly more episodic than other Whedon shows , content to follow Mal and the gang on various missions of the week on the outer planets .
It was a relaxed , funny , smartly conceived hour with occasional bursts of action , building its tone around Fillion ’s old - school toughness and way with a one - liner .
And with all that time to stretch out , Firefly was democratic in giving all the players their due ; it ’s the nature ( and boundless promise ) of television that shows can take advantage of the limitless space for character development , and that ’s something Whedon has understood from the beginning , well before the current wave of novelistic TV shows .
So there ’s a divide inherent in Serenity :
The Browncoats have a tremendous amount of investment in these characters , but their fates are probably not so urgent to people who are only just learning their names .
Hard as he tries to bring general audiences into the fold , Whedon does n’t entirely solve this dilemma , and winds up hanging onto several “ for fans only ” developments that never would have made the cut in a stand - alone film .
Advertisement
Whedon puts too much of a gloss over relationships that reprise the romantic tensions of the TV show without advancing them much , like the frisky interplay between Mal and Inara ( who ’s peripheral to the film ’s story ) , and Kaylee ’s pining over Simon , who was always too hung up with his sister to pay much attention to her .
( Though Kaylee has one of my favorite lines in the film , when she openly admits , “ Goin ’ on a year now , I ai n’t had nothin ’ twixt my nethers were n’t run on batteries ! ” )
More inexplicable is the brief appearance of Shepherd Book ( Ron Glass ) , whom Firefly fans remember fondly as a former passenger of mysterious origin , and non-fans know as some guy whose heroic martyrdom is given inexplicable weight .
Even the death of a major character in Serenity opens up a rift : on opening night , I heard plenty of gasps and sniffles from the Browncoats ( some of whom did indeed show up in the garb ) .
But outside of the initial shock —
Whedon has been known to kill off characters swiftly , and this one is breathtakingly fast — the mourning is left to the die - hards .
Then again , Whedon may be inclined to play to fans anyway ; that ’s what happened in the second season of Dollhouse , and he can really only do so much handholding before losing everyone .
The key to enjoying Serenity — and I clearly have had my struggles — is to appreciate how much Whedon tries to make a movie here , not just a special double episode of an unjustly cancelled TV show .
While I missed the relative longueurs of Firefly , with its balance of space - Western adventure and hang - out time , the action in Serenity is exciting and purposeful , and its rebellious , anti-establishment essence survives intact .
Between the Reavers and Ejiofor ’s deliciously mercenary villain , Mal and the gang are forced to slip between threats both savage and smart , but Whedon keeps the tone light and irreverent , and nobody writes better wise - ass dialogue .
Witness this typically sharp exchange between Mal and The Operative :

For whatever reason — let ’s just say the general suckiness of humanity — Serenity was n’t a box - office smash , which dispelled for a while any hope that Whedon would carry George Lucas ’ populist science - fiction mantle into an infinitely cooler future .
But it realizes a fantasy that advocates of other brilliant - but - cancelled TV shows usually only experience in fan fiction :
It brings a beloved series to a natural , satisfying close .
( Let ’s face it : Even successful TV series do n’t often come in for a graceful ending .
Most of them overstay their welcome or peter out meekly . )
And the only way to account for that is passion .
A few loud voices raised in unison sounded like a much larger chorus to a studio , and with Serenity , Whedon and his followers got away with something .

It was quite a game for Evander Kane who played hard and well all night .
He squashed Crosby up against the glass early on ( not all that hard , I might note ) and Crosby took exception and slashed him back .
From then on the Penguins were trying to get at Kane .
Matt Cooke bumped him and then put his stick around Kane 's neck area .
Cooke appears to be calling for a fight .
Kane drops his gloves and lands a perfect right that knocks Cooke out .
Kane should have had a goal later on as his misses the mostly empty net by lofting it too high .
Kane provide that he could play hard and physical despite being just 18 .
He still needs to fill out more .
Hopefully next season we 'll get to see what he can do with some power play ice time .
Neuroscience is one of the more complicated subjects .
But with innovative tools like fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation , and projects that are reengineering a model of a human brain , scientists are working hard on cracking the neural code .
Many would argue , however , that our knowledge of how the brain works is still pretty vague .
Nonetheless all sorts of industries are jumping to use any new brain information to support their work .
Neuromarketing claims to get objective truth about peoples ’ preferences by decoding the “ reactions ” of our neurons .
Companies like No Lie fMRI , Inc. , are capitalizing on the potential for tools that can “ read the brain ” to replace the polygraph in lie detection .
The literary world wants to unweave the rainbow by studying the way the brain processes literature and certain narrative techniques .
And there ’s even an Academy of Neuroscience for Architecture which reveals that oval tables make eye contact easier .
But scientists remind us that current brain scans only show areas of brain activity in response to simple stimuli .
For instance knowing that the anterior cingulate cortex lights up when we love something , does n’t necessarily help us understand the experience of loving .
Just like knowing the notes of a guitar riff ca n’t explain the sensation of soul in a blues band .
Not to say that the trend of " neuroscience everywhere " is not merited , just that its promises may be a bit premature .
But science is working on it .

A group of Jews and Arabs are fighting in the Israeli courts to be recognized as " Israelis , " a nationality currently denied them , in a case that officials fear may threaten the country ’s self - declared status as a Jewish state .
Israel refused to recognize an Israeli nationality at the country ’s establishment in 1948 , making an unusual distinction between " citizenship " and " nationality . "
Although all Israelis qualify as " citizens of Israel , " the state is defined as belonging to the " Jewish nation , " meaning not only the 5.6 million Israeli Jews but also more than 7 million Jews in the diaspora .
Critics say the special status of Jewish nationality has been a way to undermine the citizenship rights of non-Jews in Israel , especially the fifth of the population who are Arab .
Some 30 laws in Israel specifically privilege Jews , including in the areas of immigration rights , naturalization , access to land , and employment .
Arab leaders have also long complained that indications of “ Arab ” nationality on ID cards make it easy for police and government officials to target Arab citizens for harsher treatment .
The Interior Ministry has adopted more than 130 possible nationalities for Israeli citizens , most of them defined in religious or ethnic terms , with " Jewish " and " Arab " being the main categories .
The group ’s legal case is being heard by the supreme court after a district judge rejected their petition two years ago , backing the state ’s position that there is no Israeli nation .
The head of the campaign for Israeli nationality , Uzi Ornan , a retired linguistics professor , said : " It is absurd that Israel , which recognizes dozens of different nationalities , refuses to recognize the one nationality it is supposed to represent . "
The government opposes the case , claiming that the campaign ’s real goal is to " undermine the state ’s infrastructure " – a presumed reference to laws and official institutions that ensure Jewish citizens enjoy a privileged status in Israel .
Ornan , 86 , said that denying a common Israeli nationality was the linchpin of state - sanctioned discrimination against the Arab population .
" There are even two laws – the Law of Return for Jews and the Citizenship Law for Arabs – that determine how you belong to the state , " he said .
" What kind of democracy divides its citizens into two kinds ? "
Yoel Harshefi , a lawyer supporting Ornan , said the Interior Ministry had resorted to creating national groups with no legal recognition outside Israel , such as " Arab " or " unknown , " to avoid recognizing an Israeli nationality .
In official documents most Israelis are classified as " Jewish " or " Arab , " but immigrants whose status as Jews is questioned by the Israeli rabbinate , including more than 300,000 arrivals from the former Soviet Union , are typically registered according to their country of origin .
" Imagine the uproar in Jewish communities in the United States , Britain , or France , if the authorities there tried to classify their citizens as ‘ Jewish ’ or ‘ Christian , ’ " said Ornan .
The professor , who lives close to Haifa , launched his legal action after the Interior Ministry refused to change his nationality to " Israeli " in 2000 .
An online petition declaring " I am an Israeli " has attracted several thousand signatures .
Ornan has been joined in his action by 20 other public figures , including former government minister Shulamit Aloni .
Several members have been registered with unusual nationalities such as " Russian , " " Buddhist , " " Georgian , " and " Burmese . "
Two Arabs are party to the case , including Adel Kadaan , who courted controversy in the 1990s by waging a lengthy legal action to be allowed to live in one of several hundred communities in Israel open only to Jews .
Uri Avnery , a peace activist and former member of the parliament , said the current nationality system gives Jews living abroad a far greater stake in Israel than its 1.3 million Arab citizens .
" The state of Israel can not recognize an ‘ Israeli ’ nation because it is the state of the ‘ Jewish ’ nation … it belongs to the Jews of Brooklyn , Budapest , and Buenos Aires , even though these consider themselves as belonging to the American , Hungarian , or Argentine nations . "
International Zionist organizations representing the diaspora , such as the Jewish National Fund and the Jewish Agency , are given in Israeli law a special , quasi - governmental role , especially in relation to immigration and control over large areas of Israeli territory for the settlement of Jews only .
Ornan said the lack of a common nationality violated Israel ’s Declaration of Independence , which says the state will " uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens , without distinction of religion , race , or sex . "
Indications of nationality on ID cards carried by Israelis made it easy for officials to discriminate against Arab citizens , he added .
The government has countered that the nationality section on ID cards was phased out from 2000 – after the Interior Ministry , which was run by a religious party at the time , objected to a court order requiring it to identify non-Orthodox Jews as " Jewish " on the cards .
However , Ornan said any official could instantly tell if he was looking at the card of a Jew or Arab because the date of birth on the IDs of Jews was given according to the Hebrew calendar .
In addition , the ID of an Arab , unlike a Jew , included the grandfather ’s name .
" Flash your ID card and whatever government clerk is sitting across from you immediately knows which ‘ clan ’ you belong to , and can refer you to those best suited to ‘ handle your kind , ’ " Ornan said .
The distinction between Jewish and Arab nationalities is also shown on Interior Ministry records used to make important decisions about personal status issues such as marriage , divorce , and death , which are dealt with on entirely sectarian terms .
Only Israelis from the same religious group , for example , are allowed to marry inside Israel – otherwise they are forced to wed abroad – and cemeteries are separated according to religious belonging .
Some of those who have joined the campaign complain that it has damaged their business interests .
One Druze member , Carmel Wahaba , said he had lost the chance to establish an import - export company in France because officials there refused to accept documents stating his nationality as " Druze " rather than " Israeli . "
The group also said it hoped to expose a verbal sleight of hand that intentionally mistranslates the Hebrew term " Israeli citizenship " on the country ’s passports as " Israeli nationality " in English to avoid problems with foreign border officials .
B. Michael , a commentator for Yedioth Aharonoth , Israel ’s most popular newspaper , has observed : " We are all Israeli nationals – but only abroad . "
The campaign , however , is likely to face an uphill struggle in the courts .
A similar legal suit brought by a Tel Aviv psychologist , George Tamrin , failed in 1970 .
Shimon Agranat , head of the supreme court at the time , ruled : " There is no Israeli nation separate from the Jewish people . …
The Jewish people is composed not only of those residing in Israel but also of Diaspora Jewries . "
That view was echoed by the district court in 2008 when it heard Ornan ’s case .
The judges in the supreme court , which held the first appeal hearing last month , indicated that they too were likely to be unsympathetic .
Justice Uzi Fogelman said : " The question is whether or not the court is the right place to solve this problem . "

Whether you are looking for a system to use you intense gaming , something to get …
This week ’s scheduled column on security maturity has been rescheduled for next week .
It 's because I ca n’t take the misinformation anymore .
I was recently contacted by the company that manages my stock to open up a new Web site log - on account .
During new account creation , it asked me to input a secure password .
So , I put in my normal password that is 21 characters long followed by 10 characters that are unique per Web site , but only uses lowercase letters .
The length of the base password prevents basic password cracking and guessing , while the additional characters make the overall password ( or pass phrase ) unique so that no two resources ever have the same password .
At 31 characters long , my password is all but unhackable .
Attackers will need to find another way to compromise my account rather than trying to guess it or crack it with brute force .
But of course , as usual , the finance company 's Web site required that my password be complex , using three of four presented sets of characters , such as at least one uppercase character or one nonalphanumeric symbol .
So although the password could be only six characters long , according to their policy , it also had to be complex .
The conventional thinking is that the additional complexity presents such an increased workload for the hacker that complexity is the holy grail of password hacking prevention .
After all , conventional wisdom says that all the good Web sites require complexity .
Heck , a Microsoft Windows log - on password requires complexity .
Every new password policy I read requires complexity -- but gives scant consideration to the equal ( or better ) importance of longer password length .
They 're all wrong !
Character - for - character , password length is more important for security than complexity .
Requiring complexity but allowing passwords to remain short makes passwords more vulnerable to attack than simply requiring easier - to - remember , longer passwords .
For everyone using six - to nine - character passwords with “ complexity , ” I appreciate it .
I get paid to break in to systems for a living , and you make my job easier .
Strength is provided by increasing the number of possible passwords the attacker has to guess ( let ’s call this the keyspace even though it really is n’t appropriate in this context ) .
The keyspace is represented mathematically as X^L , where X is the number of possible characters that can be in the password and L is the length .
If you do the basic analysis , you can see that changes in L are more significant , character for character , than changes in X .
But conventional wisdom will have you believe that increasing complexity forces the password attacker to use significantly more possible characters in their attack .
In the X^L formula example , forcing the use of capitalized letters requires the value of X to go from 26 for all possible lower case letters to 52 for both upper case and lower case letters .
And if you include nonalphanumeric characters , X goes up to 94 to support all the normal single characters you can type on a 101 keyboard .
Windows will allow you to use any Unicode character , which includes upwards of 65,000 different symbols .
Of course , most people only use the 94 standard keyboard keys .
And if people actually evenly used the 94 characters of potential complexity , short passwords would be uncrackable , because 94^8 = 6,095,689,385,410,816 possible passwords -- which is uncrackable using anything known today or in the near future .
The problem with this analysis is that complexity cannot be guaranteed , and for the most part will be circumvented by your end -users .
Whether you give them 94 characters or 65,000 characters to choose from , most will choose to include the same 32 characters ( several studies have discussed this , including this Microsoft debate ) .
This means that the effective password space for most environments is 32 ^L , plus a few more characters .
In the study cited above , 10 percent of the cracked passwords only used the included 32 characters .
It 's important to note that this was a sample of passwords within a company that had a higher state of security than most organizations .
And because most users also use dictionary words as the root to their “ complex ” password , and follow other common conventions ( capitalized letters are at the beginning , numbers are at the end ) , a simple hybrid attack will break most of them in less than a day .
Trust me , I know -- I do it for a living .
There is no easy way to force true password complexity in most environments without a software addition , other than to generate truly random passwords and hand them out to users .
They will probably hate you for doing so , but the greater concern is that writing down their passwords makes them even weaker than noncomplex passwords .
If you ca n’t guarantee true password complexity ( and you probably can ’t ) length is your best bet .
I ’d guess that a typical good , knowledgeable password hacker can crack up to nine - character passwords within normal levels of ability and resources .
At 10 characters , it becomes very hard to crack , regardless of complexity .
So , when trying to increase the strength of your passwords , my advice is to consider length as much or more than you consider complexity .
For my money , length is all the protection I need .
Make your admin and root passwords 15 or more characters long and forget about complexity -- at 15 characters - plus , they are all but uncrackable .
If you still do n’t believe me , participate in my password cracking challenge .
Win $ 100 and books .
Odds are that you ’ll crack the 10 - character complex challenge long before the 15 - character no-complexity password .
And so begins the most iimportant general election campaign since 1997 .
As expected , Gordon Brown has chosen this morning to drive to Buckingham Palace and ask the Queen to dissolve parliament , sparking a battle over the future of Britain , the first stages of which , at least , will end on 6 May .
The symbolic move comes after a weekend of intense discussion and strategising at the top of the Labour Party .
Last night , Labour 's electoral big guns -- including Douglas Alexander , the Miliband brothers and Ed Balls -- gathered at No 10 to prepare for today .
This morning , they gathered again with the rest of the cabinet to outline Labour 's pitch for an electorate faced with what Brown and David Cameron are calling a " big choice " .
" The people of this country have fought too hard to get Britain on the road to recovery to allow anybody to take us back on the road to recession , " the Prime Minister is expected to say .
Just in time , there gathers a strong team around Brown , including Peter Mandelson , Alexander and the Milibands .
The role of David , the Foreign Secretary , is particularly significant .
Hypocritically accused of being at once a " bottler " who failed to topple Brown and " disloyal " , he is plunging into this campaign with a view to helping his rival win .
Miliband 's new campaign blog , in which he will talk to voters , is a small indication of that .
This morning , meanwhile , Neil Kinnock was chosen as the man to be shouted at by John Humphrys on the Today programme .
For perhaps the first time in two years , Labour is united .
For Brown personally , the stakes could not be higher .
The towering Labour figure of his generation even in 1994 , when John Smith died , his position was usurped by a wave of support across the party for Tony Blair , who looked like a winner .
Having wrongly allowed the false narrative to build that he had been " robbed " of the leadership , he grew bitter as he fought for over ten years to take over from Blair .
Then , finally allowed to take the helm in summer 2007 , he saw his own popularity and that of Labour soar , only to be punctured brutally in the autumn of that year .
Now , after the crash , the hint of recovery . . . and the slim chance of victory .
In four weeks he will either have pulled off the political comeback of the century or end up , in the words of the late Roy Jenkins , a " tail - end Charlie " .
But if the stakes are high for Brown , they are higher still for the country .
David Cameron has proved himself a talented media player but a bad party reformer .
The Conservatives refused to make fiscal policy their " Clause Four " and they go into this election wedded , extraordinarily , to the same mantra of cutting " red tape " as they pursued in the past three elections they lost .
Is that a vision ?
With cunning , if predictable skill , Cameron says the question the country faces is whether we want " five more years of Gordon Brown " .
True , the voters may well baulk at that .
Yet Brown should not be underestimated .
He was , it should be repeated , almost universally written off for months .
Now , polls point to a hung parliament and newspapers carry features with experts explaining how he can win .
The next four weeks are about so much more than Gordon Brown , however , as the unity around him paradoxically shows .
It is a battle between Labour , the Tories and the Lib Dems for the soul of this country .
And when it comes to the biggest decisions of all -- about the values and , yes , the parties that are to lead this country and its approach to the world in the next five years -- it is always unwise to underestimate the supreme collective intelligence of the great British electorate .
We shall see .

UPDATED : 7:12 p.m.
CLEVELAND , Ohio --
Cleveland police arrested a couple early Thursday after finding their 8 - year - old son tied to a coffee table with a broken nose .
Andreia Huffman , 37 , and her husband , Jason Dunikowski , 32 , were jailed as detectives investigate them for domestic violence and child endangering .
There were nine children , ages 3 to 17 , in the home .
One of the children , a 15 - year - old boy , called 9 - 1 - 1 about 1:15 a.m. and reported that the 8 - year - old was tied to the table , Sgt. Sammy Morris said .
Officers arrived at the house on East 50th Street and found the 8 - year - old on the floor .
His hands and feet were bound behind his back with duct tape , and a shoelace was around his neck and feet tied him to the table , Morris said .
Huffman was sleeping in a bed near the child , and Dunikowski was sleeping on a couch next to the table , police said .
Officers found severe discoloration on the boy 's hands , suggesting he may have been tied up for a long time , Morris said .
They also found bruises on his hands and feet and his nose was broken , he added .
The 8 - year - old appeared to have been beaten daily , said Deborah Forkas , director of the Cuyahoga County Children and Family Services .
The boy who called police told The Plain Dealer that he needed to take action after witnessing the incidents in the house .
He said the family came to Cleveland about six years ago from Kentucky .
" I could n't deal with it anymore , " he said in a telephone interview from the lobby of a social service agency .
This is what happened when officers came to the house , according to the police report ;
Huffman told officers that her 17 - year - old daughter tied up the boy .
One of the other children then told officers that Huffman makes the older child tie the boy and slam his head into a wall .
" I am not the only one who does it , " Huffman yelled , " and I 'm not the only one that 's going to get in trouble . "
Dunikowski , father of the five youngest children , acknowledged that he knew about the child being restrained .
The 15 - year - old urged Dunikowski to confess what he does to the boy .
" You did it , too , " Huffman yelled .
The 15 - year - old said that Huffman repeatedly smashed the 8 - year - old 's face into the wall and pointed to a crack in the wall .
An officer had the boy stand next to the crack and determined the crack matched up precisely to his face .
A police supervisor asked Huffman why she did n't take the child to the hospital .
" Just because I did n't , " she replied .
The 8 - year - old boy then tugged on an officer 's pant leg and pointed to a piece of wood wrapped with tape .
" They hit me with that , " the boy told officers .
Another child confirmed it .
Officers then handcuffed Huffman and Dunikowski .
The other eight children did not have visible injuries .
Social workers took custody of the kids -- two girls and seven boys -- and doctors evaluated them , Forkas said .
The family has no history in Juvenile Court here , but Kentucky officials took custody of the kids several years ago , said Lynne Chavers , a Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court staff attorney .
Huffman 's mother , Betty , said she was not surprised by the allegations and is glad her daughter is in jail .
" That 's good , " Betty Huffman said from Kentucky .
" Please do n't let her get those kids back . "
Plain Dealer news researcher Jo Ellen Corrigan contributed to this story .
Two buildings , poor weather and a low - flying aircraft created the illusion that a light plane had crashed into mangroves near Darwin Harbour overnight , police say .
Several witnesses told police they had seen a light plane end up in bushes just after 6 pm , sparking a large - scale search involving the CareFlight helicopter and land - based police .
" [ We had ] seen a plane balancing on top of the mangroves , " a witness was quoted as saying in the NT News .
" It was a small five - seater plane that was balancing . "
The search was called off early this morning after no sign of the missing aircraft was found .
Duty Superintendent Mike Murphy said two buildings , bad weather and the close proximity of Darwin airport 's flight path combined to create the illusion .
" Given the environmental factors , the rainfall , the low light , mate , it would be easy to misinterpret it as a light aircraft , " he said .
" I 've actually seen it myself .
" It 's remarkable how it looks like a light aircraft pointing out into the ocean . "
He said the witnesses did the right thing by alerting emergency services to a potential accident .
A pet shop owner was prosecuted for selling a goldfish to a child after previously selling a gerbil to a teenager with learning disabilities who put it in a cup of coffee , a council said today .
A complaint was made to Trafford Council last May after the Rodent died following the purchase made by the 14 - year - old girl at the shop in Sale , Greater Manchester .
The council responded by sending a 14 - year - old boy to Majors Pets to make a test purchase of a goldfish which was sold without his age being questioned or providing any information about the care of the fish .
An animal welfare officer present also noticed a cockatiel in the store in Ashfield Road that appeared to be in distress .
A veterinary surgeon examined the bird and found it had a broken leg and eye problems .
It later had to be put down .
Shop owner Joan Higgins , 66 , and her son , Mark , 47 , pleaded guilty at Trafford Magistrates '
Court to causing unnecessary suffering to a cockatiel and selling an animal to a person under the age of 16 unaccompanied by an adult .
Mrs Higgins was fined £ 1,000 and ordered to abide by a curfew to stay in her house between 6 pm and 7 am for the next seven weeks because she was unfit for community work .
Her son , who manages the shop , was fined £ 750 and ordered to carry out 120 hours of unpaid work for the community .
Head of Public Protection at Trafford Council , Iain Veitch said : " The evidence presented for this conviction clearly demonstrates that it is irresponsible to sell animals to those who are not old enough to look after them .
" We have many responsible pet shops in the borough who provide adequate advice and care for animals .
However , let this conviction send out a message that we will not tolerate those who cause unnecessary suffering to animals .

Look past the details of a wonky discovery by a group of California scientists -- that a quantum state is now observable with the human eye -- and consider its implications :
Time travel may be feasible .
Doc Brown would be proud .
The strange discovery by quantum physicists at the University of California Santa Barbara means that an object you can see in front of you may exist simultaneously in a parallel universe -- a multi-state condition that has scientists theorizing that traveling through time may be much more than just the plaything of science fiction writers .
And it 's all because of a tiny bit of metal -- a " paddle " about the width of a human hair , an item that is incredibly small but still something you can see with the naked eye .
UC Santa Barbara 's Andrew Cleland cooled that paddle in a refrigerator , dimmed the lights and , under a special bell jar , sucked out all the air to eliminate vibrations .
He then plucked it like a tuning fork and noted that it moved and stood still at the same time .
That sounds contradictory , and it 's nearly impossible to understand if your last name is n't Einstein .
But it actually happened .
It 's a freaky fact that 's at the heart of quantum mechanics .
How Is That Possible ?
To even try to understand it , you have to think really , really small .
Smaller than an atom .
Electrons , which circle the nucleus of an atom , are swirling around in multiple states at the same time -- they 're hard to pin down .
It 's only when we measure the position of an electron that we force it to have a specific location .
Cleland 's breakthrough lies in taking that hard - to - grasp yet true fact about the atomic particle and applying it to something visible with the naked eye .
What does it all mean ?
Let 's say you 're in Oklahoma visiting your aunt .
But in another universe , where your atomic particles just can't keep up , you 're actually at home watching " The Simpsons . "
That may sound far - fetched , but it 's based on real science .
" When you observe something in one state , one theory is it split the universe into two parts , " Cleland told FoxNews.com , trying to explain how there can be multiple universes and we can see only one of them .
The multi-verse theory says the entire universe " freezes " during observation , and we see only one reality .
You see a soccer ball flying through the air , but maybe in a second universe the ball has dropped already .
Or you were looking the other way .
Or they do n't even play soccer over there .
Sean Carroll , a physicist at the California Institute of Technology and a popular author , accepts the scientific basis for the multi-verse -- even if it cannot be proven .
" Unless you can imagine some super - advanced alien civilization that has figured this out , we are n't affected by the possible existence of other universes , " Carroll said .
But he does think " someone could devise a machine that lets one universe communicate with another . "
It all comes down to how we understand time .
Carroll suggests that we do n't exactly feel time -- we perceive its passing .
For example , time moves fast on a rollercoaster and very slowly during a dull college lecture .
It races when you 're late for work . . . but the last few minutes before quitting time seem like hours .
Back to the Future
" Time seems to be a one - way street that runs from the past to the present , " says Fred Alan Wolf , a.k.a.
Dr. Quantum , a physicist and author .
" But take into consideration theories that look at the level of quantum fields ... particles that travel both forward and backward in time .
If we leave out the forward - and - backwards - in - time part , we miss out on some of the physics . "
Wolf says that time -- at least in quantum mechanics -- does n't move straight like an arrow .
It zig -zags , and he thinks it may be possible to build a machine that lets you bend time .
Consider Sergei Krikalev , the Russian astronaut who flew six space missions .
Richard Gott , a physicist at Princeton University , says Krikalev aged 1/48th of a second less than the rest of us because he orbited at very high speeds .
And to age less than someone means you 've jumped into the future -- you did not experience the same present .
In a sense , he says , Krikalev time - traveled to the future -- and back again !
" Newton said all time is universal and all clocks tick the same way , " Gott says .
" Now with Einstein 's theory of Special Relativity we know that travel into the future is possible .
With Einstein 's theory of gravity , the laws of physics as we understand them today suggest that even time travel to the past is possible in principle .
But to see whether time travel to the past can actually be realized we may have to learn new laws of physics that step in at the quantum level . "
And for that , you start with a very tiny paddle in a bell jar .
Cleland has proved that quantum mechanics scale to slightly larger sizes .
The next challenge is to learn how to control quantum mechanics and use it for even larger objects .
Do so -- and we might be able to warp to parallel universes just by manipulating a few electrons .
" Our concepts of cause and effect will fly out the window , " says Ben Bova , the science fiction author .
" People will -- for various reasons -- try to fix the past or escape into the future .
But we may never notice these effects , if the universe actually diverges .
Maybe somebody already has invented a time machine and our history is being constantly altered , but we do n’t notice the kinks in our path through time . "
Being a twin can either lead to wacky hijinks or completely suck .
The 1988 movie “ Twins ” , for example , is about a pair of unlikely twins accidentally created by scientists .
Arnold Schwarzenegger is smart and muscle-y and Danny DeVito is a grossout lowlife .
Being the “ DeVito Twin ” would suck .
But for a lot of celebrity siblings , that ’s pretty much what they are .
Here are the bottom 7 twins of celebrities .
1. Paul Diesel
That ’s probably not his real name .
But Vin Diesel ’s brother looks like if Paul Giamatti played a gay ’ 70 ’s porn star .
In other words , he looks like if Paul Giamatti played Vin Diesel .
2. Ozzie Canseco
How many times has Ozzie regretted turning down steroids ?
Well , Jose hit 462 home runs in his career .
Ozzie hit zero .
So the correct answer is 462 times .
3. Michael Kutcher
Ooff .
Ashton Kutcher ’s twin brother was punk ’d by life .
4. Patricia Bundchen
You know what would suck ?
Being a fairly - attractive Brazilian broad , but having your fucking twin sister be Gisele Bundchen , the quarterback - banging supermodel .
It would probably suck to be a non - twin sister of a supermodel .
Now imagine that , with a slight chromosomal twist , you ’d be the one who does n’t get out of bed for less than $ 10,000 .
Marsha !
Marsha !
Marsha !
5. Hunter Johansson
Lots of women would probably like to look like Scarlett Johansson .
I ’m sure Hunter would n’t mind if he ’d ended up looking exactly like her , with her exact career .
Instead he just got those glasses
6. Leslie Hamilton
Do you think that Linda Hamilton ’s identical sister cries every time she drives past the estate of James Cameron ?
And , if so , do you think Linda can feel it ?
7. Daniel Heder
One is Napoleon Dynamite .
The other is his less - successful Mormon brother .
And nobody ever says , “ Hey are n’t you the less - successful Mormon brother of Napoleon Dynamite ? ”
Water Department cuts connections to thousands of city ’s poor
Image courtesy Michigan Welfare Rights Organization
In 2006 the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization picketed the houses of Detroit city council members to protest the water department ’s decision to shut off water connections to people who could not afford to pay their bills .
By Brett Walton
Circle of Blue
Detroit ’s water utility supplied 20 percent less water in 2009 than it did in 2003 .
The obvious reasons why are a steep decline in Industrial activity and population .
Michigan ’s largest city–home to 820,000 residents , 1 million less than in 1950 – is losing 10,000 residents annually .
But a third important source of the department ’s diminishing market is that many poor residents simply can’t afford the basic service .
Thousands of Detroit residents have had their water connections cut by the city , forcing people to adopt informal methods to gain access to drinking water .
“ I ’ve been to some neighborhoods where they run a hose through the window from their neighbor ’s house , ” said Maureen Taylor , chair of the Michigan Welfare Rights Organization ( MWRO ) , which educates low - income workers and welfare recipients on social services rights .
“ I ’ve seen hoses from house to house .
I ’ve seen people with big water canisters getting water from the neighbors .
Most folks understand the situation and give a hand . ”
More than 42,000 residences in 2005 lost their connection to the city ’s water system , according to figures provided by the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department , Taylor said .
The number of homes without access has decreased since then but , according to Taylor , the exact figure remains unknown because DWSD is reluctant to provide data about the shut offs .
DWSD officials , despite requests from Circle of Blue , were not available for comment .
The drop in Detroit ’s water has prompted the city ’s water utility to increase rates to compensate for lost revenue , a response that is almost certain to accelerate the decline in water demand as homeowners and businesses cut water use to save money .
In 2008 the average annual bill increased by almost $ 55 .
Last year , the average annual bill rose to almost $ 83 .
The DWSD is considering another 9.2 percent increase in July .
Even with these changes , Detroit still has some of the least expensive water of the 20 major U.S. cities surveyed by Circle of Blue .
While many U.S. cities would see a decline in water consumption as an indication that conservation and efficiency programs are working , the drop in Detroit is one more measure of a city in peril .
On average one in six Detroit workers is jobless and in some areas half of the population is out of work , according to Taylor , who has led MWRO since 1993 .
Many people who lost their job have not been able to keep up with their utility bills , even with city and state financial assistance .
As a result , DWSD– - the third largest municipal water department in the country –suffered a $ 50 million shortfall in projected revenue before the last rate increase in July 2009 .
Meanwhile rising costs for treatment chemicals , interest rates on debt the utility already owes , and a legal settlement requiring the city ’s residents to fix sewer overflows that contaminated regional waterways have added to the utility ’s financial woes .
The finance crisis will take years to solve .
The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments , the regional research and planning agency , predicts that Detroit ’s population will hit bottom in 2020 .
Meanwhile , some city officials and academics think Detroit ’s recovery can only start when it becomes smaller .
Mayor Dave Bing talked in February about the need to relocate people within the city .
“ If they stay where they are I absolutely cannot give them all the services they require , ” Bing said according to Detroit News .
But the creative possibilities for reimagining the urban space are no consolation for those without access to water now .
“ The economy has wreaked absolute havoc in Detroit , ” Taylor said .
“ We have tens of thousands of people in the city right now without water .
It is unreal . ”

The free , open - source Scratch programming language , developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab by a team led by Mitchel Resnick , has found great popularity around the world as a way for young people ( and adults ) to learn about programming by manipulating colorful onscreen modules to create games , slideshows , interactive storybooks and other creative projects .
More than a million such projects have been uploaded to the Scratch website for public sharing .
But Apple this month , in a decision that immediately stirred controversy , rejected an App ( developed independently by a programmer in Canada ) that would allow viewing of these projects on iPhones and iPads .
In an interview with MIT News , Resnick shared his thoughts about Apple ’s move — and what might happen next .
Q . What is your reaction to the decision by Apple not to allow this Scratch viewer on iPads and iPhones ?
A . We on the Scratch team are disappointed at Apple ’s decision .
Our feeling is that it ’s especially important for young people to have the opportunity to design , create and express themselves with new interactive media technologies — not just to view these things , but to create them and interact with them .
We think it should be open to as many people as possible , and we ’re interested in finding ways for people to design and share interactive media on all types of platforms , not just the iPad and the iPhone .
It ’s important for all platforms to support these opportunities .
Right now , it ’s a viewer that was not allowed , but over time we certainly would want to have the opportunity to include the ability to create interactive media on these platforms .
From this decision , it would seem like they ’re not going to allow that .
Q. Is it purely a matter of Apple ’s policies , or are there also technical difficulties in bringing the full Scratch programming system to platforms like smart phones and tablets ?
A. Apple does n't allow languages like Flash or Java , and it does n't allow apps that interpret or execute code
If you want kids to be able to create Scratch projects , there is no technical issue , it ’s just Apple ’s policies .
We ’ve done some work on a Flash version of Scratch — it ’s not finished , but if Apple decided to allow Flash , we could make a version of Scratch for the iPad .
Q . Have you had any contact with Apple about the company ’s decision ?
A. I have n’t personally .
The specific Scratch viewer — we did n’t create that , it was done independently .
The person who created it has had some interaction , and he has informed us about that .
Over time , as we move farther along in creating our own versions , we may contact them .
We 're working on developing a new generation , which we call Scratch 2.0 .
We ’ve started to get some funding .
It will be able to do authoring inside web browsers , so you do n’t have to do uploading and downloading [ the present version requires users to download the software before creating projects ] .
We ’d certainly prefer to do versions that could run across lots of platforms without needing conversion , so I think any restrictions on all kinds of platforms , not just Apple ’s , could influence what we decide [ on whether to use Flash or another language to create this version ] .
Our goal is to have the full range of capabilities of the existing version , plus more .
By creating programs online , it allows you to do new things , like having it integrate with social media .
For example , the program could react in a particular way when someone writes on my Facebook wall , or it could directly send out a Tweet , or could pull real - time data from the web such as a weather forecast or the latest baseball statistics .
There are a variety of new features we expect it could have .
grep and ack are indispensable tools , but they do n’t know ruby .
That ’s where
RubyScope comes in .
RubyScope lets you search your codebase for classes , methods , variables , and more .
It understands ruby .
For instance you could use it to find all of your test methods :
ruby_scope - R -- def '/ ^test /'
~/SecretProject
That would match :
def test_failing assert false end
But it would skip this :
# TODO : test this later def suspect_method test = 1 / 0 end
Installing
RubyScope is available as a normal gem :
gem install ruby_scope
Alternatively , you can get the source from GitHub :
git clone git://github.com/adamsanderson/ruby_scope.git
If you pull the source , install with rake install .
Examples
Here are some other examples of things you can do with RubyScope .
Find all the places the variable name is assigned :
ruby_scope - R -- assign ' name ' .
Find any place that cake is mentioned in the code base , this could be a variable , a method call , a symbol , or any other bit of ruby code :
ruby_scope - R -- any ' cake ' .
I often want to know where a method was defined :
ruby_scope - R -- def ' save_or_fail ' .
If you ’re not afraid of writing a SexpPath query you can even define custom queries :
ruby_scope -- custom 's ( : call , s( :ivar , atom ) , : save , _ ) '
That will find all of the places save is called on an instance variable ,
@post.save for instance .
Why
Ruby is a great language , it ’s very flexible , but sometimes that can be annoying .
These are all the same :
a = 1 / 0.0 ( a = 1/0.0 ) a = 1 / 0.0
Meanwhile it can be quite frustrating to be looking for where a got assigned this ridiculous value , and have to wade through all the different places a is used .
This also served as a first step towards common code completion and refactoring tools that could be used by any ruby editor .
Hacking RubyScope
Want to play with ruby_scope ?
Take a look at cli.rb , this is where all the queries are actually generated .
Have an idea for a better caching mechanism ?
Look at sexp_cache.rb .
Want to change how the hits are reported ?
Take a look at scanner.rb

As most followers of the current “ prom season ” are aware , Constance McMillen was barred by her high school from wearing a tux and bringing her girlfriend to her senior prom at Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton , Mississippi .
The school district maintained that girls must wear dresses and could only be accompanied by boys as dates .
When the ACLU won a preliminary ruling finding the school had violated Constance ’s first amendment rights to expression the school district responded not by opening up the prom to tux - wearing , girlfriend - bringing Constance , but instead canceled the prom .
Nice .
Seems to be the Mississippi way of dealing with court - ordered prohibitions on discrimination : remember when the city of Jackson , Mississippi was ordered in the 1960s to desegregate the public pools and in response closed all the pools ?
I ’ve been following the litigation in this case , not only because I am generally interested in the struggles of gender - warriors such as Constance , but also because of the strategy decisions being made by the lawyers handling her case .
In their demand letter to the school district ( something lawyers do before bringing an actual lawsuit ) the ACLU lawyers and their pro bono counsel at Kramer Levin made three arguments : first that students have a First Amendment right to bring a date of the same sex to the prom ; second that students have an equal protection right not to be discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation ; and third that Title IX , the federal law that prohibits public schools from discriminating on the basis of sex , includes discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes , including students who express gender non-conforming behavior such as a girl who wishes to wear a tuxedo rather than a dress .
Yet the complaint they filed in the case only raised the First Amendment expression claim – the sexual orientation discrimination and gender - stereotyping claims were dropped .
Now , I ’m sensitive to the strategic decisions that lawyers have to make about avoiding making bad law in a conservative jurisdiction such as Mississippi , and for that reason I get it that they did n’t make the sexual orientation discrimination claim , but I ’m more concerned about dropping the Title IX gender stereotyping cause of action .
My concern is that the issues in the case might become overdetermined by Candice ’s sexual orientation , that is , that bringing a female date and wanting to wear a tux are things that only lesbians want to do .
But of course the sex of her date and the kind of clothes she wants to wear are in some respect independent of one another – at least as one is thinking about the nature of the legal issues at stake .
A girl should n’t have to be a lesbian to refuse to wear a dress to school o r to school parties .
Thus the tux claim is one in which all girls / women have a stake regardless of their sexual orientation ( as do all boys / men ) .
There is a risk in dropping the gender - based claim that the tux issue will be seen as an epiphenomenon of the orientation issue .
And that ’s sort of what happened in the judge ’s preliminary opinion in the case .
The ACLU argued , and the judge held , that with respect to Constance ’s desire to bring a female date to the prom the Constitution protects a student ’s “ expression of one ’s identity and affiliation to unique social groups ” as a kind of “ speech ” as envisioned by the First Amendment .
Denying her the right to attend the prom with her female date thus amounted to a form of censorship of her peaceful expression of social and political viewpoints central to her sexuality .
( For the moment I ’ll hold back my observations about the perils of framing her orientation as “ expression ” and her desire to bring a female date to the prom as the articulation of a viewpoint “ central to her sexuality , ” as opposed to seeing it as her sexuality itself .
You can see that this claim is very different from an equality claim that would argue that she was discriminated against on the basis of her identity , not on the basis of her expression of her identity . )
Having considered the “ female date ” issue , the judge went on to consider the “ tux ” issue under the First Amendment .
The judge does a pretty good job of treating the choice of clothing as a form of protected expression independent from the orientation issue , framing the issue as : “ Constance requested permission to wear a tuxedo , or even pants and a nice shirt , to her prom with the intent of communicating to the school community her social and political views that women should not be constrained to wear clothing that has traditionally been deemed “ female ” attire . ”
This would n’t be my way of framing the issue , since I would not want the protection of the Constitution to turn on the nature of her expressive intent in wearing the tux – what if she just thought she looked totally stylin ’ in a suit , or her girlfriend thought she was really hot in a cumberbun , or she liked wearing a jacket and pants because they had pockets , which formal dresses never do , or for any other silly or profound reason ?
Perhaps more importantly , the boys did not have to have a particular expressive motivation for their decision to wear a tux , only the gender - nonconforming person does on this reasoning .
In effect , this is the cost of dropping the gender - stereotyping claim and instead shoe - horning the clothing claim into the First Amendment .
The point should not be the legitimacy of Constance ’s reason for wanting to wear a tux , but rather the illegitimacy of the school district ’s reason for denying her the right to do so .
Finally , the judge concludes , with respect to the tux claim , “ the record shows Constance has been openly gay since eighth grade and she intended to communicate a message by wearing a tuxedo and to express her identity through attending prom with a same - sex date . ”
Oops – here we see the tux issue turning back into the orientation issue .
That ’s a kind of slippage we ’d want to avoid in this case .
It ’s a good thing that the judge found a Constitutional problem with the school district ’s policy on opposite sex dates and gender conforming clothing , and the issues will be argued and decided more fully in a trial at some future point – but I wish the judge had more to work with than merely the First Amendment expression cause of action .
In the meantime , it was announced yesterday that Constance McMillen has been chosen to be the Grand Marshall of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Pride parade this year .
How fabulous .
Wonder what she ’ll wear ??

Some of this traffic coursing through new channels passes through public peering points like Mr. Pozar’s .
And some flows through so - called dark networks , private channels created to move information more cheaply and efficiently within a business or any kind of organization .
For instance , Google has privately built such a network so that video and search data need not pass through so many points to get to customers .
By its very nature , Internet networking technology is intended to support anarchic growth .
Unlike earlier communication networks , the Internet is not controlled from the top down .
This stems from an innovation at the heart of the Internet — packet switching .
From the start , the information moving around the Internet was broken up into so - called packets that could be sent on different paths to one destination where the original message — whether it was e-mail , an image or sound file or instructions to another computer — would be put back together in its original form .
This packet - switching technology was conceived in the 1960s in England and the United States .
It made delivery of a message through a network possible even if one or many of the nodes of the network failed .
Indeed , this resistance to failure or attack was at the very core of the Internet , part of the essential nature of an organic , interconnected communications web with no single control point .
During the 1970s , a method emerged to create a network of networks .
The connections depended on a communication protocol , or set of rules , known as TCP / IP , a series of letters familiar to anyone who has tried to set up their own wireless network at home .
The global network of networks , the Internet , transformed the world , and continues to grow without central planning , extending itself into every area of life , from Facebook to cyberwar .
Everyone agrees that the shape of the network is changing rapidly , driven by a variety of factors , including content delivery networks that have pushed both data and applications to the edge of the network ; the growing popularity of smartphones leading to the emergence of the wireless Internet ; and the explosion of streaming video as the Internet ’s predominant data type .
“ When we started releasing data publicly , we measured it in petabytes of traffic , ” said Doug Webster , a Cisco Systems market executive who is responsible for an annual report by the firm that charts changes in the Internet .
“ Then a couple of years ago we had to start measuring them in zettabytes , and now we ’re measuring them in what we call yottabytes . ”
One petabyte is equivalent to one million gigabytes .
A zettabyte is a million petabytes .
And a yottabyte is a thousand zettabytes .
The company estimates that video will account for 90 percent of all Internet traffic by 2013 .
UAW membership continues to plummet
By Jerry White
1 April 2010
The United Auto Workers union lost another 76,000 members last year , bringing its total membership to 355,000 .
This is the lowest level since the late 1930s , just after the fledgling organization had won recognition at General Motors .
UAW membership fell by 18 percent in 2009 , according to the union ’s annual report filed Monday with the US Department of Labor .
The losses were chiefly the result of the tens of thousands of job cuts the UAW accepted under the terms of the Obama administration ’s forced bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler .
The UAW will lose another 4,600 members next week when the former GM - Toyota plant in Fremont , California , closes its doors , eliminating the last auto assembly factory on the US West Coast .
UAW membership has fallen by nearly half since 2001 , when it had 701,818 members .
Since reaching its peak of 1.53 million members in 1979 , the union has lost 1.14 million members , or 77 percent of its membership .
The UAW largest local is no longer Local 600 at Ford ’s River Rouge complex in Dearborn , Michigan , but a unit representing state public employees — which is also losing members due to state budget cuts .
According to the Detroit News , the UAW shut down 50 locals last year , reducing the total from 800 to 750 , as plants closed and the organization ’s Detroit headquarters consolidated locals to cut costs .
Michigan , long the center of the UAW , saw thousands of job losses in 2009 and continues to have the highest jobless rate in the nation .
The restructuring of the auto industry — which has led to more than a 70 percent decline in Michigan ’s auto - related employment since 1989 — and the economic downturn over the last two years have led to sharp falloff in the membership of the UAW and other unions .
The number of union members in Michigan fell by 60,000 last year .
Earlier in the year , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of unionized hourly and salaried workers in the US declined by 771,000 to 15.3 million in 2009 .
Only 12.3 percent of all US workers were unionized — including just 7.2 percent in the private sector , compared to 35.7 percent of private sector workers in 1953 and 22 percent as late as 1979 .
The disintegration of the UAW — a process that has been duplicated by trade unions throughout the US and in country after country — is the result of the reactionary policies and nationalist outlook that has long guided this organization .
The UAW emerged in the mass social upheavals of the 1930s , including the sit - down strikes in Flint and Detroit .
By the 1940s , however , the socialist and other left - wing militants who pioneered the building of the UAW were purged from its leadership by the Reuther bureaucracy , which consolidated the UAW on the basis of an explicit defense of the capitalist system and an alliance with the Democratic Party .
Having tied the fate of the working class to what the UAW leadership perceived as the permanent dominance of American capitalism in the world economy , the UAW reacted to the rising challenge by Asian and European automakers in the 1980s and the globalization of auto production by abandoning any resistance to the attack on jobs and living standards and imposing the dictates of corporate management .
In the name of increasing the “ competitiveness ” of the Detroit automakers the UAW suppressed every struggle against plant closings , mass layoffs and the unending demands for concessions .
The culmination of its corporatist program of “ labor - management partnership ” and “ Buy American ” nationalism was its collaboration with the Obama administration in the restructuring and drastic cost - cutting at GM and Chrysler .
Over the past four years the UAW forced tens of thousands of older , higher - paid workers to leave the industry through so - called buyouts and agreed to contracts with GM , Chrysler and Ford that would put labor costs in line with Asian producers operating nonunion plants in the US South by reducing the wages of younger new hires by half .
In addition , the UAW relieved the auto companies of billions in health care obligations owed to more than 1 million retirees and their dependents .
As the dues - based income of the UAW apparatus declined , it increasingly sought alternative means to secure the financial position and privileges of the army of union executives that run the organization .
In exchange for its collaboration with the auto companies and the White House , the UAW was granted a substantial ownership stake of the US automakers , including 55 percent of Chrysler and 17.5 percent of GM , and essentially transformed itself into a business enterprise .
Despite the continuing hemorrhaging of its membership rolls last year , the UAW suffered only a small decline in net worth , the Labor Department reported .
UAW assets were worth $ 1.13 billion in 2009 , down slightly from $ 1.2 billion the year before .
On Tuesday , the UAW carried out a sale — conducted by Deutsche Bank Securities — of 362 million warrants in Ford Motor stock , representing an 11 percent ownership stake in the company .
Ford issued the warrants — certificates entitling the bearer to buy securities at a given price — to the UAW in December , after the organization relieved Ford of $ 13.6 billion in medical cost obligations to 200,000 retirees and their spouses .
The sale was expected to raise $ 1.3 billion for the UAW - controlled retiree health care trust fund , known as the Voluntary Employees ’ Beneficiary Association or VEBA .
Commenting on the sale , the Financial Times of London wrote , “ The union ’s move to cash in the warrants comes after Ford ’s share price has surged over the past year amid growing optimism about the company ’s chances of emerging successfully from the crisis in its industry . ”
The UAW has a direct financial stake in driving up the value of Ford shares through increasing the exploitation of auto workers and imposing further cost - cutting measures on its so - called members .
This only underscores the fact that auto workers can only defend themselves by breaking with this rotten organization and building a powerful political movement in opposition to the profit system and its defenders in the union apparatus .
Opera has one of the most rapid browser release schedules and 10.5 is now available — just in time for Microsoft ’s EU browser choice screen .
You ’ll need to download it from Opera.com , although automatic updates from previous versions will appear shortly .
Opera 10.5 is a significant update — other browser vendors would have bumped up the major version number .
Here ’s what you can expect :
excellent W3C standards support
a private browsing mode
native widgets — independent applications which continue to work when the browser is n’t running
a new interface
a new JavaScript and graphics engine — Opera claim it ’s the fastest browser on Earth .
These last two aspects are the biggest changes …
Stunning Surfing
Opera ’s always been one of the better - looking browsers , but Jon Hicks has made 10.5 look glorious .
The most noticeable change is the Chrome - like removal of the title bar and menu .
The red ‘ O’ icon can be clicked to access the most frequently - used options and show the menu bar if you want it .
The whole interface can be configured to your taste .
Icons can be added and removed , panels can be re-arranged , and even the window color can be changed .
It ’s also the first non-Microsoft browser to offer a fully - integrated Windows 7 / Vista experience with Aero , jumplists and taskbar tab support .
It ’s a welcome addition and many users will appreciate the productivity benefits .
Finally , Opera has removed the irritating modal dialog boxes and replaced them with page overlays or panels .
“ Find in Page ” is the best I ’ve seen — it dims the page content and highlights all instances of the word .
I expect competing browsers will replicate that feature soon .
Superior Speed
Although it has a reputation for speed , Google Chrome appeared to overtake Opera during the past year .
Opera is making bold claims about their new Carakan JavaScript engine .
I tested it using the SunSpider benchmark and Opera came out top .
It was only 1 % faster than Chrome , but more than twice as fast as Firefox 3.6 .
JavaScript benchmarks do n’t tell the whole story and your experience could be different , but the engine is certainly one of the quickest .
Every vendor claims their browser is the fastest — even Microsoft — and “ proof ” can be offered with tests that exploit known optimizations .
However , one of the best independent reviews of the top five browsers is available at Tom ’s Hardware .
In summary :
Opera and Chrome come out top , but Chrome just edges ahead with more second places .
Opera is especially fast when handling plugins such as Flash , Silverlight and Java .
YouTube pages load are almost twice as fast as Firefox and three times faster than Chrome .
Opera ’s memory usage is higher for a single tab , although the differences reduce as more tabs are opened .
Forget the charts , though .
Browser margins in most of the tests are measured in milliseconds and the differences will be imperceivable .
What matters is how fast the browser feels to you on your machine .
In my experience , Opera is more than a match for Chrome and it offers far more features .
Is Opera “ the fastest browser on Earth ” ?
I find no reason to dispute their claim .
Switch Straightaway ?
OK , so Opera ’s fast .
It looks fabulous .
It has more features out of the box than any competitor .
It offers great developer tools .
Standards support is excellent and it ’s usually the first to pass ACID tests .
And almost every aspect of the browser can customized or configured .
Yet it ’s not my default browser .
Opera retains a tiny 2 % market share which has barely changed during the past decade .

Have you switched to Opera 10.5 ?

Alternative MSSC Prom Open To All Students Will Be Held May 8
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
ABERDEEN , MS – A Mississippi federal court today ruled that school officials violated a lesbian student ’s First Amendment rights when it canceled the high school prom rather than let the student attend with her girlfriend .
The U.S. Court for the Northern District of Mississippi stopped short of ordering Itawamba Agricultural High School to put the school prom back on the calendar because of assurances that an alternative “ private ” prom being planned by parents would be open to all students .
The American Civil Liberties Union had requested a preliminary injunction stopping the Itawamba County School District from canceling the prom and from prohibiting Constance McMillen from bringing her girlfriend as a date and wearing a tuxedo to the event .
“ It feels really good that the court realized that the school was violating my rights and discriminating against me by canceling the prom .
All I ever wanted was for my school to treat me and my girlfriend like any other couple that wants to go to prom , ” said McMillen , an 18 - year - old senior at Itawamba Agricultural High School in Fulton , Mississippi .
“ Now we can all get back to things like picking out our prom night outfits and thinking about corsages . ”
In the 12 - page ruling , the court wrote , “ The record shows Constance has been openly gay since eighth grade and she intended to communicate a message by wearing a tuxedo and to express her identity through attending prom with a same - sex date .
The Court finds this expression and communication of her viewpoint is the type of speech that falls squarely within the purview of the First Amendment .
The Court is also of the opinion that the motive behind the School Board 's cancellation of the prom , or withdrawal of their sponsorship , was Constance ’s requests and the ACLU ’s demand letter sent on her behalf . ”
Further , the court says that since the school represented the private prom being organized by parents at a furniture store as open to all students , then the court expects that event will indeed invite McMillen and her girlfriend .
McMillen said that she plans to attend the “ private ” prom , but has also long planned to attend the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition ’s Second Chance Prom , to be held Saturday , May 8 in Tupelo .
That event , sponsored by Green Day , Tonic.com , Iron Chef Cat Cora , and Lance Bass , among others , will be open to all LGBT students in the state , as well as straight students who are LGBT - supportive .
The MSSC and the ACLU deal every year with complaints from LGBT students all over Mississippi who face resistance from their schools about bringing same - sex dates to proms or who do n’t feel safe going to their own school proms .
“ Today ’s ruling is n’t just a win for Constance and her girlfriend – it ’s a win for all the students at her school , and for all lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender students who just want to be able to be themselves at school without being treated unfairly , ” said Kristy Bennett , Legal Director of the ACLU of Mississippi .
“ Public schools ca n’t just stomp on students ’ free expression rights just because they do n't want to deal with these students , and if schools do try to do that they ’ll be dealing with us . ”
“ We are grateful and happy that IAHS ’s attempt to cancel the prom has been seen for the thinly - veiled ruse to violate Constance McMillen ’s First Amendment rights that we always knew it was , ” said Christine P. Sun , Senior Counsel with the ACLU national LGBT Project , who represents McMillen along with the ACLU of Mississippi .
“ These school officials should be ashamed of themselves for trying to scapegoat a young girl and then trying to lay the blame for their bad behavior at her feet . ”
McMillen ’s case attracted national attention and dozens of offers to host or help fund an alternative independent prom from around the country after school officials announced they were canceling the IAHS prom .
The school board canceled IAHS ’ prom shortly after the ACLU and the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition demanded that the district reverse its decision to prohibit McMillen from attending the prom with her girlfriend , also a student at IAHS .
According to McMillen , school officials told her that she could not arrive at the prom with her girlfriend and that they might be thrown out if any other students complained about their presence at the April 2 event .
Since McMillen ’s case was filed , a Facebook page set up for her case has attracted over 400,000 supporters to date .
McMillen is represented by Bennett and Sun , as well as by Norman C. Simon and Joshua Glick of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP , and Alysson Mills of New Orleans .
The case name is Constance McMillen v. Itawamba County School District , et al .
Additional information is available at https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/fulton-ms-prom-discrimination.
There is also a Facebook group for people who want to support McMillen , “ Let Constance Bring Her Girlfriend to the Prom , ” at http://www.facebook.com/pages/Let-Constance-Take-Her-Girlfriend-to-Prom/357686784817.
The Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition was formed in the fall of 2008 to address discrimination faced by lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender students , or students perceived to be LGBT , in Mississippi public schools and colleges .
The MSSC works closely with the ACLU of Mississippi to educate teachers , students , and administrators about the rights of LGBT students with the aim of making schools safer for all .
The MSSC is youth - led , and any questions about student rights at prom , starting a gay - straight alliance club , or any other safe schools issues can be directed to Ashley Jackson , facilitator , at ashley@mssafeschools.org .
More information about MSSC and the Second Chance Prom can be found at the Mississippi Safe Schools Coalition website at http://mssafeschools.org/.

The first mirror segment of the James Webb Space Telescope , the all - purpose instrument that will take the mantle of " most awesome " telescope from Hubble in 2014 , is polished .
There are 18 mirror segments to go , but it still marked a milestone on the telescope 's march towards flight - readiness .
The huge mirrors require incredible precision for collecting the tiny amounts of photons arriving at Earth from distant objects .
Even the tiniest mistakes can kill the performance of a telescope .
Recall that an erroneously polished mirror fouled up Hubble 's launch .
The telescope got into orbit before researchers realized that things were n't working quite right .
It took a separate Shuttle mission – STS - 61 – to get the telescope working properly .
Clearly , NASA does n't want a repeat of that experience , so the agency and its contractors are taking special care polishing up its latest space observatory .
This time around , everyone is taking their own measurements .
" For validation purposes , we ’re planning four sets of completely different cross checks and verification tests to authenticate the outcome of the mirror cryotests , " said Scott Texter , Northrop Grumman Webb Optical Telescope Element Manager .
" If any discrepancies surface , we can then investigate and re-verify . "

Female sex tourism : for love or money ?
In a series of stories , GlobalPost looks at the women of means who find " romance " on vacation from Jamaica to Jordan to West Africa .
DAKAR , Senegal — Women — often white , European and " of a certain age " — flock solo to Senegal 's shores year - round for what one hotel manager called " the three ' S 's : sun , sea and sex . "
The growth of Senegal 's female sex tourism has its roots in poverty and the lack of jobs for the country 's young men .
Senegal 's unemployment for youths is estimated at 30 percent , according to the International Labor Organization , and the average person in Senegal earns about $ 3 a day , according to the World Bank .
“ It ’s a question of survival .
Life is hard .
If I did n’t have these women , I ’d be struggling , " said Moussa , a 31 - year - old dreadlocked drum player who has been " dating " female tourists since 2003 .
“ The women come here alone .
They hit on you , and you go with it , ” Moussa said .
“ They like men with rastas who play the djembes [ drums ] .
It ’s part of the ambiance . ”
" Besides , " he added with a sly smile , " they know men who play the drums are powerful in bed . "
Moussa flipped through a stack of photos .
In one image , an overweight , Spanish woman — his first " girlfriend " — has her arms around his small frame .
She gave him $ 500 , he said , before heading home .
Another photo is a self - taken shot of him with an Italian woman who he said gave him the $ 650 to open his souvenir shop in Dakar where we now sit , drinking spicy Touba coffee .
He pointed out the gifts tourists send him : CDs , USB drives , a guitar , an MP3 player and a DVD player .
“ I do n’t ask for money , " he said .
" We go out .
They pay for everything .
We have sex .
Before they leave , they give me a bit cash to help me out . "
Some call it male prostitution , while others say it 's just women doing what middle - aged men have been doing for centuries :
Taking up with someone half their age and giving that new friend an all - expenses - paid ride in exchange for sex and a new lease on life .
Moussa meets tourists primarily through referrals and friends of friends .
He sees himself as “ a tourism guide who offers some extra services , ” that include sex and at times helping male tourists negotiate evenings with female prostitutes .
But , others in Senegal say it is not that innocent .
It 's exploitation on both sides , they say , and sex tourism has sullied the country 's reputation and corrupted its youth .
But , closing up his shop back in Dakar to head off to drum practice , Moussa said he 's not worried about what other people think .
" I have n't met her yet , " he said , " The woman who 's not so old , who loves me , who 's willing to do anything .
The woman who will get me a visa and a plane ticket out of here . "
The resort town of Saly , on the Atlantic coast , 55 miles south of Dakar , bears the dubious distinction as the epicenter of sex tourism in Senegal .
Middle - aged and elderly female tourists are a quick payday for young men — often called gigolos or antiquaires , originally souvenir vendors — who work out shirtless on the beaches and preen in the nightclubs .
It 's a hustle , locals said , and the older the woman , the better .
Last spring , the French news program , " 66 Minutes , " investigated female sex tourism in Saly and the growing number of marriages between European women and local men , often with vast age differences .
Going undercover , female reporters recorded via hidden camera the young men propositioning them on the beach .
They later translated discussions the men had with each other in Wolof , Senegal 's main ethnic language .
" You found yourself some clients ...
When I got here , I saw immediately that you had spotted these two white ladies , " said one guy walking past a friend who is chatting up the reporters .
" Get a move on .
Leave me alone .
Let me work , " he snapped back .
Needless to say , Saly 's residents were not pleased with the story 's release and have become rather wary of the media .
It was a Saturday around 1 a.m. — Valentine 's Day , no less — when I first ventured into Les Etages , a nightclub that opened two years ago and has become a veritable hunting ground for tourists — male and female — on the prowl .
Inside , female prostitutes , some wearing more makeup than clothes , ringed the club 's perimeter .
The club 's strobe lights skittered across a stout , middle - aged woman 's smiling face , pressed against a young Senegalese man 's chest .
Similar couples moved on the packed dance floor .
A petite woman , her dry chin - length bob bleached almost the same color as her tan tube top , inched out on the dance floor with a stiff side - step .
A tall , dapper Senegalese man in a blue dress shirt and pressed jeans approached and they began to dance , palms pressed together between them .
The DJ switched to salsa , and the man pulled her in .
Over the course of two songs , his hands drifted from her shoulder blades to the small of her back .
They were swaying in unison , pelvises pressed together .
The only thing separating them now was about 25 years .
Locals are n’t sure if sex tourism has actually increased in Saly or if it has simply become more visible in recent years .
Senegalese tourism has grown from modest numbers in the 1970s when the first Club Med opened on the coast .
More than 500,000 tourists came to Senegal last year , according to government statistics .
It is a key economic activity for the country of 12 million with a GDP of $ 13 billion .
Emphasizing the importance of tourism in Senegal , President Abdoulaye Wade set a goal of attracting 1.5 million tourists in 2010 .
However , those working in the tourism industry say that figure is still far - off and blame the world economic crisis and rising airfare costs for a recent downturn in visitors .
But the female tourists looking for romance are still coming .
There are no figures about how many indulge in sex tourism , but there are enough to support nightclubs like Les Etages .
Hotel manager Cheikh Ba said arriving guests ask him where Les Etages is before asking about the beach or even getting their room keys .
“ That gives you an idea of why they ’re here , ” Ba said .
“ Some people say the sex brings Europeans to Saly .
They do n’t want to say anything bad about it , but I say it is ruining this town . ”
Peak season in Saly is between November and April .
Hotel managers complain of the downturn in business .
They say some tourists now prefer to rent vacation homes where they can go about their business in private .
Female sex tourism is often referred to as “ love tourism , ” and becomes a lifestyle for some women who make frequent trips to see a regular boyfriend or simply play the field .
Some see it as companionship with the promise of a pay - off at the end , but Ba and other Saly residents said it ’s just plain old sex for money .
“ You have no job , no nothing , and you see your friend living in a house and driving a car that his European girlfriend bought him , ” Ba said , “ She comes every month or so to visit and sends him money .
You say to yourself , well , I could do that too . "
Pape does not live in luxury .
The 30 - year - old has a job in Dakar that pays him $ 250 a month .
Half his paycheck goes to rent and he stretches the other half to cover his living expenses and to send funds to his elderly mother in Ivory Coast .
Pape 's friends and family do n’t know about his 52 - year - old Dutch girlfriend .
They also do n’t know about the gifts and $ 250 cash infusions she sends him , sometimes three times a month .
" I'm a thing , her object , her toy , her property , " he said .
" If I had the choice financially , I would n't date her .
I would never have started this . "
Chain - smoking and downing two beers , Pape , started from the beginning .
He met the Dutch woman while working in Senegal ’s southern Casamance region last January .
She was there on vacation .
They were staying in the same hotel .
" When I came back and went to sleep , she would knock on the door , ” he said .
“ One night , she invited me into her room .
I refused .
It was weird .
It was my friends who explained to me that she was interested . "
When he returned to Dakar , she cried .
Though hesitant , Pape agreed to meet her the next weekend in Zigunchor , a coastal city in Casamance .
" We went out that night .
When we got back to the hotel , what was going to happen happened , ” he said with a shrug .
" She 's well - preserved , considering her age . ”
" I 've never asked her , but I think she was there for sex , " he said .
" I 'm afraid to ask . ”
Since then , they Skype and talk on the phone .
During her most recent visit last month , they traveled along the coast , passing through Saly .
" I saw quite a few young men there with old , white women .
I began to question my morality .
What are you doing with this old woman ?
She could be your mom .
You 've become a gigolo , someone who does n't have ambition , someone who is ready to do anything for money , ” he said .
When she left , Pape said he felt only relief .
" I'm not attracted to her , ” he said .

Just look for the robot pig singing country music and you 'll find Porky 's , the traveling carnival - grub vendor currently in Miami at the Dade County Fair & Expo .
The Indiana company 's claim to fame is its ice - cream - sundae style concoction of pulled pork , mashed potatoes , and barbecue sauce served in a big see - through cup and called the Pork Parfait .
The gypsy woman at the cash register 's story ( besides getting picked up in Bullhead City , Arizona 15 years ago ) is , " The boss just set there and wondered what he could do , and this is what he came up with .
People love it .
The first time we did it was in Indiana .
The food critic for the newspaper gave it five stars and we got bombarded .
We actually ran out of pulled pork that day .
And we been doing it all over the country ever since . "
It 's a smart product for the fair because it 's easy to eat while walking .
The strong visual works to its advantage as well .
Ironically , the food industry often uses mashed potatoes as a photographic substitute for ice cream because it does n't melt .

The number of Texans who could identify Victor Carrillo , or describe what he does as the chairman of the three - member Railroad Commission , is no doubt far smaller than the turnout in Tuesday ’s Republican primary .
But Carrillo believes his name nonetheless provoked a strong reaction — a prejudice against Hispanics that cost him his bid for reelection .
By all rights , the incumbent should have crushed his even - lesser - known and ill - financed opponent David Porter , an accountant from Midland .
Instead , Porter won in a landslide , hauling in 60 percent of the vote .
Carrillo — who had been a petroleum geophysicist , attorney , Abilene City Councilman , and a Taylor County Judge — was appointed in 2003 by Rick Perry to the Railroad Commission , which , despite its obscure name and profile , wields tremendous power :
It has regulatory jurisdiction over the oil and gas industry , pipeline transporters , the natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline industry , natural gas utilities , the LP - gas industry , and coal and uranium surface mining operations .
The next year , with the governor 's backing , he easily won statewide election .
This cycle , he spent more than $ 620,000 on his losing campaign , according to state records .
Porter , a political unknown , spent $ 33,000 on the race .
Carrillo issued a long statement Wednesday afternoon making clear his frustration over the outcome of the race .
“ Early polling showed that the typical GOP primary voter has very little info about the position of Railroad Commissioner , what we do , or who my opponent or I were .
Given the choice between ' Porter ' and ' Carrillo ' — unfortunately , the Hispanic - surname was a serious setback from which I could never recover although I did all in my power to overcome this built - in bias .
I saw it last time ( in the 2004 election ) , but was able to win because the ' non- Carrillo ' vote was spread among three Anglo GOP primary opponents instead of just one . ”
Porter disagreed , calling Carrillo ’s statement a case of “ sour grapes . ”
“ I do n’t think ( Carrillo ’s ethnicity ) played much of a factor , if any , " Porter said .
" Sure , you might find somebody that did n’t vote for him because he ’s Hispanic , but then you ’d probably find somebody else who did vote for him because he ’s Hispanic .
Quite honestly , I think I caught some anti-incumbency fever .
But , also , nobody really knew who he was .
I spent a lot of time talking to people , and nobody could name the third member of the Railroad Commission , even in oil towns . ”
The incumbent ’s defeat , while in some ways shocking , was in other ways illustrative of the challenges the GOP faces in cementing a Hispanic base — a necessity for long - term success in a state predicted to be majority Hispanic in the near future , said William Lutz , managing editor of the Lone Star Report , a conservative newsletter .
Though Hispanic Republican candidates often fare well in local races , Lutz said , they still face steep obstacles running statewide , especially in Republican primaries .
( He noted that the converse can be true in Democratic primaries , where Hispanic surnames draw votes to candidates who otherwise would not run as strong . )
Lutz called Carrillo ’s loss “ tragic , ” saying he was “ one of the more qualified people to sit on the Railroad Commission in recent times . ”
His defeat evoked memories of that of Xavier Rodriguez , who was appointed by Perry to the Texas Supreme Court in 2001 but was defeated by challenger Steven Wayne Smith in 2002 — again , despite outspending the upstart by a huge margin .
In that race , however , some voters were energized to vote for Smith because of his involvement as an attorney in Hopwood v. Texas , a case that challenged affirmative action policies at the University of Texas Law School .
“ The Victor Carrillo defeat is a lot harder to explain , ” Lutz said .
In addition to Carrillo ’s own analysis — that the only reason he won in 2004 was that white candidates split the vote against him —
Lutz posited that he was hurt by the intense governor ’s campaign .
It both robbed him of Perry ’s attention , in money and public support , along with voters ’ attention , which was drawn to the marquee race .
Another reality is that the vast majority of Republican turnout in primaries is white , said Mike Baselice , the founder and CEO of the Austin - based polling firm Baselice & Associates .
Baselice , who counts Gov. Perry among his clents , argues that the GOP has done fairly well at winning Hispanic support in general elections , drawing up to 35 percent of the Hispanic vote .
“ The problem in Republican primaries is that only about 7 percent of the voters who turn have Hispanic surnames , ” he said .
Matthew Dowd , a chief strategist to the 2004 presidential campaign of George Bush , said the results speak for themselves .
“ If his name had been Victor Carlton , he would have won .
I do n’t think anybody can argue with that , ” he said .
“ It was n’t like Porter had framed him , had done a bunch of negative stuff on him , and said , ' This is who he is . '
Nobody knew either candidate . ”
California insurer backs away from 39 % hike
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Anthem Blue Cross has withdrawn its request to increase premiums by as much as 39 % for its California customers , citing provisions in the new health care reform law .
Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care law , commercial insurers must maintain an 80 % " medical loss ratio " for individual insurance policies beginning January 2011 .
That means insurance companies must allocate 80 cents out of every premium dollar to providing health care to their customers , while the remaining 20 cents can be used to pay other expenses , including salaries , overhead , and profits .
In a statement released Thursday , Anthem , a unit of WellPoint Inc ( WLP , Fortune 500 ) . , said the decision to withdraw its rate request was taken " to meet our current understanding of this requirement in advance of the effective date . "
Anthem said it plans to refile rate increases sometime in May .
The insurer said it will provide " adequate notice " to members regarding how their rates may be impacted by the refiling .
In the meantime , rates for Anthem 's individual members in California remain unchanged .
Kathleen Sebelius , secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department , said the announcement was " good news " for Californians who could have been hit with " massive rate increases . "
" Since these rate hikes were first announced , I have heard from countless Americans who have been stretched to the limit by high health insurance premiums , " Sebelius said in a statement .
Anthem 's decision , she said , will provide " some much - needed temporary relief . "
" As we implement the law , [ we ] will closely monitor the industry , and we will not hesitate to act to prevent exorbitant premium hikes , " she said .
Anthem became a symbol in the acrimonious debate over health care reform when it announced the plan earlier this year to raise rates by as much as 39 % for its 800,000 customers in California .
Critics say Anthem and other insurance companies want to raise rates to help boost profits .
But the insurance industry argues that rate hikes are necessary to cope with lost revenue as more of their customers either dropped insurance or downgraded to cheaper plans during the recession .
Brian Sassi , chief executive of WellPoint 's consumer business unit , said Anthem 's decision to withdraw its rate request was in " the best interests of our customers . "
" Our goal is to make health care reform work for our members , " he said .
President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law in March .
The law , which goes into effect over the next four years , aims to provide health care for 95 % of Americans .
Last year , the Virtual Console brought us Ogre Battle : The March of the Black Queen , the " fifth " title in the Ogre Battle series ( although none of the first four chapters in the story actually exist . )
An incredibly rare game , it was also one of the best strategy titles on the SNES , allowing for an enormous deal of micro-management if you so desired .
It had many fans who still think it 's one of the greatest titles the genre has to offer .
But the fans think even higher of the sequel .
Person of Lordly Caliber follows on where March left off , and is thus the sixth game in the series .
As Magnus Gallant , a recent graduate of the Palatinean Army , who is assigned to protect the upper classes in the southern region of his land .
He quickly discovers that things are n't quite like the rich people make it out to be : the lower classes are seriously oppressed , and so he decides to join them instead .
The basic gameplay remains unchanged from the previous entry .
In almost every mission , your goal is to defeat all enemies and liberating the strongholds they 've captured .
To do this , you must send out groups of units from your headquarters , and then command them to walk around the field , to explore areas for hidden items , fight enemies or seize strongholds .
You can send out any number of squads , but it 's usually a good idea to keep at least one or two at your HQ : if it 's captured , you instantly lose , so keep some units behind as defense .
Enemies are n't visible until you 're close to them , so you 'll never know if one of them secretly sneaks up on your base !
While running around on the map , time will also pass .
Certain units might perform better during the day or the night , so if you have one of them , keep an eye on the current time .
If you walk around for too long , you 'll also get tired ( who can manage to stay up for two days and not get tired ? ) and will have to set up camp for a while .
Units can also rest in captured strongholds , allowing them to regain HP .
Your unit squads are where the game 's strategic element comes into play the most .
Each is made up of a 3 - by - 3 square , and allows you to place five units on it .
You need to choose very carefully what to place where ; for example , it 's highly recommended to place characters with swords and other highly damaging attacks at the front , as placing them further back lowers their damage .
Depending on which row you place units in , you might even alter their attacks significantly – healing spells , for example , can be used twice in one turn if the healer is in the back .
On the other hand , you 'll want to have long - range fighters like archers and mages in the back , so that enemies are less likely to hit them and put their low amount of health in danger .
Putting units in front of others also automatically makes whichever unit is in front defend the one behind – close - range enemy fighters will not be able to attack the shielded units until the one in front is dead .
Some units , like dragons , actually count for two , so if you decide to use them , you 'll have to decide unit placement even more carefully .
Each squad also has a leader you can assign .
Protect him / her at all costs , because if a team 's leader dies , the remaining units become unable to do anything !
Thankfully , the same goes for enemy squads : defeat their leader and you can take out what remains with ease .
But the unit customization does n't end there .
Each individual unit can also be equipped with a variety of items , which you can either find , receive from defeated enemies or buy from shops .
Units can also change into more powerful classes if they level up sufficiently , but you 'll need specific armour and weapons to let them .
Although this all sounds quite complicated , in reality it 's actually quite easy to manage everything .
The menus are easy to navigate and the game includes a tutorial if you 'd prefer to be told what everything does rather than experimenting on your own .
Although organizing everything can go quite in - depth , actual battles could n't be easier .
You do n't actually make any of your units attack , because they all act on their own accord .
The only thing you can do is tell them which enemies to attack .
You can let them attack the weakest , the strongest , the leader , or simply let them act on their own instinct .
In most cases you 'll want them to attack the leader , though , because , as said , taking him / her out will render the remaining units extremely vulnerable !
As you might expect from a game like this , between missions , you 'll get a scene that advances the storyline .
There 's quite a lot of them , because there 's no less than 43 different missions in the game !
You can't play them all in one playthrough , however , as some will only be available by making certain specific decisions when asked something .
There 's also plenty of little sidequests you can try to solve within other missions , which is usually worth your time – it tends to get you unique items or , in some cases , even unique units .
The game 's graphical style is quite odd .
The map screen is 3D with 2D characters on it , but almost every other part of the game , like the story sequences and battles , is exclusively 2D .
It 's a bit odd seeing 2D on a mainly 3D console , but it works and fits the game quite well .
The soundtrack is equally nice , with a ton of different songs befitting any given situation .
Couples without kids and single - person households are the new norm in the heart of Brisbane .
The trend has been revealed in a new study on population change in inner Brisbane from 1996 and projected to 2031 .
The study was released today , as the Queensland government convenes a summit on managing the state 's growth .
It found inner Brisbane is set for considerable growth and will likely resemble the demographic makeup of inner Sydney and Melbourne over time .
" We need to learn from their experiences to ensure that Brisbane remains a better place to live , " Treasurer Andrew Fraser said in a statement .
The Beltway , quasi - government think - tank of warmongerers provides a sick glimpse into the craniums of how governments approach war .
The U.S. should use diverse tactics in Iraq and Afghanistan that best minimize its own casualties , no matter that these operations greatly raise civilian casualties , as Israel learned from its 2006 invasion of Lebanon and executed in the 2008 - 09 Gaza Massacre , one of the most influential think - tanks on global policy reports to the U.S. Army .
In “ Military Capabilities for Hybrid War : Insights from the Israel Defense Forces in Lebanon and Gaza ” [ .pdf ] , a report published by the RAND Corporation , “ insights to broaden the understanding of the capabilities needed to prevail against more sophisticated hybrid opponents ” is derived from Israel ’s U.S. - backed massacres .
The 2010 study was sponsored by the U.S. Army , in part with the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff and G - 8 Headquarters .
The report “ examines the experience of the Israel Defense Forces ( I.D.F. ) ” in Lebanon and Gaza .
The 2006 invasion of Lebanon ended with nearly 1,200 Lebanese casualties not belonging to Hizbollah — only 37 identified as soldiers or police officers — and 44 Israeli civilians .
Reports , unanimously show evidence of crimes against humanity .
The Gaza Massacre began less than two months after Israel broke a four - month ceasefire between it and Hamas .
While Americans and the rest of the world were anointing so - called “ change ” to lead the world , Israel Defence Forces ( I.D.F. ) raided Gaza in the middle of the night , killing six Hamas forces .
A fact - finding mission endorsed by the U.N. Human Rights Council , known as the Goldstone Report , found the Israeli government and Hamas committed war crimes during Operation Cast Lead .
The so - called “ conflict ” resulted in over 1,400 Palestinian and 13 Israeli deaths , the ‘ wanton destruction ‘ of almost 40,000 Gazan homes and left tens of thousands homeless .
Of the nearly 1,200 dead non-combatants , hundreds were children .
According to the study , in Gaza , the I.D.F. ” focused ” on “ using targeted assassinations ( including air strikes ) to ‘ mow the grass , '” — what interviewed I.D.F. soldiers called the raining death in 2008 — “ and raids against high - value targets , all enabled by close coordination with Israeli security services . ”
These tactics are valuable because :
This approach [ “ attack by fires ( principally air strikes ) ] also seemed to promise lower I.D.F. casualties ( a major domestic political consideration ) , less collateral damage ( a key consideration for managing international and regional opinion ) , and budgetary savings .
There is no mention in the study to how spontaneous death from above and massive home invasion by these government thugs “ humiliate ” and “ terrorize ” the population , as the Goldstone Report assessed , because that is not a cost relevant to calculate for the U.S. Army .
This is not “ collateral damage ” to the researchers because it does n’t enhance soldier casualties or raise monetary costs .
More disturbing is how RAND describes the Gaza Massacre in portraying the I.D.F. as God in the Book of Revelations :
The flat , relatively open terrain in Gaza facilitated a rapid ground advance to isolate Gaza City and sever the lines of communication from the Egyptian border ….
Furthermore , Hamas is not as capable an opponent as Hezbollah , neither in its training and discipline nor its weaponry .
Hezbollah defended its positions ; Hamas frequently retreated .
Hezbollah had advanced A.T.G.M. ’s [ anti- tank Guided Missiles ] and used them to good effect ;
Hamas seems not to have had many and used few , if any , relying mainly on small arms , [ rocket - propelled grenades ] , mortars , rockets , I.E.D. ’s [ improvised explosive devices ] , and mines .
This is displayed by encouraging the highly advanced military power “ mow the grass ” by “ paving the way with fires ” to clear the way for the big boys on the block against rag - tag bunches who retreat because they ’re incapable of fighting back :
The Israelis also relied heavily on combat engineers and on artillery - and air - delivered fires to neutralize mines and I.E.D. ’s on their approach routes ( “ paving the way with fires ” ) .
Furthermore , unlike in Lebanon in 2006 , maneuver brigade commanders had air assets ( attack helicopters and [ drones ] ) and artillery units in direct support of their operations .
By all reports , these fires were highly responsive and effective .
The overall lesson , RAND says the U.S. should take is that because civilian deaths are inevitable by nature of choosing to battle unsophisticated , non-state - sanctioned militants among the helpless in their homeland :
Precision , standoff fires are critical , but not sufficient , to cope with hybrid warfare opponents , particularly if they are operating “ among the people . ” …
Heavy forces — based on tanks and infantry fighting vehicles — are key elements of any force that will fight hybrid enemies that have a modicum of training , organization , and advanced weapons ( e.g. , A.T.G.M.’s and [ surface - to - air weaponery ] ) .
Light and medium forces can complement heavy forces , particularly in urban and other complex terrain , but they do not provide the survivability , lethality , or mobility inherent in heavy forces .
Quite simply , heavy forces reduce operational risks and minimize friendly casualties .
Indiscriminately rain death from drones before invading with full force to avoid “ friendly casualties ” — meaning minimize U.S. casualties , disregarding the deaths of natives because those are inevitable anyway .
This is the cheapest way Israel ‘ increased deterrence ’ and inflicted submission .
This is how the mind of the Corporate War Party works : externalize the social costs of terrorizing civilian populations and tell everyone you ’re using a ‘ winning ’ strategy .
There ’s no mention in the study about international humanitarian law , U.S. law or blowback .
This is what the strategy framers are reading as the Obama Administration escalates air strikes and night raids on the way into another large - scale offensive in the Afghan province of Kandahar .

Last June
I placed some photographic film into a tin cannister with a small hole punched into its side .
The tin cannister was then attached to a clothes pole in my backgarden and left .
This afternoon I fetched the cannister and took the photographic film out .
My son John scanned the photographic film and with the aid of some image software made the image negative .
The result is the picture above .
The picture clearly shows the path of the sun through the sky over the last six months .
I believe you can see we didn`t have a great summer by the broken lines at the top .
More sun shone in the month of October .
This has been a fascinating simple project that was carried out very easily .

India has banned telecom equipment from China citing national security reasons , heightening trade tensions between the two Asian economic giants .
In a recent order , the government has told mobile operators not to import any network equipment manufactured by Chinese vendors such as Huawei and ZTE .
Indian officials say the ban was prompted by concerns Chinese telecom equipment could have spyware or malicious software — known as " malware " — embedded in it which could give Chinese intelligence agencies access to telecom networks in India .
The ban and other regulations come less than a week after media reports that Chinese hackers had broken into the computer networks of India 's security , defence and diplomatic establishment .
Approval required
Under strict new conditions , Indian telecom companies will have to get " security clearance " from India 's Home Ministry before projects are approved , an official said Friday .
" All service providers have to submit details of the equipment used , and their applications will have to get security clearance from the home ministry , " said Satyendra Prakash , a Telecommunications Ministry spokesman .
The government also ordered that the operation and maintenance of telecom networks be carried out " entirely " by Indian engineers .
Prakash said most countries had similar rules in place making it mandatory for companies to reveal their service providers in order to protect their database and network security systems .
China wants tech secrets
China itself is involved in a tussle with Europe and the United States over Beijing 's attempts to force foreign suppliers of computer security technology to disclose how it works .
The United States and Europe have said Beijing 's requirement that global technology suppliers reveal the inner workings of computer encryption and other security products to conduct business in China was protectionist .
The immediate beneficiaries from the ban on Chinese equipment imports would be European , U.S. - based and Indian telecom equipment manufacturers who would fill the enormous demand for mobile equipment in India .
The number of mobile phone users in India is expected to hit one billion by 2014 , roughly twice what it is now , with some 20 million new users added each month .
Last year , the government banned imports of Chinese handsets without the International Mobile Equipment Identity , or IMEI , number , again citing security reasons such as the use of stolen handsets to make terror or hoax calls .
The IMEI number of a mobile phone is a 15 - digit number unique to every mobile handset .
It prevents stolen handsets from making calls and allows security agencies to track down a specific user .

( CNN ) --
Three choices , and you only get to pick one :
Of these three developments that took place in the second half of the 20th century , which has had the most enduring impact on our lives today ?
1 . The building of the interstate highway system .
2 . The blanketing of the United States with coast - to - coast television .
3 . The introduction and spread of the Internet .
We 're finally far enough into the 21st century that we can look at the previous one with the perspective that comes with distance .
American life prior to 1950 felt nothing like American life feels now , and a big reason is those three changes .
They , more than any fleeting headline event or arcane political controversy , transformed everything ; the question for you is , which of them changed things the most ?
Before the interstates were constructed , the country felt pretty hemmed in .
Even a trip within an individual state often took considerable planning ; two - lane roads , dangerous and slow , were common , and people did n't leave their hometowns on a whim .
The interstates -- the official name , still , is the Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways -- tore down the invisible walls around U.S. towns .
President Eisenhower was in favor of building the interstates ( often said to be the biggest public works project in the history of the world ) because he believed that , in a time of war , they would be helpful in moving troops and supplies .
But their immediate effect was to make Americans feel that certain doors had been unlocked .
With the interstates came an exhilarating sense of freedom : A person could drive anywhere -- everywhere -- easily and without paying tolls .
Suddenly , horizons were unlimited .
" Local " did n't mean quite the same thing it used to .
You did n't have to stay put .
Getting away was effortless .
The introduction of national television meant that for the first time in history , people in every corner of the country -- people in small towns , in huge cities , in farm communities , in remote villages -- were watching exactly the same thing at exactly the same moment .
It connected the country , made it cohesive , in a way that even network radio had n't accomplished , and it was because of the transfixing quality of the TV pictures .
As with the interstates , coast - to - coast television was an antidote to isolation .
The executives who ran the newly formed television networks had an enormous amount of power .
Their decisions about what to put on the air determined what people would be talking about the next day .
They , in essence , controlled what people would laugh at and when , what people would cry over and when , what would anger people and when it would anger them .
The handful of national over - the - air networks , in their early days , were just that dominant .
America might as well have been hypnotized , so great was the devotion to the new machine .
And then , later in the century , the Internet came along and with it the promise of the erasure of all symbolic borders .
If the interstate highways had allowed physical freedom , the Internet allowed a different kind of freedom , one unprecedented in human experience .
It was no coincidence that it was initially referred to as the information superhighway : Seemingly overnight , the knowledge ( and trivia and gossip ) of the world was available to anyone with a keyboard and a modem ; people who had never met and would never meet could communicate as if they were lifelong friends .
The old - time television executives no longer had as firm a grip on how citizens would spend their time ; now the individual at his or her computer terminal was given the power to decide how he or she would be informed , entertained or infuriated at a given moment .
No one else had the absolute authority to program the individual 's life ; he or she made that decision , moment by moment .
What in the past might have taken a person a lifetime -- searching for mankind 's recorded wisdom in distant and magnificent libraries -- now , in theory , was available with a series of key taps from one 's room , regardless of how modest .
What had once seemed inconceivable had , in the blink of an eye , become routine .
So :
The three innovations ended up changing our daily world profoundly -- largely because of them , it is a world that would be almost unrecognizable to our grandparents and great - grandparents .
Each of the three , it can be argued , had certain drawbacks and tradeoffs that we should not ignore :
The interstates let us roam at will but weakened our sense of place ; television brought us together , but somehow , in relieving the old sense of forced isolation , it paradoxically introduced a new kind of voluntary isolation as it lured us to stay increasingly within the confines of our walls ; the Internet gave us access to the whole planet but locked our attention on a small sheet of plastic or glass .
The drawbacks are perhaps a discussion for another time .
What is not debatable is how much influence each of the three developments has had on the way we live our lives today .
The question is , if you had to choose one of the three as the most far - reaching , the one that has altered our lives -- all right , your life -- the most , which one would it be ?
Or , to put it another way : which of the three could n't you live without ?
There 's no right answer .
There 's just your answer .
Feel free to come up with it as you drive unfettered down the open highway , as you sit around watching TV or , if you 'd like , by going to the quick vote that you 'll find on this page .
[ Postscript : Voting is now closed .
More than 303,000 people voted ; 58 percent selected the Internet as the most enduring innovation , 29 percent selected television , and 14 percent selected the interstate highways . ]

Planarian worms .
Image credit : University of Nottingham
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Scientists at The University of Nottingham have discovered the gene that enables an extraordinary worm to regenerate its own body parts after amputation -- including a whole head and brain .
Their research into the Planarian worm is another piece in the scientific jigsaw that could one day make the regeneration of old or damaged human organs and tissues a real possibility .
The research led by Dr Aziz Aboobaker , a Research Councils UK Fellow in the School of Biology shows for the first time that a gene called ' Smed - prep ' is essential for correctly regenerating a head and brain in planarian worms .
The study is published on April 22 2010 in the open access journal PLoS Genetics .
Planarian worms have an amazing ability to regenerate body parts , including a head and brain , following amputation .
These remarkable creatures contain adult stem cells that are constantly dividing and can become all of the missing cell types .
They also have the right set of genes working to make this happen exactly as it should so that when they re-grow body parts they end up in the right place and have the correct size , shape and orientation .
Dr Aboobaker said : “ These amazing worms offer us the opportunity to observe tissue regeneration in a very simple animal that can regenerate itself to a remarkable extent and does so as a matter of course .
“ We want to be able to understand how adult stem cells can work collectively in any animal to form and replace damaged or missing organs and tissues .
Any fundamental advances in understanding from other animals can become relevant to humans surprisingly quickly .
“ If we know what is happening when tissues are regenerated under normal circumstances , we can begin to formulate how to replace damaged and diseased organs , tissues and cells in an organised and safe way following an injury caused by trauma or disease .
This would be desirable for treating Alzheimer ’s disease , for example .
With this knowledge we can also assess the consequences of what happens when stem cells go wrong during the normal processes of renewal — for example in the blood cell system where rogue stem cells can result in Leukaemia . ”
Smed - prep is necessary for the correct differentiation and location of the cells that make up a planarian worm ’s head .
It is also sufficient for defining where the head should be located on the worm .
The team have found that although the presence of Smed - prep is vital so that the head and brain are in the right place , the worm stem cells can still be persuaded to form brain cells as a result of the action of other unrelated genes .
But even so , without Smed - prep these cells do not organise themselves to form a normal brain .
Daniel Felix , a graduate student who carried out the experimental work said : “ The understanding of the molecular basis for tissue remodeling and regeneration is of vital importance for regenerative medicine .
Planarians are famous for their immense power of regeneration , being able to regenerate a new head after decapitation .
With the homeobox gene Smed - prep , we have characterised the first gene necessary for correct anterior fate and patterning during regeneration .
It has been a really exciting project and I feel very lucky to have had this study as the centre piece of my thesis work . ”

A recent venture into a long - locked room at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida uncovered interesting artifacts of a by - gone era : retired spacesuits from Americans who trained in the 1960s to be space spies .
Two security officers were doing a check of a facility known as the Launch Complex 5/6 museum .
NASA Special Agent Dann E. Oakland and Security Manager Henry Butler , of the company that oversees the museum , Delaware North Parks and Resorts , discovered a locked room -- and they had no key .
They eventually were able to unlock the door using a master key .
With no power , the room had evidently not been accessed by people in many years .
The officers used flashlights to explore the room and make their noteworthy find .
But Oakland and Butler were n't the first visitors .
Rodents had clearly explored the room over the years .
Still , two blue spacesuits were " complete and in remarkable shape , " according to the suits ' manufacturer , who examined them .
Investigators started looking into who owned the spacesuits .
A NASA technician initially thought they were training suits from the end of the Gemini or beginning of the Apollo space programs .
The manufacturer , however , determined that they were MH - 7 training suits from a short - lived Cold War -era military program to put a manned reconnaissance station in space .
Begun in 1964 , the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program was an Air Force initiative that would have sent Air Force astronauts to a space station in a Gemini capsule .
After spending a few weeks in orbit , the crew would undock and return to Earth .
The Air Force abandoned the program in 1969 , but the program produced a great deal of technological development , and three groups of military officers trained to be MOL astronauts .
The spacesuit with identifying number 008 had the name " LAWYER " on the left sleeve .
The suit was traced to Lt. Col. Richard E. Lawyer , a member of the first group recruited to be MOL astronauts in 1965 .
Records show that official ownership of this suit was transferred by NASA to the Smithsonian Institution in 1983 .
The suit itself has now been returned to the Smithsonian .
No records were found for the other suit , with the intriguing identifying number 007 .
It still belongs to NASA , and the agency 's plans for the suit are still being determined .
Other historical treasures found in the room include old film canisters , one flown shuttle main landing tire , electrical equipment , and various miscellaneous boxes .
The MOL program left other legacies to NASA , as well .
When the program was cancelled , seven of the younger astronauts were transferred to the agency 's human space flight program and went on to have standout careers .
Among them were Robert Crippen , pilot of the first Space Shuttle mission , and Richard H. " Dick " Truly , who later became NASA Administrator .
Josh Gerstein over at Politico sent Threat Level his piece underscoring once again President Barack Obama is not the civil - liberties knight in shining armor many were expecting .
Gerstein posts a televised interview of Obama and John Walsh of America 's Most Wanted .
The nation 's chief executive extols the virtues of mandatory DNA testing of Americans upon arrest , even absent charges or a conviction .
Obama said , " It 's the right thing to do " to " tighten the grip around folks " who commit crime .
When it comes to civil liberties , the Obama administration has come under fire for often mirroring his predecessor 's practices surrounding state secrets , the Patriot Act and domestic spying .
There 's also Gitmo , Jay Bybee and John Yoo .
Now there 's DNA sampling .
Obama told Walsh he supported the federal government , as well as the 18 states that have varying laws requiring compulsory DNA sampling of individuals upon an arrest for crimes ranging from misdemeanors to felonies .
The data is lodged in state and federal databases , and has fostered as many as 200 arrests nationwide , Walsh said .
The American Civil Liberties Union claims DNA sampling is different from mandatory , upon - arrest fingerprinting that has been standard practice in the United States for decades .
A fingerprint , the group says , reveals nothing more than a person 's identity .
But much can be learned from a DNA sample , which codes a person 's family ties , some health risks , and , according to some , can predict a propensity for violence .
The ACLU is suing California to block its voter - approved measure requiring saliva sampling of people picked up on felony charges .
Authorities in the Golden State are allowed to conduct so - called " familial searching " – when a genetic sample does not directly match another , authorities start investigating people with closely matched DNA in hopes of finding leads to the perpetrator .
Do you wonder whether DNA sampling is legal ?
The courts have already upheld DNA sampling of convicted felons , based on the theory that the convicted have fewer privacy rights .
The U.S. Supreme Court has held that when conducting intrusions of the body during an investigation , the police need so - called " exigent circumstances " or a warrant .
That alcohol evaporates in the blood stream is the exigent circumstance to draw blood from a suspected drunk driver without a warrant .

Going into this system guide , we were n’t expecting to make too many dramatic changes .
Not much new hardware has come out since we published our last guide in February , right ?
That ’s true to an extent , but there ’s been room for more than enough little tweaks and modifications to keep us occupied .
At the low end , our Econobox has now drifted closer to our $ 500 target price , and we ’ve started to recommend a more enthusiast - friendly enclosure in the alternatives .
The $ 850 Utility Player has gained a new motherboard with more ports , connectors , and other little perks than before , as well .
At the high end , our Double - Stuff Workstation now has a hexa - core processor almost fast enough to become sentient and start building man-killing humanoid robots .
To keep things even spicier , we ’ve thrown together a completely new configuration : a microATX system that favors not low power and low cost , but a mix of strong performance and low noise levels .
That build includes a Core i5 - 750 , a Radeon HD 5770 , a 1TB hard drive , and some very quiet cooling options , all for about the same price as the Utility Player .
Keep reading for all the details .
Rules and regulations
The first thing you should know about this guide is that it ’s geared toward helping you select the parts for a home - built PC .
If you ’re new to building your own systems and want a little extra help , our tutorial on how to build your own PC is a great place to start and a helpful complement to this guide .
Before tackling our recommended systems , we should explain some of the rules and guidelines we used to select components .
The guiding philosophy behind our choices was to seek the best bang for the buck .
That means we avoided recommending super - cheap parts that are barely capable of performing their jobs , just as we generally avoided breathtakingly expensive products that carry a hefty price premium for features or performance you probably do n’t need .
Instead , we looked to that mythical “ sweet spot ” where price and performance meet up in a pleasant , harmonic convergence .
We also sought balance within each system configuration , choosing components that make sense together , so that a fast processor wo n’t be bottlenecked by a skimpy graphics card or too little system memory , for instance .
The end result , we hope , is a series of balanced systems that offer decent performance as configured and provide ample room for future expandability .
We confined our selections to components that are currently available online .
Paper launches and preorders do n’t count , for obvious reasons .
We also tried to stick to $ 500 , $ 800 and $ 1200 budgets for our three cheapest desktop systems .
Those budgets are loose guidelines rather than hard limits , to allow us some wiggle room for deals that may stretch the budget a little but are too good to resist .
We ’ve continued our tradition of basing the guide ’s component prices on listings at Newegg .
We ’ve found that sourcing prices from one large reseller allows us to maintain a more realistic sense of street prices than price search engine listings , which are sometimes artificially low .
In the few cases where Newegg does n’t have an item in stock , we ’ll fall back to our trusty price search engine rather than limit our options .
Finally , price was n’t the top factor in our component choices .
Our own experiences with individual components weighed heavily on our decisions , and we ’ve provided links to our own reviews of many of the products we ’re recommending .
We ’ve also tried to confine our selections to name - brand rather than generic products and to manufacturers with solid reputations for reliability .
Warranty coverage was an important consideration , as well .
The Econobox
Because speed does n’t have to cost a fortune
As our cheapest build , the Econobox presents an affordable formula for gaming and general use .
Rather than picking leftover components from the bottom of the bargain bin , we tried to balance low cost with decent performance and headroom for upgrades , which should result in a surprisingly well - rounded system for the price .
Component Item Price Processor AMD Athlon II X4 630 $ 99.00 Motherboard Gigabyte GA - 770TA - UD3 $ 94.99 Memory Crucial 2GB ( 2 x 1GB ) DDR3 - 1333 $ 57.99 Graphics XFX Radeon HD 5670 $ 94.99 Storage Western Digital Caviar Black 640 GB $ 74.99 Samsung SH - S223L $ 26.99 Audio Integrated $ 0 Enclosure Antec NSK 4482 w/380W PSU $ 79.99 Total Buy this complete system at Newegg $ 528.94 Processor Little has changed in the Econobox .
The value numbers from our latest CPU showdown ( and our subsequent blog post ) remain quite relevant here , and they still tell us that AMD ’s Athlon II X4 630 delivers the most bang for your buck within the Econobox ’s budget no wonder , considering this CPU packs four 2.8GHz cores yet sells for just under $ 100 .
Just as in our March guide , we debated including Intel ’s Core i3 - 530 in our list of primary picks .
While the i3 -530 does n’t perform quite as well as the Athlon II overall , it has a tighter thermal envelope ( 73W vs. 95W ) , better power efficiency , and incredible overclocking potential .
Unfortunately , going that route would distend our already stretched budget , so we ’ve relegated the Core i3 to the alternatives .
Folks who really care about overclocking and power efficiency should look there .
Motherboard USB 3.0 and 6 Gbps Serial ATA ports have recently flooded the motherboard market .
Part of the Econobox ’s appeal comes from its low cost , and it turns out you can get next - gen I/O on relatively cheap boards like Gigabyte ’s GA - 770TA - UD3 .
USB 3.0 alone promises substantial performance improvements with all manner of external devices , and 6 Gbps SATA could make a big difference with future solid - state drives , so not spending the extra $ 10 - 15 now seems a little short - sighted .
The GA - 770TA - UD3 has a nicely rounded set of features , too , with a gaggle of ports ( including external SATA and FireWire ) plus an 8+2 power - phase design capable of fueling 140W CPUs .
This board ’s DDR3 memory slots might seem like a downside now that DDR3 has regained its slight price premium over DDR2 .
Here , too , however , we ’re prioritizing future expansion over small , short - term savings .
DDR3 is taking over the system memory market , and DDR2 will likely become more expensive as DDR3 demand increases and DDR2 production wanes .
That means adding more RAM down the line could be cheaper with DDR3 , and you may be able to re-use memory from this system in your next one .
Memory Our Econobox had quite a long run with four gigs of RAM as standard .
Sadly , that was only possible because of a wave of oversupply and various other factors that wreaked havoc in the memory industry .
The situation has now stabilized , and memory prices are back to their pre-crunch level good news for memory makers but bad news for us .
Until memory makers resume bankrupting themselves to flood the market with cheap RAM , we ’ll have to step down to 2 GB to stay within our budget .
Crucial ’s 2GB DDR3 - 1333 memory kit ought to be sufficient for everyday use and even most cross- platform games , and it ’s covered by a lifetime warranty .
Should the upgrade itch strike you some time in the future , our recommended motherboard has room for two more 1GB DIMMs .
We ’ve set aside a 4GB kit for inveterate multitaskers and hard - core gamers in our alternatives , as well .
Graphics
As much as we want to fashion the Econobox into a lean , mean gaming machine , we have to make minor sacrifices to keep close to our $ 500 budget .
XFX ’s Radeon HD 5670 is a good compromise .
This graphics card does n’t quite have the muscle of the Radeon HD 5750 , but as we saw in our review , the 5670 is still powerful enough to run the latest and greatest games at 1680 ×1050 with antialiasing turned up .
Fittingly , 1680 ×1050 happens to be the native resolution of most budget 20 ″ and 22 ″ monitors with 16:10 aspect ratiosideal companions for the Econboox .
If you feel the urge to pair the Econobox with a bigger , higher - resolution display , head on to our alternatives for a meatier GPU recomendation .
Storage Western Digital has three 640GB hard drives in this price range , and we think the Caviar Black works best as a system drive .
Not only does it have a full 7,200 - RPM spindle speed , 32 MB of cache , and the same noise level ratings as the slower SE16 model , but WD also covers the Black with a five - year warranty .
We have n’t seen another 640 GB hard drive with specifications quite as good or warranty coverage quite as long .
For our optical storage option , Samsung ’s SH - S223L makes another appearance here .
We like its combination of positive user reviews and low pricing , and its Serial ATA interface is reasonably future - proof .
Samsung even includes LightScribe support .
Enclosure and power
In this edition of the guide , the Antec NSK 4482B is out , and the NSK 4482 is in .
These two enclosures are actually identical in virtually all respects except for color and price , but Newegg inexplicably charges more for the all - black 4482B .
The plain 4482 ’s silver front panel brings down the price by about 20 bucks , but buyers are still getting a 380W , 80 % - efficient power supply ( with 80 Plus Bronze certification ) , nice noise - reduction features , plenty of room for hard drives and expansion , and a clean , easy - to - work - in layout .
You might find cheaper cases out there , but we do n’t think you ’ll be able to save a whole lot once the cost of a PSU is factored into the equation .
Besides , bargain - bin power supplies generally have inflated specifications .
A cheap PSU can also jeopardize system stability , damage sensitive components over time , and potentially even flame out in spectacular fashion , taking system components with it in the process .
Econobox alternatives
Want to tweak the Econobox with a more overclockable and power - efficient CPU , more RAM , or a different graphics config ?
Read on .
Component Item Price Processor Intel Core i3-530 $ 119.99 Motherboard Gigabyte GA - H55M - USB3 $ 109.99 Memory Crucial 4GB ( 2 x 2GB ) DDR3 - 1333 $ 99.99 Graphics XFX Radeon HD 5770 $ 159.99 Enclosure Antec Three Hundred w/ 430W PSU $ 99.95 Processor
As we noted on the previous page , the Core i3 - 530 falls a little behind the Athlon II X4 630 in our benchmark suite overall .
However , the Intel CPU also happens to have much better power efficiency and incredible overclocking potential .
We got ours to just over 4.4GHz after swapping the stock cooler for a tower - style heatsink ; the chip subsequently ran our Cinebench test almost as quickly as the $ 200 Core i5 - 750 at that speed , despite having two fewer cores .
The icing on the cake ?
Even with a relatively power - hungry H57 motherboard , our Core i3 -530 system overclocked to 4.4GHz only drew about 5W more under load than the Athlon II X4 630 build running at stock speeds .
Just make sure to check out this guide ’s last page for our aftermarket cooler recommendations .
Motherboard
We usually feature a motherboard with integrated graphics in our Econobox alternatives .
Today , Gigabyte ’s GA - H55M - USB3 fills in as both our Intel motherboard and our IGP option , since it can pipe the Core i3 -530 ’s integrated graphics through VGA , DVI , DisplayPort , and HDMI outputs .
( Clarkdale processors all have integrated graphics cores on the actual CPU package . )
In spite of its microATX form factor , this puppy also features dual physical PCI Express x16 slots , USB 3.0 , external SATA , and FireWire connectivity .
Slightly cheaper H55 mobos do exist , but none have those kinds of perks .
Memory
We aimed to keep our primary build near the $ 500 mark , but you do n’t have to .
Anyone with a little more spare cash ought to consider jumping up to 4GB of RAM , which should smooth out multitasking and long gaming sessions .
Windows 7 is n’t quite as resource - intensive as Vista , but it will still put spare memory to good use thanks to technologies like SuperFetch .
Now , you ’ll need a 64 - bit operating system to take full advantage of all this memory .
32 - bit OSes have enough address space for 4GB of RAM ( here in the form of an affordable Crucial kit ) , but that figure is an upper limit for all memory in a system , including video RAM .
In practice , 32 - bit versions of Windows will only let you use 3 to 3.5 GB of actual system memory , and they ’ll normally restrict each application ’s RAM budget to 2GB .
Workarounds exist for 32 - bit Windows , but Microsoft says they can hurt compatibility ; it advises that folks run a 64 - bit version of Windows instead .
Considering how many pre-built PCs ship with Win7 x64 these days , we ’re inclined to echo that recommendation .
Check out our OS section on the second - to - last page of the guide for more details .
Graphics Similarly , folks who play state - of - the - art 3D games may want to step up to the new Radeon HD 5770 .
We saw first - hand that this card pretty much shadows the old Radeon HD 4870 1GB , generally reaching playable frame rates at 1920 ×1200 with 4X antialiasing .
The 5770 also consumes quite a bit less power , generates less noise with the stock cooler , has a shorter circuit board , and has better texture filtering than its predecessor .
Last , but not least , the 5770 ’s DirectX 11 support may bring image quality or performance bonuses in DX11 games like Battlefield : Bad Company 2 , DiRT 2 , and Metro 2033 .
We chose XFX ’s variant of the 5770 because it has double - lifetime warranty coverage , a relatively quiet dual - slot cooler , and a price tag barely above that of other models .
Enclosure and power
We ’ve always stuck with an affordable , quiet case and PSU bundle for the Econobox .
Considering some of the hardware we ’re now throwing into this build , though , a more enthusiast - focused alternative seems to be in order .
The Antec Three Hundred should fit that role quite well .
Compared to the NSK 4482 from our primary picks , this case has a more powerful , bottom - mounted 430W power supply , several additional fan mounts ( including one 140 - mm fan at the top and room for two 120 - mm front fans ) , extra storage bays , and a more attractive mesh front panel .
The Three Hundred admittedly lacks some of the NSK 4482 ’s noise - reduction features , like hard drive mounting grommets , an 80 Plus - certified PSU , and a limited number of vents for noise to escape through .
Still , we find this a more appropriate choice for , say , someone who might want to grab one of those Core i3-530s and see how far they can overclock it .
The Utility Player
Value without major compromises
For an extra fistful of Franklins , the Utility Player gives us more of everything processing power , graphics performance , memory , storage capacity you name it while remaining tantalizingly affordable .
Component Item Price Processor Intel Core i5 - 750 $ 199.99 Motherboard Asus P7P55D - E $ 144.99 Memory Crucial 4GB ( 2 x 2GB ) DDR3 - 1333 $ 99.99 Graphics XFX Radeon HD 5770 $ 159.99 Storage Western Digital Caviar Black 1TB ( 6 Gbps ) $ 119.99 Samsung SH - S223L $ 26.99 Audio
Integrated $ 0 Enclosure Antec Sonata III w/500W PSU $ 119.99 Total Buy this complete system at Newegg $ 871.93 Processor
We ran the numbers on the Core i5 - 750 in our latest processor roundup ’s value section .
When we accounted for the price of a full system much like the Utility Player , this CPU came out on top of both our performance - per - dollar and power - efficiency - per - dollar rankings .
With four Nehalem cores , a 95 W thermal envelope , and a sub -$ 200 price tag , it ’s no wonder the Core i5 - 750 does so well .
What better choice for this build ?
Motherboard Our Utility
Player keeps its shiny USB 3.0 and 6 Gbps Serial ATA ports , but they ’re now coming out of a slightly different motherboard .
In March , we picked Gigabyte ’s GA - P55A - UD3 over Asus ’ P7P55D - E because we felt the latter ’s extras were n’t worth a $ 25 premium .
Well , today , the Asus board only costs $ 10 more than the alternative and since it adds external Serial ATA and FireWire to the mix , we feel it ’s now the better deal of the two .
Both contestants otherwise have very similar feature sets : two of each next - gen I/O port , six 300 MB / s Serial ATA ports , dual physical PCI Express x16 slots ( one of which has only four lanes of PCIe connectivity ) , CrossFire certification , and heatsinks covering the processor ’s power - regulation circuitry .
The Asus board trades one 32 - bit PCI slot for a PCIe x1 , however .
Memory
This build ’s budget lets us include 4GB of Crucial DDR3 - 1333 RAM in our primary config despite recent memory price increases .
The Utility Player would look a little lopsided with a $ 200 CPU , $ 160 graphics card , and just two gigs of RAM , after all .
Just make sure you install a 64 - bit operating system , or you wo n’t be able to make use of all this RAM easily .
Graphics
We ’re not going to re-hash what we wrote about this card on the last page , but suffice it to say the Radeon HD 5770 can run most games at 1920 ×1200 with antialiasing , at the same time delivering great image quality , low power consumption , and relatively low noise levels .
Now that the old Radeon HD 4870 1GB has all but disappeared from e-tail listings , the 5770 also has virtually no competition in this price range .
Nvidia ’s GeForce GTS 250 1GB might count if it were n’t an older , slower , and power - hungrier DirectX 10 product .
There ’s plenty of room to go up from the 5770 , of course .
If you ’d like more performance and have some wiggle room in your budget , see the next page .
Storage
For what seems like ages , we recommended 640 GB Western Digital hard drives across our three cheapest builds .
We prolonged this tradition for lack of a 1TB drive with the same mix of great performance and low noise levels .
In light of today ’s prices and the release of WD ’s 1TB Caviar Black with 6 Gbps SATA , however , we ’ve decided to compromise a little bit .
The new 1TB drive might have relatively high seek noise levels , but it also has more storage capacity , better performance , the same five - year warranty as the Econobox ’s 640 GB Caviar Black , and roughly the same cost per gigabyte .
For a cheaper , potentially quieter 1TB alternative , see the next page .
We ’re sticking with the Samsung SH - S223L as our optical drive .
DVD burners have become commodity items , so we ’re not terribly inclined to get something fancier just because of our more generous budget .
Audio
Our inclusion of a discrete sound card in previous Utility Player builds elicited some very polarized responses , with some folks praising the Asus Xonar DX for its superior analog sound quality and others labeling it a waste of money .
This time , we ’ve stuck with onboard audio in our primary config not because we now side with the latter camp , but because price increases on other components ( namely memory ) mean the Xonar would push us well over budget , making it much tougher to justify .
This decision involved a fair amount of hand - wringing .
However , we reckon onboard audio will sound okay not great , just okay to folks with cheap headphones or speakers .
Good enough for gaming , YouTube , and listening to MP3s , certainly .
If you ’re running a receiver or speakers with a digital input , the burden of good digital - to - analog conversion will rest with those components rather than the motherboard .
Should you happen to have a halfway decent analog audio device and the slightest amount of concern about sound quality , though , a good sound card will make a very real , palpable difference .
Bass will be less boomy , mids will sound far more detailed , and highs wo n’t chirp away louder than they should .
Everything will sound distinctly , unmistakably more natural .
If better analog sound is worth an extra $ 90 to you , then skip over to our alternatives page .
Enclosure and power The Antec Sonata III costs more than the NSK 4482 we selected for the Econobox , but it has several big advantages , including a beefy 500W power supply with an 80 % efficiency rating , a clean layout with sideways - mounted hard drive bays , and a host of noise reduction features .
Antec even slaps an eSATA port on the Sonata ’s front bezel , in case you want to be able to plug in a fast external hard drive without crawling behind the system .
Utility Player alternatives
As with the Econobox , we have some alternative propositions for how to fill out the Utility Player .
You might notice we ’re not throwing in a processor alternative here .
We noted earlier that the Core i5 - 750 outclasses all of its competitors in our value rankings .
You could go with a Phenom II X4 965 for a few dollars less , but why do that when the Core i5 - 750 has both better overall performance and substantially lower power consumption ?
Component Item Price Graphics XFX Radeon HD 5850 $ 309.99 Storage Samsung SpinPoint F3 1TB $ 89.99 Lite - On iHOS104-08 Blu-ray reader $ 64.99 Audio Asus Xonar DX $ 89.99 Graphics
The Radeon HD 5770 might be quick enough to run most games at 1920 ×1200 with antialiasing on , but the Radeon HD 5850 guarantees smoother frame rates at those settings and the ability to run a good number of titles at 2560 ×1600 with AA enabled , as well .
Not only that , but the 5850 should yield higher frame rates in DirectX 11 games that put a greater strain on the GPU than vanilla cross - platform titles .
An XFX card gets our nod of approval here because of its double - lifetime manufacturer warranty and relatively competitive pricing .
At this point , some readers may be wondering why they have n’t yet seen the $ 230 - 240 Radeon HD 5830 anywhere in this article .
May we suggest you peruse our review of that product to understand our decision .
In a nutshell , the 5830 costs too much for the relatively small performance jump it provides over the Radeon HD 5770 .
You ’d be better off saving up a little more and getting the 5850 , which is considerably faster than both the 5830 and the 5770 .
Storage
We ’re not quite as confident in the 1TB SpinPoint F3 as we are in the Caviar Black , since we have n’t tested the Samsung drive yet .
However , the SpinPoint ’s specs look solid : a full 7,200 - RPM spindle speed , 32 MB of cache , and two 500 GB platters .
More importantly , Samsung quotes noise levels of up to 29 dB during seeks , which should be quieter than the new 1TB Caviar Black , for which WD quotes maximum seek noise of 33 dB .
On the flip side , we would n’t be surprised if the SpinPoint had poorer random access times and lower overall performance than the Caviar .
Looking at Blu-ray drives , Lite - On ’s iHOS104-08 should do a fine job as a stand - alone reader ; it has great user reviews , relatively recent software ( PowerDVD 8 ) , and an affordable price .
None of the combo offerings we ’ve come across lately really stand out , usually because of lackluster software bundles or high prices .
In the end , we figure you ’re better off pairing a Blu-ray reader with the DVD burner from our primary parts list .
Audio Again , onboard audio can’t match the analog output quality of a good sound card like Asus ’ Xonar DX .
The Xonar also happens to handle real - time Dolby Digital Live encoding , and it does a pretty good job of emulating EAX 5.0 positional audio effects , which is an extra bonus for gamers .
Just about anyone with a decent set of analog speakers or headphones should be able to appreciate the difference in output quality between the Xonar and our onboard audio .
Sweeter Spot alternatives
Perhaps you want to max out your RAM , or maybe you ’d like a different hard drive and some TV tuning options .
Regardless , our alternatives should cover your needs .
Component Item Price Memory Crucial 4GB ( 2 x 2GB ) DDR3 - 1333 $ 99.99 Crucial 4GB ( 2 x 2GB ) DDR3 - 1333 $ 99.99 Graphics Asus GeForce GTX 470 $ 349.99 Storage Corsair Nova 128GB $ 369.00 Western Digital Caviar Green 2TB $ 139.99 TV tuner
Hauppauge WinTV-HVR 1800 MCE kit $ 99.99 Memory Sure , RAM is n’t anywhere near as cheap now as it was last year , but some folks may still want to fill each of our recommended motherboard ’s memory slots with a 2GB DDR3 module ( using a pair of 4GB Kingston kits ) .
Anyone who goes that route will need only ensure they run a 64 - bit operating system ; otherwise , making use of more than 4GB or so will prove problematic .
Graphics
As we saw in our testing , Nvidia ’s new GeForce GTX 470 fails to outpace the Radeon HD 5850 substantially in real - world games , actually falling behind it in many cases .
That ’s not terribly enticing for a card with not only a higher price tag , but also higher noise levels , higher temperatures , and higher power draw .
To make matters worse , the GeForce GTX 470 still is n’t available right now .
These shortcomings do n’t warrant shunning Nvidia entirely for another edition of the guide , though .
Newer Radeons have been dogged by supply problems , so we ’re happy to have a DX11 - capable alternative to recommend .
Plus , some folks may find value in this card despite its handicaps .
For one , the GF100 GPU has formidable geometry processing capabilities that may become an advantage in future games .
We also suspect the GF100 has great GPU computing performance , which could come in handy if OpenCL - enabled consumer applications start flooding the market .
On top of that , the GeForce has PhysX and 3D Vision two features that lack alternatives on the AMD side right now .
( To its credit , though , our Radeon HD 5850 can drive one more monitor than the GeForce . )
We ’ve included this Asus variant of the GTX 470 as a provisional recommendation , because Asus offers three years of warranty coverage regardless of whether the user registers or not almost better than some of the lifetime deals we ’ve seen , which often fall back to one year if you forget to sign up .
No retail - boxed GTX 470s seem to be available right now , though , so you may have to wait a little bit … or check out what else Newegg has in stock .
Our price search engine might also be a good resource .
Storage Some folks might want to complement all of this nice hardware with a state - of - the - art storage solution , so we ’ve thrown an SSD into the mix .
Corsair ’s Nova 128 GB solid - state drive delivers a fine combination of performance and capacity at a fairly reasonable price ( about 130 bucks less than Intel ’s 160 GB X25 - M ) .
Corsair has implemented TRIM support , which should keep used - state write speeds from sinking too low in WIndows 7 , and the firm quotes top sequential transfer speeds of 270 MB /s while reading and 195 MB /s while writing .
128 GB should be enough room to store an operating system and a few applications , too .
Other apps and files will have to sit on an auxiliary , mechanical hard drive , which is where WD ’s 2TB Caviar Green comes in .
The Green may be slower than 7,200 - RPM models , but it ’s much quieter , and you ’ll have to work hard to fill the drive up .
TV tuner The AVerMedia AVerTV Combo PCIe tuner of system guides past has faded out of online listings .
In its absence , we ’ve chosen Hauppauge ’s WinTV -HVR 1800 MCE kit .
Just like the AVerTV , this tuner has a PCI Express x1 interface , inputs for both analog and digital TV , support for ATSC and Clear QAM high - definition digital TV standards , a hardware MPEG encoder , Windows Vista certification , and a remote that works with Windows Media Center .
Newegg customers sound fairly happy with it , too .
Honey , I shrunk the Utility Player !
microATX and proud
And now , for the Spring system guide ’s one - off configuration , we present “ Honey , I shrunk the Utility Player ” an apt description of what ’s happened here .
We took some of the core components from our mid-range Utility Player build , strapped them to a microATX motherboard and enclosure , and biased our component choices in favor of low noise levels .
The result is a smaller , more discreet system that ’s just as potent and nearly as cheap .
The operating system
Which one is right for you ?
Before we begin , we should acknowledge that some readers may not feel comfortable with Windows ’ prominent place on this page .
We hold no particular grudge against Linux or other desktop operating systems , but we think most TR readers will want to stick with Windows .
For starters , most of you play PC games , and we ’ve tuned all of our main configs for gaming something Linux does n’t do nearly as well as Microsoft ’s OSes .
Also , we figure enthusiasts with enough expertise to run Linux on their primary desktops will already have a favorite Linux distribution picked out .
As for Mac OS X , we find both the dubious legality and the lack of official support for running it on standard PCs too off - putting .
Now , if you ’re buying a copy of Windows today , you should really be thinking about Windows 7 .
We explained in our review that this OS may well be Microsoft ’s finest to date , because it draws from Vista ’s strengths while adding a healthy dose of polish , not to mention improved performance and non-disastrous backward compatibility .
Building a new system with Windows 7 instead of Vista or XP is really a no - brainer at this point .
Just like its predecessors , Windows 7 comes in several different editions , three of which you ’ll find in stores : Home Premium , Professional , and Ultimate .
What makes them different from one another ?
The table below should help answer that question : Windows 7 Home Premium
Windows 7 Professional
Windows 7 Ultimate
New Aero features X X X Windows Search X X X Internet Explorer 8 X X X Windows Media Center X X X HomeGroups X X X Full - system Backup and Restore X X X Remote Desktop client X X X Backups across network X X Remote Desktop host X X Windows XP Mode X X Domain Join X X BitLocker X Interface language switching X Pricefull license $ 183.49 $ 274.49 $ 291.99 Priceupgrade license $ 109.99 $ 179.49 $ 199.99 Price OEM ( 64 - bit ) license $ 104.99 $ 139.99 $ 174.99 Price OEM ( 32 - bit ) license $ 104.99 $ 139.99 $ 174.99 Price Anytime Upgrade > $ 89.99 $ 139.99
As you can see , Windows 7 editions follow a kind of Russian nesting doll pattern : Professional has all of the Home Premium features , and Ultimate has everything .
Since most users probably wo n’t find the Ultimate edition ’s extras terribly exciting , the choice ought to come down to Home Premium vs. Professional for almost everyone .
Some of TR ’s editors like hosting Remote Desktop sessions and running network backups , so we ’d probably go with the Professional package unless we were on a tight budget .
However , we should also note that Windows 7 Home Premium includes some features formerly exclusive to more upscale editions , namely full - system backups and Previous Versions ( a.k.a. Shadow Copy ) .
See our review for more details .
If you go with Home Premium and find you need some of the Professional features down the road , you can always use the Anytime Upgrade program to step up .
It ’ll only set you back $ 90 .
Speaking of upgrades , you ’ll notice upgrade licenses are quite a bit cheaper than full ones .
That ’s because you need a legit version of Windows XP or Windows Vista to use them .
The edition does n’t matter , but you do need the previous OS to be activated and installed on your hard drive for the Windows 7 upgrade to work .
Mind you , Vista upgrade installers do n’t seem to protest when a user does a clean install of Vista without a product key and then runs an upgrade installation over that .
Windows 7 could allow for the same trick .
Microsoft does n’t sanction this method , however , and who knows how future updates to the Windows activation system might affect it .
To save even more , you could also opt for an OEM license .
Microsoft aims these at pre-built PCs , and for that reason , it prohibits users from carrying an OEM license over from one PC to another one .
You may therefore be forced to buy a new copy of Windows 7 after a major upgrade .
( Retail editions have no such limitation , as far as we ’re aware . )
Also unlike their retail brethren , OEM licenses only cover one version of the software  32 - bit or 64 - bit so you ’ll have to pick one or the other up front and stick with it .
That brings us to another point : should you go 32 - bit or 64 - bit ?
Since all of the processors we recommend in this guide are 64 - bit - capable and all but one of our systems has 4GB of memory or more , the x64 release strikes us as the most sensible choice .
This recommendation is relevant to folks who buy retail and upgrade editions , too you might have to ask Microsoft to ship you x64 installation media first , but installing an x64 variant looks like the best idea .
As we ’ve already explained , 32 - bit flavors of Windows only support up to 4GB of RAM , and that upper limit covers things like video memory .
In practice , that means that your 32 - bit OS will only be able to use 3 - 3.5 GB of system RAM on average and even less than 3GB if you have more than one discrete GPU .
With new OSes and games pushing the envelope in terms of memory use , the 4GB limit can get a little uncomfortable for an enthusiast PC .
There are some caveats , however .
64 - bit versions of Windows do n’t support 32 - bit drivers , and they wo n’t run 16 - bit software .
You ’ll probably want to make sure all of your peripherals have compatible drivers , and vintage game lovers may also have to check out emulators like DOSBox .
Still , hardware makers have improved x64 support quite a bit since Vista came out three years ago , so you ’ll probably be fine unless you have something like a really old printer .
( For some background on what makes 64 - bit computing different at a hardware level , have a look at our take on the subject . )
Suddenly there 's a glut of accomplished running backs looking for work .
The Philadelphia Eagles announced they will release RB Brian Westbrook less than 24 hours after LaDainian Tomlinson was cut by the Chargers .
" Brian is one of the greatest Eagles of all time and he is even a better person and leader , " said head coach Andy Reid on the team 's website .
" In my mind , there has not been a more versatile running back that the NFL has seen .
I had a conversation with Brian this morning to let him know .
This is by far the most difficult part of this job .
We wanted to make this move now in order to maximize Brian 's chances of landing with another NFL team . "
Westbrook will leave with more yards from scrimimage ( 9,785 ) than anyone in Eagles history .
His best year came in 2007 when he rushed for a career - best 1,333 yards while catching 90 balls for 771 yards ; his 2,104 yards from scrimmaged paced the league that year .
But Westbrook suffered through the least productive season since his rookie year in 2009 , a victim of recurring concussion problems .
He played in just eight games and managed just 455 yards from scrimmage .
" Brian Westbrook is one of the most electric players in the history of this franchise and is certainly also one of the most popular , " said team owenr Jeffrey Lurie .
" He was personally one of the my favorite players to watch each and every Sunday and his playmaking abilities , leadership and values will be missed . "
Westbrook , who has battled various injuries throughout his career though he'd never missed more than four games until last season , said earlier this month that he was , " 100 % sure that I would n't hang it up ( this offseason ) unless something crazy happens . "
The move leaves second - year man LeSean McCoy atop the Eagles ' depth chart at tailback , though they could be in the market for a complementary back , perhaps even the title - starved Tomlinson .

A Gracie Family Pictorial
No one can deny that the Gracie family is nothing short of legendary .
From Carlos Gracie Sr. all the way down to the newest Gracie members who are still actively competing in MMA or BJJ and everyone in between , the Gracie 's are the most influential family in the history of martial arts .
They will go down in history for revolutionizing the martial arts .
As with any influential figure , people love seeing pictures of the Gracie family .
To bring a somewhat reasonable method to the madness , we have organized the pictures in the order eldest Gracie family member to the youngest and included pictures of other influential individual such as Mitsuyo Maeda and Masahiko Kimura .

Mitsuyo Maeda was the Jiu-Jitsu / Judo champion that left Japan to help pioneer a Japanese colony in Brazil in 1914 , but he was known at the time for traveling the world making money as a fighter who took on all comers .
In fact , he was kicked out of the Kodokan because of this .
Maeda is the man credited with teaching the Gracie's his practical form of Jiu-Jitsu .

Carlos Gracie Sr .
Credited as the first person to learn Jiu-Jitsu from Mitsuyo Maeda .
He probably learned it at the same time along with his brothers ( except for Helio who was too young ) , but because he was the eldest brother and the one who initiated most of the challenges and fights , he is credited as the first to learn the art .
Carlos and his brothers opened the first Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy in 1925 .
Helio Gracie
Helio Gracie was the youngest of the Gracie brothers and because of his age , he was the last to learn Jiu-Jitsu .
He primarily learned it through his brothers .
Prof .
Helio is credited as being the person who really created Gracie Jiu-Jitsu because he took the techniques that his older brothers sifted through had kept from the effective art of Jiu-Jitsu and innovated them to require less power and implemented more leverage into the techniques due to his fraile physique .

As a follow - up to our earlier post on corporate earnings this season , we ’ve put together some longitudinal data courtesy of Bloomberg ’s wonderful little EA function , which those of you with a Bloomberg service can double check if you want to make sure we ’ve got our maths right .
Bloomberg data only goes back to Q405 earnings ( and shows up as Q106 reporting ) , but still , that ’s 17 periods including the current one , which is somewhat more than halfway finished .
And , yes indeedy , something weird is going on this quarter — but it may just be a continuation of a trend that started in the first quarter of last year .
The handy little EA function , remember , lets us look at earnings surprises ( and sales , too , if we ’re interested in that ) .
And it breaks the data down by geography — you can drill down to the individual country level , or keep it at regions , which is what we ’re doing here .
And if we compare EPS earnings surprises by region , and exclude the current quarter , we see a sharp difference between Western European companies and North American companies ( US , Canada , and , um , Bermuda — do n’t ask ) .
For Western European companies , it ’s pretty evenly split between positive and negative earnings surprises — in some quarters there are more positive surprises , and in some quarters there are more negative ones .
Over the entire period ( again , not including the current quarter ) , the positive / negative ratio is about as flat as flat can be — 1.01 times .
Here ’s what the data look like ( note that the Average does NOT include the data for the current quarter , since it ’s not yet finished , and that the data is as of 1 March ) :
( If you click on the chart , it magically becomes legible ! )
Now , this is really what you would more or less expect — all the percentages remain roughly the same over the entire period , except for the current one , where the total % of earnings surprises ( both positive and negative ) appears meaningfully higher than average .
Now , it may be that this will regress to the mean as the rest of earnings come through — we still have lots of companies to report .
So we ’ll just have to wait and see .
But if analysts are doing their jobs , then companies are doing what you would expect — some are a bit higher than expected , some are a bit lower , and it ’s roughly comparable over time .
If we look at North America ( which , let ’s face it , is mostly US companies ) , a different pattern emerges :
In fact , several differences are apparent .
First , there is no quarter when negative earnings surprises exceeded positive earnings surprises .
In fact , the average positive / negative ratio is 1.33 — there was only one quarter of Western European earnings that exceeded this ratio at all , and most quarters did n’t even approach this level .
So North American data seem to be positively biased relative to Western Europe .
Second , while negative surprises are a bit higher in North America than in Western Europe ( 20.73 % versus 18.64 % ) this does n’t look that material–it could be , I suppose , but I ’m not sure there ’s enough data here to say .
However , positive surprises are a whole lot higher — 27.06 % versus 18.78 % .
Even for a data set this small , this looks pretty compelling .
And this pattern has been pretty consistent over this entire period .
Third , it ’s this difference in positive surprises that accounts for the overall result of there being considerably more earnings surprises in North America than in Western Europe ( 47.43 % versus 37.42 % ) .
Lastly , nothing in any of this so far in any way explains the sharp escalation in positive earnings surprises in 4Q09 , where positive surprises account for 42 % of ALL earnings monitored by Bloomberg so far this period , and total surprises are nearly two - thirds of all reported earnings .
Again , let ’s be clear — we could still regress to the mean in the balance of this reporting season .
But that would still leave unexplained the fact that North American companies routinely generate positive surprises at what appears to be a higher rate than Western European companies .
Or , as we mentioned last time , North American analysts do a considerably poorer job of predicting earnings than do their European counterparts .
OK , now , this is all good fun for the statheads among us , but there are some needed caveats .
First , this is n’t a real longitudinal survey — for that , you would need a decade or two of data , and we do n’t have that through Bloomberg ( maybe Thomson Reuters does , but I do n’t subscribe to them ) .
Did a similar pattern emerge in the 2001 recession , for example ?
We do n’t know .
Second , we have no way of knowing at this point whether the relative size of the data sets has any impact — the North American data set is about four times the size of the Western European one .
It may be that there is a higher number of small cap names in the North American set that produces some excess variability — but that still does n’t explain the directionality of the data .
But it is a potential concern .
So we ’re back to the conundrum we mentioned last time — why do North American analysts consistently under - predict earnings in a way that their European counterparts do n’t ?
Well , European managements could be feeding more interesting data and commentary to analysts than their North American counterparts .
That ’s something I would have entertained as a possibility fifteen or even ten years ago , when that sort of interaction was pretty routine , but it ’s hard to see it occurring now , frankly .
Second , maybe North American analysts have gotten more burned than their European counterparts , and are therefore more conservative in their predictions .
The problem with this is that up to , say , the second quarter of 2009 , there ’s no evidence that North American analysts were burned at all — positive and negative surprises held pretty constant .
But there is one interesting aspect of the North American data prior to this past quarter , and that ’s the steady rise in the positive / negative surprise ratio during 2009 — it ’s higher each quarter .
But that ’s the only thing that really changes , and if anything it seems to derive from a decline in negative surprises during this period that mirrors an increase in positive surprises .
But even if the current quarter is a continuation of a previous trend , what accounts for that trend ?
Why do we care ?
Well , as is the case for anyone who works in the financial sector , I ’m interested in a number of things , one of the key ones being sentiment .
And we ’ve had several quarters now of positive earnings surprises which get touted by the likes of CNBC as being meaningful of , well , something .
We ’re booming into a recovery , earnings show .
Look how much better companies are doing .
Well , leaving aside the fact that in general many companies are still doing worse than they were a year or two ago , and the fact that one fundamental reason for decent earnings at all is the pace of restructurings ( ie , layoffs ) , what this might really show is that sentiment is possibly being distorted .
North American ( read Wall Street ) analysts are doing an even poorer job of predicting the future than they usually do , but the spin is that companies are doing better than expected , so party on , dude .
Given how much credence the business media in particular , and the investment community in general , places on these predictions , you would think that there might be some questions about whether this credence is properly placed .
As the old saying goes , prediction is very difficult , especially of the future .
If the current pattern holds , prediction is even more difficult that it was a year ago .
Such sensitive souls .
Perhaps we should pay less attention to these predictions — or , at the very least , less attention to the media spin-meisters and talking heads who still take them seriously .
Maybe it ’s time to remind people of that other old saying about Wall Street — “ Often wrong , never in doubt . ”

A group of space enthusiasts is attempting to preserve objects that have been left on the moon by astronauts .
The Lunar Legacy Project , headquartered at the University of New Mexico , has its eye on such moon litter as a Hasselblad camera , air sickness bags , astronaut boots , soil collection tools and plastic wrap .
This July 20 , 1969 , photo shows Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong , right , trudging across the moon 's surface , but he left a lot more than footprints behind , according to a space heritage group .
( ( Associated Press ) )
Beth O'Leary , co-founder of the group , says she 's particularly interested in items such as the lunar laser ranging retro reflector , a device that measures the distance between the moon and Earth by bouncing off light rays .
It was left behind by Apollo 11 .
Why is all this paraphernalia still on the moon ?
According to O'Leary , the first priority for astronauts was to collect specimens to take back to Earth .
That meant gathering rock and soil samples and leaving behind unnecessary clothing and tools that would weigh down the craft .
" They were told to jettison anything that was n't necessary , " she told CBC's As it Happens .
O'Leary says she 's afraid that if the moon becomes a tourist destination , people will remove some of the artifacts they find there , in the same way tourists have walked off with bits of the Parthenon in Greece .
To prevent that , she wants the moon designated a UNESCO world heritage site , a process that involves listing objects left there on state registers , getting these states to write up a historic landmark nomination , then moving the application process to the national realm .
" We all own the moon , " O'Leary said .
" It was n't one country that put people on the moon .
It was scientists and engineers from all over the world that made it possible for those people to take the first steps .
Beijing , China ( CNN ) --
China 's kindergartens and preschools increased security after another violent attack on children and teachers Friday .
The execution of a former doctor who stabbed eight children to death and wounded five others at an elementary school in eastern China last month failed to deter what police say are copycat attacks , state media reported .
" Chinese society has generated enormous pressure on individuals and some of those individuals have perhaps had emotional and psychological problems , " sociologist Ding Xueliang said .
" They want to cause general attention from the population and attacking kids perhaps is the best way from their perspective of achieving this objective . "
The latest attack came Friday , when a man armed with a hammer injured five preschool children in east China before setting himself on fire in a classroom suicide , a government spokesman told Xinhua news agency .
The attacker held two children in his arms as he poured gasoline over himself , the spokesman said .
Teachers in Weifang City , Shandong province , pulled the children away as the man died , the spokesman said .
All five victims from the attack were hospitalized with injuries that were not life - threatening , he said .
The incident followed at least three other attacks in China in recent weeks in which assailants have killed or wounded students .
On Thursday , at least 28 children were injured when a man with a knife attacked a kindergarten in east China , state media said .
Most of the victims were 4 - year - olds and three of the children were in critical condition .
Police said they have arrested a 47 - year - old suspect .
The incident happened in Taixing city in Jiangsu province .
A day earlier , a man attacked 18 students and a teacher with a knife at a primary school in southern China 's Guangdong province , Xinhua said .
It was not immediately known how many people were injured or whether there were any fatalities in the attack Wednesday .
The man , described as being in his 40s , entered the school in the afternoon and attacked before he was seized by police , Xinhua reported .
This week 's attacks came despite the execution of Zheng Minsheng , 42 , a former community doctor convicted for the March 23 attack .
Zheng , executed by a firing squad in Nanping City on Wednesday , told investigators he carried out the attack because he was frustrated by " failures in his romantic life and in society , " according to Xinhua .
China Daily newspaper quoted Nanjing University sociology professor Zhu Li saying Zheng 's attack inspired copycats .
" Some people may not have thought about stabbing school children , but due to the media 's coverage of such a case , they got an idea , " Zhu said .
Chinese authorities have begun teaching safety awareness in school curriculums , China Daily reported .
Officials also have tightened security in schools by hiring extra guards to escort students to and from class .
Students , teachers and parents are receiving counseling to help deal with the trauma , according to authorities .

SAN ANTONIO — A West Texas teen filed a lawsuit Thursday against the Archdiocese of San Antonio and Archbishop Jose Gomez alleging repeated sexual assaults by a parish priest , who he says the church 's leadership should have known was abusive .
The allegations came just days after Gomez was named to a high - profile post leading the Archdiocese of Los Angeles , where he is scheduled to be formally introduced to parishioners in May .
The lawsuit accuses the Rev. John M. Fiala of repeatedly sexually assaulting the teen , including twice forcing him to have sex at gunpoint when Fiala was the pastor at Sacred Heart of Mary Parish in the remote community of Rocksprings .
The lawsuit alleges the incidents occurred in 2007 and 2008 , during Gomez 's tenure overseeing a swath of South and West Texas .
“ We believe that they knew there were serious issues with Father Fiala , ” the teen 's attorney , Tom Rhodes , said of church leadership .
“ When you look at his assignment history , there were gaps .
He was moved around quite a bit .
We believe the church knew he was a serious problem . ”
Archdiocese spokesman Pat Rodgers said he could not comment directly on the litigation , but said in a prepared statement that when Edwards County authorities told the archdiocese in 2008 that they were investigating accusations of custodial interference — not sexual abuse — by Fiala , the priest was removed from ministry and the parish was told about the investigation .
Fiala has not been charged .
A listed phone number for him was disconnected on Thursday .
Gomez , who has been the archbishop in San Antonio since 2004 , also told Fiala 's religious order about the investigation and Fiala 's suspension , Rodgers said .
Fiala is no longer in priestly ministry , according to the order , The Society of Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity .
The lawsuit alleges Fiala had sexual contact with the teen , now 18 , once or twice a month under the pretext of giving him private catechism lessons .
Rhodes said Fiala sexually assaulted the boy and threatened to hurt him and his family .
Following two alleged rapes on out - of - town trips , the priest gave the teen a car , Rhodes said .
The teen later gave the car back and ran away .
The attorney said that while the boy 's mother complained about Fiala taking the teen out of town without her permission , the family was not aware of the alleged abuse until the teen tried to commit suicide .
A counselor reported the allegations to the authorities .
The Edwards County Sheriff 's Office confirmed it has conducted a criminal investigation of Fiala , but a message left for the sheriff seeking details about the investigation was not returned on Thursday .
The Catholic child molestation stories keep getting worse and worse .
Now from Brazil comes the story of Monsignor Luiz Marques Barbosa ’s alleged sexual abuse of young boys .
The worst part … street vendors are selling video of one boy ’s molestation .
For $ 5 to $ 10 , vendors here will sell you the video , downloading it directly into your cellphone via Bluetooth .
The price depends on the quality and length of the footage .
According to one street vendor , the most popular download is the “ complete ” version .
Buyers , he says , are “ almost everybody — not just the curious . ”

Hard to believe that " V " could get low ratings after 3 different show runners and about a 2 year hiatus .
" Breaking Bad " is the new " Lost . "
Concession speeches are never easy and , as he explained that the Champions League was now virtually a lost cause , Rafael Benitez 's voice was hoarse and cracked .
His mood was not made any easier by a Danish journalist 's attempts to quiz him on the life and times of Daniel Agger while he was doing it .
In the wake of a strangely low - key goalless draw against Fulham in the Anfield sunshine , the Liverpool manager 's thoughts would have turned to the lost glory rather than the lost revenue that failure to qualify for the Champions League entails – anything up to £ 45 m .
But it will have a significant impact on the sale of the club and in deciding Benitez 's own future .
Although Liverpool 's owners , Tom Hicks and George Gillett , have appointed Barclays Capital and will appoint a new chairman , Martin Broughton from British Airways , to oversee the sale of the club , they have been told that they are now unlikely to get £ 500 m for Liverpool and the eventual figure may be closer to £ 400m .
" The impact of not being in the Champions League is enormous – it is around £ 30 m off the bottom line , more if you get to the later stages , " said Professor Chris Brady , the dean of the BPP Business School , who specialises in football finance .
" It is absolutely prime non-commercial revenue and you get it in hard cash .
I was hearing this morning that they [ Hicks and Gillett ] were valuing the club at £ 600 m .
I would suggest that is unrealistic by £ 100 m and the price could come down further than that .
If you take over a club not in the Champions League , you might need to spend anything up to £ 100 m to get them back up there .
The club still needs a new stadium that would cost around £ 350 m .
The total investment needed to take over Liverpool and run it properly would be £ 900 m to £ 1bn . "
At the weekend , Benitez , who was still publicly confident about re-qualification for the Champions League , suggested that Liverpool needed a minimum investment of £ 60 m on at least three players to regain their competitive edge .
The relationship between the size of a club's wage bill and success is a well - known correlation and Liverpool 's is only the fifth biggest in the Premier League .
Benitez alleged that Peter Crouch was able to substantially increase his salary by moving to Tottenham and any takeover would have to come with an implicit understanding that this wage bill would have to rise .
The club 's bankers , the Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia , have now all but agreed to give Hicks and Gillett another six months to pay back £ 100 m of the £ 237 m they have borrowed against the club , a sum that was due to be repaid in July .
However , although many on the Kop would welcome the departure of the owners , any takeover would put Benitez 's job in peril – and not just because billionaire owners like Roman Abramovich at Chelsea and Abu Dhabi United at Manchester City showed themselves all too ready to dispense with the managers they inherited .
Yesterday , Liverpool 's vice - captain , Jamie Carragher , pointed out that if they do fail to qualify for the Champions League , the principal reason would be the club 's away form , which he compared to that of Wolverhampton Wanderers .
That is ultimately Benitez 's responsibility .
" One of the chief reasons for not getting rid of Benitez is that you would have to pay up the majority of a five - year contract , " said Professor Brady .
" Giving him and his backroom staff a £ 10 - 15 m pay - off might be a substantial obstacle to the current owners .
But if you have paid £ 500 m for Liverpool and may have to invest another £ 500 m , then paying off Rafa Benitez suddenly becomes peanuts . "
With a price tag of between £ 400 - 500 m and a need for substantial investment in a stadium that has more than 120 fewer corporate boxes than the Emirates Stadium , Broughton and Barclays may find the Far East the likeliest place to find a buyer .
" The Liverpool brand there is bigger there than anywhere else in the world , " said Professor Brady .
" If you land at Bangkok Airport , the first thing they ask if they know you are English is about Liverpool .
It would probably appeal to a consortium rather than a single investor .
Dubai International Capital [ the consortium beaten to ownership of Liverpool by Hicks and Gillett in 2007 ] may be interested now that the Americans are offering total control .
" But there is still money to be made in the Premier League , not so much by running a club but by selling it on . "
Three years ago , Hicks and Gillett paid £ 174 m for the club , which had a debt of £ 44 m .
If they sell for £ 500 m , they will still make a profit of £ 30 m – not a bad return for three years ' work , even with all that bad feeling from the Kop .
Torres struggling to be fit for Madrid return
Fernando
Torres is struggling to be fit for what would be an emotional return to Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals of the Europa League .
The striker spent yesterday in Barcelona in the care of surgeon Ramon Gugat , who examined the knee injury that has plagued him throughout the season .
Liverpool said in a statement that Torres " will continue to receive treatment over the next few days – with the injury being reassessed later this week . "
Torres , who missed the goalless draw with Fulham , is unlikely to be risked in Monday 's encounter with West Ham at Anfield but his manager , Rafael Benitez , would hope to start him at Torres 's former home , the Vicente Calderon , on 22 April .

Why Hicks and Gillett are banking on Barclays
Q. What is Barclays Capital 's involvement with Liverpool ?
A. Tom Hicks and George Gillett last week called in Barclays Capital , the investment banking arm of Barclays , to help them sell off the club .
BarCap offers a range of services to corporate clients including merger and acquisition ( M&A ) advisory .
The American owners have failed to secure a cash injection of £ 100 m from a minority investor , and are now prepared to listen to offers for the entire club .
BarCap has been brought in to advise the owners and seek out potential bidders .
It will then manage the process as it develops .
Q . What does this mean for the club ?
A . The appointment is a sign that the US owners are stepping up their plans to sell the club .
The Americans called in BarCap after their existing advisers – Rothschild and Merrill Lynch – failed to find a buyer .
BarCap has built up its M&A teams in Europe and North America .
It has also recently hired some heavy - hitting bankers in Asia whose contacts books could prove crucial if , as some insiders believe , there is significant interest from the region .
Q. Why bring in Martin Broughton ?
A. Broughton is currently the chairman of British Airways , and has been brought in as independent chairman of Liverpool to lend the club credibility among potential investors .
This marks another strand to its strategy to knock the business into shape to attract buyers .
The existing management structure , including managing director Christian Purslow who is well respected , will remain in place to help facilitate the sale .
Purslow has been instrumental in building Liverpool 's presence in Asia .
Q. Why the urgency ?
A. Hicks and Gillett are struggling to refinance their £ 237 m debts , and although it seems Royal Bank of Scotland and Wachovia will offer six months ' breathing space , the financial situation needs to be sorted out .
Q. Has BarCap taken on the debt ?
A. No .
It remains with RBS and Wachovia .
However , BarCap has significant debt market operations , and could provide financing services if crucial to securing a deal .
Q. Where does this leave Benitez ?
A. Weakened .
While new owners often keep executives , the managers do n't last long .
Roman Abramovich quickly lost patience with Claudio Ranieri at Chelsea , and Sheikh Mansour sacked Mark Hughes at Manchester City .
While the £ 15 m termination fee is seen as prohibitive , should a buyer pay hundreds of millions for the club , they would be unlikely to baulk at the extra cost .
Q. What are the benefits of buying Liverpool ?
A . The club is a global brand name , and such assets do n't come up for sale that often .
The club has also signed lucrative sponsorship deals with Standard Chartered and Adidas .

Update : read our latest mobile phone reviews and news .
The days when the T - Mobile G1 was the big cheese in the Android world are happily gone .
Now , the Android OS is being used to create some truly industry leading handsets and HTC is behind some of the best .
But which is the one for you to spend your hard - earned on ?
The Hero - a - like Legend ?
The insanely powerful but stupidly monikered Desire ?
Or do you trust your mobile dollar in Google with the Nexus One ?
The HTC Legend
What makes a phone good ?
Well , the easy answer is one that packs the most into the smallest frame - but Apple came along with the iPhone and changed that perception almost overnight .
No , apparently what 's best is the combination of beautiful hardware and a slick user experience - so step forward the HTC Legend .
If you imagine an HTC Hero met an Apple Macbook Air one night in a bar , got along famously and ended up getting so drunk that they woke up shame - facedly together in the morning , this would be the result .
The HTC Legend is hewn from a single block of aluminium , giving it a polished and expensive look , in the Marmite - esque ' lip ' chassis .
Not only that , but the 3.2 - inch screen is actually an OLED , which means colours are gloriously saturated and the blacks are wonderfully dark .
The HTC Sense UI is also in full force here , and while we could witter on about the social networking integration in the contacts menu or the improved camera UI , we just care about the fact we can pinch the home screen in to view all our open widgets in one glance ( called Leap view ) .
We 're also digging the ability to see all our friends ' feeds in one place through Friend Stream - we know that it's an option on the HTC Desire as well , but it seems to suit the Legend a little more .
It 's a smooth , sleek and ultimately satisfying to hold phone - and it's packing a fair whack of grunt under the hood as well .
Who 's gonna buy the Legend ?
If you 're the kind of person that values form as much as functionality ( and for some reason do n't want the iPhone ) then you should definitely give the HTC Legend the once over .
Sure , it 's not got the processing power of the Desire or the bells and whistles of Google 's device , but it looks superb , handles better than most phones out there and what 's more - it should n't break the bank when it appears .

President Hugo Chávez ’s government is already facing broad public ire over electricity shortages , and the state electricity company fears that the fires could diminish the forests that help gather and release water , and boost river sediments into the Guri , the hydroelectric complex that provides Venezuela with most of its electricity .

But many Pemón , along with some of the scholars who study them , say the fires help prevent grasses from building into biomass for much larger fires that could tear through the region , in the way vast wildfires devastated parts of Indonesia in 1997 .
“ Outsiders think we are primitive savages , but they are ignorant of our ways , ” said Leonardo Criollo , 46 , a Pemón leader whose village , Yunék , sits in the shadow of the Chimantá Massif , a collection of 11 tepuis from which waterfalls descend from mile - high rock walls .
“ We burn so that we may live in harmony with the savannas around us . ”
The clash of views on the centuries - old practice is part of a broader debate over the sovereignty and proper management of indigenous lands .
Much of the Gran Sabana is cordoned off as either national park or military territory .
But some fire ecologists claim that indigenous people around the world have long used fire to alter their ecosystems and shape regions like the prairies of the American Midwest .
Accounts of the origins of the Pemón in the Gran Sabana differ , but some historians say they may have migrated here about five centuries ago from the coast of what is now Guyana , after incursions by European explorers .
Paleoecologists also debate how much of the Gran Sabana was originally covered by forests , and when fire - setting by humans here actually got under way .
On 7 February , the New Orleans Saints will make their first ever appearance in American football 's Super Bowl , traveling to Miami to face off against the Indianapolis Colts in a competition that 's as much about the commercials as the game itself .
Also making an appearance for the first time will be an anti-abortion ad , paid for by the evangelical group Focus on the Family and featuring star college quarterback Tim Tebow , known for painting Bible quotations under his eyes during games .
The ad , " Celebrate Family , Celebrate Life " , cost Focus on the Family as much as $ 2.8 m , will reportedly tell the story of how Tebow 's mother defied medical recommendations to have an abortion and instead gave birth to Tim , and may be viewed by as many as 100 million Americans .
Reminiscent of the anti-abortion ad created by the anti-choice Catholic group Fidelis , which was rejected for broadcast last year , " Celebrate Family , Celebrate Life " does n't have the decidedly inconvenient problem of having been produced without the participation of its central figure .
( The Fidelis ad , called " Imagine Spot 1 " , ostensibly encouraged viewers to " imagine " the possibilities for a foetus shown in an ultrasound , but helpfully did the imagining for them , as text onscreen , with a backdrop of crescendoing violin music , read : " This child 's future is a broken home … he will be abandoned by his father … his single mother will struggle to raise him … despite the hardships he will endure … this child … will become … the first African - American President . "
The video then cuts to a picture of President Barack Obama , accompanied by the text : " Life . Imagine the potential . " )
The message of this year 's ad nonetheless carries the same implicit message : Imagine if Tim Tebow 's mother had aborted him .
If you do n't find it quite as inspiring to imagine the world without a successful collegiate athlete as it is to imagine the world without the trailblazing president of a global superpower , well , that 's your problem .
And it 's your problem , too , if you happen to object to an anti-abortion premise that makes no distinction between an ill woman with a wanted pregnancy deciding not to terminate , and a woman with an unwanted pregnancy .
Wantedness is a variable with which manipulative musings like these sorts of adverts do n't concern themselves – and not just because their sponsors are n't in the business of making wanted lives more livable , despite their claims to be " pro-life " .
It is , simply , more convenient – and decidedly so – to pretend that it makes no difference in the course and potential of a life whether the person living it was wanted by her or his parents .
Their message would be eminently more complicated if they did not diligently ignore the observable ways in which parental resentments born of imposed obligations stifle the lives in their charge .
Better , then , and easier , to tacitly reinforce that dusty old chestnut about how a mothering instinct will " kick in " postpartum , irrespective of one 's desire to mother , as if the willingness to assume responsibility for another life is merely a foregone conclusion etched into every woman 's very DNA , and not a decision individuals make with their ability to reason .
Which is not to say that such ads make no effort to appeal to women 's reason .
Implicit , and not very subtly so , is the narrative that a pregnant woman should prostrate herself at the feet of the Fates because of the possibility that she may give birth to A Great Man .
And let us not mince words :
It is no coincidence that we are meant to " imagine " the snuffing out of a man 's potential via abortion , forestalling as it does our " imagining " the protagonist 's potential come to a screeching , shuddering halt in the shadow of an unwanted pregnancy that cannot be terminated .
Imagine that .
How Courgette works
As I described in Smaller is faster ( and safer too ) , we wrote a new differential compression algorithm for making Google Chrome updates significantly smaller .
We want smaller updates because it narrows the window of vulnerability .
If the update is a tenth of the size , we can push ten times as many per unit of bandwidth .
We have enough users that this means more users will be protected earlier .
A secondary benefit is that a smaller update will work better for users who do n't have great connectivity .
Rather than push put a whole new 10 MB update , we send out a diff that takes the previous version of Google Chrome and generates the new version .
We tried several binary diff algorithms and have been using bsdiff up until now .
We are big fans of bsdiff - it is small and worked better than anything else we tried .
But bsdiff was still producing diffs that were bigger than we felt were necessary .
So we wrote a new diff algorithm that knows more about the kind of data we are pushing - large files containing compiled executables .
Here are the sizes in bytes for the recent 190.1-> 190.4 update on the developer channel :
Full update 10,385,920 bsdiff update 704,512 Courgette update 78,848
The small size in combination with Google Chrome 's silent update means we can update as often as necessary to keep users safe .
Compiled code
The problem with compiled applications is that even a small source code change causes a disproportional number of byte level changes .
When you add a few lines of code , for example , a range check to prevent a buffer overrun , all the subsequent code gets moved to make room for the new instructions .
The compiled code is full of internal references where some instruction or datum contains the address ( or offset ) of another instruction or datum .
It only takes a few source changes before almost all of these internal pointers have a different value , and there are a lot of them - roughly half a million in a program the size of chrome.dll .
The source code does not have this problem because all the entities in the source are symbolic .
Functions do n't get committed to a specific address until very late in the compilation process , during assembly or linking .
If we could step backwards a little and make the internal pointers symbolic again , could we get smaller updates ?
Courgette uses a primitive disassembler to find the internal pointers .
The disassembler splits the program into three parts : a list of the internal pointer 's target addresses , all the other bytes , and an ' instruction ' sequence that determines how the plain bytes and the pointers need to be interleaved and adjusted to get back the original input .
We call this an ' assembly language ' because we can run an ' assembler ' to process the instructions and emit a sequence of bytes to recover the original file .
The non-pointer part is about 80 % of the size of the original program , and because it does not have any pointers mixed in , it tends to be well behaved , having a diff size that is in line with the changes in the source code .
Simply converting the program into the assembly language form makes the diff produced by bsdiff about 30 % smaller .
We bring the pointers under control by introducing ' labels ' for the addresses .
The addresses are stored in an array and the list of pointers is replaced by a list of array indexes .
The array is a primitive ' symbol table ' , where the names of the symbols , or ' labels ' are the integer indexes into the array .
What we get from the symbol table is a degree of freedom in how we express the program .
We can move the addresses around in the array provided we make the corresponding changes to the list of indexes .
How do we use this to generate a better diff ?
With bsdiff we would compute the new file , ' update ' from the ' original ' like this :
server :
diff = bsdiff ( original , update )
transmit diff
client :
receive diff
update = bspatch ( original , diff )
( The server would pre-compute diff so that it could be transmitted immediately )
Courgette transforms the program into the primitive assembly language and does the diffing at the assembly level :
server :
asm_old = disassemble ( original ) asm_new = disassemble ( update ) asm_new_adjusted = adjust ( asm_new , asm_old ) asm_diff = bsdiff ( asm_old , asm_new_adjusted ) transmit asm_diff
client : receive asm_diff asm_old = disassemble ( original ) asm_new_adjusted = bspatch ( asm_old , asm_diff ) update = assemble ( asm_new_adjusted )
The special sauce is the adjust step .
Courgette moves the addresses within the asm_new symbol table to minimize the size of asm_diff .
Addresses in the two symbol tables are matched on their statistical properties which ensures the index lists have many long common substrings .
The matching does not use any heuristics based on the surrounding code or debugging information to align the addresses .
More than one executable , less than an executable
For the above to work , ' assemble ' and ' disassemble ' have to be strict inverses , and ' original ' and ' update ' have to be single well - formed executable files .
It is much more useful if ' original ' and ' update ' can contain several executables as well as a lot of non-compiled files like JavaScript and PNG images .
For Google Chrome , the ' original ' and ' update ' are an archive file containing all the files needed to install and run the browser .
We can think of a differential update as a prediction followed by a correction , a kind of guessing game .
In its simplest form ( just bsdiff / bspatch ) , the client has only a dumb guess , ' original ' , so the server sends a binary diff to correct ' original ' to the desired answer , ' update ' .
Now what if the server could pass a hint that could be used to generate a better guess , but we are not sure the guess will be useful ?
We could insure against losing information by using the original and the guess together as the basis for the diff :
server :
hint = make_hint ( original , update )
guess = make_guess ( original , hint ) diff = bsdiff ( concat ( original , guess ) , update )
transmit hint , diff
client
receive hint , diff guess = make_guess ( original , hint ) update = bspatch ( concat ( original , guess ) , diff )
This system has some interesting properties .
If the guess is the empty string , then we have the same diff as with plain bsdiff .
If the guess is perfect , the diff will be tiny , simply a directive to copy the guess .
Between the extremes , the guess could be a perfect subset of ' update ' .
Then bsdiff will construct a diff that mostly takes material from the perfect prediction and the original to construct the update .
This is how Courgette deals with inputs like tar files containing both executable files and other files .
The hint is the location of the embedded executables together with the asm_diff for each one .
Once we have this prediction / correction scheme in place we can use it to reduce the amount of work that the client needs to do .
Executables often have large regions that do not contain internal pointers , like the resource section which usually contains string tables and various visual elements like icons and bitmaps .
The disassembler generates an assembly language program which pretty much says ' here is a big chunk of constant data ' , where the data is identical to the original file .
bsdiff then generates a diff for the constant data .
We can get substantially the same effect by omitting the pointer - free regions from the disassembly and letting the final diff do the work .
Source Code
Everyone loves source , so you can find it here :
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/courgette/+/master
Summary
Courgette transforms the input into an alternate form where binary diffing is more effective , does the differential compression in the transformed space , and inverts the transform to get the patched output in the original format .
With careful choice of the alternate format we can get substantially smaller updates .
We are writing a more detailed paper on Courgette and will post an update when it is ready .
( Health.com ) --
Eating as little as a quarter of an ounce of chocolate each day -- an amount equal to about one small Easter egg -- may lower your risk of experiencing a heart attack or stroke , a new study has found .
For best results , the chocolate should be dark , experts say .
" Dark chocolate exhibits the greatest effects , milk chocolate fewer , and white chocolate no effects , " says the lead author of the study , Brian Buijsse , a nutritional epidemiologist at the German Institute of Human Nutrition , in Nuthetal , Germany .
In the study , Buijsse and his colleagues followed nearly 20,000 people for an average of eight years .
The researchers surveyed the study participants about their chocolate consumption ( as well as the rest of their diet ) , and also tracked the heart attacks and strokes that occurred in the group .
Compared with people who rarely ate chocolate ( about one bar per month ) , the people who ate the most chocolate ( slightly more than one bar per week ) had a 27 percent and 48 percent reduced risk of heart attack and stroke , respectively , the researchers found .
Health.com :
How to make chocolate a healthy indulgence
The heart benefits observed in the study may be due in part to lower blood pressure , the study notes .
Previous studies have suggested that eating chocolate can lower blood pressure , and the researchers observed a similar -- though less pronounced -- association in this study .
" The good news is that chocolate is not as bad as we used to think , and may even lower the risk of heart disease and stroke , " says Buijsse .
" The bad news , at least for some of us , is that the amounts that are needed to benefit from these effects appear to be quite low . "
In other words , these findings do n't mean that you should stuff yourself with chocolate Easter eggs .
Chocolate is high in calories , and , as with any such food , eating too much of it can swell your waistline and harm your health in other ways .

" This is only one small egg per day , " says Buijsse .
" Eating higher amounts will most likely result in weight gain .
If people start eating small amounts of chocolate , it should replace something else , preferably other high - calorie sweets or snacks . "
The people in the study were part of a larger study on the effect of diet and lifestyle on cancer risk .
For the current study , Buijsse and his colleagues excluded anyone with a history of heart disease or stroke , and also controlled for age , diet , lifestyle , and other factors .
Still , they note that factors not recorded in the surveys -- rather than chocolate consumption alone -- could have been responsible for some or all of the health benefits they observed .
The study had some other important limitations .
Most notably , the researchers did not determine whether the study participants ate dark , milk , or white chocolate .

Using one of the surveys administered during the study , the researchers estimated that 57 percent of the participants ate milk chocolate , 24 percent ate dark chocolate , and 2 percent ate white chocolate .
This data , however , came from a subset of just under 1,600 participants , so they are merely estimates that may not have been borne out in the full study population .
Experts believe that natural compounds known as flavonoids ( or flavonols ) , which appear to promote artery health and reduce inflammation , are responsible for the cardiovascular benefits that have been associated with chocolate consumption .
Health.com : Food swaps that cut cholesterol , not taste
Flavonols are found in cocoa , and dark chocolate contains more cocoa than milk chocolate does .
" The benefits of chocolate come from flavonoids , and those are mainly found in dark chocolate , not Easter eggs , which are usually milk chocolate and have a lot of saturated fat , " says Julia Zumpano , a registered clinical dietitian at the Cleveland Clinic , in Ohio .
" I usually recommend less than one ounce of dark chocolate a day -- a tiny square -- for heart health , " she adds .
" The chocolate should be at least 70 percent cocoa with limited added sugar . "

This study is merely the latest to point to the heart benefits of chocolate .
In addition to lower blood pressure , cocoa consumption has been linked to improved blood vessel function , lower LDL ( or bad cholesterol ) , and higher HDL ( good cholesterol ) in recent years .
Despite their findings , Buijsse and his colleagues caution that more research , namely randomized trials on the heart benefits of chocolate , is needed .
Buijsse admits to being conservative about his own chocolate consumption .
" If I eat chocolate , which is not on a daily basis , I limit my intake to a small piece , " he says .

Elliott Bay Book Co. is n’t the only new book store planning a Capitol Hill opening .
Ada ’s Technical Books will be located in the Loveless Building and is scheduled to be ready to serve Seattle ’s tech and geek community starting in mid-June 2010 .
The bookstore is named for Ada Lovelace , a 19th Century pioneer in computer programming .
She is celebrated today as a symbol of all the great women who add to the advancement of technology .
According to the Ada ’s website :
Our goals are to bring a valuable resource to the technical community in Seattle by carrying a large selection of new , used , & rare books on Computers , Electronics , Physics , Math , and Science .
We also hope to foster education and innovation in the local community by hosting monthly meet - ups , book signings , and training workshops .
The store will also have a lounge area and refreshments for customers to plug in and hang out .
In addition to books , Ada ’s will also carry a wide selection of puzzles , brain teasers , and gadgets .
I asked Danielle , one of Ada ’s Technical Books owners , a few questions via e-mail :
Why do you think a technical book store is needed on Capitol Hill ?
Capitol Hill in particular , but Seattle in general , has a large , technical community .
There are no technical bookstores in the city or on the Eastside .
We think Capitol Hill is a great place to start one because of the large technical community that already lives and works here , and the number of businesses , such as Metrix Create : Space , that are starting to pop up around Cap Hill that are targeted for that community .
What kind of events to you plan to host ?
We plan on having an “ author of the month ” every month .
Throughout the month , we will feature books written by this author and books that he / she recommends for general reading .
At the end of the month , the author will come in and give a free lecture ( or a reading , depending on the author ) .
We will also occasionally host workshops with the authors over the weekend .
Along with that , we would love to host meet - ups of different technical groups at the store and encourage people to use the space for work , research , and collaboration .
We will carry fast Wi -Fi and drinks along with our books .
What inspired you to open the store ?
We currently work in the technical industry and we love visiting technical bookstores in other cities … we only wish there were one here .
So , we decided to start one .
We are excited about not only carrying great , highly technical books and technical leisure books , but also about carrying some geeky extras .
We think this will have a draw for both the technical people in Cap Hill , but also those who do n’t know what to get their geeky friends as gifts .
For the last 30 years , ALTA has provided language training to corporate clients and government agents whose relocation to foreign countries requires them to achieve high levels of proficiency in a new language .
High proficiency includes the ability to communicate in an advanced way with native speakers of the new language — a range of people from professionals who use specialized terminology , to everyday people encountered while navigating a new culture : grocers , neighbors , taxi drivers , lawyers , and doctors .
Our experience has taught us a lot about language acquisition : the best methods , how long it takes to become fluent , the most helpful exercises , and the importance of going beyond words to learn the nuances of the culture .
If you ’ve decided to learn a new language but do n’t know where to start , here are five tips that will get you going in the right direction .
1. Self - guided Programs versus Instructor - led Programs
Our experience has taught us that the best way to acquire a new language is through personal customized training led by a professional instructor who is a native speaker of the target language .
There are also many self - guided language programs that may be a good place to start for individuals with zero knowledge of the new language .
These resources are unlikely to guide learners beyond basic proficiency levels — greetings , basic requests , and so forth , but many of them do provide good introductions to the new language , and a bit of a foundation before starting intensive training .
Self guided options include mp3/cd and book based courses by the Foreign Service Institute and , for free , the Massachusets Institute of Technology ’s Open Courseware , a collection of activities , notes , and audio / video lectures .
Community colleges and intensive language institutions like Middlebury ’s Language Schools offer the advantage of complete immersion in the language — no English allowed — and you ’re forced to keep on track with the study plan .
Although learning on your own may be more cost - effective , people with serious language goals and the means to pay tuition would do well to consider total immersion programs .

2. Practice Makes Perfect
An important element to learning a language , no matter what method you choose , is to really study .
Every day you need to set aside time in your schedule to practice reading , writing , speaking , and listening .
Here are a few ideas to get you out of the coursework and into real life situations :
Watch a foreign film without subtitles .
You might not understand everything that goes on , but it is a good way to use context and cultural clues to learn words — and to hear how everyday speech sounds like in that language .
Read one newspaper article in your target language every day .
Not only will you catch up on the latest news from around the globe , you ’ll also hone your reading comprehension skills .
Log onto sites like italkie and chat with a language exchange partner .
It ’s like having a pen pal in the other language , but via video feed !
Improve your writing skills by starting a journal in the other language .
After you write something , submit it to Lang - 8 , a language exchange website that allows you to submit writing in a foreign language and then have a native speaker correct it for you .
You can then , in turn , help others learn your native language by doing the same for them .
3. Focus on the Vocabulary
Chances are , if you know 1000 of the most common vocabulary words in any language , then you can follow 85 % of normal speech .
Make flash cards of common verbs , nouns , and adjectives and review them on a daily basis .
Every time you run across a new word , make a note of it — and then remember to review it until you recognize it on sight / speech .
Vocabulary is n’t everything , but it is a huge facet of any language .
4. Follow Through
A day will come , whether one week into learning a language or after several months , when you need a break .
No matter how long you need to take off , do n’t forget to hit the books again .
After taking time off from the language , simply start by reviewing the last couple of activities / chapter / vocabulary words that you worked on .
Spend a day or two reviewing to make certain you know it before you move onto more material .
Do n’t make a habit of taking time off , but remember that it ’s ok to take a break every now and then — as long as you remember to put your nose back to the grindstone again .
5. Do n’t Stress the Small Stuff
A huge hurdle for many language learners is the need to say and understand everything perfectly .
While that ’s a good thing , remember , do n’t stress out !
You ’ve just started to learn an entirely new language , something you did n’t grow up hearing spoken in your household or taught at your school .
It is natural to mix up words and phrases .
Learning a new language is n’t fast or easy , it takes time and work , so do n’t be frustrated when you do n’t pick up everything on the first try — with the proper guidance , and hard work , you will reach your goal .

If you spend as much time as I do worrying about the coming zombie apocalypse ( and let 's face it , you 're reading GeekDad so in all likelihood it's at least in the back of your mind ) , clear some space on your bookshelf beside Dr.Spock and pick up a copy of The Zombie Combat Manual : A Guide To Fighting The Living Dead , by Roger Ma .
Not only will you learn how to defend yourself against the shuffling menace , but Ma dedicates a chapter of his book to the critical topic of protecting your children during a zombie outbreak .
The Zombie Combat Manual was a great read that I completed in only three sessions - not because it 's shallow or particularly short ( for the record , it clocks in at around 300 pages ) , but because it was entertaining and quick paced .
Author Roger
Ma presents the book as a combat manual that focuses on hand - to - hand fighting or small weapons use , based on the premise that while guns may be more effective at a distance , Murphy 's Law dictates that at some point during an outbreak , you 'll be facing a zombie without the benefit of a firearm .
And survival favors the prepared .
Covering everything from an effective exercise regimen to zombie vulnerabilities , weapon selection , defensive equipment , child protection and even the reality of decapitation during combat ( it 's much harder to achieve than you might think based on what you see in movies ) , the book is also sprinkled with sections where survivors recount their experiences .
Underestimation of the undead is a common theme in these stories .
Gamers will appreciate the way weapons are presented as different classes , each complete with a ranking of effectiveness against zombies , an expected lifespan ( measured in zombie engagements ) , skill level required , availability and cost .
Using this system , a common screwdriver , for example is considered to be highly effective , good for 100 + zombie engagements , requires a very high skill level ( best results are achieved when close enough to drive the blade up from under the zombie 's chin ) , but it 's very common and very inexpensive .
Since this is GeekDad , a few words on the Child Protection chapter might be in order .
First of all , in case the talk of decapitation and driving screwdrivers into zombie skulls was n't a strong enough clue , let me point out that the book itself is not for your kids .
Besides the graphic description of zombie combat , it 's complete with black and white illustrations that effectively showcase the results of different attacks , so keep the book to yourselves .
Among
Ma 's advice to parents : always have a stroller on hand ( because the energy needed to carry a child to escape a zombie outbreak would be better spent on foraging , security and defense ) , avoid close - quarters fighting if you 're carrying a child strapped to you in a carrier ( duh ! ) and , as parents , it 's important to inform kids about the zombie life cycle so they know to run should their guardian be turned .
It 's not a pleasant topic , but it 's important that they understand the dangers the living dead present .
And I thought " stranger danger " was a tough conversation …
In all seriousness , The Zombie Combat Manual succeeds because it does n't try to rehash everything there is to know about zombies , it concentrates on hand - to - hand combat survival techniques .
There are just enough encounter sections to keep things moving and Ma 's sense of humor prevents the book from getting too dark , despite the often gruesome subject matter .
Y.N. Heller 's illustrations are the prefect accompaniment , adding an element of gory camp to the equation .
The funny thing is , I was reading a novel during the same session that prominently features the undead ( Cherie Priest 's Boneshaker ) , and found myself wincing when her characters did the " wrong thing " ( according to the combat manual ) when encountering rotters ; I guess I did pick up on the techniques .
Check out the Zombie Combat Club website for more tips , pointers and hints .
Currently selling for $ 9.99 on Amazon , the book could be the best ten bucks you spend on zombie preparation .
If you like the cool " Zombie Combat Club " emblem on the book cover , T - shirts and decals sporting the logo are available from Zazzle .
Roger sent me one of the decals and I can't decide where to put it ( kind of a throwback to grade one and the whole " sticker hoarding " issue ) , so I 'm thinking of just ordering a shirt so I do n't have to make the decision .
Believe it or not , the United States has many trade partners around the globe .
Here they are listed by the dollar amount of trade .
The U.S. international trade is big business !
It is worth $ 4.9 trillion every year .
China , Canada and Mexico are the nation 's biggest trade partners , trading almost $ 1.9 trillion worth of imports and fares .
International trade is a vital part of every country 's economic prosperity and growth , but trade partners , like all relationships , can sour .
This generally has more to do with politics than products .
The Importance of International Trade
The employment of over 41 million Americans workers relies on international trade .
The success of businesses and manufacturing in the U.S. depends on the buying and selling of materials and products to maintain the country 's economy .
The U.S. has trade agreements with 20 countries that maintain a level playing field for imports and exports .
North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) NAFTA is a trade agreements between the U.S. , Canada and Mexico .
Trade with Canada and Mexico keeps 14 million workers in jobs and generates $ 1.3 trillion annually in goods and services .
U.S. - Korea Free Trade Agreement ( KORUS )
This trade agreements was signed in March of 2012 and the only one the U.S. has in the Asia - Pacific region .
Besides these two most recent trade agreements , the U.S. also has agreements with Australia , Bahrain , Chile , Colombia , Costa Rica , Dominican Republic , El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras , Israel , Jordan , Morocco , Nicaragua , Oman , Panama , Peru , and Singapore .
Let 's have a look at U.S. international trade and see how politics are affecting trade partners .
U.S. Top Trade Partners
The top five trade partners who import the most American produced goods are Canada , Mexico , China , Japan , and the U.K .
Canada remained the biggest importer of American goods throughout 2016 and increased imports by almost 6 % in 2017 .
China was the biggest change between 2016 and 2017 , importing almost 13 % more goods .
The U.S. imports goods valued at over $ 1.5 billion more from China than its next biggest trade partner , Mexico .
The value of Chinese imports also increased by over 9 % from 2016 to 2017 .
What is the U.S. Trade Deficit ?
A trade deficit means a country is importing goods valued at more than it is exporting .
The U.S. trade deficit sits at around $ 450 billion , representing 2.5 % of the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
In January 2018 , the U.S. trade deficit hit a 9 - year high and the trade gap spiked by 5 % representing a $ 56.6 billion loss .
For example , the U.S. incurs a huge trade gap with China .
Americans import more than $ 45 billion worth of Chinese goods , but China only imports less than $ 10 billion of American goods .
About the Three Biggest U.S. Trading Partners China
In 2018 , China is the biggest trade partner to the U.S. , with imports and exports totally almost $ 56 billion .
The Chinese make a better profit off the U.S. as it sells more product than it buys creating a trade gap with the Americans .
Chinese primary exports are mechanical and electrical products , high tech products , clothing , and textiles .
At only 18 % of all Chinese exports , the U.S. is still its largest trading partner .
China trades with many countries around the world .
South Korea exports the most products and services to China , whose main imports are electrical and electronic equipments and crude oil , iron ore , copper and aluminum .
Since China is literally on the other side of the world from the U.S. , products have a long way to travel .
About one - third of all trade is flown between the two countries and almost two - thirds travels by ship .
Canada
Over half of all trade between the U.S. and Canada occurs through only three border crossings all into and out of the province of Ontario .
They are The Ambassador Bridge between Detroit , Michigan and Windsor , the Blue Water Bridge between Port Huron , Michigan , and Point Edward , and the Peace Bridge between Buffalo , New York and Fort Erie .
It is not only the geographical convenience that makes Canada one of the U.S. 's top trading partners .
Canada is the primary source of all American foreign oil .
However the price of oil has declined over the years making it less lucrative for the Canadians .
Canada 's primary exports are energy products , motor vehicles and parts , consumer goods , metal and non-metallic mineral products , forestry products and building and packaging material .
76 % of all Canadian exports go to the U.S .
Only 52 % of imports to Canada come from the U.S. China is also Canada 's second largest trade partner .
Canada 's largest imports are consumer goods , motor vehicles and parts , and electronic and electrical equipment .
Canada has now fallen into second place as China becomes the U.S. number one trade partner .
Mexico
Mexico and the U.S. also enjoy an easy delivery of goods being neighbors , and almost half of all trade between the two countries travels through border crossings in Port Laredo and El Paso , Texas .
80 % of all Mexican exports go to the U.S.
The most popular are manufactured products and oil and oil products .
However , only 47 % of imports to Mexico come from the U.S. 18 % come from China .
Its main imports are metallic products , machinery and equipment .
The Trade Deficit
The biggest U.S. industries that are not selling to foreign countries are cars and car parts , clothing and oil .
These three industries represented a $ 366 billion loss for the U.S. in 2016 .
On the other hand , the biggest selling U.S. industries to trade partners were all service - based .
Travel and tourism , intellectual property rights and financial services made the U.S. $ 234 billion in 2016 .
Tariffs
A tariff is a tax places on imports which ( in theory ) make foreign products more expensive for Americans to buy than the same product made by a manufacturer in the U.S. Tariffs are signed into law by the U.S. government and are meant to protect American industries , but as they may help one industry , they could negatively affect another .
For example , President Trump recently signed into law tariffs of 25 % on steel and 10 % on aluminum imports .
While this may increase the costs of these products putting more money into those industries , American companies that rely on steel and aluminum have to pay more .
Ford , General Motors , Boeing , and Anheuser - Busch will all bear the brunt of the rising costs and that could lead to layoffs in their factories , as well as making it more expensive for Americans to buy products like cars and beer .
The steel and aluminum import tariffs could very well lead to a trade war .
Trade Wars
Countries whose exports become subject to import tariffs can retaliate by imposing their own tariffs on American exports .
This reaction is called " protectionism " and is terrible for international trade .
In response to the U.S. tariff on steel and aluminum , the European Union has indicated it is considering import tariffs on Harley - Davidson motorcycles , bourbon , Levi's , peanut butter and cranberries .
These responses can escalate leading to political tensions between countries , called a trade war .
U.S. trade partners are most likely to impose retaliatory tariffs or to block completely American industries that are producing a surplus , like airplanes , negatively hitting the bottom line of domestic producers .
Texting while driving is a huge problem in the US .
We know it 's insanely dangerous .
Studies have found that each time you write or read a text message , you take your eyes off the road for almost five seconds and increase your risk of collision up to 23 times .
The hazard is " off the charts , " says David Strayer , a University of Utah professor who has studied the practice .
That 's why states are frantically trying to ban it .
Nineteen already prohibit texting while driving , and plenty more — including West Virginia and Missouri — will likely join the pack next year .
But I 'm not convinced the bans will work , particularly among young people .
Why ?
Because texting is rapidly becoming their default means of connecting with one another , on a constant , pinging basis .
From 2003 to 2008 , the number of texts sent monthly by Americans surged from 2 billion to 110 billion .
The urge to connect is primal , and even if you ban texting in the car , teens will try to get away with it .
So what can we do ?
We should change our focus to the other side of the equation and curtail not the texting but the driving .
This may sound a bit facetious , but I 'm serious .
When we worry about driving and texting , we assume that the most important thing the person is doing is piloting the car .
But what if the most important thing they 're doing is texting ?
How do we free them up so they can text without needing to worry about driving ?
The answer , of course , is public transit .
In many parts of the world where texting has become ingrained in daily life — like Japan and Europe — public transit is so plentiful that there has n't been a major texting - while - driving crisis .
You do n't endanger anyone 's life while quietly tapping out messages during your train ride to work in Tokyo or Berlin .
Rich Ling , a sociologist who studies the culture of texting , grew up near Denver but now lives in Oslo with his family .
He told me that Denmark has so many buses and streetcars that teenagers often do n't bother getting their driver 's license until later in life .
" My daughter is 18 , and she 's only sort of starting to think about driving , " he says .
As a result , texting while driving " is n't as big a deal . "
In contrast , US cities and suburbs have completely neglected their public transit .
With very few exceptions — New York and Boston are two — buses and trains are either nonexistent or wretchedly inadequate .
People desperately need cars to shop , work , and meet up with friends .
Which is precisely why we 're in a crisis :
Two activities that are both central to our lives are colliding .
Of course , you could argue that texting should n't be so culturally central to people and that they should just cool it in the car .
You may well be right , but good luck convincing them , my friend .
And anyway , there are other benefits to making the streets safe for texters :
Dramatically increasing public transit would also decrease our carbon footprint , improve local economies , and curtail drunk driving .
( Plus , we 'd waste less time in spiritually draining bumper - to - bumper traffic . )
Texting while driving is , in essence , a wake - up call to America .
It illustrates our real , and bigger , predicament :
The country is currently better suited to cars than to communication .
This is completely bonkers .
By all means , we should ban texting while driving , or at least try .
But we need to work urgently on making driving less necessary in the first place .
Let 's get our hands off the wheel and onto the keypad — where they belong .

If you ask most Americans , they will agree that the financial system is corrupt .
It is generally assumed that just like most politicians , most big bankers are corrupt by nature .
But the truth is that the vast majority of Americans have no idea just how corrupt the U.S. financial system has become .
The reality is that the American Dream is literally being stolen from millions of Americans right out from under their noses and they do n’t even realize it .
The corruption on Wall Street has become so deep and so vast that it is hard to even find the words to describe it .
The level of greed being displayed by many Wall Street firms would make Gordon Gecko blush .
It seems that the major financial players will try just about anything these days – as long as they think they can get away with it .
But in the process they are contributing to the destruction of the greatest economic machine that the planet has ever seen .
The following are 11 examples of just how insanely corrupt the U.S. financial system has become ….
#1) An industry insider “ whistle blower ” has come forward with “ smoking gun ” evidence that major financial institutions have been openly and blatantly manipulating the price of gold and silver .
But so far those who are supposed to be regulating these firms have been sitting back and doing nothing about it .
#2) It has also now come out that most “ gold ” that is traded on the markets is not backed by the actual metal itself .
For years , most people have assumed that the London Bullion Market Association , the world ’s largest gold market , had actual gold to back up the massive “ gold deposits ” at the major LBMA banks .
But that is not the truth at all .
Industry insiders are now revealing that LBMA banks actually have approximately a hundred times more gold deposits than actual gold bullion .
When most people think they are buying gold what they are actually buying is pieces of paper that say that they own gold .
Meanwhile they are being charged huge storage fees to store the gold .
#3) The guy who helped bring down AIG is going to get off scott - free and will be able to keep the millions in profits that he made in the process .
It must be nice to be him .
# 4) Goldman
Sachs is denying that it “ bet against its clients ” when it changed its position in the housing market in 2007 .
But the reality is that is exactly when they did and a lot of things that are even worse than that .
The corruption at Goldman Sachs is very deep and very entrenched , but they will never be fully investigated because they have such close ties to the U.S. government .
#5) It is being alleged that the biggest banks in the United States are ripping off American cities with the same predatory deals that brought down the financial system of Greece .
Of course the big banks will rip off just about anyone these days if they think they can get away with it .
# 6) Several major Wall Street banks are being accused of using accounting techniques similar to those utilized by Lehman Brothers in its final days to mask the size of their balance sheets at the end of reporting periods .
# 7 ) The Federal Reserve bought up the vast majority of U.S. government debt in 2009 .
Many analysts claim that this is the same as “ printing money out of thin air ” , while others are openly calling it a Ponzi scheme .
#8) It turns out that the Federal Reserve holds credit - default swaps on the debt of Florida schools , and on debt owed by the states of California and Nevada .
So the Federal Reserve would profit if one of those states defaulted on its debt .
Talk about a conflict of interest .
# 9 ) Executives at many of the firms that received large amounts of money during the Wall Street bailouts are being lavished with record bonuses as millions of other average Americans are suffering intensely .
Even the CEOs of bailed - out regional banks are getting big raises .
# 10 ) We may not know much about what is going on inside some of these banks , but they sure do know a lot about us .
For example , it has been revealed that the data mining operations of the major credit card companies are becoming so sophisticated that they can actually predict how likely you are to get a divorce .
# 11 ) But the biggest financial fraud of all is being committed against the American people .
The exploding U.S. national debt threatens to destroy the financial future of literally generations of Americans .
It is obscenely immoral to saddle our children and our grandchildren with the biggest mountain of debt in the history of the world .
If they get the chance , future generations of Americans will look back and curse this generation for what we have done to them .
Google , which has recently been involved in a censorship spat with China , has been one of the filtering policy 's harshest critics .
It has identified a range of politically sensitive and innocuous material , such as sexual health discussions and discussions on euthanasia , which could be blocked by the filters .
Last week , it said it had held discussions with users and parents around Australia and " the strong view from parents was that the government 's proposal goes too far and would take away their freedom of choice around what information they and their children can access " .
Google also said implementing mandatory filtering across Australia 's millions of internet users could " negatively impact user access speeds " , while filtering material from high - volume sites such as Wikipedia , YouTube , Facebook and Twitter " appears not to be technologically possible as it would have such a serious impact on internet access " .
" We have a number of other concerns , including that filtering may give a false sense of security to parents , it could damage Australia 's international reputation and it can be easily circumvented , " Google wrote .
On ABC Radio last night , the majority of callers were opposed to the filters and right before the end of the segment , Senator Conroy attacked Google over its privacy credentials .
" Recently the founders of Google have got themselves into a little bit of trouble because notwithstanding their alleged ' do no evil ' policy , they recently created something called Buzz , and there was a reaction , and people said well look are n't you publishing private information ? , " Senator Conroy said .
" [ Google CEO Eric ]
Schmidt said the following : ' If you have something that you do n't want anyone to know maybe you should n't be doing it in the first place ' .
This is the founder of Google .
He also said recently to Wall Street analysts , 'we love cash ' , so when people say , should n't we just leave it up to the Googles of this world to determine what the filtering policy should be .... "
Google said today it was surprised to hear Senator Conroy trying to " make this an issue about Google " .
" This is a debate about freedom of access to information for all Australians , an issue of national importance .
Let 's focus on that , " Google said .
Google 's Buzz product added social networking features to Gmail but it caused a privacy uproar in February , with users complaining their contacts were being made public without their knowledge and that they had little control over who could follow their updates .
Google quickly tweaked the service to allay these concerns .
Google said the Schmidt quote referred to by Senator Conroy had been taken out of context .
Furthermore , Senator Conroy incorrectly labelled Schmidt one of the founders of the company , when in fact he joined the company as its CEO in 2001 .
Opposition communications spokesman Tony Smith said it was Senator Conroy 's " default position " to attack anyone that questions his policies .
" Google should be able to express their opinion without being attacked by the Minister and having their motives questioned , " he said .
Senator Conroy also said he was not aware of the US State Department contacting his office or that of the Foreign Minister , Stephen Smith , over the internet filters .
This contradicts a statement made by a US State Department spokesman yesterday .
" Our main message of course is that we remain committed to advancing the free flow of information which we view as vital to economic prosperity and preserving open societies globally , " a U.S. State Department spokesman Michael Tran told The Associated Press .
Tran declined to say when or at what level the U.S. State Department raised its concerns with Australia and declined to detail those concerns .
" We do n't discuss the details of specific diplomatic exchanges , but I can say that in the context of that ongoing relationship , we have raised our concerns on this matter with Australian officials , " he added .
Senator Conroy argues the he is only attempting to apply the same restrictions placed on the distribution of books , magazines , DVDs and other content to the internet .
But critics say this approach fails to consider that the internet is a vastly different , dynamic medium .
They say Senator Conroy 's proposal is a heavy - handed measure that is easily bypassed by criminals and could restrict access to legal information .
Senator Conroy has conceded that greater transparency is needed in terms of how content ends up on the blacklist , but last night he again refused to make the blacklist itself public , saying it would provide people instant access to the banned material .
Whether the internet filtering policy is implemented depends largely on whether the Opposition supports or blocks the legislation .
It has said it is waiting to see the government 's legislation before stating a final position on the matter .
" The Federal Coalition supports sensible and workable measures to protect children from inappropriate online content , " said Smith .
" However we are yet to be convinced that Labor ’s mandatory filtering plans will actually be effective or achieve the best results . ”

I 'm a Medicare doctor .
Here 's what I make
Dr. William Schreiber , a primary care physician , said cuts in Medicare payments to doctors will force them to consider boycotting Medicare patients .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
When you think of low - paying jobs , doctor does n't usually come to mind .
But with a 21 % cut in Medicare payments slated to take effect later this month , physicians who say they are making an OK living may be reduced to income levels that no longer make their profession viable .
That 's especially true for those still paying medical school costs and other training .
" The cuts will hit me , " said Dr. William Schreiber , a primary care physician based in North Syracuse , N.Y .
Schreiber sees 120 patients a week .
About 30 % of them are enrolled directly in Medicare , while another 65 % have private insurance plans that peg their payments on Medicare 's rates .
Only 5 % pay on their own .
As a result , Schreiber expects the cuts to take away $ 3 out of every $ 5 he currently earns .
And , as a primary care physician , he already was n't earning anything near the salary of a specialist .
" After the costs of my own benefits are deducted , that will leave me with the equivalent of a minimum wage job , " he said .
Unless Congress acts to adjust Medicare payments without considering the impact of rising health care costs , Schreiber said he could be forced into bankruptcy or shut his practice .
Cost of care
Schreiber , who employs two nurse practitioners , agreed to break down the costs associated with running his practice .
He spends about $ 60,000 a month on " fixed costs " to run his practice .
" That 's more or less my breakeven point , " he said .
" If I spend more , I 'm in the red for the month . "
Business costs include rent , payroll , utilities , medical and office supplies .
Because he maintains electronic health records for his patients , Schreiber also pays for equipment maintenance and other management services associated with patient billing .
Fixed costs for a private practice also include malpractice insurance .
He pays about $ 7,000 a year for himself and $ 2,000 each for his two nurse practitioners .
Schreiber admits that his cost for malpractice insurance is relatively low , compared to specialists such as ob / gyns , who pay upward of $ 100,000 a year .
( Rx for money woes : Doctors quit medicine )
Finally , his fixed costs include benefits to cover his employees , including himself .
Those costs go against the $ 800,000 or so in revenue , which includes about $ 100,000 in income , he said his practice collects in a given year .
Nearly a third of that money , the sum that would be cut 21 % , comes from Medicare .
What Medicare pays
Overall , Medicare pays between 63 % and 72 % of the costs for one of Schreiber 's patients -- although the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services applies different payment rates in different states .
According to Schreiber , four billing codes make up the " bread and butter " of claims submitted to Medicare .
The first code represents a simple visit , which might include blood pressure and cholesterol checks .
Schreiber gets about $ 44 from Medicare for the $ 70 fee he charges .
The second and third codes correspond to a sick visit , when he spends 15 to 20 minutes evaluating a patient for symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath .
Schreiber charges $ 92 for a sick visit , of which Medicare pays about $ 58 .
The last billing code is a complex visit .
" This is where a patient comes in with many problems like heart disease , hypertension , diabetes , " he said .
Such a visit requires about 30 minutes of his time .
Schreiber charges $ 120 for these visits , and Medicare pays $ 88 of that .
" Medicare reimbursements are n't bad .
That 's why everyone takes them , " Schreiber said .
For his privately insured patients , Schreiber gets paid an additional 10 % to 20 % above Medicare rates .
But an approximately $ 5,000 monthly cut in Medicare payments and a related reduction in rates from private insurers would change his financial picture dramatically .
The cuts -- which took effect Monday but were deferred to the end of March when the Senate approved an extension Tuesday -- can't come from the fixed costs .
So , Schreiber said , they would have to come from the amount he clears a month .
" If I am now getting paid 21 % less on what Medicare reimburses me , it turns Medicare into a losing proposition , " he said .
Despite his concerns , Schreiber said he 's not dumping his Medicare patients yet .
" I 'll see what we are going to do , " he said .
" It 's not a case of closing my doors to Medicare to get back at someone for cutting my salary . "
Lisa B. Hanson , the county attorney in Roseau , Minn. , said , “ Maybe all this attention has gotten them to change their tune , and if that ’s the case we ’ll take their cooperation . ”
Mr. Lena also said that the Vatican office in charge of handling abuse cases , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , had recommended laicization , which is removal from the priesthood .
Mr. Lena said in the statement : “ The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith suggested in this matter that Father Jeyapaul agree to laicization , demonstrating that the Congregation believed that the accusations were serious enough to merit dismissal from the clerical state .
However , as a matter of longstanding canon law , such decisions are made by the local bishop , who is deemed to be generally in the best position to adjudicate the case relating to the priest in question . ”
He declined to provide any documents on the case .
The bishop of Ootacamund , India , Arulappan Amalraj , told The Associated Press , which first reported the news on Monday , that Father Jeyapaul had no contact with children and would remain in the diocesan offices .
“ We can not simply throw out the priest , so he is just staying in the bishop ’s house , and he is helping me with the appointment of teachers , ” the bishop said .
“ He says he is innocent , and these are only allegations .
I do n’t know what else to do . ”
Father Jeyapaul told The A.P. , “ It is a false accusation against me .
I do not know the girl at all . ”
The criminal complaint from Minnesota said that the 14 - year - old girl , whose name is redacted , was praying after school at Blessed Sacrament Church in Greenbush , Minn. , when Father Jeyapaul told her to come into the rectory .
The girl claimed that when she refused to touch his genitals , he told her it was a sin and said he “ could make her life miserable . ”
She said he then pushed her down onto a couch , touched her breasts and pulled down his pants .

April 20th is a day when people across the world celebrate the consumption of marijuana .
You may be one of the thousands of people gathering for 4/20 rallies in Boston , Boulder , New York , Santa Cruz , Seattle and other cities .
Or maybe you just believe our country 's backwards marijuana laws need a major overhaul .
Whatever your plans for 4/20 , let 's use the day to join together and declare our support for marijuana legalization .
Maybe you smoke marijuana and are tired of being considered a criminal .
Maybe you 're a teacher or public health advocate tired of politicians cutting money for education and health to pay for new jails and prisons .
Maybe you 're a civil rights activist appalled by racial disparities in marijuana law enforcement .
Or maybe you just do n't want your tax dollars wasted on ineffective policies .
The tide is quickly turning against the war on marijuana .
Lawmakers across the country are introducing legislation to regulate marijuana like alcohol .
Newspapers are calling for major reform .
Celebrities like Sting are speaking out .
In November California voters will have the historic opportunity to vote on ending marijuana prohibition .
More Americans support legalizing marijuana than ever before , and it 's time for us to speak up .
Help support the legalization of marijuana by adding your voice to this petition .
It 's time to finally put the performance review out of its misery .
This corporate sham is one of the most insidious , most damaging , and yet most ubiquitous of corporate activities .
Everybody does it , and almost everyone who 's evaluated hates it .
It 's a pretentious , bogus practice that produces absolutely nothing that any thinking executive should call a corporate plus .
And ...
The Senate , by voice vote March 17 , passed legislation that would reduce the crack / cocaine sentencing disparity .
Currently the differential is 100 to one .
In other words , a person caught with crack will get a sentence 100 times harsher than a person convicted of cocaine possession .
The Senate bill would reduce the ratio to 18 to one .
The House of Representatives has passed a companion bill that eliminate the sentencing disparity making it one to one .
Patrick Leahy , Senate Judiciary Committee chair , said in a statement , “ The racial imbalance that has resulted from the cocaine sentencing disparity disparages the Constitution ’s promise of equal treatment for all Americans . ”
The Senate vote was the product of a bipartisan deal and has been hailed by the White House and Attorney General Eric Holder .
Holder said , “ There is no law enforcement or sentencing rational for the current disparity between crack and cocaine powder offenses , and I have strongly supported eliminating it to ensure our sentencing laws are tough , predictable and fair . ”
Importantly the Senate backed measure eliminates mandatory minimums for crack possession .
Civil rights and drug advocacy groups , however , are critical of the Senate ’s stance .
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights cited momentum , but took note of the bill ’s inadequacy .
Wade Henderson said the vote “ represents progress , but not the end of the fight . ”
The Drug Policy Alliance , a group that promotes policy alternatives to the drug war , pointedly criticized the Senate action .
“ Today is a bittersweet day , ” said Jasmine L. Tyler of the Drug Policy Alliance to the Associated Press .
By not eliminating the disparity , Tyler said , the Senate “ has proven how difficult it is to ensure racial justice , even in 2010 . ”
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund also took aim at the continuing disparity .
“ Although the Senate passed legislation concerning the crack / powder sentencing disparity , it refused to completely eliminate that unjustified disparity .
The Senate ’s failure is deeply troubling .
If left uncorrected , the Senate ’s action would mean that racial discrimination will persist . ”
ColorofChange.org voiced similar concerns .
“ Last week , the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee had a chance to advance a bill to eliminate the disparity .
Instead , they chose to reduce it - with no good reason other than to please ‘ moderate ’ Democrats and Republicans .
And President Obama , who for years has championed ending the disparity , is supporting the bill – apparently because it ’s bipartisan , ” the Internet - based organization said in an e-mail .
They are asking President Obama and House Speaker Pelosi to support the House version of the bill .
To support this effort click here .
The crack cocaine sentencing laws passed in the 1980s are a big reason why one in 15 African Americans are behind bars today .
The crack / cocaine epidemic emerged partly out efforts by the Reagan administration to fund the Central American contra war against Nicaragua ’s Sandinista government .
As reported over 20 years ago by the San Jose Mercury News , money from contra drug sales were used to purchase weapons .
The cocaine then made its way to crack labs in Los Angeles and across the country .
The House and Senate bills will now have to be reconciled .

Corporate Welfare Queen Kills 25
Watching recent news on CEO Don Blankenship of Massey Energy — renowned for falling spectacularly short of industry safety standards which are themselves almost nonexistent , and most lately for hosting the site of the worst mining disaster in decades — I got the feeling I ’d heard of this guy before .
Sure enough , several months ago Alternet listed Blankenship and Massey in a rogue ’s gallery of corporate malefactors .
Massey ’s mountaintop removal operation was fined $ 50 million by West Virginia courts for polluting its neighbors .
But hey , if you can afford to spend $ 3 million replacing an unfriendly justice with your own stooge , running attack ads ( he “ released sexual deviants ” ) that would make Lee Atwater or Karl Rove proud , those pesky fines are easy enough to deal with .
( Blankenship was spotted in Monte Carlo a few months later partying with yet another buddy on the Supreme Court . )
$ 3 million to buy a Supreme Court justice , to overturn a $ 50 million fine from a lower court — that ’s what I call a pretty good return on your money .
It reminds me of all those colorful stories about railroads buying legislators and Congressmen wholesale back in the Gilded Age .
Blankenship also opined , by the way , that it ’s perfectly OK for elementary school kids to inhale coal dust from his operations while playing on school grounds .
You see , Massey “ already pays millions of dollars in taxes each year . ”
Ever see that episode of The Simpsons where a young Monty Burns ran down workers in the street for the sheer joy of crippling them , and then tossed money out the window ?
Blankenship , it seems , is also a major corporate Tea Party sponsor , appearing at last year ’s Labor Day Tea Party with the charming duo of Sean Hannity and Ted Nugent .
Blankenship also seems to collect unpaid fines for unsafe working conditions the way some people collect parking tickets in their glove box .
Interestingly , an Alternet commentator on the Tea Party story wrote : “ I ’m sure those people cheering every insane thing he said at that rally will blame the government for failing to stop him , thus proving once again that it ca n’t do anything right . ”
Well , yeah .
The mine safety and anti-pollution regulations , in this case , are a good illustration of why the corporate state replaced traditional tort liability standards under the common law with a regulatory state in the first place .
Mountaintop removal is just what the name implies .
It involves clearing areas of thousands of acres , in the process filling nearby valleys and stream beds with debris and destroying entire watersheds .
It also involves showering surrounding areas with coal dust from silos — you know , the dust Blankenship ’s taxes pay the schoolkids to breathe .
And then there ’s the multi-billion gallon sludge ponds full of coal mine waste .
The dam enclosing one such Massey pond gave way several years ago , with its contents wound up in the Big Sandy River .
A number of towns lie in the flood path of other such ponds , should they give way .
Now , you ’d think tort liability for the full damages of wholesale devastation of the entire countryside , the poisoned water and coal dust , the deaths from gross negligence , and all the rest of it , would seriously undermine the profitability of mountaintop removal .
And you ’d be right .
That ’s exactly what the regulatory state was created to avoid .
Let ’s look at a little history .
I ca n’t recommend strongly enough “ The Transformation of American Law , ” by Morton Horwitz .
According to Horwitz , the common law of tort liability was radically altered by state courts in the early to mid-19th century to make it more business - friendly .
Under the traditional standard of liability , an actor was responsible for harm that resulted from his actions — period .
Negligence was beside the point .
Courts added stricter standards of negligence and intent , in order to protect business from costly lawsuits for externalities they might impose on their neighbors .
The regulatory state subsequently imposed far weaker standards than the traditional common law ; the main practical effect was to preempt what remained of tort liability .
A regulatory standard amounts to a license to commit torts below the threshold of that standard , and lawsuits against polluters and other malfeasors can be met with the defense that “ we are fully in compliance with regulatory standards . ”
In some cases , as with food libel laws or product disparagement laws , even voluntarily meeting a more stringent standard may be construed as disparagement of products that merely meet the regulatory standard .
For example , Monsanto has had mixed success in some jurisdictions suppressing the commercial free speech of those who advertise their milk as free from rBGH ; and conventional beef producers have similarly managed in some cases to prevent competitors from testing for mad cow disease more frequently than the law mandates .
So a class action suit against a coal mining company for the public nuisance created by mountaintop removal could be thwarted by simply demonstrating that the operation met EPA regulatory standards , even if such operations caused serious harm to the property rights and quality of life of the surrounding community .
I think it ’s fair to say that Mr. Blankenship is one of the most loathsome pigs ever to contaminate the Earth with his presence .
And the dumbed - down regulatory state — by offering wrist - slap fines worth a tiny fraction of the harm caused by his terrorism , as a substitute for free juries of his neighbors nailing his scrote to the wall for his crimes — has played a key role in enabling him .
Although most Americans – according to opinion polls – still rate Dick Cheney alongside Ebola virus in terms of popularity , there 's a corner of America that will always love Dick .
And that corner was brought together at the CPAC conference in Washington DC , where the former vice president made a " surprise " appearance .
To wild applause Dick teased the crowd with a little presidential come - on , saying : " A welcome like that is almost enough to make me want to run for office again . "
Cue standing ovation .
" But I 'm not gonna do it . "
For shame Dick Cheney , your country needs you .
On CNN , Wolf Blitzer declared he thought Cheney might run in 2012 , assuming the Republicans do well in the 2010 midterm elections in November .
And who knows ?
he might be the only man to stop the Sarah Palin bandwagon from driving the Republican party over off the cliff .
So go and register the www.cheney2012.com web address right now .
Obviously it would be great for the Democratic party if Cheney did run , one suspects , and the prospect of a Cheney versus Palin Republican primary ... well , it would be like Alien versus Predator , but much better .
And real .
Anyway , it 's too much to hope for .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The new Coffee Party movement deemed its official kickoff Saturday a " huge success , " with dozens of talks held at coast - to - coast coffee shops as members came together to discuss the issues most important to them .
Billed by many as an answer to the conservative Tea Party movement , the Coffee Party was born on Facebook just six weeks ago .
While the group has become an instant hit online -- it boasts more than 141,000 Facebook fans as of Saturday -- gauging the success of this weekend 's coffee meetups was predicted to be an indicator of the group 's strength .
A statement released by the party said " today 's coffee houses have been a huge success -- both for Coffee Party USA and for democracy .
All across the U.S. , Americans from all political sides sat down for civil conversation and , of course , coffee . "
At Java Monkey in Decatur , Georgia , a suburb of Atlanta , coordinator Stacey Hopkins said turnout far exceeded expectations , with around 60 people participating at the " very productive " meeting where health care reform was the overriding issue .
" We had kids there , we had college students , high school students , and we had retirees , " she said .
" It went across a very broad spectrum age wise and racially , and this is that we 'd like to see . "
Were you at a Coffee Party gathering ?
Share your images , story
In Asheville , North Carolina , about 35 people gathered at Filo Pastries and Coffee , according to CNN iReporter Rachael Jernigan , a stay - at - home mom who coordinated the meeting .
" I think the biggest thing to come out of it was people were tired of being labeled and divided , " said Jernigan , who added that a Tea Party member was among the attendees .
" They do agree on a lot . "
About 30 people came out to a meeting at Raleigh , North Carolina 's Cup A Joe , said CNN iReporter Davis Hall .
" I really liked what the Coffee movement said the foundation was -- which is to get everybody of all stripes of life to get together , " Hall said .
The meetings were among about 350 the party planned to hold Saturday .
Coffee Party founder Annabel Park , who worked as a volunteer for Barack Obama 's presidential campaign and Democratic Sen.
Jim Webb of Virginia 's 2006 campaign , says the group is not " aligned " with any party and calls the two - party system out of date .
Park said the bitter battle over health care is an example of how government is not working .
" We feel like the health care debate showed not only that we are a very divided country , but there 's something really wrong with our political process .
We kind of got to see the innards of the political process and realize there 's something very broken .
I think that 's what we 're responding to . "
The party statement said the next step " is to dig into what our community discussed ( and ) find out what matters most to them . "
Park said the Coffee Party 's first real national action will be March 27 , when members will get together to discuss ways to engage members of Congress during the Easter recess .
" Just like in the American Revolution , we are looking for real representation right now .
We do n't feel represented by our government right now , and we do n't really feel represented well by the media either , " Park said last week on CNN's " American Morning . "
" It 's kind of a simple call to action for people to wake up and take control over their future and demand representation .
And it requires people standing up and speaking up . "
Sound familiar ?
Tea Party activists use much of the same language in describing their year - old protest movement that 's steeped in fiscal conservatism and boiling - hot , anti-tax rhetoric .
" It 's a response to how they are trying to change our government , " Park told CNN , referring to the Tea Party .
" It 's their methodology that we are against .
We may want some of the same things , but their journey is so alienating to us . "
So what does the Tea Party movement think of this new sensation ?
" This Coffee Party looks like a weak attempt at satire or a manufactured response to a legitimate widespread grassroots movement , " says Brendan Steinhauser , director of federal and state campaigns for FreedomWorks , a nonprofit conservative organization that helps train volunteer activists and has provided much of the organizational heft behind the Tea Party movement .
" It 's driven from the top down and it's not a grass - roots movement driven from the bottom up , " Jim Hoft of the St. Louis Tea Party said .
CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .
Gallery How to Bake in a Salt Crust
With the weather warming up , thoughts of playing in the sand inspired me to try salt - crust baking .
That 's essentially what this technique feels like .
Baking in salt involves burying food in a sand - like mixture of salt and egg white .
The salt insulates the food , cooking it gently and evenly .
When the dish comes out of the oven , you crack open the hardened , golden salt shell to unearth a moist , evenly cooked and fragrant buried treasure .
I tried this method out on new potatoes , red snapper , bronzini , chicken breasts , whole chicken , and duck breasts .
Many boxes of salt later , I have this slideshow to take you through what I learned on my imaginary beach vacation .
If you have any salt - crust baking experiences , as always , please share them along with your tips .

US prepares for military confrontation with Iran
By Peter Symonds
20 March 2010
An article in the Scottish - based Sunday Herald last weekend provided an ominous reminder that the Obama administration has retained what is euphemistically described as the “ military option ” against Iran — that is , massive , unprovoked US air strikes .
The newspaper reported that the US military was moving 387 bunker - buster bombs , from California to the US base on Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean , in preparation for a possible attack on Iran .
Superior Maritime Services was contracted in January to transport 10 containers of munitions , including 195 smart Blu-110 bombs and 192 huge 2,000 pound Blu - 117 bombs , which are designed for use against hardened or underground structures .
The Sunday Herald cited Dan Plesch , director of the Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy ( CISD ) at the University of London , who said : “ They are gearing up totally for the destruction of Iran .
US bombers are ready today to destroy 10,000 targets in Iran in a few hours . ”
According to a CISD study in 2007 , the Pentagon ’s war plans , drawn up under the Bush administration , would not only target Iran ’s nuclear facilities but its air defences , military and industrial capacity .
None of the analysts interviewed by the newspaper described a US attack as imminent .
But Plesch commented : “ The US is not publicising the scale of these preparations to deter Iran , tending to make confrontation more likely .
The US … is using its forces as part of an overall strategy of shaping Iran ’s actions . ”
However , President Obama ’s “ overall strategy ” appears increasingly in disarray .
Having set the end of last year as the deadline for Tehran to meet US demands , the White House has been waging a sustained diplomatic offensive this year to secure a UN resolution imposing tough new sanctions on Iran .
The US not only needs the agreement of UN Security Council members , but is seeking support from Arab allies in the Middle East and attempting to ensure that Israel does not take unilateral , preemptive military action of its own against Iran .
On Wednesday , Obama declared again that the US would pursue “ aggressive sanctions ” against Iran .
However , as the Financial Times pointed out yesterday , the effort to build a consensus for UN sanctions “ is looking increasingly under stress ” .
Any resolution “ is unlikely to reach the 15 - member Security Council before June , if then ” .
The main opponent is China , which has repeatedly dismissed calls for fresh sanctions , reiterating as recently as Thursday its commitment to “ a peaceful solution through diplomatic means ” .
By refusing to consider further sanctions , Beijing has encouraged other UN Security Council members , including Russia , Turkey , Brazil and Lebanon , to maintain an ambivalent position .
Washington had been exploiting the so - called P5+1 grouping — the permanent UN Security Council members , the US , Britain , France , Russia and China , plus Germany — as a forum to pressure Beijing into line .
However , no face - to - face meeting of the group has taken place since January and none is scheduled .
In recent weeks , top - level delegations have visited Beijing — including from Israel , the US and , this week , British Foreign Secretary David Milliband .
They have attempted without success to cajole and pressure China to agree to tough new penalties against Tehran .
Beijing ’s opposition is a significant factor in the increasingly tense relations with Washington over a range of issues .
The American and international press has highlighted the Chinese economic interests at stake in Iran .
In 2009 , China became Iran ’s top trading partner , with bilateral trade worth $ 21.2 billion , up from $ 14.4 billion three years earlier .
Although Beijing still relies on Saudi Arabia and Angola for more than half its oil imports , it has increased Iran ’s share to 11.4 percent and is investing heavily in oil and gas projects there as well as other infrastructure .
China National Petroleum and its subsidiary Petrochina last year agreed to invest more than $ 8 billion in one gas and two oil projects .
Shining a media spotlight on Chinese interests only underscores the fact that the US confrontation with Iran is not about its alleged plans to build a nuclear weapon .
Rather , Washington is exploiting the issue to block the interests of its European and Asian rivals and to further its own ambitions for dominance in the energy - rich Middle East and Central Asia .
Tehran has repeatedly declared that it has no intention of building a bomb , but is determined to develop a nuclear energy program .
Washington ’s diplomatic efforts are running into obstacles on other fronts .
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s trip to Moscow this week has turned into a debacle .
In what can only be described as a calculated diplomatic snub , Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia and Iran would complete the process of starting up the long - delayed , Russian - built power reactor at Bushehr within months .
In a joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday , Clinton criticised the plan as “ premature ” because “ we want to send an unequivocal message to the Iranians ” .
Clinton was obviously hoping for Russian support for stronger sanctions .
Last year Obama shut down the planned US anti-ballistic missile system in Poland and the Czech Republic , which was bitterly opposed by Moscow , hoping for Russian support for sanctions against Iran in return .
However , Lavrov made clear that Moscow would only back sanctions that were “ not aggressive ” — an obvious reference to Obama ’s remarks on Wednesday — and did not target the Iranian population or have humanitarian consequences .
The sharp tensions between the US and Israel , which erupted last week during US Vice President Joseph Biden ’s visit , also cut across Washington ’s strategy on Iran .
Israel ’s announcement of new Jewish settlements — while Biden was in Israel — was a direct rebuff to US efforts to restart talks with Palestinian leaders and provoked a furious response from Biden and Clinton .
The US is not concerned in the slightest about the fate of Palestinians .
But by undermining the sham peace process , Israel is damaging intense US efforts to enlist the support of Arab allies , including Egypt , Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states , to back sanctions against Iran , and weaken Syrian ties with Iran .
If the UN Security Council fails to pass new sanctions , the US has already raised the prospect of further unilateral penalties .
Over the weekend , Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb , who was hosting a meeting of EU foreign ministers , tentatively declared that there would be “ consensus enough ” for unilateral EU sanctions , if a UN resolution were not passed .
The US Congress is also considering far - reaching legislation to allow the US administration to penalise foreign companies selling refined oil products to Iran or engaged in providing insurance , reinsurance or shipping for such trade .
Even if finally put in place , unilateral US or European sanctions are fraught with difficulties .
Action against the sale of gasoline would potentially have a severe impact on the Iranian economy , which imports 40 percent of its requirements due to a lack of refining capacity .
But such a measure would inevitably provoke widespread popular opposition in Iran under conditions where Washington is still hoping to encourage political opposition and some form of regime change in Tehran .
Moreover , Chinese corporations might increase their sales of gasoline and diesel to Iran , as is already taking place .
Congressional sanctions against Tehran could provoke a further sharpening of tensions with Beijing .
As Obama ’s diplomatic campaign becomes bogged down , a debate has opened up in US ruling circles over the future course of action .
Sections of the foreign policy establishment are proposing a policy of “ containment ” in the event that the US fails to prevent Iran building a nuclear weapon .
An extensive essay entitled “ After Iran Gets the Bomb ” in this month ’s issue of the influential Foreign Affairs magazine argues for aggressive policies to isolate Iran .
Far from easing tensions in the Middle East , a strategy of “ containment ” would only heighten them .
The authors — James Lindsay and Ray Takeyh — call for the consolidation of US military alliances in the Middle East along the lines of the Central Treaty Organisation established in 1955 by the US , Britain , Turkey , Pakistan and Iran to counter Soviet influence .
Washington would offer security guarantees to , and bolster the military capacity of , its allies , as well as laying down a series of three “ red lines ” that Tehran would cross at its peril .
Chillingly , the article insisted that “ it should also be made clear that the price of Iran ’s violating these three prohibitions could be US military retaliation by any and all means necessary , up to and including nuclear weapons ” .
The alternative being canvassed — but not so openly discussed — is to dramatically intensify action to compel Iran to accede to US demands .
The case is argued in today ’s New York Times by Howard Berman , the Democrat chairman of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs .
He declares : “ It is foolhardy to believe that the West could contain or deter Tehran were it to acquire the bomb .
A nuclear - armed Iran would usher in a dangerous new era of instability in the Gulf and Middle East …
If recalcitrant governments seek to block or dilute the ability of the United Nations to take strong swift action , then we Americans will have no choice but to act on our own . ”
He calls for Obama “ to focus our efforts on the pressure track ” and declares that Congressional sanctions legislation will be ready in a matter of weeks .
What is left unsaid is that the only “ option ” left , should sanctions fail to bring Iran to heel , is the military one .
The transfer of bunker - buster bombs to Diego Garcia , along with a string of visits by top US generals to the Middle East in recent weeks and US assistance to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States to bolster anti-missile systems , are all evidence of the advanced nature of US preparations for a military attack on Iran .
While the outcome of the current debate in Washington is not yet clear , no one can rule out a reckless new US military adventure against Iran as the Obama administration seeks to extricate itself from a mounting political crisis both at home and abroad .

[ 11 September 2007 ]
This is the world ’s largest single - cylinder two - wheeler .
It was built by a gentleman called Fritz Langer , and it ’s based on an NSU Konsul 500 .
I suspect that Fritz is one wave short of a shipwreck , but there ’s no denying the balls - out engineering that has gone into this machine .
Fritz replaced the original cylinder and piston with a 122 ci unit from a radial aeroplane engine , but that piston weighed 3.3 kg — over 7 lbs .
So Fritz got Mahle to make up a lightweight piston of just 1.6 kg .
After the engine block was widened and the crank milled , Fritz was ready to roll .
( He must have strong legs , because this baby is a kickstart . )
The stainless steel exhaust system , incidentally , is 75 mm ( 3 inches ) in diameter , and there ’s no silencer .
So it ’ll be enough to put even a Screamin ’ Eagle - equipped Harley to shame .

TOKYO Ã¢â‚¬â€  Greece ’s debt problems may currently be in the spotlight but Japan is walking its own financial tightrope , analysts say , with a public debt mountain bigger than that of any other industrialised nation .
Public debt is expected to hit 200 percent of GDP in the next year as the government tries to spend its way out of the economic doldrums despite plummeting tax revenues and soaring welfare costs for its ageing population .

Based on fiscal 2010 ’s nominal GDP of 475 trillion yen , Japan ’s debt is estimated to reach around 950 trillion yen — or roughly 7.5 million yen per person .
Japan “ ca n’t finance ” its record trillion - dollar budget passed in March for the coming year as it tries to stimulate its fragile economy , said Hideo Kumano , chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute .
“ Japan ’s revenue is roughly 37 trillion yen and debt is 44 trillion yen in fiscal 2010 , ” he said .
“ Its debt to budget ratio is more than 50 percent . ”
Without issuing more government bonds , Japan “ would go bankrupt by 2011 ” , he added .
Despite crawling out of a severe year - long recession in 2009 , Japan ’s recovery remains fragile with deflation , high public debt and weak domestic demand all concerns for policymakers .

Japan was stuck in a deflationary spiral for years after its asset price bubble burst in the early 1990s , hitting corporate earnings and prompting consumers to put off purchases in the hope of further price drops .
Its huge public debt is a legacy of massive stimulus spending during the economic “ lost decade ” of the 1990s , as well as a series of pump - priming packages to tackle the recession which began in 2008 .
Standard & Poor ’s in January warned that it might cut its rating on Japanese government bonds , which could raise Japan ’s borrowing costs amid the faltering efforts of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama ’s government to curb debt .

The system of Japanese government bonds being bought by institutions such as the huge Japan Post Bank has been key in enabling Japan to remain buoyant since its stock market crash of 1990 .
“ Japan ’s risk of default is low because it has a huge current account surplus , with the backing of private sector savings , ” to continue purchasing bonds , said Katsutoshi Inadome , bond strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities .

But while Japan ’s risk of a Greek - style debt crisis is seen as much less likely , the event of risk becoming reality would be devastating , say analysts who question how long the government can continue its dependence on issuing public debt .
“ There is no problem as long as there are flows of money in the bond market , ” said Kumano .
“ It ’s hard to predict when the bond market might collapse , but it would happen when the market judges that Japan ’s ability to finance its debt is not sustainable anymore . ”

“ And when that happens , the yen will plummet and a capital flight from Japan ’s government bonds to foreign bonds will occur , ” he said .
Yet others argue that there is no precedent for the ratio of debt to GDP nearing 200 percent being dangerous .
Nomura Securities economist Takehide Kiuchi cited Britain ’s government debt in the post - war period “ which reached 260 percent but ( the government ) did n’t face a debt crisis .
“ There is no answer to the question of what the critical level of debt is for a government to go bust . ”

The likes of single - currency Greece and non-eurozone countries are also different in that the latter group have flexible currency exchange rates which are more closely calibrated to their fiscal conditions , he said .
Instead , the most realistic hazard brought by huge Japanese debt is prolonged deflation under a shrinking economy , say analysts .
“ Regaining fiscal health needs fiscal austerity , which could weigh on economic growth , ” said Kiuchi .
“ And when the economy is bad , people do n’t spend money as they are worried about their future , which in turn intensifies the deflational trend , ” he said .

Continued deflation could further worsen Japan ’s fiscal health because of less tax revenue and more stimulus spending , stirring fears over big tax hikes , which in turn weigh on demand and again reinforce deflation , analysts said .
The key to breaking the vicious cycle is drafting a feasible economic growth strategy for Japan , they said .
“ If the economy grows , tax revenue increases , ” Kumano of Dai-ichi Life said .
Since 2001 Japan ’s annual growth rate has peaked at 2.7 percent in 2004 .
The economy shrank 1.2 percent in 2008 and 5.2 percent last year .

Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama ’s centre - left government has pledged to announce details of its new strategy in June , which aims to lift annual growth to two percent by focusing on the environment , health , tourism and improved ties with the rest of Asia .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Hewlett - Packard Co HPQ.N announced a $ 1.2 billion deal to buy Palm Inc PALM.O , betting it can resuscitate the struggling smartphone maker to compete with the likes of Apple Inc AAPL.O and RIM RIMM.O .
Jon Rubinstein , chairman and chief executive of Palm , talks about new games for Palm phones during a news conference at the 2010 International Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas , Nevada , January 7 , 2010 .

Analysts say 2010 ’s third - largest U.S. tech acquisition grants
Palm ’s devices global production and distribution reach while launching the world ’s top PC maker into a tech arena experiencing blistering growth .
The news on Wednesday surprised many on Wall Street , since much of the long - running takeover speculation surrounding Palm had shifted in recent weeks to focus on potential Asian bidders , such as China 's Lenovo 0992 .
HK .
An early pioneer in handheld devices , Palm once dominated the market but has since been surpassed by Apple 's iPhone and Research in Motion 's RIM .
TO BlackBerry .
Palm put out a new mobile operating system , the well - reviewed webOS , last year but even that has been overshadowed by Google Inc's GOOG .O Android software .
In a sign of Palm ’s struggles , the money - losing company headed by Jon Rubinstein -- an ex-Apple executive famous for developing the iPod -- slashed revenue expectations for the current quarter .
It said slow product sales have led to low order volumes from carriers .
“ If you saw the guidance Palm just put out , it was clear they had to sell , ” said Phil Cusick , analyst at Macquarie Research .
“ Given how quickly Palm ’s business was falling off and how fast their cash was going out the door , they ’re lucky to get what they got .
Palm reported losses for each of its last two fiscal years .
Shares of Palm , 30 percent owned by Elevation Partners , jumped 27 percent to $ 5.88 , above HP ’s $ 5.70 cash offer .
Some investors could be betting on a higher bid , while others could be covering short positions on the heavily shorted stock , analysts said ..
HP said the deal for Palm , which both boards have approved , valued the company at $ 1.2 billion including debt .
Based on Palm ’s latest filing , the deal values Palm ’s 167.892 million shares outstanding at $ 957 million .
Analysts said HP has deep pockets to invest in Palm , can expand its carrier relationships and negotiate better component pricing from existing suppliers .
“ PC companies do n’t need cellphone - type margins to make the model work ; they can be much more price - aggressive in capturing share and will certainly drive margins down for everyone else , ” said Avi Cohen at Avian Securities .
Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised HP , while Goldman Sachs advised Palm .
GOOD DEAL OR NOT ?
HP 's foray into the fiercely contested smartphone arena , while it may not immediately threaten Apple , and Research in Motion 's BlackBerry , may increase pressure on Nokia NOK1V.HE , Motorola MOT.N and other device manufacturers now battling to expand their market share .
“ Nokia will be one of the most affected players , ” said IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo .
Because of a “ wrong portfolio and lack of carrier support , Nokia never moved from its eighth position ... in the smartphone segment .
This deal puts also pressure on Motorola and HTC . ”
Others , however , were more skeptical about HP ’s ability to turn around Palm , whose Pre and Pixi phones have withered in the face of fierce competition .
“ If HP wants to have a global role in the mobile space , spending $ 1.2 billion in Palm is not the way .
Palm has no brand outside the U.S. , and it has no distribution outside the U.S. ” said John Strand , chief executive of Strand Consult .
“ To pay $ 1.2 billion for a U.S. - centric mobile player that ’s not successful is a first - class way to destroy shareholder value .
Palm has tried to move from the PDA world into the mobile world for eight years without success , ” Strand said .
According to Gartner , Palm held 1.2 percent of the global smartphone market in 2009 , compared with Nokia 's NOK1V .
HE 41.1 percent , RIM 's 19.9 percent and Apple 's 14.4 percent .
Despite Palm ’s shortcomings , persistent takeover rumors have attracted many investors to the heavily shorted stock .
For example , Philip Falcone ’s hedge fund Harbinger Capital Partners LLC bought Palm shares on April 12 , when they were trading between $ 5.43 and $ 6.29 , and had a 9.48 percent stake .
The deal may mark the culmination of a long - running effort by private equity firm Elevation Partners , the private equity firm that boasts U2 frontman Bono among its partners .
Elevation -- which bought a quarter of Palm for $ 325 million in 2007 -- had brought in numerous ex-Apple executives over the years in hopes of turning the company around , including Rubinstein .
It was unclear how much Elevation , which has invested about $ 460 million in Palm , made or lost .
Some investment banking sources had thought that Lenovo 0992.HK was the leading candidate to buy Palm after the U.S. company was rebuffed by other potential Asian buyers including HTC Corp 2498 .
TW and Huawei HWT .UL .
Palm now expects fiscal fourth quarter revenue in the range of $ 90 million to $ 100 million , compared with its mid-March forecast that revenue would be less than $ 150 million .
Todd Bradley , executive vice president of HP ’s computer division , said the company plans to “ invest heavily ” in Palm , increasing spending on sales and marketing and research and development in the hope of spurring the developer community into writing more applications for the platform .
Palm ’s app universe now has more than 2,000 applications , dwarfed by Apple ’s App store with closer to 200,000 apps .
Bradley also said Palm ’s platform is attractive for an entire ecosystem of mobile devices , from smartphones to slate devices to netbooks .
HP Executives expected a few cents ” dilution for from the deal in the second half of fiscal 2010 and “ mild ” impact in 2011 -- for a company that in the fiscal first quarter reported non-GAAP earnings of $ 1.07 per share .
“ Coupled with our scale , global reach and investments in the ecosystem , we expect we will see solid growth , ” he said .
HP already has a smartphone , the iPaq , which runs on Microsoft's MSFT .
O Windows mobile platform .
But the device has gained little traction in a crowded market .
Rubinstein is expected to remain with the company , HP said in a statement , adding that the acquisition would likely close during its third fiscal quarter ending July 31 .
Shares of HP fell 1 percent to $ 52.75 in extended trading from their New York Stock Exchange close of $ 53.28 .
HP “ would be one of the few companies that I think could successfully turn Palm around .
The company has great brand , great international distribution , ” said C.L. King Associates ’ analyst Lawrence Harris .
“ That will open a lot of doors . ”

Meet Republican politician Sue Lowden , a wealthy casino owner .
According to recent opinion polls , she 's likely to be the next US Senator from the state of Nevada , thanks to a double - digit lead over the Democratic incumbent Harry Reid .
At least , she was the main contender for Reid 's seat – until she started propounding her chicken - based healthcare plan .
On Monday Lowden appeared on a local TV programme , where she was asked about a mildly eccentric suggestion she had made that patients should haggle and barter with their doctors to save money on their medical bills .
As you can see from the video clip above , she replied :
" You know , before we all started having health care , in the olden days , our grandparents , they would bring a chicken to the doctor .
They would say I 'll paint your house ....
In the old days that 's what people would do to get health care with their doctors .
Doctors are very sympathetic people .
I 'm not backing down from that system . "
Washington Monthly blogger Steve Benen was one of many who responded to Lowden 's plan with an open mouth .
" This is one of the dumbest things I 've ever heard from a candidate for statewide office , " wrote Benen .
" If there was n't a video , I might not even believe it . "
Harry Reid 's campaign was more blunt , sending out a statement headlined : " Has Sue Lowden lost her mind ? "
The Democratic party was also quick to respond , reports the Las Vegas Review - Journal :
Phoebe Sweet , communications director for the Nevada State Democratic Party , and a few of her barnyard friends who shall remain nameless stopped by Lowden 's campaign headquarters .
" I tried to trade this goat for some health care , and my doctor looked at me like I 'm crazy , " Sweet told a receptionist as she carried the 25 - pound goat into the headquarters with a local TV crew tracking her .
" So I was just curious if you had any information on her barter plan . "
" No , thank you , " the unidentified receptionist said politely .
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has put together a handy website , complete with list of ailments ( rickets , scurvy , swamp fever ) and possible bargaining chips ( including " best ranch hand " ) with which to barter for healthcare .
" Do you need medical care ?
Write a letter to Sue Lowden with your ailment and what you 're willing to trade , and we 'll make sure she gets it .
It 's just like the good old days ! " is the gloating copy .
Over on Twitter a " LowdenCare " meme has sprung up .
" Under # LowdenCare do we pay urgent care facilities in McNuggets ? , " wondered one tweet .
" Crap .
My doctor 's a vegan , " tweeted Duncan Black , the blogger Atrios .
Even the normally cerebral Economist bloggers joined in with some hilarious – well , hilarious if you are a reader of the Economist – jokes about chicken - based collateralised debt obligations :
For example , payment in kind would eliminate many of the risky innovations that led to the financial crisis .
It would be virtually impossible to structure a chicken - based CDO ; sure , you could find buyers for the breast tranche easily enough , but who would take all those necks and feet ?
Leverage rules become much less necessary when you can only hedge with items that actually exist ; it 's hard to imagine the notional value of chicken - based hedges greatly exceeding the number of actual chickens on the planet .
And all this could be accomplished without any new taxes .
It 'll be interesting to see what happens to Lowden .
She is currently the most likely candidate to win the Republican primary on 8 June , according to recent polls .
But of course , one should never count one 's chickens till they are hatched .
The real shame is that Lowden is n't running for office in Kentucky .
The first line says it all :
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday that Democrats would pursue a bruising , rarely - used parliamentary procedure to muscle health care legislation through the Senate over the vehement opposition of chamber Republicans .
You have to wonder if Michael Steel and Frank Luntz are perched on this guys shoulder whispering sweet nothings .
Once again these class clowns are proving to be the water carriers for the Republican noise machine .
This all comes on the heels of the Politico announcing that the Healthcare summit was a " tie , " but that means the Republicans won .
His Democratic operatives ( Fox news Democrats ? ) told Thrush this ( note the Republican poll - tested words below ) so it has to be fact .
The beltway arbiters of what we should believe :
But in this case , the tie goes to Republicans , according to operatives on both sides of the aisle — because the stakes were so much higher for Democrats trying to build their case for ramming reform through using a 51 - vote reconciliation tactic .
Never mentioning the Republicans abusing the filibuster .
Heck ,
Bunning is putting a one man stop on benefits extensions , but that gets a low page byline .
The beltway boys of hysterical political tabloid sensationalism are at it again .
We need to call out this Mickey Mouse shop for what it is : another arm of the Republican media .
There is no excuse for using Republican memes verbatim and employing them as fact in articles posing as journalism .
Shameless ...
Creating Blueberry Garden
By Erik Sved�ng
[ Erik Svedang , the creator of the 2009 Independent Games Festival Grand Prize winner Blueberry Garden , shares the thought processes and inspirations that shaped his atmospheric exploration - based PC indie game , which he calls " a small stepping stone in trying to help evolve storytelling in games . " ]
I was a bit reluctant to write this text at first , since I do n't think I 'm the best person to pick my own game apart .
I'm a creator , and not a game critic , and obviously what I 'm going to write about lies too close to my heart for me to really see it clearly .
Initially I was going to write a regular Gamasutra postmortem , which would have solved the problem to some extent .
I could have focused on obvious mistakes such as releasing a game with no saving functionality , ridiculously high system requirements , and extremely limited buying options in today 's video game market .
I resisted this , though ; it 's not what I am interested in .
I 'm primarily a game designer , and since the rest of the world clearly has moved beyond my level of amateurishness I will just promise to do better in the future and move on to look at the more interesting points of my game .
When I set out to create the game , I almost completely looked at it as an experiment , or rather two experiments , combined into one whole .
First of all , I really wanted to create a game where the underlying world was a working ecosystem .
I imagined many creatures with different behaviors eating , mating , dying , etc. -- completely independent of the presence of the player .
Secondly I wanted to see what I could do with the idea of telling a story solely through interactivity , the " holy grail " of our art form .
This would include not forcing the player to do anything she did n't want to do .
In other words , she would have total control over the actions of the player character .
In my mind this meant to not use any cutscenes , descriptive texts , or triggered events -- all meaning of the story would have to emerge from the systems of the game ( and these systems would have to be general ) .
This would turn out to be a very difficult thing to do , indeed .
I started the actual production in early 2008 as a part of my final thesis at the bachelor degree Game Design program in Skövde that I went to at the time .
As I worked along on my game and people got hold of the trailer and my working version , it became increasingly clear that I could not look at my work as completely academic or self - fulfilling .
I realized that people would actually want to play my creation ( and even pay money for it -- gasp ! )
This of course presented me with some interesting problems , mainly concerning the length of the game .
This text aims to look at these two main parts of the game ( the ecosystem and the interactive storytelling ) in separation to see how well they work on their own .
After that I will discuss how they combine into a game and how they represent some possibilities for creating meaning through interaction .
The ecosystem
The idea of having an ecosystem in a game is naturally nothing new .
It has been done many times before and I should have taken a better look at existing examples to be better prepared for the daunting task I had set up for myself .
The reason I wanted an ecosystem in the game in the first place was that it's one of the most interesting and easy to understand real - world systems with emergent properties .
For some reason it speaks to the human soul that we 're just part of a greater circle of life .
Also I wanted to beat Peter Molyneux by putting growing trees into games before he succeeded .
To make the ecosystem " real " I decided that it had to be simulated in all places simultaneously , without any difference if the camera of the player was there or not .
This is something that I think many people that are new to video games take for granted , but gradually learn that " that 's not how it works in games " and eventually come to terms with .
I wanted people to be able to bring real - world knowledge into the game and make use of it there .
One could even say that my goal was to make the game easier for a person used to surviving in the woods than for an experienced gamer .
Sadly ( and predictably ) this failed ...
I think I will try again someday .
To be able to build this kind of system I realized I needed elements like plants , seeds and creatures .
This in turn made me understand that some kind of physics simulation was necessary ; gravity had to pull the apples down from the trees , so tospeak .
This is where things got messy :
Problems of simulation
This article will not discuss programming , so suffice it to say that constantly simulating all the physics in a big , freely explorable world is not a great idea , especially not if someone is going to use the computer to play a platforming game at the same time .
This was clearly one of the things where my academic interest and artistic vision was prioritized , with the players of the game paying the price .
In a way , I think it was worth it though ; it really is an area of computer games that needs exploration .
I have had some clever people giving me pointers on how the simulation could be simplified to make it more manageable .
This could involve running a less accurate version of the physics in far off places in the world , for example .
I do n't want the game to work that way though .
For me , a huge part of the experience is knowing that everything is " for real . "
In Blueberry Garden the tree falls in the forest even if no one hears it .
This might not be the route for the future of game design .
Maybe you could even dismiss it as utterly meaningless .
But now I 've at least tried it and can go on with my life .
Impossible puzzles
One problem with making things " realistic " in games is that it 's usually not very fun , at least not in the immediate and happy - go - lucky way that we 've somehow gotten used to over the years .
A perfect example of that is the choice to make every action in the game world irreversible and permanent .
This means that in my game , if you , for example , kill all the creatures of a certain kind , they will be extinguished ( until you start over the game from the beginning ) .
It also means that if the player messes up a puzzle so that it can't be solved , there is no reset button .
Even if you walk far away from the location everything will still be the same way when you come back .
This seems to cause less problems than I thought it would , probably because there are n't that many actual puzzles in the game .
Actually there are very few things that you really need to do -- a prerequisite for making a non-linear experience work .
Underused puzzle potential
One interesting dilemma I was presented with early in the design process was how many puzzles and obstacles I really wanted to put into the game .
Of course most video game players would expect a constant stream of challenges , something that was problematic in several ways :
First , I did n't want to make the landscape feel like it was designed by someone .
It should feel as if it had evolved on its own through erosion , volcanos , etc .
In early versions of the game I even wanted to simulate that whole process for a long period of time and then let the game take off from there .
Secondly , I did n't want to make a game that was about puzzles .
I wanted to focus on storytelling and the experience of discovery .
Puzzles draw attention to the designer , simply because they are designed .
I wanted the players to forget about me .
This idea did n't last for long though ; when I started building the game it quickly became clear to me that I had to design the environment down to its smallest detail .
This turned out to be much more fun as I could try to subconsciously influence the player to do certain things : explore in different directions , perform interesting actions , etc .
At the time I read several texts talking about game design as architecture ; shaping a space for people to explore .
This had a profound effect on the way I worked and with time my role changed from scientist to hypnotist .
Instead of observing the player I tried to influence her to create a memorable and strong experience for herself , without even noticing that she was being led to do this .
Instead of making the environment feel untouched I focused on creating the most well - thought out experience I could -- still without ever forcing the player to do anything .
Interactive Storytelling
At the time I made the game I was kind of obsessed with the thought of the player as an actor , taking on the main role in the game and trying to make as great a performance as possible .
This is something that turned out somewhat fuzzy during development .
Since it 's not communicated to the player , I do n't think a lot of people consciously played the game like an actor .
Still I hope that it 's actually part of what draws players in ; the feeling of being allowed to create your own story as an effect of not being told what to do .
I will now look at some
other things related to the interactive storytelling in my game .
Tangibility and an even level of interaction
A big part of designing computer games is to decide what actions the player should be allowed to perform .
From the verbs of text adventure games to different attacks for units in strategy games , the actions are crucial for shaping the experience .
For me , the most important thing while designing the actions in Blueberry Garden was to make them all feel natural and on the same level .
By " level " , I here refer to the complexity of different actions , such as for example walking forward , picking up a rock , or eating a blueberry .
All of these actions are short , simple and easy to recognize .
It would have been against this philosophy to mix them up , with for example the possibility to bend your left middle finger ( which is a very tiny action ) or to build a house ( which is a very complex action ) .
I 'm not sure this obsession with a minimal and well - put together toolset of actions is really good for the game , mainly because it severely limits the storytelling possibilities .
I even had to add a special action to enable the most significant story event : turning off the faucet .
Speech
Originally I had some plans for the player to meet other human - like characters in the game that he or she could interact with .
Since I really wanted to make all actions in the game feel believable and of the same level of complexity , I eventually decided that I could n't use speech between characters .
This in turn influenced the design of the other beings in the world , since it had to feel natural that they did n't talk .
The obvious way to do this was to make them animals , so that 's what I did .
I initially had the idea to let the player interact in different non-verbal ways with the animals ; for example by scaring them or giving them food to make them more friendly .
Unfortunately a lot of this got cut out of the final design ; the animals do n't care that much about the player .
This is a real shame and I hope to revisit these design concepts in the future .
Story
Even though walking through my whimsical garden surely could have pleased some people solely through sensory pleasures such as music and visuals , I wanted to try to make the experience into something more memorable .
In my mind that meant that playing the game should at least remotely resemble a proper story .
Of course my main problem was the restrictions I had put upon myself ; no cutscenes , descriptive text , or triggered events -- arguably the most common ways to make people put together what is happening in a video game into something understandable and meaningful .
The first narrative element I had in the game was the tower that you build by finding building blocks scattered around the game world .
This mechanic was what made up the core idea for the game , all the way from the beginning .
In its simplest form this is the story of someone growing or improving in some way -- a popular plot that seems to engage most humans .
In a way it 's exactly the same thing as characters leveling up in role playing games , only very much more tangible and wordless , since the actual output is a construction and not a number .
The tower , and its construction , was a given from the beginning .
What I did n't know , though , was how to explain why the player wanted to build the tower .
I figured that most people would want to build for a while just to be able to see more of the world ( the higher the tower is , the more places you can reach by gliding from the top of it . )
But after a certain time they would probably feel satisfied and lose interest .
I toyed around with different ideas ; the first one was that you had fell down from the moon where you and your loved one lived ; alas , you needed to build a tower to get up there again .
Another one was about competing with another character in the world about who could build the highest tower .
At some point I got the idea of flooding the world , and was thrilled with how well that worked together with the tower building .
A threat or an antagonist is part of most stories .
This was the perfect chance to include one in mine !
It 's worth noting how my restrictions on cutscenes and triggered events prevented me from telling the player about anything directly .
All has to be deducted from the environment and how it changes -- something that does n't work if the player is n't actually trying to analyze things .
This kind of storytelling by its very nature feels very vague , as we are all used to it actually involving " telling " ( something that text and cutscenes do very well ) .
To some extent this can be solved through a clearer and well - framed execution , but I also think that it 's part of letting the player handle being the author .
It might be a strange feeling , since no one is telling you if you 're doing it right -- but that 's just because there is no wrong !
Putting it all together
It 's evident that my two main areas of interest while making the game , the ecosystem and the interactive storytelling , overlap quite a bit when put into the same game .
The reason is that they both have the same basic idea of being based on systems instead of manuscripts and on rules instead of pre-made decisions .
This concept is of course what all games have in common , though only to a different degree .
My hope before starting making the game was to place myself firmly on the outer edge of the " interactivity " side while still giving the player the tools to experience some kind of meaningful story .
By " meaningful " , I mean that it should include memorable events , follow some kind of structure , and make sense to human beings .
If I could succeed in that while still letting the player " do whatever he wants " I thought I would be happy .
In the end all this boils down to what has been a hot topic for a long time now , namely how games have to start saying things to be taken seriously .
The one important thing to realize is that I 'm not talking about " meaning " as in contemporary art , where some obscure thought from the artist ( or the viewer of the artwork ) is imagined to be hidden inside the work .
When I talk about the game being meaningful to people , I mean that in a very direct way : showing them things that interests them , preferably from an angle they have n't seen before .
So how does Blueberry Garden hold up in this respect ?
What do the gameplay and interactions in my game say to the player ?
This is of course up to everyone to figure out for themselves .
One simple but powerful feature of interactive experiences is that they can be easily changed , meaning different things to different people .
Of course so can books and movies too , but not in the same extreme way .
If you want to play Blueberry Garden as a story about how a maniac killed every animal in the world by throwing them down into the water -- be my guest .
The meaning I will discuss here is primarily my intended meaning .
This is dangerous territory indeed !
One could argue that the need to explain things shows a clear failure of communication on my side .
I agree with this ; actually I 'd rather have you go play the game and see what you come up with yourself .
On the other hand I think there is value in me revealing what I wanted to achieve since , it will make it more obvious where I succeeded and where I failed .
I have decided to break down the meaning of the game in three levels , from the lowest to the highest .
Unfortunately , this is not based on any well acknowledged theories I 've read ; it 's just a way that I like to think about it .
Please bear with me even if you do n't approve of my classification .
My point is not to present " the grand theory of meaning in games . "
I just want to present my thinking in an orderly fashion .
Meaning in games can occur at several levels simultaneously .
First of all , every small event in the game brings with it some meaning .
A player throwing a creature into the water to let it drown could be described as " murder " , for instance .
This is not something the game and its rules say anything about , it 's just something that emerges from how the creatures and the game world work .
Other meaningful actions are more pre-planned , such as the ability to eat fruit to get special powers or building the tower a little higher by finding a strange object in the landscape .
Still , the meaning is there ; nothing is so abstract that it can't be described through normal means of telling a story .
Most video games work very well on this level .
The second layer is way more interesting .
It could probably best be described as " the story layer . "
This is where the smaller , atomic events of playing the game work together to form some kind of a story .
This is where most modern video games use cutscenes and other pre-determined chunks of events to make things work out .
If those elements would be removed , no one would know really what was going on .
When this works out in a FPS for example , it gives you a reason to shoot at the enemies , and you know that the game is over when the bad boss is killed .
So what story does Blueberry Garden tell ?
Of course there are several , arguably boring stories that some people have created through playing the game .
Someone might just have walked around the garden , looking at things for a while , and then turned it off .
That story is certainly not very interesting to tell back to someone .
Another potential story is when the ecosystem goes crazy and birds invade the whole world .
This happens rarely , but it certainly makes for a different experience .
The stories that I hoped that most people would experience are a bit more substantial , though .
To my great pleasure it seems like most players experience exactly the series of events that was intended .
The first playthrough this goes something like this , retold from a first person perspective :
I found myself lost in a strange land filled with flowers and strangely shaped terrain .
Since no one was around to tell me what was going on , I decided to explore some .
First of all I learned how to fly , then that I could eat blueberries .
Eventually I realized how I could construct a tower with objects that I found ; this tower helped me to explore the world more .
Suddenly it dawned upon me that the water in the world was rising .
Yikes !
What could I do ?!
I tried flying as far as I could to the right , where I found a faucet .
I could n't reach it , but maybe if I could make the tower a little higher ...?
As I tried finding more building blocks , the water started rising very quickly .
Panic !
As the water flooded the whole world , my only chance of survival was to stand carefully on a log .
When I tried to move I fell down into the abyss .
Game over .
This is certainly more exciting !
This is not just some random dude with a beak running around in a crazy garden ; this is an actual series of events that makes sense only when put together .
It certainly lacks human drama and interesting character portraits -- it 's very primal .
To me , that 's fine .
My work is just a small stepping stone in trying to help evolve storytelling in games .
The next level of meaning is what could be described as " the message . "
Some people seem obsessed with the idea that things that could be described as " works of art " also have to have some kind of underlying message .
The simple answer here is that I did n't have any message with Blueberry Garden .
Some people might think that I was commenting on global warming , for instance .
While ecology and sustainability are certainly things that are close to my heart , this is not something that I was pushing for very much ( at the same time I think that it 's impossible to not embed a part of yourself in your work ) .
In the end though , I think the most correct analysis comes from looking at what my top - level design goals were .
As stated before , the main reason for me to make the game was to try out some underused game design ideas ( the ecosystem and storytelling solely through interaction ) .
These two messages , when combined into one game , become all about what that game asks its players to do ; namely to think for themselves and be responsible .
Put into an unknown environment with no one to tell you right from wrong , what would you do ?
As humans we so often rely on the hive - mind and other people 's opinions .
Left to our own devices we have to get back in a kind of primal state , where our actions have real consequences .
Without any load button or possibility to reset missed opportunities , we suddenly are forced to think hard -- or everything is lost .
This is not something that is ever told to the player directly , but anyone who plays the game will feel those things .
Finally there is something more to be said about my process of creating the game .
As I hope is clear from the text , I used science or academic interest as a big motivation .
I wanted to know certain things and let that determine how the game should work .
Of course that is not the whole truth ; I also had more personal and artistic reasons to make the game .
Much of what makes people like the game , I think , comes from the fact that I brought in a lot of what is " me " and my experiences to the game .
A good example of this is the landscape , which is very much inspired by Sweden 's west coast archipelago , with its bare rocks and occasional trees swaying in the wind .
A big part of what I tried to do was capture the mood of an empty island in the middle of the summer .
The kind of day where it 's neither cloudy nor sunny and a small wind is chilling everything down a little .
The water is dark , and even though everything is very nice you have a certain sense of doom .
If anything of that feeling has appeared in the room while you played the game I 'm very satisfied .
If this game will be remembered in the future it will not be for what it is , but rather for what it tried to do .
Looked at from afar , through the binoculars of today 's game design practice , it does not make very much sense .
Instead I beg everyone to focus on the finer details , the subtle things that really try to make the player experience something profound .
These details are a direct result of trying to take a relatively simple idea ( a story told solely through interactive means , set in an ecosystem ) and bringing it to its extreme , adding as little extraneous elements as possible .
Even if the results are both rough and vague , hidden behind code of dubious quality , I hope they will encourage more exploration .
To all of us who are pursuing that path -- good luck !

Editor 's Note :
The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE , an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn , New York .
VBS.TV is Vice 's broadband television network .
The reports , which are produced solely by VICE , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process .
We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers .
Brooklyn , New York ( VBS.TV ) --
Getting into North Korea was one of the weirdest processes VBS has ever dealt with .
After we went back and forth with their representatives for months , they finally said they were going to allow 16 journalists to come and cover the Arirang Mass Games in Pyongyang .
Just before our departure , they suddenly said , " No , nobody can come . "
Then they said , " OK , OK , you can come .
But only as tourists . "
But they already knew we were journalists , and over there if you get caught being a journalist when you 're supposed to be a tourist you go to jail .
We do n't like jail .
And we 're willing to bet we'd hate jail in North Korea .
But we went for it .
The first leg of the trip was a flight into northern China .
At the airport , the North Korean consulate took our passports and all our money , then brought us to a restaurant along with our tour group .
All the other diners left , and these women came out and started singing North Korean nationalist songs .
We were thinking , " Look , we were just on a plane for 20 hours .
Ca n't we just go to bed ? "
But this guy with our group who was from the L.A .
Times told us , " Everyone in here besides us is secret police .
If you do n't act excited then you 're not going to get your visa . "
So we got drunk and sang songs with the girls .
The next day we got our visas .
A lot of people we had gone with did n't get theirs .
We flew into North Korea that night .
We were supposed to have three days before the games started , but as soon as we got on the ground they told us , " The games are happening now . "
We went straight to the stadium , and there were 40,000 people in the stands , portraying the history of the North Korean revolution with flip cards .
On the playing field before them , about 60,000 people did wild synchronized - gymnastics routines .
The 15 of us who made up the audience watched from a marble dais .
We were the only spectators .
Fifteen audience members for a 100,000 - man extravaganza .
See the rest of the Vice Guide to North Korea
The next day , our grand tour began .
We went to the International Friendship Museum , which comprises 2,000 rooms carved into the bottom of a mountain .
The displays are all gifts from different world leaders .
Joseph Stalin gave Kim Il - sung a train .
Mao Zedong also gave Kim Il - sung a train .
He got hunting rifles from communist East Germany 's Erich Honecker and Romania 's Nicolae Ceausescu and all the other Eastern - bloc guys .
Madeleine Albright famously gave Kim Jong - il a basketball signed by Michael Jordan .
Perhaps the weirdest thing about North Koreans is that they genuinely do n't seem to know that the rest of the planet hates and fears them .
They believe ( or maybe they really convincingly lie about believing ) that the whole world admires and envies them and that they 're the true light of socialism and Juche , which is their leader 's philosophy of Communist self - reliance .
As the days went on , North Korea presented us with progressively stranger sights and encounters .
Being there was like being nowhere else on the planet .
Are we glad that we got into Pyongyang and were able to document it ?
Yes .
But are we even gladder that we made it out ?
Watch our documentary on the trip and try to guess the answer .
Last week I pointed out a somewhat mysterious , undated entry ( turned out to be Nov. 24 , 2009 ) at the website of the “ official ” arbiters of recession , the NBER .
Rooting around the web , and finding myself at the site of the Census Bureau , I caught the following cryptic note at the page where Durable Goods data is released :
The Census Bureau identified a processing error that occurred when revising historic seasonally adjusted data for the November ( data month ) releases .
The data have been corrected .
As of January 15 , 2010 , revised data from January 2001 through October 2009 are available in the Historical Timeseries – NAICS tables , under the Historical Data tab .
Being skeptical and curious , I wondered what this “ error ” implied for the most recent release of Durable Goods ( because we ’re always all about the latest green shoot , right ? ) .
Here we go again .
It struck me as a bit unusual that the data had been corrected as of January 15 — not coinciding with a scheduled Durable Goods release , which actually comes this Thursday , the 28th .
Seemed to be a slip - it - in - there - while - no - one ’s - looking type of thing .
( And no , I ’m really not a conspiracy theorist . )
But back to the November data :
You may recall that consensus for November ’s Durable Goods had been +0.5 % .
The reported data was lighter than expected at +0.2 % .
Looking at the revisions the Census Bureau has now incorporated into the data , we see that November actually printed at - 0.7 % .
Here are the “ Before ” and “ After ” charts :
Before
After Revision
Admittedly October was bumped up a bit .
But we now are looking at two consecutive months of declines , which we ’ve not seen since December 2008 ( - 3.7 % ) and January 2009 ( - 7.9 % ) , when the world was falling apart .
And the trend seems to have deteriorated , with November now being the worst print since August .
What might the real - time impact have been had the Census Bureau initially reported a disappointing - 0.7 % instead of the +0.2 % they maintained until very recently ?
Consensus for Thursday is around + 1.5 % – +2.0 % .
Stay tuned .

Listen to a podcast with Max Bergmann on the New START treaty ( mp3 )
Listen to a press call on the NEW START with former British Defense Minister Des Browne , Ploughshares Fund President Joe Cirincione , Max Bergmann , and Samuel Charap ( mp3 )
What is New START and why do we need it ?
New START , the agreement between the United States and Russia on a successor to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , is a historic achievement that will increase the United States ’ safety and security .
It will help us move beyond the outdated strategic approaches of the Cold War and reduce the threat of nuclear war , and marks a significant step in advancing President Barack Obama ’s vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
It also shows that his policy of constructive engagement with Russia is working .
New START strengthens and modernizes the original START Treaty that President Ronald Reagan initiated in 1982 and George H.W. Bush signed in 1991 .
That agreement significantly reduced the number of nuclear weapons and launchers , but it also embodied Reagan ’s favorite Russian proverb “ trust but verify ” by establishing an extensive verification and monitoring system to ensure compliance .
This system helped build trust and mutual confidence that decreased the unimaginable consequences of а conflict between the world ’s only nuclear superpowers .
Yet President George W. Bush ’s reckless policies left this cornerstone of nuclear stability ’s fate in doubt .
Bush effectively cut off relations between the United States and Russia on nuclear issues by unilaterally pulling out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and refusing to engage in negotiations on a successor to START even though it was set to expire less than a year after he left office .
The two countries had lost the ability to work together on arms control by the end of Bush ’s presidency .
The Obama administration restored these ties by adopting an approach of constructive engagement with Moscow , and in little over a year it succeeded in negotiating an extensive new agreement that continues the legacy of Reagan ’s verification system , which brought stability to U.S. - Russia nuclear relations for two decades .
New START has the U.S. military ’s full backing .
It has been endorsed by the country ’s leading voices on national security from across the political spectrum , including prominent Republicans such as Sen. Richard Lugar ( R - IN ) , ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , and former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger , Colin Powell , and George Schultz .
But New START , like any treaty , requires the approval of a two - thirds majority ( 67 votes ) of the Senate for ratification , and there is a danger that it will have difficulty overcoming the intense partisan obstructionism in that body .
Since the agreement answers all of the concerns that were raised during the negotiation process there should be no doubt about the motives of those who would block ratification : ideological opposition to arms control or a partisan strategy to uniformly obstruct and reject anything President Obama proposes .
Senators would do well in their deliberations to consider the consequences of not ratifying the treaty .
If the Senate rejects New START , we would enter a period of nuclear instability and potentially a new arms race .
This would be disastrous for U.S. national security .
The United States and Russia are no longer adversaries .
Yet two decades after the end of the Cold War they still possess more than 20,000 nuclear weapons — 95 percent of the world ’s total .
This new treaty represents an important step toward moving us beyond this haunting legacy .
What does New START accomplish ?
The new agreement maintains and modernizes the existing verification system , places significant limits on deployed strategic warheads , lays the groundwork for stronger international action on arms control and nonproliferation , and restores U.S. - Russia nuclear relations .
It establishes a robust verification regime that modernizes the framework contained in Reagan ’s START agreement .
This treaty enables the United States and Russia to continue to monitor each other ’s nuclear stockpiles , ensuring that both sides are living up to the agreement .
U.S. and Russian negotiators reportedly leveraged their experience with START ’s verification and monitoring measures to streamline some of the more lumbering procedures to build a more efficient and effective verification regime .
The actual text of the treaty has yet to be released , but early information indicates that this new verification regime will deepen trust and confidence between the two nuclear superpowers and even go further than START in ensuring compliance .
The original treaty ’s verification system only counted delivery vehicles , such as the number of deployed missiles .
It did n’t actually count the number of warheads contained inside of each missile , and this new system will .
It limits the number of nuclear warheads to levels not seen since the days of the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations .
New START will limit the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 1,500 — a 30 percent drop from the 2,200 currently allowed .
The allowable number of nuclear launchers — land - based missiles , submarine - based missiles , and bombers — will see their aggregate limit reduced from 1,600 to 800 .
No more than 700 launching systems can be deployed at a given time .
It significantly bolsters upcoming efforts to combat nuclear terrorism and proliferation .
The signing of New START comes just days before President Obama convenes the Nuclear Security Summit , a meeting in Washington , D.C. with 44 heads of state on April 12 and 13 that will focus on strategies for preventing nuclear terrorism .
These meaningful limits on the United States ’ deployed nuclear weapons will put the United States in a stronger position to convince other world leaders to take steps to secure nuclear stockpiles and prevent nuclear trafficking .
The new agreement also gives fresh momentum to next month ’s Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference in New York , which is meant to bolster the agreement that is the backbone of international efforts to counter nuclear proliferation .
Nuclear - armed states under the Non-Proliferation Treaty agree to reduce their arsenals and provide non-nuclear - armed countries with access to civilian nuclear technology in exchange for an agreement from non-nuclear - armed states to forgo the pursuit of nuclear weapons .
New START gives the United States credibility to bolster the NPT by showing progress on its end of the nuclear bargain and puts us on a much better standing from which to forge a strong international diplomatic effort to confront North Korea and Iran over their nuclear programs .
It restores U.S. - Russia nuclear relations and lays the groundwork for more far - reaching agreements .
U.S. - Russia relations on nuclear policy issues had fallen apart by the time President Bush left office .
His unilateral withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty in 2001 helped poison nuclear relations , and the three - page arms reduction treaty he signed in 2002 was a weak agreement that contained no verification measures to ensure compliance .
The Bush administration also did essentially no work in its final years to lay the groundwork for a START successor agreement .
The Obama administration had to start from scratch on a new treaty with only months left before the original START expired amid a completely dysfunctional relationship with Moscow on nuclear issues .
The successful conclusion of negotiations puts this relationship back on track and sets the stage for future talks .
The administration should immediately begin working with Russia after New START is signed on a more far - reaching arms control agreement that addresses tactical nuclear weapons and seeks reductions in nondeployed strategic nuclear warheads .
The Obama administration ’s approach to Russia
When President Obama took office in January 2009 , the U.S. - Russia relationship was at its lowest point since the end of the Cold War .
President Bush was presented just five months earlier with the option of conducting military strikes against the Russian military units that had invaded Georgia .
Such a move would have had catastrophic consequences , but the bilateral relationship was in a state of near - complete disrepair even before the Russia - Georgia war .
Ties between the two governments declined rapidly following a brief period of intense cooperation after 9/11 .
The Bush administration largely neglected Russia policy and spent little effort on the bilateral relationship , leaving it to hinge on the personal rapport between the two presidents .
The Georgia war was merely the immediate catalyst of the complete unraveling of a relationship that had already hollowed out .
The Obama administration worked to improve U.S. - Russia relations in order to advance core U.S. national security interests .
The Obama administration came into office with the conviction that an improved U.S. - Russia relationship would be crucial for its attempts to make progress on top priorities , including counterterrorism , nonproliferation , and nuclear security .
It decided to adopt a new approach and engage Moscow on critical issues facing both countries — a tactic Vice President Joseph Biden described as pressing “ the reset button . ”
It sought to work with Moscow on matters of mutual concern while avoiding needlessly provocative rhetoric and demonstrating greater transparency with the expectation that the other side would do the same .
There were to be no trade - offs in return for Russia ’s cooperation : the administration did not silence criticism of Russia ’s violations of its international commitments , backtrack on American values , or otherwise appease the Kremlin .
The administration argued instead that U.S. objections to some of the Russian government ’s actions should not prevent cooperation on questions where interests converge , but that this cooperation would not serve as a pretext for ignoring the objections .
Engagement with Russia is not capitulation .
The United States is capable of working with the Russians on key national security priorities and at the same time pushing back on disagreements .
Engagement is anything but capitulation , and over time it might create conditions that allow us to address our concerns about Russia ’s actions more effectively by opening up channels of communication and diminishing antagonism .
The Bush administration ’s isolation tactic produced the opposite result .
New START is definitive proof that engagement with Russia has paid off .
The reset restored a degree of trust and created an atmosphere that allowed the two countries to produce what is a landmark document .
Engagement has raised the prospects for future cooperation between Washington and Moscow , both on arms control and the vast array of other issues on the bilateral agenda , ranging from stabilizing Afghanistan to confronting Iran to deepening trade .
As President Obama put it , “ When the United States and Russia can cooperate effectively , it advances the mutual interests of our two nations , and the security and prosperity of the wider world . ”
His policy of engagement put this key relationship on a productive footing and made New START possible .
New START addresses critics ’ concerns
The Senate should expedite New START ’s ratification .
The treaty builds on Reagan ’s legacy and has widespread bipartisan support from leading voices on national security .
Yet ratification is far from a sure thing in this hyperpartisan political environment .
It is clear from what we now know about the treaty that votes against New START in the Senate will reflect either ideological opposition to arms control or a crass partisan desire to deny the president a victory — even on an issue so vital for U.S. national security .
Indeed , ideological arms - control opponents have raised questions about the Obama administration ’s approach to the negotiations for months — some frivolous politically motivated arguments and others substantive concerns — but New START addresses all of these .
New START will not constrain missile defense .
Anti-arms control ideologues have long predicted that the Obama administration would agree to provisions limiting our capacity to implement missile defense programs .
They were wrong .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates put it bluntly , saying , “ missile defense is not constrained by this treaty . ”
And Sen. Lugar has concurred .
According to administration officials , there will be a brief line in the preamble of New START that acknowledges that there is a relationship between offensive and defensive systems — essentially a repetition of language from a U.S. - Russia joint understanding released in July 2009 .
Yet this language is not actionable and will in no way restrict the United States from developing missile defense capabilities , despite what some conservative opponents of the administration claim .
Unilateral declarations on missile defense from Moscow will not affect the treaty .
Sens .
Kyl , McCain , and Lieberman voiced concern recently that Russia will issue a unilateral statement when New START is signed that ties its compliance with the treaty to the development of U.S. missile defense programs and that Russia could therefore hold our missile defense plans “ hostage . ”
But this argument is a smokescreen .
Unilateral statements have no affect on the terms of the treaty .
What ’s more , all treaties allow signatories to withdraw when they see fit , just as President Bush withdrew from the ABM Treaty .
A unilateral signing statement issued by Russia changes nothing about New START or the administration ’s declared plans for a phased , adaptive missile defense system .
Those making this argument are simply looking for an excuse to oppose New START .
The treaty in no way hinders our ability to protect and defend ourselves or our allies .
New START preserves an overwhelming deterrent to protect the United States and our allies .
Secretary Gates explained that , “ it is clear that we can accomplish these goals with fewer nuclear weapons .
The reductions in this treaty will not affect the strength of our nuclear triad . ”
Admiral Mullen concurred , saying that , “ this treaty enhances our ability to do that which we have been charged to do : protect and defend the citizens of the United States . ”
The U.S. nuclear arsenal is being modernized and well maintained , leaving no doubt that it is the most advanced and reliable in the world .
There are no limits on prompt global strike or other conventional systems .
Anti-arms - control ideologues ’ predictions that the treaty would constrain the development of prompt global strike — the conversion of ICBMs from nuclear to conventional missiles — or other conventional systems were proven wrong .
New START has no restrictions on conventional systems , which protects , as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen stated , “ our ability to develop a conventional global strike capability should that be required . ”
Some conservative arms - control opponents are now trying to move the goal posts even further by arguing that the treaty by definition restricts conventional systems by limiting the number of launchers .
But this argument would have led them to oppose Reagan ’s initial START treaty .
The United States will have access to Russian missile test data .
Direct exchanges of data on missile tests , or telemetry , with the Russians are no longer of great significance to the United States due to technological advances that allow for access to the missile test data independently .
And Russian negotiators strongly opposed further data exchanges because they would receive no information in return since the United States no longer conducts missile tests .
Yet some conservatives voiced concerns about the loss of the data exchange nonetheless .
The Obama administration therefore pushed hard and succeeded in keeping exchanges of telemetry data in New START over strong Russian objections .
The consequences of rejection
Blocking New START in the ratification process would not simply result in a continuation of the nuclear status quo .
The original START treaty expired on December 5 , 2009 and Russia and the United States reached an informal interim agreement to comply with the “ spirit ” of the START treaty , enabling much of the verification and monitoring measures to continue despite not being legally binding .
Yet if START were to fail in ratification , this existing nuclear status quo would evaporate , resulting in potentially disastrous consequences that could push the world past a nuclear tipping point .
Nuclear stability between the United States and Russia would shatter if START fails in ratification .
Conservative arms - control opponents ’ worst fears would come true if the Senate fails to ratify New START .
It would eliminate the framework that has created nuclear stability for nearly two decades since the end of the Cold War .
Senator Kyl , perhaps the most outspoken opponent , has even warned of what would occur in the absence of a treaty : “ For the first time in 15 years , an extensive set of verification , notification , elimination and other confidence building measures will expire .
The U.S. will lose a significant source of information that has allowed it to have confidence in its ability to understand Russian strategic nuclear forces . ”
Senator Kyl is right , and the implication is clear : failure to ratify the New START would have dangerous consequences for U.S. security .
Failure to ratify New START will jeopardize the concrete security gains from the U.S. - Russia reset .
Rejection would send the message to Moscow that the United States is not a reliable partner , empowering the “ hawks ” in the Russian political and military establishments who look for any opportunity to make the argument that the Obama administration ’s engagement policy is a cover - up for the U.S. strategic intention of weakening Russia .
Such a move would obliterate any sense of trust between the two countries , closing off channels of communication and making impossible dialogue on issues critical to U.S. national security .
The most immediate concern is the U.S. mission in Afghanistan : rejection could lead Russia to cease its facilitation of the massive logistical operations needed to supply our forces there .
About 30 percent of nonlethal material to support our troops in Afghanistan currently goes through or over Russian territory .
The climate of antagonism that would result from rejection would put this at risk .
The nonproliferation regime could collapse .
Should New START ratification fail , it could push the world past a nuclear tipping point .
It would undermine the NPT ’s foundational bargain , possibly leading to an overall weakening of the nonproliferation regime .
Efforts to clamp down on loose nuclear materials that could be acquired by terrorists would be severely undermined , as would efforts to stop states from acquiring nuclear weapons .
Efforts to confront Iran and North Korea ’s nuclear programs would also lose steam , since the failure to cut the U.S. nuclear arsenal would be seen as hypocritical abroad , leading to an erosion of international will .

By Peter Boone and Simon Johnson
As a serious financial reform debate heats up in the Senate , defenders of the new banking status quo in the United States today – more highly concentrated than before 2008 , with six megabanks implicitly deemed “ too big to fail ” – often lead with the argument , “ Canada has only five big banks and there was no crisis . ”
The implication is clear :
We should embrace concentrated megabanks and even go further down the route ; if the Canadians can do it safely , so can we .
It is true that during 2008 four of all Canada ’s major banks managed to earn a profit , all five were profitable in 2009 , and none required an explicit taxpayer bailout .
In fact , there were no bank collapses in Canada even during the Great Depression , and in recent years there have only been two small bank failures in the entire country .
Advocates for a Canadian - type banking system argue this success is the outcome of industry structure and strong regulation .
The CEOs of Canada ’s five banks work literally within a few hundred meters of each other in downtown Toronto .
This makes it easy to monitor banks .
They also have smart - sounding requirements imposed by the government : if you take out a loan over 80 % of a home ’s value , then you must take out mortgage insurance .
The banks were required to keep at least 7 % tier one capital , and they had a leverage restriction so that total assets relative to equity ( and capital ) was limited .
But is it really true that such constraints necessarily make banks safer , even in Canada ?
Despite supposedly tougher regulation and similar leverage limits on paper , Canadian banks were actually significantly more leveraged – and therefore more risky – than well - run American commercial banks .
For example JP Morgan was 13 times leveraged at the end of 2008 , and Wells Fargo was 11 times leveraged .
Canada ’s five largest banks averaged 19 times leveraged , with the largest bank , Royal Bank of Canada , 23 times leveraged .
It is a similar story for tier one capital ( with a higher number being safer ) : JP Morgan had 10.9 % percent at end 2008 while Royal Bank of Canada had just 9 % percent .
JP Morgan and other US banks also typically had more tangible common equity – another measure of the buffer against losses – than did Canadian Banks .
If Canadian banks were more leveraged and less capitalized , did something else make their assets safer ?
The answer is yes – guarantees provided by the government of Canada .
Today over half of Canadian mortgages are effectively guaranteed by the government , with banks paying a low price to insure the mortgages .
Virtually all mortgages where the loan to value ratio is greater than 80 % are guaranteed indirectly or directly by the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation ( i.e. , the government takes the risk of the riskiest assets – nice deal if you can get it ) .
The system works well for banks ; they originate mortgages , then pass on the risk to government agencies .
The US , of course , had Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , but lending standards slipped and those agencies could not resist a plunge into assets more risky than prime mortgages .
Let ’s see how long Canada resists that temptation .
The other systemic strength of the Canadian system is camaraderie between the regulators , the Bank of Canada , and the individual banks .
This oligopoly means banks can make profits in rough times – they can charge higher prices to customers and can raise funds more cheaply , in part due to the knowledge that no politician would dare bankrupt them .
During the height of the crisis in February 2009 , the CEO of Toronto Dominion Bank brazenly pitched investors : “ Maybe not explicitly , but what are the chances that TD Bank is not going to be bailed out if it did something stupid ? ”
In other words : do n’t bother looking at how dumb or smart we are , the Canadian government is there to make sure creditors never lose a cent .
With such ready access to taxpayer bailouts , Canadian banks need little capital , they naturally make large profit margins , and they can raise money even if they act badly .
Proposing a Canadian - type model to create stability in the U.S. is , to be blunt , nonsense .
We would need to merge our banks into even fewer banking giants , and then re-inflate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to guarantee some of the riskiest parts of the bank ’s portfolios .
With our handful of new “ hyper megabanks ” , we ’d have to count on our political system to prevent our banks from going wild ; Canada may be able to do this ( in our view , the jury is still out ) , but what are the odds this would work in Washington ?
This would require an enormous leap of faith in our regulatory system immediately after it managed to fail repeatedly and spectacularly over thirty years ( see 13 Bankers , out next week , for the awful details ) .
Who can be confident our powerful corporate lobbies , hired politicians , and captured regulators can become so Canadian so soon ?
The stakes would be even greater with these mega banks .
When such large banks collapse they can take down the finances of entire nations .
We do n’t need to look far to see how “ Canadian - type systems ” eventually fail .
Britain ’s largest bank , the Royal Bank of Scotland , grew to control assets equal to around 1.7 times British GDP before it spectacularly fell apart and required near complete nationalization in 2008 - 09 .
In Ireland the three largest banks ’ assets combined reached roughly 2.5 times GDP before they collapsed .
Today all the major Canadian banks have ambitious international expansion plans – let ’s see how long their historically safe system survives the new hubris of its managers .
There ’s no doubt that during the coming months many people will advocate some form of a Canadian banking system in America .
Our largest banks and their lobbyists on Capitol Hill will love the idea .
For some desperate politicians it may become a miracle drug : a new “ safer ” system that will lend to homeowners and provide financing to Washington , while permitting politicians and regulators to avoid tough steps .
Let ’s hope this elixir does n’t gain traction ; smaller banks with a lot more capital – and able to fail when they act stupid – are what U.S. citizens and taxpayers really need .

The police in Santa Clara County , California have begun an investigation into the lost iPhone Gizmodo obtained , Greg Sandoval at CNET reports .
Investigators are trying to figure out if there are grounds for a criminal charge .
These are the laws that might have been broken , Greg says :
Under a California law dating back to 1872 , any person who finds lost property and knows who the owner is likely to be but " appropriates such property to his own use " is guilty of theft .
If the value of the property exceeds $ 400 , more serious charges of grand theft can be filed .
In addition , a second state law says that any person who knowingly receives property that has been obtained illegally can be imprisoned for up to one year .

After nearly five years of waiting , spectators have finally been given a taste of the Rocket Racing League .
At an airshow in Tulsa , Oklahoma , two of the racers took to the skies with long flames and loud bursts of rocket power .
The pilots demonstrated the impressive capabilities of a lightweight composite airplane paired with a liquid - oxygen rocket motor .
Founded by X - Prize guru Peter Diamandis in 2005 , the Rocket Racing League was initially planning on holding a series of races back in 2008 .
After hitting some of the same financial turbulence felt around the world , Diamandis is hoping to get back to a schedule for races some time next year .
A single rocket racer flew in front of the aviation crazed crowd at Oshkosh , Wisconsin , in 2008 with its short bursts of rocket power allowing the pilot to climb and maneuver unlike a traditional airplane .
As one of the test pilots explains in the video after the jump , it ’s full throttle or nothing at all , giving pilots a boost of power that would make Michael Knight envious .
In addition to the first flight of two rocket racers together , showing off the impressive power - to - weight ratio when you have a real rocket booster , the event in Tulsa also included demonstration of how the race will look to spectators on the ground .
Using a twin -engine Cessna equipped with the same technology that will be used by the racers , pilots flew through an example of a computer - generated course and spectators were able to “ see ” the course on giant television screens on the ground ( or at home ) .
Though some have called it NASCAR in the sky , the rocket racers will actually race against the clock .
The computer - generated course will be shown on a heads - up display allowing the pilot to see the course from the cockpit , a view that is shown in the video as a series of boxes creating a track to follow .
The concept is similar to the highway in the sky that has been developed as a navigation aid to normal , non-rocket - flying pilots .
It ’s a lot like a videogame where a pilot must fly through a course on a screen , but in this case with liquid oxygen rocket that can be heard for miles .
The videogame connection will be taken even a step further according to race organizers .
Viewers at home will be able to fly a computer based rocket racer head - to - head with the real - life pilots , allowing spectators to virtually compete in the Rocket Racing League from the comfort of their couch .
The real rocket racers are derived from an airplane developed by kit- plane manufacturer Velocity Aircraft .
The four - place airplane features a canard design derived from a plane originally designed and built by legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan .
In the future , race organizers expect purpose - built rocket racers to be built as the sport develops .

Seat , not wanting to be left out of the electric car party that was the 2010 Geneva Motorshow , has announced that they will put the Seat IBE into full production .
The 2+2 sports hatchback looks set to compete with the Golf GTi , Alfa Romeo Giulietta and other hot hatches currently enjoying huge popularity across Europe due to their remarkable fuel economy combined with unflinching driving performance .
Seat has enjoyed success in both the world of rallying and touring cars over the past 15 years or so and these racing genes are clearly present in the IBE .
The 100 % electric drive vehicle features an 18KwH lithium - ion battery system and an electric drive system producing 75Kw ( 100 hp ) and a torque rating of 200 Nm , we think that Seat is going to have to boost both the battery capacity and Kw power of the motor in order to be competitive as a 0 - 60 time of 10 seconds just is n’t going to cut it for most of the IBE ’s potential clients .
They get top marks for styling though , this is almost exactly what we hoped cars of the future would look like when we were kids , so kudos to the design team .

The United States entered into the challenge of space exploration under President Eisenhower 's first term , however , it was the Soviet Union who excelled in those early years .
Under the bold vision of Presidents Kennedy , Johnson , and Nixon , and with the overwhelming approval of the American people , we rapidly closed the gap in the final third of the 20th century , and became the world leader in space exploration .
America 's space accomplishments earned the respect and admiration of the world .
Science probes were unlocking the secrets of the cosmos ; space technology was providing instantaneous worldwide communication ; orbital sentinels were helping man understand the vagaries of nature .
Above all else , the people around the world were inspired by the human exploration of space and the expanding of man 's frontier .
It suggested that what had been thought to be impossible was now within reach .
Students were inspired to prepare themselves to be a part of this new age .
No government programme in modern history has been so effective in motivating the young to do " what has never been done before " .
World leadership in space was not achieved easily .
In the first half - century of the space age , our country made a significant financial investment , thousands of Americans dedicated themselves to the effort , and some gave their lives to achieve the dream of a nation .
In the latter part of the first half century of the space age , Americans and their international partners focused primarily on exploiting the near frontiers of space with the space shuttle and the International Space Station .
As a result of the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003 , it was concluded that our space policy required a new strategic vision .
Extensive studies and analysis led to this new mandate : meet our existing commitments , return to our exploration roots , return to the moon , and prepare to venture further outward to the asteroids and to Mars .
The programme was named " Constellation " .
In the ensuing years , this plan was endorsed by two presidents of different parties and approved by both Democratic and Republican Congresses .
The Columbia Accident Board had given Nasa a number of recommendations fundamental to the Constellation architecture which were duly incorporated .
The Ares rocket family was patterned after the Von Braun Modular concept so essential to the success of the Saturn 1B and the Saturn 5 .
A number of components in the Ares 1 rocket would become the foundation of the very large heavy lift Ares V , thus reducing the total development costs substantially .
After the Ares 1 becomes operational , the only major new components necessary for the Ares V would be the larger propellant tanks to support the heavy lift requirements .
The design and the production of the flight components and infrastructure to implement this vision was well underway .
Detailed planning of all the major sectors of the programme had begun .
Enthusiasm within Nasa and throughout the country was very high .
When President Obama recently released his budget for Nasa , he proposed a slight increase in total funding , substantial research and technology development , an extension of the International Space Station operation until 2020 , long range planning for a new but undefined heavy lift rocket and significant funding for the development of commercial access to low earth orbit .
Although some of these proposals have merit , the accompanying decision to cancel the Constellation programme , its Ares 1 and Ares V rockets , and the Orion spacecraft , is devastating .
America 's only path to low Earth orbit and the International Space Station will now be subject to an agreement with Russia to purchase space on their Soyuz ( at a price of over $ 50 m per seat with significant increases expected in the near future ) until we have the capacity to provide transportation for ourselves .
The availability of a commercial transport to orbit as envisioned in the president 's proposal cannot be predicted with any certainty , but is likely to take substantially longer and be more expensive than we would hope .
It appears that we will have wasted our current $ 10 bn - plus investment in Constellation and , equally importantly , we will have lost the many years required to recreate the equivalent of what we will have discarded .
For the United States , the leading space faring nation for nearly half a century , to be without carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future , destines our nation to become one of second or even third rate stature .
While the president 's plan envisages humans travelling away from Earth and perhaps toward Mars at some time in the future , the lack of developed rockets and spacecraft will assure that ability will not be available for many years .
Without the skill and experience that actual spacecraft operation provides , the US is far too likely to be on a long downhill slide to mediocrity .
America must decide if it wishes to remain a leader in space .
If it does , we should institute a programme which will give us the very best chance of achieving that goal .

Apparently , the owner went on a fishing trip and left the catch in the plane .
A bear smelled the food and tore the plane apart to get to it .
I suppose a Piper is easier to open than a tin can …
Take a look at the horizontal stabilizer .
Wow .
So , the story goes that the Alaskan pilot had 2 new tires , three cases of speed tape and several rolls of cellophane delivered to the site and promptly repaired his plane so that he could fly it home .
If you look closely , you can just about see that he wrote the registration on the side with a ball - point pen .
Would you get in ?

This is the first of three articles on how food made from scratch using local ingredients is served to the students and staff at Washington Jesuit Academy , a free - tuition private school for at - risk kids .
Chef Duane Drake lines a dozen pie shells on sheet pans and begins filling them for breakfast quiche .
First , he scatters freshly torn spinach leaves at the bottom of the shells .
Then he begins cutting blocks of Muenster cheese into cubes .
He works quickly .
“ This morning , I ’m speedballing , ” he explains .
Two of his assistants have been out sick .
He ’s behind with the prep work .
In the walk - in refrigerator , Drake locates a large plastic tub filled with an egg , milk and pesto mixture he made the night before .
He begins pouring it into the pie shells and checks the clock :
He has only a few minutes to get the quiches into the kitchen ’s convection oven and finish baking them before students arrive at 7:30 for breakfast at Washington Jesuit Academy .
Wait a second .
Can that be right ?
Handmade quiche for school breakfast ?
Yes , you heard correctly .
At this all - boys middle school in Northeast Washington , D.C. , all of the meals are made from scratch every day .
Not only are the ingredients fresh , most of them are locally grown as well .
The eggs and milk , for instance , are from Trickling Springs Creamery in Chambersburg , Pennsylvania .
The basil and other micro-greens on the menu hail from southern New Jersey .
The Muenster cheese is made by Amish Delight in Louisville , Ohio .
When the quiche goes into the oven , Drake will start on lunch : a pasta sauce made with roasted local chicken , hot house plum tomatoes from farms in Virginia ’s Shenandoah Valley , eggplant and other vegetables from a produce auction in Dayton , Virginia .
It ’s all the brainchild of D.C. Central Kitchen , a social service agency perhaps best known for providing daily meals to thousands of the District of Columbia ’s homeless and needy , but now flexing its know - how and local food connections through its own for - profit catering company , Fresh Start , which runs the kitchen at Washington Jesuit Academy .
Drake and his crew also are responsible for feeding children and staff at a nearby child - care center , as well as some 18 students in a post - high school training program across town and other catering jobs that come in over the transom .
A fleet of D.C. Central Kitchen trucks keeps the food moving .
Washington Jesuit Academy is a “ tuition - free middle school offering quality education to disadvantaged boys in the 6th , 7th & 8th grades , ” according to its website .
The students , Drake ’s clients , are 71 “ at risk ” boys who spend 12 hours each day in the school ’s intensive educational program and eat breakfast , lunch and dinner at school .
They love the quiche , served on the food line only minutes after it comes out of the oven , warm and fragrant .
“ It ’s very cheesy , ” comments one smiling 12 - year - old between forkfulls .
After I wrote a series of articles about the woeful state of cafeteria food at my daughter ’s elementary school here in the District–most of it highly processed meal components cooked in distant factories and shipped frozen to D.C. schools –I received a number of tips about schools that were taking a different approach , trying to serve students meals more resembling real food and not junk .
I decided to see for myself how a stronger commitment to school food –from individual kitchen workers , food companies and school administrators –could result in better food on children ’s plates , and how much that might cost .
New Chief Assigns Top Cops Homework

On his first day in town , New Haven ’s new drug gang - fighting police chief asked his command staff to hand in two ideas apiece for improving the department .
Frank Limon issued the homework assignment at a private meeting in the mayor ’s conference room .
Then he stepped into the City Hall atrium for a press conference , where Mayor John DeStefano announced that he ’d named the 55 - year - old career cop the city ’s next police chief .
Limon begins work April 5 .
His term will run through Feb. 1 , 2014 .
Limon succeeds James Lewis , who left New Haven a week and a half ago following a 20 - month stint reorganizing the police department .
Limon was chosen from 50 applicants , all males , according to someone familiar with today ’s scheduled announcement .
He is Latino , as is his wife , who hails from Ecuador .
( The New Haven - based Ecuadorian consul attended the announcement Tuesday ) .
In the end Limon prevailed over two other finalists , one a former New York City precinct captain .
He comes to New Haven from Illinois .
He spent 30 years on the Chicago police force , where he supervised 600 people in the Organized Crime Department ( OCD ) before retiring in 2008 .
For the past year he has served as police chief in River Forest , Illinois , a western suburb of Chicago .
He shook up that department , cutting staff and crime at the same time .
Limon spent five hours cruising all around New Haven Monday — in part because he was staying at the Omni , which had been evacuated because of a bomb scare .
He described the city as warm and welcoming .
He described meeting a friendly couple who invited him and his wife for dinner ; because his appointment had n’t yet been announced , Limon could n’t tell his new friends why exactly he was in town .
Mayor John DeStefano said Tuesday that he chose Limon in part because of his skills in working with the community and his background fighting drug gangs .
The department “ needs to be more aggressive on narcotics , ” DeStefano said .
“ Virtually all gun violence is related to narcotics . ”
District managers and unit heads met with Limon in the private session before the press conference .
He asked them to submit , in sealed envelopes , their two best ideas for changing the department , along with their resumes .
He plans to meet one - on - one with each of them .
“ I want ideas from the rank and file and department leaders that are there now , ” he said .
“ I ’m not going to come in with a wand and fix everything . ”
Limon visited New Haven and considered the chief ’s job two years ago , the last time it was open .
He decided against pursuing the job further , he said , because his wife Gisella was still working .
She has now retired ; she was an arson detective with the Chicago police force .
In his remarks to the press Tuesday , he spoke of his support for community policing .
He also spoke of combating drugs through a strategy that combines law enforcement and social services .
Click on the play arrow at the top of the story to watch some of those remarks .
A Hit In River Forest
As OCD head , Limon worked closely with state and federal cops , an important part of a New Haven chief ’s role .
He ’s a graduate of Xavier University and the Illinois Institute of Technology .
For the past year , he has produced “ amazing ” results in turning around the once - troubled department in the 12,000 - population town of River Forest , according to Stephen Hoke , who chairs the Police Committee of the Board of Trustees there .
Crime went down 28 percent while the chief cut staff 17 percent over the past 11 months , Hoke said .
“ He ’s a living example that more for less is possible , ” Hoke said .
Limon ’s emphasis was on placing more cops on the street ; cuts were focused elsewhere .
For instance , he cut the number of deputy chiefs from two to one .
In New Haven , one open question is whether the new chief will continue to have four assistant chiefs .
( Read about that here . )
You can read about the River Forest department ’s problems and how Limon produced a “ dramatic turnaround ” beginning on page 5 of this report .
And read about the problems he inherited when he took the job in this report .
Hoke also credited Limon with building bridges to chiefs in River Forest ’s neighboring communities .
“ His theory is crime does n’t respect borders , ” Hoke said .
Limon created a working group of regional chiefs that produced some major busts in the past three to four months , according to Hoke , including breaking up a 54 - member burglary ring .
The local Wednesday Journal newspaper shared Hoke ’s assessment .
It named Limon “ Villager of the Year ” for “ transforming ” the department .
Read about that here .

however will he be just another puppet to johnny boy or will he be able to lead this department as a chief should , having TOTAL CONTROL and bring back morale , and alleviate all the turmoil within ???
we shall see

Hmm , this fellow reportedly is capable of conducted major drug / conspiracy investigations without the help of FBI or DEA .
Perhaps that will save a lot of legs from gunshot wounds in New Haven in the coming years .
Seems to be the gun crime of choice these days : Bullet Leg
So as not to end a New Haven blog comment without a dose of that cranky New Haven skepticism , have to ask , how did he escape the crisis at Chicago PD where he served as deputy commissioner during a scandal that brought down the commissioner ?
Are we going to become a episode of The Wire ?

A Chicago cop is exactly what this town needs .
I have the same high hopes that I had when Lewis came to town .
Best of luck , Chief Limon .

Not sure why we pick on QUADS when the DRIVERS are also out of control .
Can there be a special crackdown on both ?
In the summer , the cops will be needed to deal with shootings so now is the time to crack down on the insane , speeding drivers who are singlehandedly ruining the quality of life in this city and making it an impossible place to live …
I ’m fed up and about ready to leave !

We need to bring back walking beats to New Haven , especially in the club district on Crown St and on Park Street south of Chapel .
Dwight Street between Whalley and Frontage is sorely in need of a walking beat - officers who stop and actually interact with residents - instead of barreling past on their cell phones .
Also , bring motorcycle cops to James Street - specifically to Criscoulo Park - ticket the litterers and pot smokers .
There ’s always someone having sex in their car at the park , drinking , and dealing drugs at the dead - end .
Craps games at night contribute to local violence .
Sobriety checkpoints at night downtown would also help curb accidents and irresponsibe driving .
Bicycle cops and mounted cops ( horses ! ) in the beach communities / parks would increase visibility , calm the nerves of people used to seeing cruisers as an enemy , and bring peace back to the parks .
East Rock Park would benefit from a mounted police presence on the trails , where vehicular traffic is impossible .
There are a number of muggings there in summer .
Glad to see the new chief is bilingual - it should help assuage fear in the spanish - speaking community that an out - of - touch chief is in town !
posted by : citysavior on March 9 , 2010 6:47 pm welcome to New Haven Chief Limon .
Be careful some of the command staff that your are inheriting may not be truthful .
some have agendas to get their command staff members on to your staff .
Others are wolfs in sheep clothing .
as you have four years sit back the movers and shakers will be known to you .
Keep a eye on your 40 hour workers and your minute men and women .
You have seen this in Chicago .
best of luck and god bless you and your family .

Two weeks back Chief Lewis warned that cuts would come to the sworn services .
Now we have the guy who can do more with less .
Johnny Boy ’s tax hike will never fly .
He knows the alders will not approve it .
He can then blame them for the layoffs of cops and firefighters that are coming .

Finally , our authorities referred and recognised to those who are destroying the quality of life with crazy driving , noise pollution and groups on bicycles all over the city in summer time as a drug gangs .
They are NOT enjoying the good weather with so much aggravation to the peace .
They are responsible of intimidation to the rest of the community .
A Chief with impressive city life experience and drugs .
Good start !
Good luck .

The vast majority of crimes are property crimes while violent crimes , which are much less frequent , is the greatest contributor to the sense of a lack of safety .
Beyond this , it can be observed that there are two types of crime - those committed as a direct result of specific circumstances and those committed as a result of cultural and social degradation that stem form circumstances that happened over a relatively long period of time .
The first kind has been around since the first civilizations were being formed and will likely be around for the foreseeable future .
An example is if a person loses their job and cannot feed their children , so they are reduced to stealing , this would be a case of a main stream citizen turning to crime as a direct result and usually a last resort .
This can be effectively addressed by police , either through prevention by having community - based walking beats and patrols and by having investigative work of a crime to catch the perpetrator and bring them to ( when possible ) rehabilitative justice .
Conversely , police are extremely ineffective at addressing the second type of crime .
If that same person loses a job and steals bread to feed their family and ends up having to repay their debt with interest to the property owner and society through jail time ( or fine , community service , etc ) and that person ’s child grows up without that person there , without access to jobs ( because along with the parent ’s job , the work was exported to Mexico , China or India ) , the lower standard of living that is common in single parent households , and because this child has a child at a young age , then the perfect storm for an existence defined by social inadequacies .
This is amplified when it happens to entire communities and neighborhoods , which is precisely what happened in this country and in this city in communities across the nation when manufacturing jobs were exported to places with cheaper labor and less regulation / taxation .
Police can address the person committing the crime , but they cannot address the underlying problem .
Social programs also cannot address these problems , only an atmosphere of purpose and community through complete neighborhoods with jobs for all people , adequate housing , recreational / public space , services and access to daily needs can address the underlying problems that plague much of our city .
After several generations of social and cultural degradation we see the types of violence that can result from drugs becoming an underground currency and women becoming an object to fight over .
Even drugs are not a central problem , the issues in crime ridden neighborhoods go back much further than the 1980s cocaine boom , they go back to the decentralization and destruction of urban centers through sustained decay and suburbanization of the countries woodland , farmland and coastal areas that accelerated the de-localizing of this country ’s intricate networks of commerce , governance and coherently organized citizen involvement in “ places ” .
Drugs are a complicated issue because I think it is sensible to decriminalize them but not without first supplying the alternative of meaningful employment that produces goods and services that others rely on .

Did I miss something , or did the Mayor state that he hired him because of his “ drug - gang ” experince .
Is the Mayor now admitting that there ARE gangs in New Haven ??
He ’s been dispelling that “ myth ” for a few years now …
Wow how the story changes .

For years we were told crime was down in New Haven or there was no crime !?
because New Haven failed to report the crime .
This city is a mess , Chief , Good Luck and God Bless .
Do n’t be fooled or manipulated by anyone .
You need to clean this place up , crimes are up in every neighborhood there is no respect for our police and to many special interest groups that run this city .
Come to the “ annex ” section of New Haven , look what it has become …
J.D should remember what it was and what it is now .
He grew up in the area .

After I checked chief ’s Limon “ page 5 ” report and follow the link Pedro posted , I will add three more words to describe him .
Philosophy , vision and goals .
seems like he knows and follows his instincts to perform his job base on reality .
very good thing .

I hope you continue the good work of Chief Lewis in enforcing the motor vehicle laws .
When cars can speed through red lights , chronically turn right on red and ignore pedestrians in crosswalks , the city looks and fells lawless .
( Maybe some of the “ No turn on red ” signs should be gotten rid of ? )
I bless Chief Lewis every time I can cross the street now .
Good luck !

a good mayor should address both .
but you do n’t believe access to a solid education would decrease gang activity ?
Chief Limon , welcome & best of luck to you .
posted by : Tomas Reyes Jr. on March 10 , 2010 11:16 am Congratulations and welcome to the new Chief , Frank Limon .
Congratulations to Mayor DeStefano
for spending the time and energy to find an
experienced and obviously courageous individual
who , I believe , will not only energize the Department but will engage the community at a
variety of levels .
Lets all say yes to truly
working together for a better and safer community and prove the naysayers wrong !
posted by : gangs in the hill on March 10 , 2010 12:43 pm @juli : of course a good mayor should address both .
but what is our mayor really addressing ?
he is in denial about the gangs and he is focused on student attendance and test scores disguising this focus as “ reform . ” its a case of which came first the chicken or the egg .
the gangs have to be dealt with , as its a quality of life issue impacting the neighborhoods where our kids live , work and play .
im not sold that a “ solid education ” will decrease gang activity .
of course excellent schools are important , but it has to be an aggressive two - pronged approach .
i will believe it when i see it .
and yes , welcome to the new chief .
best wishes for a peaceful and productive term .

I just hope that this chief got the guts to do the job .
We were on a good path when Lewis and his boys left in which the Mayor should have kept them .
We need accountability to the tax - payers in New Haven that ’s paying these officers salary .
It is so easy to go a - stray when you do n’t have good leadership in place .
Just because a person get promoted do n’t mean they are qualified to do the job and has good leadership skills .
Just look at past practice .
The past help you to define the present .
The past at New Haven Police was “ HOPLESS ” .

Perhaps it can be best summed up by a quote from Chicago ’s own Mayor Richard Daley ( Sr. ) : “ The police are not here to create disorder .
They are here to PRESERVE disorder ! ”

I heard there ’s a guy in New Haven that smokes pot .
I sure hope they catch him …
Letters
If you could cram your favorite hobby horses into the Encyclopedia of the Future , would n't you be tempted ?
Well , refreshingly , many readers would n't - so let 's commend their integrity .
Wikipedia 's reputation gets another mauling in response to this story , so if you 're a member of what one reader calls the Emergent People - perhaps like Tomorrow 's People , but without the transporter belts - do n't read on .
" Good article .
Please do not let up on these people for a second , " writes Kevin Browne .
" If the Emergent People wish to present themselves as authorities without the credentials to back up the claim , they already begin at a disadvantage .
If they then lack the discipline and knowledge to write and present themselves correctly , should one have confidence in the knowledge they claim , or that they have the discipline to research it properly ? "
Citing the excitable young wiki - fiddler who claimed , ' It should come as no suprise a journalist and teacher ganged up on Wikipedia .
Both have much to loose .
Their claim ?
Authority . '
Kevin replies -
" Indeed .
Authority .
And training .
And experience .
And having received guidance from a predecessor who had those same advantages .
And the ability to fucking spell ! "
" Let 's assume the wiki - fiddlers are right and education is obsolete , which is what their argument amounts to .
They should demonstrate the courage of their convictions , quit their day jobs and impart their knowledge and wisdom to us , full - time , for nothing .
I might support them in such a course of action - not monetarily , of course , as I would hate to corrupt them - and I may even read what they have to say if they learn what a bloody apostrophe is for .
Some Bazaar
Reader Hari Balaramaran adds :
" I found the article very amusing and close to my experience .
Although originally interested in the idea of a ' bazaar ' of ideas , I found that there is a lot of submission by young , energetic , interested but unfortunately misinformed people ( their excess free time results in distortions in the ' bazaar ' equilibrium . )
The fact that they do n't know very much about their articles of interest seems to add to their energy and self - righteousness .
The idea is very democratic and egalitarian but if you want to spread egalitarianism , start a political party .
Do n't subvert an encyclopaedia .
Democracy may support egalitarianism but that has nothing to " truth " or " knowledge " ( yes , I know you 'll want to connect it all up for me but give it a rest )
It brings to mind a different project , Linux , which is " successful " rather than " emergent " on account of linus , who in addition to his kernel coding , probably does n't want to dealt with Emergent facts from uninformed heads . "
" Personally I 'm happy to accept their information on Klingons as being authoritative , " writes Andy Toone .
" However , the people who get overexcited about the social effects of Wiki / Blogs / Open Source seem to be far less reliable when it comes to the economics and practicalities of providing time , effort and information to such projects . "
Ouch .
Many readers pointed to this Slashdot discussion , where mistakes inserted into the online encyclopedia were n't picked up .
The project 's supporters said that this is because the entries were under obscure topics .
Er , just the sort of things that you might need an encyclopedia to answer .
Oh , dear .
But there 's more .
Reader Pascal Monnett gets close to the truth behind the evangelism .
" Wikipedia is a dreamer 's idea of knowledge , " he writes .
" The fact that everyone can input whatever they want may a great thing for equality , but any librarian will tell you its a lousy thing for classification and evaluation . "
" Wikipedia has nothing over a ' traditional ' library , especially when the ' Old World ' institution puts its catalog on line .
In the end , Wikipedia will not allow to search faster or find more , unless you 're looking for Star Trek trivia of course .
Having surfed on the ocean of ignorance that is the Web for the past ten years , I will prefer a library ( on - line or off ) whenever I want to find Knowledge ( the stuff written by scientists and men in possession of that Old World thing known as Wisdom ) . "
What 's ' meme ' in Klingon ?
" What did Wikipedia ever do to you to deserve this ? " asks Ikijtsch van Beijnum .
" I have found plenty of interesting stuff in there , and some of it even unrelated to Star Trek or computers . "
Well , so have we all , but it's when the fiddlers get to obscure or contentious subjects , that the trouble really starts .
Trust is built on how hugely contentious subjects are presented , and Wikipedia with its Klingon belief in " neutral point of view " - rather than context - is where it starts to fall down .
Other philosophical issues , like the idea that you can vote on the truth , might be more problematic .
A most bizarre claim comes from Aakash Mehendale , who at least admits that as a first port of call and as a free resource it is n't too bad .
He did n't accept our library comparison , because , he argues :
" You * pay * for access to those , making a comparison to Wikipedia , free to anyone with web access , not really valid ( online access to databases at sfpl.org is only available with a library card ; these are free to California residents [ who pay state taxes , I am assuming ] , but visitors require a $ 10 ' non- refundable deposit ' and a temporary San Francisco address ) "
But you can also look at it from another direction .
Libraries are an incredibly effective way of amortizing the cost of getting expensive , good - quality information out to people .
And almost everyone in the developed world already pays for some kind of library .
Now remember that the database owners do n't hoard this information because they 're evil or mean , but because it's how they make money , and they have to eat .
They do n't care how they get it , and they'd be happy to receive more from the libraries , so long as Wikipedians were n't copying it out .
So this could be a worthwhile project : only it 's a social , rather than technical challange .
It 's hard to imagine anyone other than a Wikipedian arguing the wider availability of high quality information collections - at which point , you begin to realize it 's a religious issue .
Which brings us full circle , back to those hobby horses .
Rather bizarrely , Aakash defends the odd weighting given to many entries by arguing ,
" Maybe ' the entry on " memes " is almost as long as the entry for Immanuel Kant ' [ or the KLF - ed ] because there already exists a wealth of resources on Kant , " he says , " so the appropriate entry is a guide to and links to those ; whereas you can cover memes pretty much completely in a single article .
Of approximately the same length as the hyperlink - packed entry on Kant . "
He adds , " In the extreme case where there already exists an online resource that says everything about topic T , why do any more than link to that resource ?
This is hypertext , not a paper encyclopaedia : we do n't have to copy out all the work that 's already been done . "
So there you go .
Your reporter is tempted to start a supermarket where if something is n't available , the punters are simply redirected to another store where it is .
We 'll call this Emergent - Mart .
How well do you suppose it will do , dear readers ?
Wikipedia has a dilemma here .
I 'm sure many readers have been approached by people in the street claiming to have a big book that tells all the answers - people in various states of hygiene , insisting that their book is more trusted than others .
But historically , the ones we end up trusting more than others usually do n't make psychobabble their main selling point .
Other factors are usually decisive - like whether it 's authoritative , or just plain right or wrong .
So Wikipedia can go two ways : it can grown into becoming a reasonable encyclopedia , or it can hide behind the psychobabble , and claim special pleading - like religious projects do .
Expect a change in how the project is marketed fairly shortly . ®
