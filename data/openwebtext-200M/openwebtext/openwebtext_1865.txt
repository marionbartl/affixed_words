Karl Rove and other White House employees were cautioned in employee manuals , memos and briefings to carefully save any e-mails that might discuss official matters even if those messages came from private e-mail accounts , the White House disclosed Friday .
Despite these cautions , e-mails from Rove and others discussing official business may have been deleted and are now missing .
White House officials spent much of Friday reiterating that the missing e-mails were the result of an innocent mistake .
About 50 aides in the executive office of the Bush administration have used e-mail accounts provided by the Republican National Committee to keep campaign - related communication separate from their official White House business .
However , some of those RNC accounts were used to discuss official matters , including the firing of eight federal prosecutors , which has triggered investigations on Capitol Hill .
Democrats contend that politics was improperly inserted into Justice Department decision - making about which attorneys should leave .

Though official White House e-mail is automatically preserved in accord with the Presidential Records Act , e-mail that was used by the employees with RNC accounts was not always saved .
White House officials this week said the lost e-mails resulted from a failure to clearly communicate Presidential Records
Act rules to staffers and to see that the rules were followed .
“ That is a mistake the White House is aggressively working to fix , ” White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said earlier in the week .
The White House has recently provided guidance to each of the 22 staffers who currently have RNC e-mail accounts .
Each person receiving such an account is required to sign a statement acknowledging that he understands the rules .
White House employee manuals distributed in early 2001 made it clear that any e-mails containing discussion of official matters should be preserved .

Redacted copies of White House employee manuals were shown to reporters late Friday at the White House press office on condition that they not be removed from the premises .
The documents included a memorandum from then - White House General Counsel Alberto R. Gonzales , who is now attorney general , cautioning employees that “ any e-mail relating to official business ... qualifies as a presidential record . ”
The instructions dwell on the importance of separating political from official acts .
But they also explain that all e-mail sent “ to your official account is automatically archived as if it were a presidential record . ”
The manual adds : “ If you happen to receive an e-mail on a personal account which otherwise qualifies as a presidential record , it is your duty to insure that it is saved as such by printing it out and saving it or by forwarding it to your White House e-mail account , ” the manual said .
The manual was updated and expanded through the years , and the most recent iteration dwells on preserving official records .
Despite the instructions , many employees did not save their e-mails , creating the latest controversy to dog the Bush White House .

Democrats have suggested Rove and others may have deliberately deleted e-mails from his RNC account , which he used heavily .
Rove ’s lawyer , Robert D. Luskin , denied any attempt to evade record - keeping rules , telling the Associated Press on Friday that Rove ’s “ understanding starting very , very early in the administration was that those e-mails were being archived . ”
But Robert K. Kelner , a lawyer for the RNC , said in an interview with The Times that the RNC had a policy of automatically deleting e-mails through middle or late 2004 and that there was not an understanding that White House - generated documents would be preserved .
“ The RNC is not directed by law to administer the Presidential Records Act , ” Kelner said .
“ That ’s an authority given to the president .
The treatment of these e-mail accounts by the RNC has been based on the RNC ’s own internal document preservation policies . ”

Gonzales role in Cheney oversight dodge probed Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday June 27 , 2007 Print This Email This
The role of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in Vice President Dick Cheney 's efforts to escape scrutiny for his office 's dealings with classified information is being probed by a pair of House committees .
" An Executive Order signed by President Bush in 2003 directs the National Archives to oversee a uniform , government - wide system for protecting national security information .
For six months , the National Archives has sought unsuccessfully to receive clarification from the attorney general regarding the OVP 's contention that it is exempt from the order because it is not an entity within the executive branch of our government , " notes a press release sent to RAW STORY by the House Judiciary Committee and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform .
In the letter , Reps. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) , Chairman of the Oversight Committee , John Conyers ( D - MI ) , Chairman of the Judiciary Committee , and William Lacy Clay ( D - GA ) , who chairs the Oversight Committee 's Subcommittee on Information Policy , Census , and National Archives , complain that the Attorney General 's office has created confusion about the current state of the review of the Vice President 's actions .
" Due to conflicting statements from your department , the status of your review of this matter is unclear ... the Information Security Oversight Office has received no response to its inquiry .
In response to a FOIA request [ by the Federation of American Scientists ] , the department 's Office of Legal Counsel stated on June 4,2007 , that no documents exist relating to your department 's response to Mr. Leonard 's letter ... Last week , however , a spokesperson for the Department of Justice stated that this matter is under review in the department . "
Rep. Conyers ( D - MI ) warned in the statement that , " Once again , we appear to have an attorney general who is too close to the White House for his own - or the people 's - good . "
The letter transmits a set of questions to which the committees seek answers , requesting follow up by July 12 .

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have identified an important mechanism that regulates how many new cells are produced by each intestinal stem cell .
The study is published in the latest issue of the prestigious scientific journal , Cell .
" This might eventually help us develop new drugs for things like neurological disorders and anaemia , " says Professor Jonas Frisén .
In most organs of the body , old cells are continually being replaced by new .
If too many new cells are produced , however , it can lead to overgrowth and tumour formation .
Too few cells , on the other hand , can result in organ degeneration .
It is therefore crucial that exactly the right number of cells are produced .
As many serious disorders cause a reduction in the production of new cells , scientists are keen to develop drugs that stimulate the process , which in turn could help the body to cure itself .
It has long been known that the new cells are often formed by immature cells known as stem cells , but the mechanism regulating the number of new cells produced has remained something of a mystery .
However , in a new study to be published by Cell stem - cell researcher Jonas Frisén has succeeded in showing how the body 's own stem cells do just this .
Working alongside an American group of researchers , Professor Frisén and his team have identified a signal transduction process that regulates the degree of stem - cell division .
" Understanding how cell production is regulated increases our chances of producing drugs able to stimulate the endogenous production of new cells , " says Professor Frisén .
He hopes that the new findings can be used to develop drugs that stimulate , for example , the formation of new nerve cells to treat conditions such as stroke and Parkinson 's and skin cells to facilitate the healing of wounds .
Professor Frisén is best known for his research on cerebral stem cells ; the present study , however , has been carried out on stem cells in the intestine , one of the organs in the body with the highest rates of cell renewal .
" We also know that blood , brain and skin stem cells express the genes that we now know to be important in the intestine , " he says .
" This suggests that the cell production mechanism can be the same for these stem cells too . "
The next step for Professor Frisén and his group is therefore to study how blood and skin stem cells go about producing new cells .

IS Little Nell dead ? "
New Yorkers thronging the docks in the winter of 1841 called out to ships arriving from Europe , hoping for news from someone who had read the latest installment of Dickens 's " Old Curiosity Shop . "
She was , though Dickens said that killing her off had caused him " anguish unspeakable , " and both here and in England readers wept in the streets .
Daniel O'Connell , the famous Irish member of Parliament , was so upset he threw his copy of the novel from the window of a train .
To prepare her readers for just such a blow , J. K. Rowling , the most Dickensian of contemporary writers and the author of the Harry Potter books , announced the other day that in the seventh and final volume in the series , not yet scheduled for publication , two characters would die , and she hinted that one might even be Harry himself .
Not that Potter fans will necessarily accept something so unthinkable , any more than the true believers accepted the death of Elvis .
When Dumbledore , the beloved headmaster of Hogwarts , was murdered in Volume 6 of the series , " Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , " deniers immediately created a Web site called " Dumbledore Is Not Dead , " where they argued that he had merely contrived his own disappearance and would eventually be back .
For the second time in five weeks , information about a key upcoming Microsoft Corp. product has come to light because of a presentation placed on the company 's Web site by an employee in Denmark .
According to a PowerPoint presentation ( download PDF ) created by a technical staffer at Microsoft Denmark , the software vendor plans to invest in four major areas in the next client version of Windows after Vista .
Microsoft has already begun working on its next OS , and one executive indicated last month that the company hopes to ship the follow - on during 2009 -- although Microsoft later issued a statement saying that it is " not giving official guidance to the public yet about the next version of Windows . "
The PowerPoint presentation , which is dated Jan. 31 and can be accessed via Microsoft 's download.
microsoft.com site , was publicized today on AeroXperience , an independent blog aimed at Windows Vista developers .
The AeroXperience posting says that two slides in the presentation contain information that " more than likely applies to ' Windows Seven , ' " the codename that Microsoft is using internally for the successor to Vista .
According to the slides , planned areas of investment for end users in Windows Seven include making it easier to find information and improving mobile connectivity .
For example , a detailed list of future Windows features includes converged local , network and Internet search capabilities and improved wireless connectivity , management and security .
For IT professionals , the presentation indicates , planned improvements include added security measures , such as extending data protection and management capabilities to peripheral devices and expanding usage monitoring capabilities for compliance purposes .
Cutting PC operating costs will also be a priority , via new features such as simplified provisioning and upgrading of systems , according to the slides .
Last month , AeroXperience was the first to report that Microsoft planned to spend US $ 1 billion per year on development of the next version of Office , which is referred to by Microsoft employees as Office 14 and is expected to be ready for release in the first half of 2009 .
In the Office - related posting , AeroXperience cited a different PowerPoint presentation apparently created by another Microsoft Denmark employee that was also hosted on the download.microsoft.com site .
That presentation has since been taken down by Microsoft , although AeroXperience still has copies of some of the slides on its Web site .
Separately , the next version of Microsoft 's Windows Media Center software is expected to be released " out of band , " meaning that it wo n't necessarily be tied to a new version of the base Windows OS or a service - pack update , according to a March 14 blog posting by a Microsoft official that was highlighted yesterday by ZDNet blogger Mary Jo Foley .
Microsoft has released a version of Windows Media Center each year since 2002 , including one codenamed Diamond that came out last year and is built into Windows Vista Ultimate .
The blog posting by Charlie Owen , a program manager for Windows Media Center , notes that Diamond is the only one of the releases that was synchronized with a new version of Windows .
Owen wrote that with the next version of Windows Media Center , Microsoft will continue " our ( approximate ) yearly schedule " of releases .
But he did n't disclose any specific target dates or development milestones .
He added only that the Media Center team is " hard at work defining and coding the next version . "
In her blog entry , Foley wrote that she expects the next release of Windows Media Center to arrive this year or during 2008 .
Citing unnamed sources as well as a hint in an earlier posting by Owen , she said that she thinks the upcoming version is codenamed Fiji .
Microsoft did n't immediately respond to a request for comment on the various blog postings related to Windows Seven and Windows Media Center .

The Big Hollywood Lie :
Denying that Jews Control the Film Business
When country singer Dolly Parton told Vogue magazine a couple of months ago that her idea for a TV series about a country singer who becomes a gospel singer was turned down by Hollywood , she said that " everyone 's afraid to touch anything that religious because most of the people out here are Jewish , and it's a frightening thing for them to promote Christianity . "
Truer words were never spoken .
But the ADL 's chief troublemaker , Abe Foxman , immediately flew into one of his by - now tiresome furies and fired off a letter ( which he made available to the news media , of course ) to Dolly , scolding her for her innocent , honest comment .
Foxman charged that Ms. Parton was invoking " the old antisemitic stereotype of Jewish control of Hollywood and hostility toward Christianity . "
He did not , however , directly contradict her or deny that Hollywood is controlled by his fellow Jews .
Being the nice person she is and knowing on which side her bread is buttered , Dolly dutifully and publicly apologized .
She wrote to Foxman , " I regret that my words could have conjured up an impression of Jewish ' control ' of Hollywood . "
Ever the arrogant , whining bully , Foxman accepted Ms. Parton 's atonement , informing the media that is was a " refreshing capitulation . "
And the Hollywood lie lives on .
The Jewish denial that Hollywood is controlled by Jews is a great lie which can be attested to by anyone who has ever been associated with the film industry .
Here is but one example .
In the late 1970s , New American View editor Victor Marchetti was working as a screenwriter on a spy movie .
The producer , the director , Marchetti's agent and just about everyone else was Jewish .
The proposed film was shopped around to several major studios .
All the executives at all the studios with whom the project team met , with one exception -- Alan Ladd , Jr. , then head of 20th Century Fox -- were Jewish .
At one meeting , at MCA - Universal ( the studio which produced " Schindler 's List " ) , the discussion was interrupted when a latecomer entered the studio head 's office and took a seat next to Marchetti .
He was a little , nondescript person who seemed out of place in the production meeting .
The studio head halted the discussion and , turning to the little man , asked if he had any problems with the project after having read the treatment , an abbreviated script .
The man , speaking with a foreign accent , said no , smiled at Marchetti , and departed .
" Who is he ? " Marchetti asked the studio head .
The powerful Hollywood boss answered , " He 's an Israeli .
I just wanted to make sure there was nothing in this movie that he would not like . "
As the meeting continued , Marchetti began to count noses .
Of the nine people in the office , Marchetti was the only non-Jew .
It reminded him of many meetings he had attended in the publishing world in New York , where often he had been the only Gentile out of a dozen or more people discussing a book project .
Marchetti's Jewish agent leaned over and asked in a whisper , " What are you thinking about ? "
" Everybody in the room is Jewish except me . "
" Forget about that , " the agent said .
" You just better hope that your Jews are smarter than the studio's .
We 're talking big bucks . "
Since then , Marchetti has had several other involvements with the Hollywood movie crowd .
It was always the same .
The Jews were , and remain , in control of Tinsel Town .
To say otherwise is to lie .
It is bad enough when a group representing less than three percent of the American population -- and many of whose members have a self - proclaimed first loyalty to a foreign nation -- should be in control of so many of America 's cultural , financial and governmental institutions .
But it is positively insulting for them to deny their influence and power -- particularly when they themselves are continually boasting in their own circles about their " overrepresentation " in these fields .
And it is absolutely infuriating when this denial reaches the point that non-Jews are attacked by Jewish agitators and Zionist zealots for stating obvious facts and truth .
Most Americans have always been suspicious of too much power in too few hands .
That 's what the Constitution is all about .
And that is why we have never trusted elitist groups which have tried to dictate to us .
So , if we do n't trust the old - line establishment , the old elite , why should we not be suspicious of the new elite -- the Jewish establishment -- and its excessive power in America .
This essay is reprinted from the April 1 , 1994 , issue of New American View , a newsletter edited by Victor Marchetti .
( It is no longer published . )
Marchetti served for 14 years with the CIA , where he rose to be executive assistant to the deputy director .
His book ,
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence , co-authored with John Marks , was the first critical account of the agency written by an insider .
Marchetti's presentation at the Ninth IHR Conference , " Propaganda and Disinformation : How the CIA Manufactures History , " was published in the Fall 1989 Journal of Historical Review .
From The Journal of Historical Review , September / October 1998 ( Vol. 17 , No. 5 ) , page 14 .
Today , a friend of mine told me that he was writing a Sudoku solver in Haskell .
I could not resist and also wrote a brute - force one .
The code is ugly ( I was trying to generate as short a program as possible ) , but it led me to interesting thoughts .
First , here is the code .
Beware , you are supposed to know Haskell and monads to understand the comments following the code :
import Control .
Monad ( msum , mzero , MonadPlus ) import List ( elemIndex , ( \\ ) , intersperse ) import Maybe ( fromJust ) get s ( l , ln , c , cn ) = [s !!
( ll * 9 + cc ) | ll <- [l .. l + ln ] , cc <- [ c .. c + cn ] ] getall n s = [ (f 0 9 1 , 0 , 0 , 8 ) , ( 0 , 8 , f 9 1 1 , 0 ) , ( f 0 27 3 , 2 , f 9 3 3 , 2 ) ] >>= get s where f m d t = ( ( if m == 0 then n else n `mod` m ) `div` d ) * t solve :: ( Eq a , MonadPlus m ) => [ a ] -> a -> [ a ] -> m [ a ] solve g n s = case elemIndex n s of Nothing -> return s Just idx -> msum $ ( g \\ getall idx s ) >>= \x -> return $ solve g n $ take idx s ++ [ x ] ++ drop ( idx + 1 ) s showSudoku s = unlines $ " Solution : " : ( flip map [ 0 .. 8 ] $
-> sline n s ) where sline n s = concat $ intersperse " " $ map show $ get s ( n , 0 , 0 , 8 ) main = do s <- getContents let display = do choice <- solve [ 1 .. 9 ] 0 $ map read $ words s return $ showSudoku choice putStr $ fromJust display
The interesting piece here is not the code itself , which is indeed pretty boring and unclear , it is the type declaration of the solve function : its return type is m [ a ] , where [ a ] represents a completed Sudoku grid and m is a MonadPlus instance .
What is the point of choosing a MonadPlus type when , in the main function , the result is coerced to a Maybe ( which is a MonadPlus instance ) before being printed by the usage of fromJust ?
The Maybe type can contain zero or one result .
It means that the code , when executed , will either find no solution or return exactly one solution which will then be printed .
But what can we change if we want to print all the solutions ?
( if we start from the empty grid for example )
We are using Haskell after all .
Instead of using a Maybe type , we might as well use a list .
All right , the list type is also an instance of the MonadPlus class .
It can contain nothing ( empty list ) , one result , or more .
Let ’s change the line containing fromJust in main by :
mapM_ putStr display
The use of mapM_ coerces the use of solve to a list type .
Now , all the solutions will be printed , not only one of them .
If you want to try it , create a file called empty containing 9 lines of 9 space - separated zeroes :
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
and compile the program ( either variant ) .
Then you can feed it the empty sudoku grid :
% ghc -o sudoku sudoku.hs ./ sudoku < empty
Monad matters .
For real .
2 SETS OF PLANS IN ONE !
Build either the wind - powered B - 19 Glider for as little as $ 500 , which needs no engine and is towed into the air like a kite ; or the engine - powered B - 20 Kopter , a self - powered aircraft capable of long , sustained flights .
Vortech is pleased to offer the complete plans for building both outstanding aircraft .
FLY FOR FREE . . . with the B - 19 Glider . . . OR FOR PENNIES ! with the B - 20 Kopter
The Glider costs nothing to operate , requires no license .
Towed by car , the craft becomes airborne at about 23 mph .
Flight is completely pilot - controlled , limited only by the length of the tow cable .
Or , by adding a cable release , once airborne the pilot may free the craft for the exhilaration of unrestricted soaring .
The B - 19 may easily be converted at any time to the B - 20 , as is fully detailed in the same Construction Plans .
Take - off and flight of the Kopter is under full piston - engine power .
Takes off at 30 mph .
Cruises at 60 mph , with a high speed of 85 + mph .
Climbs at 1,000 fpm and will reach an altitude of 12,000 ft.
Engines of as little as 35 hp may be used ( with reduction drive ) , or up to 80 hp .
If flown as an ultralight , the B - 20 is free of licensing or certification requirements .
B - 19 easily converts to B - 20 — detailed in Plans !
SPECIFICATIONS OF THE B-19/20 GYROS
Height ...................................................................... 6 ft Length ............................................................... 10 ½ ft Width .................................................................... 5 ½ ft Empty Weight ( minus engine ) ..................... 150 lbs Empty Weight ( with engine ) ....................... 230 lbs Gross Weight ( max ) ...................................... 530 lbs Payload Weight .............................................. 300 lbs Rotor Diameter .................................................. 21 ft Rotor Chord ......................................................... 7 in Disc Loading ( lbs /sq ft ) ..................................... 1.53 Engine ( original ) .........................
McCulloch 4318 Horsepower Range ....................................... 45 to 70 Maximum Speed ............................................ 90 mph Airframe construction ........... welded steel tubing Control System ................. joystick ; rudder pedals Cruise Speed .................................................. 60 mph Take - off Speed ................................................ 30 mph Rate Of Climb ........................................... 1,000 fpm Maximum Altitude ..................................... 12,000 ft Now available : B - 19/20 Kits !
SUMMARY OF THE DESIGN :
The above 2 aircraft are the unpowered B - 19 Glider , which can be towed into the air by an automobile or , if fitted with floats , by a boat .
Once airborne , the cable can be released and , with proper skill and perhaps some help from the wind , the craft can continue its flight for many minutes .
Once control of the glider has been mastered , the craft can be easily converted to the engine - powered B - 20 Kopter .
According to FAA statistics , gyroplanes have outstanding safety records .
SUMMARY OF THE PLANS :
Construction of both the B - 19 and B - 20 are fully detailed in our plans package , available in either a reduced format ( 11 " X 17 " manual ) or as full - size blueprints with an assembly manual that provides step - by - step layout , parts ’ descriptions , balancing , and so on .
The full - size plans includes 3 free bonus manuals : Flying The Gyrocopter , Flying The Gyroglider , and the Helicopter Experimenter 's Handbook .
BUILDING COST :
Cost of constructing the B - 19 can be as low as $ 500 , or , for the B - 20 , as low as $ 1,000 , final cost depending on sources of supply , cost of engine , etc .
Even such critical parts as rotor blades , rotor hub and joystick may be constructed in a home shop from readily available raw materials , as detailed in the manual .
LICENSE -FREE STATUS OF THE B-19/20 :
No license is required to fly the B - 19/20 .
The unpowered B - 19 is classified under Federal Aircraft Regualtion ( FAR ) 103 as an unpowered , ultralight aircraft since its empty weight is below 155 lbs and it is only intended to carry a single person ( the pilot ) .
To fully conform to this regulation , the Gyro - Glider must only be flown for recreational purposes during daylight hours in an area away from concentrations of population .
Even when you add an engine to the B - 19 and create the B - 20 , it would fall within the weight criterion for a powered ultralight .

Stevey 's Drunken Blog Rants ™
There 's this great scene in the book The Last Castle by Jack Vance .
Or it might have been The Dragon Masters — I can't remember anymore .
This ancient castle on some distant planet is under attack , and the folks who 've lived there for generations are screwed because they 've forgotten how all the technology works .
The machines have worked fine for centuries , so the people in the castle have pretty much degenerated into a kind of ultra-elaborate , decadent aristocracy .
There are these big fire - cannons on the ramparts that they use to blast any enemies who happen to want to live in the castle too .
They know how to work the cannons , but not how they actually work ; in fact it would be considered a gauche breach of their refined social customs to mention something as irrelevant as the inner workings of the machinery .
At a critical juncture in the battle , an old Baron or some such tries to use their cannon to do some serious blasting , but it just belches out some smoke .
He yells at this old technician / butler guy who maintains the machines and asks him why it 's not working .
The butler / technician guy assures him that he 's taken the most exquisite care of the machine for decades , and his father before him , and so on .
He says they 've polished the cannon with nothing but the finest wines and the softest cloths , since time immemorial .
The Baron asks him again why it 's not working , but the butler says the internals were n't his responsibility ; he can't be held accountable , and so on .
I really got a kick out of that scene .
Polishing the cannon with expensive wine .
Har .
It 's a good thing I did n't really bond with those characters , since they got slaughtered .
Non-Leaky Abstractions
I wrestle with the whole abstraction question , and I 'm still not sure where a good engineer these days should draw the line — the one below which it 's all just magic .
We all have that line somewhere ; I encountered mine in school , back in my semiconductors course .
We were ( ostensibly ) learning how semiconductors work , but it was perfectly clear to me that this was just magic , and I was never going to understand it — in part , because I did n't want to make what was clearly going to be a HUGE effort to get it .
There was all this crap about K - spaces and lattices and who knows what else .
Maybe they 'd listed the prerequisites wrong , but I did not have the math foundations to understand what was going on .
It did n't help that my professor was 100 % senile , either .
Once a week he'd break into his senile rant about what an Amazing Device the Human Eye is , totally forgetting that he'd shared this insight with us every week since the quarter started .
We 'd all recite the story along with him , sometimes jumping ahead , which he senile - ly mistook for us being just as big fans of the Human Eye as an Amazing Instrument as he was .
It was really damned hard to concentrate in that class , and at the end of the quarter , my Human Eye was Amazed to see I 'd almost failed it , which signalled clearly that it was Time to Change Majors .
I 'd found that I love programming and detest hardware , so staying a Computer Engineering major probably would n't be too wise .
So I transferred into the UW 's Computer Science department , which meant switching from Engineering to Arts & Sciences , which meant taking a bunch of extra foreign - language and froo - froo social anthropology classes , where I got to watch films of dolphins counting to five through their blow - holes .
Which is about how smart I felt after that semiconductors class .
I felt like I could have made it as a dolphin .
It took me an extra year , but I finished in CS instead of CE , which allowed me to conveniently pretend that computer hardware , starting somewhere down at the level of the doping barrier in a silicon semiconductor , is just pure magic .
Parts of the hardware above that level are still a little murky , but I have a pretty good idea how computers can be made by assembling successively larger components together from smaller ones .
Given time and a gun to my head , I could probably start with any set of smaller components and derive how to build higher - level abstractions : transistors into logic gates , logic gates into larger assemblies that do arithmetic and boolean computing , those into state machines and ALUs , and so on .
I 'd suck at it , but I get the general idea , so it 's not really " magic " .
It 's magic when you have absolutely no frigging clue how it works , not the first clue .
It just works .
That 's how it is for me and semiconductors .
But I 'm OK with that .
I 'm OK with treating semiconductors as " atoms " ( or axioms , anyway ) in our little programming universe .
Chips are like molecules , CPUs are compounds , and Von Neumann machines can be bricks and mortar .
Well , I 'm sure you could come up with a way better metaphor .
Whatever .
The point is , the computers and networks and power supplies and so on are all amazingly complex under the hood , but usually I can just pretend they work a certain way , and not worry about how , any more than I have to worry about my Amazing Eye in order to pour myself another glass of fine wine , which I will doubtless use to polish my keyboard if I do n't finish this blog entry soon .
When is Magic OK ?
I do n't know .
I 'd really LIKE to know .
I 'm constantly trying to find better abstractions for my everyday work as a programmer .
You can't build large systems without having some fairly bulletproof abstractions to build on .
If you 're building an e-commerce system , for instance , you need a transactional data store , and you rely on the semantics of transactionality when you 're coding ; if you do n't , you 'll wind up with all this crap in your code that tries to fake transactions .
I 'm comfortable relying on certain abstractions working for me — for instance , if I compile with optimizations turned on , I know the compiler wo n't discard correctness in favor of performance , or if it does do that , it 'll be documented so I know I should n't use that flag .
Compiler optimization can be treated like a black box of sorts : I turn it on and see if performance seems any better , but I do n't expect to need to re-test all my loops to make sure the variables are all still being adjusted in the same order as before .
What I 'm NOT sure about is where I 'm allowed to forget how things work , or never know in the first place , and start getting by with incantations that seem to work .
For instance , I know that I can type 'ls ' in a shell to get a directory listing .
How much do I have to really know about how unix ' ls ' works in order to be an effective developer ?
I can see two arguments — so cleanly divided in opinion , in fact , that I can picture which of my friends are marching directly into one camp or the other right now .
One argument is that you DO need to know a lot about how 'ls ' works , because there are all sorts of situations in which it can fail , and you 'll need to figure out how to fix it .
It could simply not show up ( " command not found " , say ) , or it could stop working on certain of my directories , or it could crash every once in a while instead of producing a directory listing , or it could go on a rampage and start deleting files .
I think I 've seen all of these happen with 'ls ' in my time , even the last one , when my linux filesystem was corrupted .
Another argument is that you DO NOT need to know much about how ' ls ' works .
Probably all you need to know is that it's a unix command - line tool , a binary that was compiled for your OS , probably written in C , that it lives in a standard place in the filesystem , and that standard binary locations are looked up in an environment variable called PATH .
But you do n't need to know how it traverses the filesystem inode entries , or whether it's a statically or dynamically linked version of ' ls ' , or whatever else there is to know about 'ls ' .
( I probably should have picked ' diff ' as my example , not 'ls ' .
Oh well . )
The second camp argues that software development is a community effort , and your community should have a Unix Guy Or Gal who knows all the ins and outs of how lses and diffs and their ilk work .
A sort of tribal shaman who you go to , and desperately plead with : please help me !
There 's a bug in qsort !
The shaman frowns at your screen , and pokes and prods things a bit , and announces that your pilfer grommit is no longer connected to your weasel pins , and that the easiest fix is to reinstall the OS .
A third , possibly even more abstract camp , would argue that 'ls ' is way too complicated , and that you should be developing on systems in which everything is managed by navigating menus and waiting for your Auto Updater to tell you that a new Service Pak is available for download .
And for all I know , they might be right .
I have no idea how Exchange works , for example , and yet I trust it with my email every day .
When it 's broken , I put in Stupid Remedy Tickets saying I have n't received email in 10 days , and I do n't feel the least bad about that , since it 's not my responsibility ; I made all the right incantations , and spilled all the right wine , and by golly , I 'm not getting email anymore .
The second and third camps want to use J2EE , and they recount with some pride how they 've managed just fine for years without ever having had to learn a scripting language , or become proficient with some cryptic unix editor , or any of that arcane crapola .
They did n't see any need , because they were off building the FrooSingleton Manager service , and it's all finished now , while I 'm still mucking around with my broken ' ls ' command .
Moreover , many of them say they do n't see any need to know how to implement an n*log ( n ) sorting algorithm , because the damn things are already provided in libraries for every platform in the universe , including programming languages that are deader than Latin or Sanskrit .
And you know , I wonder sometimes whether they 're right .
I find myself straddling both camps .
One the one hand , I think nobody in their right mind would try to write a gigantic system in C++ now that Java has become an obviously far superior way to build large systems .
You can argue that in C++ you really have to know what you 're doing , or that you love the smell of freshly - brewn pointer arithmetic in the early morning , or whatever the hell you like about C++.
I 'm not arguing that you LIKE it — I know you do .
I liked assembly language when I was using it daily .
I 'm just saying that the game has moved on , and if you 're using C++ to build large systems because you like C++ , it 's like competing in the Indy 500 with your 1980 5.8 - liter Pontiac Firebird .
It gets you around , and it 's fun to tinker with , which is good ' cause it breaks down all the time , but you 're not going to win any world championships with it .
On the OTHER hand ( remember , we were just on the one back there ) , I think nobody in their right mind would write a huge system in Java without first knowing how the whole thing is implemented , under the covers , in C++ and ( below that ) assembly language .
As of today , anyway , I do n't believe the JVM is allowed to be on the " it 's magic " side of the line .
And as for J2EE , which provides so much abstraction that you can snap together an enterprise architecture with it after one or two introductory programming courses , it 's WAY too much magic .
I definitely think that ( as of today ) if your Magic Line stops at the J2EE framework APIs and the Java Programming Language , then you 're a wuss .
The problem is , these two views that I hold are mutually inconsistent : one says that using abstraction makes you MORE effective , because to build large , interesting things in any reasonable amount of time , you need to work with high - level abstractions and be able to assume that they work as advertised .
This part of me believes that someday we 'll be programming in purely declarative languages , telling the computer what to do , and letting it figure out how .
one says that relying too much on abstraction makes you LESS effective , because you 're unable to cope when your framework is n't working right , or when you 're trying to do something with it that it was n't designed for , or whatever .
This part of me believes that my other belief is on crack if it thinks it 'll happen during my lifetime .
My Current Compromise : Know Thy Abstractions
The tentative compromise I 've been working with is as follows .
You can use an abstraction all you want , as long as : you know more or less how it works ; i.e. what other abstractions it 's built on top of , and approximately how it was built .
you know where the abstraction leaks : i.e. what the gotchas are , failure modes , what the most common incantations are to get it working again .
You need at least SOME level of tv-repairman ability for the things you use — you should be able to install any of the software you rely on , for instance .
Or you should have a plausible backup plan handy if you need to throw this abstraction away and use another one .
you need to be able to reason about the performance characteristics of the abstraction , and understand how its performance and reliability degrade as you put pressure on it .
you know where to look , or who to ask , if it does n't seem to be working .
Sound easy enough ?
If you think so , then you should be able to , say , talk about the data structure they used to implement a Set , the last time you used a Set.
Think Java 's TreeSet , or STL's Sets and MultiSets .
They 're implemented using the same underlying data structure , which seems to indicate that it 's kind of important , so in my world view , you can use it , but only if you can describe more or less how it works , reason about its space and time performance , etc .
Am I right ?
I have no idea .
I suspect that the Line of Acceptable Magic is slowly moving up , as certain abstractions become so bulletproof , ubiquitous , and well - supported that you really do n't need to know how they work .
Like toilets .
I 'm happy that they 're magic .
As the Line of Acceptable Magic moves up each year , the people who understand abstractions below the line will kick and scream ( I do it too ) , saying that back in the old days , your bits had to walk uphill both ways in the snow .
These folks have been burned by the appearance of slick new magical forces , claiming to give you seven years of high availability if you 'll just sign on the dotted line .
Old - timers always advise you to hold on to your low - level knowledge , even if you apparently never use it .
On the other side , there are people who are pushing the Line of Acceptable Magic higher and higher , by building abstractions that take you further and further away from the bits marching like ants between computers on the network , or swirling around in the washing machine of your CPU .
They say you can't write great literature if you 're constantly worrying about typesetting and ink drying times .
The J2EE people are shaking their heads at me for saying you should " only " be using the abstraction that plain Java and misc 3rd - party libraries provide .
I 'm sure they feel as frustrated with me as I do with people writing who are still writing big systems in C++ , and they take out their frustration on me in debriefs , when I say their candidate does n't raise the bar .
( And I take out my frustration on them when they say my candidates , who might quite literally be rocket scientists , fail their C++ questions .
Really .
This stuff happens every month , and the two sides are waging a sort of desperate war to figure out what a Hiring Bar is .
As far as I know , it 's pure magic . )
When is it OK to use magic ?
How do you know your machines wo n't fail during a most inopportune siege on your castle ?
How do you know your frameworks wo n't fail during an important time window for your business ?
This is a really hard problem .

For SharkDefense partners Eric Stroud and Michael Herrmann , the latest eureka moment in their efforts to repel sharks came not from their extensive research but their utter geekiness .
Since 2001 , SharkDefense has been working on a chemical shark repellent .
According to Herrmann , he and Stroud were playing around with powerful rare - earth magnets in 2005 , when he dropped one next to their shark research tank in Oak Ridge , New Jersey .
The lemon and nurse sharks inside instantly darted to the opposite wall .
Bewildered , the two scientists began to investigate .
The results , chronicled by Ocean Magnetics ( their spinoff company ) , bode well for the much - maligned and often needlessly killed fish .
In testing at the Bimini Biological Research Station shark lab in the Bahamas , Stroud and Herrmann have found that sharks dramatically avoid magnets made from neodymium , iron and boron .
The magnets even rouse sharks from tonic immobility , a coma - like state induced by turning them upside down .
A lemon shark is instantly repelled by Ocean Magnetics ' unnamed " mystery metal , " even when the metal is hidden behind a plastic barrier .
Video : SharkDefenseHerrmann says he and Stroud think the magnets overload a shark 's ampullae of Lorenzini , small vesicles and pores around the head that form part of a subcutaneous sensory network .
What 's more , he says a metal with similar electropositive qualities also appears to affect sharks the same way .
Hermann preferred to keep the identity of that metal secret for now .
A line of magnets ( underneath the black line in the center ) keeps a group of juvenile lemon sharks on one side of a test tank .
Video : SharkDefenseDivers and swimmers may thrill to the idea of shark safeguards .
However , before you rush out to buy neodymium magnets to create your own shark - repelling gear , Herrmann cautions that the magnets appear to have an effective range of only 10 inches .
Also , you 'd need to align the magnetic poles outward and keep the magnets from clicking together , and once you had the necessary 10 to 20 pounds of magnets all over your body , you 'd sink .
So , at a cost of about $ 5 a magnet , you could theoretically turn yourself into a $ 400 shark - safe anchor at the bottom of the sea .
Rather than being a solution to shark attacks on humans , Stroud and Herrmann hope the magnets or metals can help protect sharks from us .
Last year , the World Conservation Union announced that 20 percent of shark and ray species are close to extinction , and SharkDefense believes magnets or metals can create more - humane underwater fences than the often lethal nets currently keeping sharks out of swimming areas .
A lemon shark with tonic immobility ( a comatose state induced by turning it upside - down ) is roused by bringing a magnet near its head .
Video : SharkDefenseSharkDefense won $ 25,000 from the World Wildlife Fund 's annual International Smart Gear Competition to develop magnets or metals to keep sharks from dying on commercial fishing lines intended for other fish , such as swordfish – which they do in great numbers daily .
Rare - earth magnets and electropositive metals would be expensive and cumbersome to add to longline fishing hooks , says Herrmann .
" But if you think about it , when a fisherman catches a shark by mistake , that 's one swordfish worth at least several thousands of dollars he does n't catch , " he says .

May 25 , 2007  --
On Hans Pieter Sieber 's Priegola dairy farm in Villanueva del Pardillo , Spain , the secret to success is not some newfangled technology or machine .
Nor is it a time - tested technique or process handed down from generation to generation .
Rather it is the dulcet , layered tones of classical music .
And not just any music .
Sieber exposes his herd of approximately 700 heifers to the famous chords , crescendos and cadences of Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart .
Once just normal , run - of - the - mill dairy cows , these Friesians now receive the rock star treatment -- listening to soothing music , sleeping on water beds , taking relaxing showers , and even enjoying sessions with an animal psychologist .
Believe it or not , since sending Mozart 's Concerto for Flute and Harp in D Major soaring through their stalls at milking time , Sieber has seen a dramatic shift in the temperament and production of his Daisys and Besses .
Now his herd quietly lines up to be milked , seeming not to mind the poking and prodding that comes with being a dairy cow , and , most notably , producing anywhere from 1 to 6 more liters of milk per day than their non-Mozart listening counterparts .
" It is relaxing music for them , but at the same time it is dynamic , it keeps the cows active .
The trick is not to have music too relaxing , " said Sieber 's son , Nicolas Sieber , the head of marketing for the Priegola farm .
But Sieber believes it 's simpler than that .
" If you give the cows comfort they are more disposed to help out , " he said .
Originally discovered by monks in Brittany , the effect of Mozart on cows ' milk production is not a totally new concept .
Since the early 1990s , when UC Irvine 's Dr. Gordon Shaw and Dr. Francis Raucher theorized that listening to Mozart had the potential to boost babies ' IQs and make adults smarter and more creative , the " Mozart effect , " as it 's come to be known , has sparked a worldwide debate on the power of sound therapy .
But it was not until recently that researchers began testing the theory on animals .
" It only happens with Mozart , and , although it was discovered by monks in Brittany , the idea is being used mainly in Israel , " said the younger Sieber of the Mozart effect .
" We , in fact , have specialists come over from Israel to explain to us new concepts of production .
And it was them that told us to use Mozart . "
According to researchers , the placid harmonies , sharps and flats , legatos , and allegros of Mozart 's music stimulate the brain , but relax the muscles allowing both humans and bovines to live up to their fullest potential .
Despite the Priegola farm's success , not everyone is sold on the benefits of musical milking .
British herdsman Chris Howard , who milks his ladies in silence , says that his girls ' milk production is " just fine " without the music , attesting that a happy cow is one with food in front of her .
Perhaps Howard 's biggest issue with the Mozart theory is that he does not even like classical music .
" I do n't think I could put up with that , to tell you the truth , " he admitted .
Whether it's their comfort or relaxation levels , both cows and owners have reaped unforeseen rewards from this experiment .
Not only do these now blissful bovines produce more milk , but , as it turns out , their milk has higher levels of healthy fats and proteins and , according to the farm , a sweeter taste .
Now , that 's music to everyone 's ears .
One thing I ’ve noticed about talking to certain types of press , particularly mainstream , is that they have a pattern in mind before they write about something , and the better you conform to the pattern the more coverage you get .
I think what they really want is an unusually young founder , possibly with a partner , who stumbled on an idea in an epiphany moment , implemented it in days , and then enjoyed overnight success , preferably capped with some sort of financial hook such as a huge VC funding or selling out to a large company for millions of dollars .
It ’s not uncommon to get leading questions trying to hit a point in the above patterns …
Yes , WordPress really is four years old .
I was 19 .
No , I did n’t create it alone , if I did you would have never heard of it .
Actually , it entered a rather crowded field , not even close to being first .
No , not planning to sell it , there is n’t really anything to sell , it ’s more of a movement .
No , I did n’t make 60 million dollars in 18 months .
What ’s worst is I think these stories sell a false promise and hope to people outside of the industry — it attracts the wrong type of entrepreneurs — and inside of the industry it distracts us from what really matters .
Someday I think there will be a realization that the real story is more exciting than the cookie - cutter founder myth the media tries frame everything in .
It ’s not just one or two guys hacking on something alone , it ’s dozens of people from across the world coming together because of a shared passion .
It ’s not about selling out to a single company , it ’s dozens of companies independently adopting and backing an open source platform for no reason other than its quality .
I ’m not a millionaire , and may never be , but there are now hundreds of people making their living using WordPress , and I expect that number to grow to tens of thousands .
That ’s what gets me out of bed in the morning , not the prospect of becoming a feature on an internet behemoth ’s checklist .
Finally it ’s not Web 2.0 , or another bandwagon me - too content management system with AJAX , it ’s a mature project that has been around and grown up over four years of hard work , and it has many , many more years of hard work ahead of it .
I smile these days when I see WordPress referred to as an “ overnight success , ” if only they knew how long an overnight success takes .

April 18th , 2007
I thought that I should designate a single post to all of the Virginia Tech related analysis , to parse out some of the key signals from the noise .
Within 30 minutes of actually sitting down to read about the incident , I had already seen enough .
At first , I was looking for — and found — indications of trauma induced mind control .
According to ABC News :
Lucinda Roy , a co-director of the creative writing program at Virginia Tech , taught Cho in a poetry class in fall of 2005 and later worked with him one - on - one after she became concerned about his behavior and themes in his writings .
Roy spoke outside her home Tuesday afternoon , saying that there was nothing explicit in Cho ’s writings , but that threats were there under the surface .
Roy told ABC News that Cho seemed “ extraordinarily lonely –the loneliest person I have ever met in my life . ”
She said he wore sunglasses indoors , with a cap pulled low over his eyes .
He whispered , took 20 seconds to answer questions , and took cellphone pictures of her in class .
Roy said she was concerned for her safety when she met with him .
She said she notified authorities about Cho , but said she was told that there would be too many legal hurdles to intervene .
She said she asked him to go to counseling , but he never did .
One play attributed to him , called “ Richard McBeef , ” describes a 13 - year - old boy who accuses his stepfather of pedophilia , and ends with the boy ’s death .
In another , called “ Mr. Brownstone , ” three high - school students face an abusive teacher .
“ I wanna kill him , ” says one character .
“ I wanna watch him bleed like the way he made us kids bleed , ” says another .
The two plays were posted on AOL after a staffer named Ian MacFarlane , a December 2006 graduate of Virginia Tech , brought them to his editors ’ attention .
MacFarlane said he was in a class with Cho in which students were required to post their plays online for peer review and comment .
In a different ABC News article , Brad Garrett , a former FBI agent / ABC News consultant , provided some interesting commentary :
The date of the first gun purchase will likely serve as the time of “ some triggering mechanism that was very important ” to Cho said Garrett , an expert on profiling murderers .
That made me want to read through the first ABC News article again , and I noticed something that I had skipped the first time .
Let ’s look at Sun- Kyung , Cho ’s sister :
Cho ’s parents live in a townhouse development in Centreville , a suburb of Washington .
They own a dry - cleaning shop nearby .
His older sister , Sun-Kyung , graduated from Princeton University in 2004 .
A source , who asked to be identified as a senior Administration official , said she works for McNeil Technologies , a firm contracted by the State Department to manage reconstruction efforts in Iraq .
Woh .
Ok .
Stop right there .
What does McNeil Technologies do ?
Oh , the usual black bag intelligence agency cut out kind of stuff …
Actually , there ’s more here than you can shake a stick at .
The McNeil Technologies Services page lists the following categories : Language Services , Information Management Services , Program Support Services , Security Services , Intelligence Services .
I clicked on Intelligence Services first .
Intelligence Services ->
Overview
McNeil ”s Intelligence and Language Center ( ILC ) provides unmatched expertise in the areas of Intelligence and Language Services .

Cui bono ?
Who benefits ?
At some point in the future , would a company that provides physical security for large organizations benefit from what just happened at Virginia Tech ?
It ’s obviously just a coincidence that the sister of the shooter works for a large provider of these services .
Right ?
A company with more publicly stated connections to U.S. Intelligence than you can shake a stick at …
A company that is providing ongoing support to current U.S. Intelligence operations …
Feel free to keep clicking around on that site , if you dare .
Intelligence operations .
Physical security operations at airports and top secret government facilities .
Government document declassification .
Handling of information related to weapons of mass destruction …
It goes on and on .
I ’m not trying to sell you a set of steak knives :
But wait , there ’s more .
Who / what owns McNeil Technologies ?
According to the McNeil Technologies About page :
In July 2004 Veritas Capital acquired McNeil Technologies and its subsidiaries .
Veritas Capital is a private equity investment firm headquartered in New York .
Founded in 1992 , Veritas ’ primary objective is to partner with experienced and entrepreneurial management teams to develop leading companies in their respective markets .

Moving on to Veritas Capital , again , take your pick of what to look at there , but with two board members being associated with the Council on Foreign Relations …
Like I said , I ’ve already seen enough .
UPDATE 1 : 4/19/07 : Is the South Korean Film Oldboy Somehow Related ?
I know I said that I ’ve already seen enough , but it ’s actually difficult to keep up with the rest of the news without bumping into this story .
The New York Times posted a brief story about how Cho appears to be imitating a scene from Oldboy , a 2003 South Korean film .
I gathered the appropriate images from Cho ’s “ multi media manifesto ” and Oldboy .
Cho and Oldboy ?
If you do n’t know what Oldboy is about , you might think pfft ! , so what , two Korean dudes with hammers , God damned conspiracy theorists …
I ’ve never heard of the film before today .
What ’s it about ?
See for yourself .
The parts about forced drugging , psychological torture and split personalities caught my attention .
But to the growing number of people who insist that this has nothing to do with mind control ( really !
you conspiracy theorist whackos should just get a life ! ) , this is just another coincidence .
* yawn *
Of course , your results may vary .
UPDATE 2 : 4/20/07 : Comment Moderation
This post is attracting the WRONG kind of traffic , and lots of it .
The troll population has literally exploded .
So , some rules about comments :
1 ) Make sure your comment is on topic .
For this post , it would help if you ’ve read at least some of the literature on U.S. Government mind control programs .
2 ) If you have a personal issue with me or Cryptogon , comments on posts are n’t the place for that .
Feel free to send me an email if you want .
I may or may not respond .
( Why not start your own I - Hate - Cryptogon blog , with round the clock coverage of why you hate Cryptogon ?
That may be a more productive use of your time . )
3 ) Be polite to other users .
4 ) Read rule # 1 again .
UPDATE 3 : 4/23/07 : Cho Attended Same High School as Another “ Lone Nut ” Shooter
And the shootings occurred within one year of each other .
To quote the story , “ It ’s just a horrible coincidence …
It ’s hard to believe . ”
But is it really that hard to believe ?
Is it ?
In general , when lies are told to Americans , everyone knows that there ’s no point is telling small lies .
Tell them whoppers .
Tell them nonsense that would n’t even fly in a nut house full of raving lunatics .
The more absurd the lies , the more Americans have to believe in multiple , ridiculous ‘ coincidences ’ , the more readily they will internalize the programming .
For people who managed to believe the Mohammad Atta magic passport story , and so many other absurdities , this will just be another walk in the park .
Via : Chicago Tribune :
Fairfax County , Va. , police investigators said today that Virginia Tech gunman Cho Seung - Hui was a 2003 graduate of the same high school attended by an 18 - year - old who went on a shooting rampage last year at a Virginia police station , killing two officers .
Michael Kennedy , armed with an AK - 47 , fired more than 70 rounds in the parking lot of the Sully District police station on May 8 , killing Det. Vicky Armel and Master Police Officer Michael Garbarino .
Kennedy was shot to death by police .
Cho and Kennedy lived in Centreville and graduated from Westfield High School , said Officer Courtney Thibault of the Fairfax County Police Department .
She said Cho graduated four years ahead of Kennedy .
Once Cho ’s identify was released by police in Blacksburg , Va. , home of Virginia Tech , Thibault said Fairfax County police launched an investigation to determine if there was any connection between the two shooters .
She said they found nothing tying the two young men together .
“ It ’s just a horrible coincidence , ” she said .
“ It ’s hard to believe . ”
UPDATE 4 : 4/27/07 : System Planning Corporation Involved with Investigation
System Planning Corporation is such a profoundly spooky outfit that it creeps me out just thinking about it .
But I ’m sure that it ’s just another coincidence that one of DARPA ’s largest contractors — a private company involved with some of the U.S. Government ’s blackest projects — is involved with the investigation into the Virginia Tech shooting .
Via : Washington Post :
An Arlington County consulting firm that evaluated the emergency response to the 1999 Columbine High School shootings and other public safety crises has been hired by state officials to assist the panel that will investigate the Virginia Tech massacre .
TriData Corp. will provide staff and research support to the eight - member panel named last week by Gov. Timothy M. Kaine ( D ) . Kaine , in Northern Virginia yesterday for a community meeting with the South Korean ambassador , met privately with Philip S. Schaenman , TriData ’s president .
Schaenman said the contract terms are being worked out .
A division of defense contractor System Planning Corp. , TriData is best known for studying fire safety issues .
But it also conducted a study for the Federal Emergency Management Agency on police and emergency medical response to the shootings at Columbine , in which two students killed 15 , including themselves , at the Colorado school .
The report pointed out problems with communications and management of the disaster scene .
The firm was retained by Virginia officials to review the chaotic response to a false positive anthrax test at the Pentagon ’s remote mail facility and a similar alarm at Defense Department sites in Fairfax County in March 2005 .
Again the firm concluded that poor communication and unclear chains of command hampered coordination between federal officials and local jurisdictions .
Schaenman told a congressional committee that the response was “ the homeland security version of the fog of war . ”

IBM 's BlueGene / L supercomputer contains 4,096 processors , each tricked out with 256MB of RAM .
It crunches out 360 trillion floating point operations per second .
But as University of Nevada researchers have discovered , it does n't hold a digital candle to the mind of a mouse :
" The mouse cortex has roughly 8x10 ⁶ ( 8 m ) neurons and 8,000 synapses per neuron , " state researchers James Frye , Rajagopal Ananthanarayanan and Dharmendra S Modha .
" Assuming an average firing rate of 1 Hz , the entire memory must be refreshed every second , each neuron must be updated at every simulation time step , and each neuron communicates to each of its targets at least once a second . "
As the team says in a gloriously deadpan way : " Modeling [ sic ] at this scale imposes tremendous constraints on computation , communication and memory capacity of any computing platform . "
However , even this huge processing effort still only managed to run at a speed 10 times slower than real time , and only for 10 seconds - the equivalent of one second of mouse - thought .
Barely enough time for a mouse to register a hungry cat in the vicinity .
What 's more , a mouse brain has just eight million neurons .
A human brain , by comparison , has 100 billion , but that has n't stopped Swiss researchers from trying to model one .
Would such a supercomputer develop consciousness ?
The Lausanne researchers are refreshingly candid on this : " We really do not know , " they say .
" If consciousness arises because of some critical mass of interactions , then it may be possible . "
Just how powerful is the brain of a mouse ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Obese workers may cost their employers more , filing more workers ’ compensation claims for injuries on the job , and then more frequently going on to become disabled , according to two reports published on Monday .
The researchers , writing in the Archives of Internal Medicine , said employers should consider offering advice not only on safe work practices , but on healthy eating and exercise .
A person is considered technically obese if he or she has a body mass index of 30 or above .
BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared .
A person 5 feet 5 inches tall , is obese at 180 pounds ( 82 kilograms ) and morbidly obese , with a BMI of 40 , at 240 pounds ( 109 kilograms ) .
Obesity brings a higher risk of cancer , heart disease and diabetes .
Dr. Truls Ostbye and colleagues at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina studied 11,728 health care and university employees who completed at least one health risk assessment questionnaire between 1997 and 2004 .
Over an average of three years of follow - up , workers with higher BMIs tended to file more workers ’ compensation claims .
People with BMIs of 40 or more had twice the rate of claims as people at recommended weights -- especially claims related to back , wrist or arm , neck or shoulder , knee , foot or hip injuries .
“ The number of lost workdays was almost 13 times higher , medical claims costs were seven times higher and indemnity claims costs were 11 times higher among the heaviest employees compared with those of recommended weight , ” Ostbye ’s team wrote .
For the second study , Dr. Soham Al Snih of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and colleagues studied 12,725 adults 65 years or older .
None were disabled at the beginning of the study , which started in 1982 and ended in 1993 .
The researchers questioned the volunteers every year about health conditions , demographics and psychosocial characteristics .
Blood pressure , height and weight and physical function were also measured .
Over the 11 years , 3,570 of the volunteers became disabled , and 2,019 died .
“ Subjects with BMIs of lower than 18.5 ( underweight ) or 30 or higher ( obese ) at baseline were significantly more likely to experience disability during the follow - up period , ” Al Snih ’s team wrote .
But being simply overweight did not cause health trouble .
People with BMIs of 25 to 30 -- 150 pounds to 180 pounds ( 68 to 82 kilograms ) for someone 5 feet 5 inches -- lived longer than people who weighed less .
“ Disability - free life expectancy is greatest among subjects with a BMI of 25 to less than 30 , ” the researchers wrote .
Other studies have also found underweight and normal weight older adults may have a lower immediate risk of death .
This is the homepage of the GTK - server .
The GTK - server is a free , open - source project , which offers a stream - oriented interface to the GTK libraries , enabling access to graphical user interfaces for shellscripts and interpreted programming languages using GTK 1.x , 2.x or 3.x .
It was inspired by Sun 's DeskTop KornShell ( dtksh ) of the Common Desktop Enviroment ( CDE ) for Unix .
Currently the following languages have been tested successfully with the GTK - server :
How does it work ?
The GTK - server can be compiled as a standalone binary , which is able to communicate by a message queue , a 2 - way pipe , a named pipe or by a TCP / UDP port .
The script invokes this binary , sets up a queue , pipe or a TCP / UDP connection and prints the GTK call in plain text to the queue , pipe or socket .
The GTK - server then sends information back which can be used in the program or script .
Instead , the GTK - server also can be compiled as a shared object or DLL , from which the function ' gtk ' can be imported .
This function accepts GTK calls as a plain text argument .
There is also a configuration file , in which the user of the GTK - server must describe the API call he wants to invoke .
In the configfile every API call must be defined ; the type of callback signal must be set , the return value , the number of arguments and the type of these arguments .
If you are not familiar with the GTK API , you can download a default configfile from this place .
The configfile also defines which GTK libraries should be used .
Next to the regular GTK libraries any library can be specified , like Glade , GtkMozEmbed , GtkGlArea , GtkGlExt , but also libc , libmikmod and so on !
But the most disturbing aspects that Scahill explores have more to do with larger questions than just Blackwater itself or the status of contractors in the law courts .
For example , he points out :
... the pool of potential soldiers available to an aggressive administration is limited only by the number of men across the globe willing to kill for money .
With the aid of the mercenaries , you do n’t need a draft or even the support of your own public to wage wars of aggression , nor do you need a coalition of " willing " nations to aid you .
Using a private army , a government can bypass democratic Congressional agreement about waging war .
Scahill explains the benefits – both to the contractors and the government –when private mercenaries are being put on the ground in places like the Caspian , rich in natural gas resources and conveniently located between Russia and Iran :
Instead of sending in battalions of active U.S. military to Azerbajian , the Pentagon deployed " civilian contrctors " from Blackwater and other firms to set up an operation that would serve a dual purpose : protecting the West ’s new profitable oil and gas exploitation in a region historically dominated by Russia nd Iran , possibly laying the groundwork for an important forward operation base for an attack against Iran .
.... Central Asia correspondent Nathan Hedge [ observed ] , " It ’s understandable :
The country is sandwiched between Russia and Iran , and sending a contingent of uniformed U.S. military trainers would be a provocative move .
A private contract helps keep things under the radar . "
The use of these contractors raises an even more alarming prospect , if followed to its logical conclusion : why not cut governments out altogether ?
As multi-national corporations continue to grow and exercise a power greater than that of many nations , what ’s to prevent them from employing their own private armies – as they do now with smaller , more passive security forces – and ignoring all laws of any country , the ones they ’re occupying or the ones they ’re at least nominally registered in ?
As it is , Blackwater is floating around the world , according to Scahill , recruiting in countries with some of the most heinous human rights records and long and sordid histories of utilizing death squads .
Your Solutions , a rival mercenary provider to Blackwater , actually hired the Honduran soldiers pulled out of Iraq by the Honduran government and sent them right on back to the region to fight under a private contract .
Blackwater has hired and trained South Africans and soldiers who served under Pinochet in Chile .
More disturbing is the current push of Blackwater and the mercenary industry to repackage itself to meet domestic and humanitarian needs .
First , consider this passage from Scahall , describing the first - ever " World SWAT Conference and Challenge , " held at the company ’s North Carolina facility , where :
... there would be a SWAT Olympics , where teams from across the United States and Canada would compete in a series of events televised by ESPN .
[ Army Lt. Col. David Grossman , author of the book On Killing ] spoke of a " new Dark Age " full of Al Qaeda terrorism and school shootings ...
" Embrace the warrior spirit , " he shouted .
" We need warriors who embrace that dirty , nasty four - letter word kill ! "
Totally aside from the surreal weirdness of having these events broadcast on ESPN , consider those " warrior spirit " quotations and realize that Blackwater was on the streets of New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina faster than the federal government was .
And think about how the company , according to Scahill , is now making a push , with its massive lobbying arm behind it , to get into the border patrol business as well , with founder Prince talking up savings and efficiency .
Are these the kind of people we want in American cities in the wake of national disasters ?
Or on our borders ?
Men who are exhorted to " embrace that dirty , nasty four - letter word , kill ? "
Blackwater is astute enough to realize this warrior philosophy might not be warmly embraced by civilians , and in an attempt to downplay its soldier - of - fortune roots , has begun an Orwellian repackaging PR campaign , Scahill reports .
First of all , it helped as the industry leader to create its own trade association , now masquerading under the double - speak name , the " International Peace Operations Association , " an organization that now defines itself as representing – are you ready ?
– the " peace and stability industry . "
Under this " peace and stability " guise , the mercenary corporations are maneuvering not just to corner the disaster preparedness , border control and insurgent - quelling markets worldwide , they are shooting for the stars – taking over NATO peacekeeping missions and as much as they can gobble up of the international humanitarian aid business .
Under the soft banner of " humanitarianism , " these companies hoped to take " business " away from international governmental bodies like the UN , NATO , and the African and European Unions .
For Blackwater , such a transformation would mean permanent profit opportunity , limited only by the number of international crises , disasters , and conflicts .
Most specifically – and what should be disturbing to liberals who are understandably urging humanitarian intervention in Africa – is this :
Sudan has become a pet cause of many of the right - wing Christian forces Blackwater is in bed with , not the least of which is Christian Freedom International — on whose small nine - member board both Erik Prince and his lobbyist Paul Behrends sit .
Christian Freedom , founded by a consortium of well - connected Republican evangelicals , has been accused of using its " humanitarian aid " designation as a cover for missionary activities .
What Scahill rightly calls this " repackaging mercenaries as peacekeepers " is going on through presentations to government officials – both in this country and to officials in such places as Jordan – under the beloved conservative banner of privatization , efficiency and incredible lobbying efforts ( the same lobbyists , in fact , who are threaded throughout the Abramoff scandal ) .
The author has done an amazing job in laying out the sheer vastness and ambition of Blackwater and similar companies , but a reader is left with many questions – and to be fair , it feels like Scahill himself got a bit cramped in the presentation and would like to follow up on more lines of research :
How much of the black ops budget is Blackwater taking up ?
How will this strange hybrid mix of government military and private military play out , given that there is video on the internet showing Blackwater mercenaries commanding GI ’s under attack in Najaf ?
What about the legalities of criminal mercenary actions ?
What about protections of the mercenaries ’ own legal rights – like those of the Central American squads who showed up in Iraq and were told their contracts paid much , much less than they were led to believe and if they did n’t like it , to find their own way home ?
What about the " national security " dodge Blackwater is using to avoid discovery in its civil lawsuits ?
How deeply involved is Blackwater ’s aviation arm with illegal renditions ?
And on and on and on ....
The privatization of just about everything has long been an ambition of the Bush administration and the people who placed them there .
The Blackwater situation only points out the muddy waters in the starkest fashion possible , in the most brutal industry , operating invisibly behind the scenes .
One hopes Scahill has a long and happy career in front of him , full of plans to follow up on a lot of the disturbing leads he initially kicked up in this book .
It ’s a horrifying but necessary read , and I ca n’t recommend it more highly than that .
[ A video of Scahill and an excerpt from this book are available for perusal at The Nation .
Isikoff : ' A New Cheney - Gonzales Mystery ' RAW STORY
Published : Sunday June 24 , 2007 Print This Email This Michael Isikoff is reporting " a new Cheney - Gonzales mystery " in the current issue of Newsweek .
It has recently become known that Cheney 's office has refused to comply with an executive order requiring annual reports on security measures , claiming that the vice president is not part of the executive branch .
The government official responsible for enforcing the order , J. William Leonard , complained about this last January to Attorney General Gonzales , asking for an official ruling , but he never received a response .
Isikoff asks , " Why did n't Gonzales act on Leonard 's request ?
His aides assured reporters that Leonard 's letter has been ' under review ' for the past five months by Justice 's Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) .
But on June 4 , an OLC lawyer denied a Freedom of Information Act request about the Cheney dispute asserting that OLC had ' no documents ' on the matter , according to a copy of the letter obtained by NEWSWEEK .
Steve Aftergood , the Federation of American Scientists researcher who filed the request , said he found the denial letter ' puzzling and inexplicable 'especially since Leonard had copied OLC chief Steve Bradbury on his original letter to Gonzales . "
Congressional investigators have now become interested in the matter , according to Isikoff , and Rep. Henry Waxman has told Newsweek that he plans to investigate the Justice Department 's handling of the issue .

A study of the “ miraculous ” recovery of a man who spent 19 years in a minimally conscious state has revealed the likely cause of his regained consciousness .
The findings suggest the human brain shows far greater potential for recovery and regeneration then ever suspected .
It may also help doctors predict their patients ’ chances of improvement .
But the studies also highlight gross inadequacies in the system for diagnosing and caring for patients in vegetative or minimally conscious states .
In 1984 , 19 - year - old Terry Wallis was thrown from his pick - up truck during an accident near his home in Massachusetts , US .
He was found 24 hours later in a coma with massive brain injuries .
Within a few weeks he had stabilised in a minimally conscious state , which his doctors thought would last indefinitely .
It did indeed persist for 19 years .
Then , in 2003 , he started to speak .
Advertisement
Over a three day period , Wallis regained the ability to move and communicate , and started getting to know his now 20 year old daughter – a difficult process considering he believed himself to be 19 , and that Ronald Reagan was still president .
Brain rewiring
To try and find out what was going on inside Wallis ’s brain , Nicholas Schiff and colleagues from the Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York City , used a new brain imaging technique called diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) .
The system tracks water molecules and so reveals the brain ’s white matter tracts – akin to a wiring diagram .
They combined this with more traditional PET scanning , to show which brain areas were active .
The team ’s findings suggest that Wallis ’s brain had , very gradually , developed new pathways and completely novel anatomical structures to re-establish functional connections , compensating for the brain pathways lost in the accident .
They found that new axons – the branches that connect neurons together – seemed to have grown , establishing novel working brain circuits .
Surprisingly , the circuits look nothing like normal brain anatomy .
A lot of the damage had been to axons that passed from one side of the brain to the other , torn by the force of the accident .
But Schiff says that new connections seem to have grown across around the back of the brain , forming structures that do not exist in normal brains .
Neural plasticity
There were also significant changes between scans taken just two months after the recovery , and the most recent , at 18 months .
Some of the new pathways had receded again , while others seem to have strengthened and taken over as Wallis continued to improve .
Krish Sathian , a neurologist and specialist in brain rehabilitation at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta , US , describes it as an amazing finding .
“ The bounds on the possible extent of neural plasticity just keep on shifting , ” he says .
“ Classical teaching would not have predicted any of these changes . ”
Knowing the mechanism will be important for identifying whether a particular unconscious patient could improve , says Schiff , potentially allowing doctors to target their rehabilitation efforts .
Family appeals
But improvements in the care of patients could be made without putting every patient into a brain scanner , says Schiff .
There is currently no system for even a bedside re-examination from 8 weeks after an initial diagnosis , despite the fact that “ their whole prognosis might change ” , he says .
Wallis was frequently classified as being in a permanent vegetative state .
Though his family fought for a re-evaluation after seeing many promising signs that he was trying to communicate , their requests were turned down .
“ A careful bedside examination at 6 months [ after the accident ] would have unequivocally said he was not in a vegetative state , ” says Schiff .
There is a much greater chance of a late recovery from a minimally conscious state , he adds , although such recoveries are still rare .
“ The Wallis case will force the issue , ” he believes .
Dutch police believe a Nigerian man who was arrested at Schiphol Airport a couple of weeks ago with € 1.2 m in his pocket - the biggest money seizure in Dutch history - belongs to a major 419 scam operation .
According to Dutch police Idowu Musiliu Balogun , 36 , works for ringleader U. Kingsley , who is still at large .
Kingsley and his band of confidence tricksters recently plundered a dozen or so German companies for € 4m .
Balogun and Kingsley were arrested two years ago in Nigeria for selling a house in the US without the knowledge of the owner .
Both men had gained access to a mailbox of a US businessman and then instructed an estate agent to sell his house and transfer the money to their own account .
Another victim from Limburg in the Netherlands was lured into a classic advance fee scheme , with promises of lottery winnings or an inheritance .
Lawyer Theo Hiddema told the Dutch daily Telegraaf that his client " is just a Nigerian businessman who visited Holland to buy trucks , but unfortunately his business partner did n't turn up " .
However , Hiddema had to admit that if the accusations bear any merit “ the case can get complicated . " ®
“ Every fall we discover that a few families have lost it over the summer and are camping out in the woods , ” Ms. Miller said .
“ So we help them find some kind of housing in town . ”

Above the fog line and below the snow line , with herds of elk in the surrounding hills , the town offers a peaceful beauty , and residents say it is a perfect place to live , except for the lack of jobs .
Today , a latte - serving cafe caters to mountain bikers and travelers on their way to a ski slope or parts farther west .
A few new fast - food outlets are interspersed with graying motels and empty storefronts .
Former workers fondly recall how the town ’s 10 bars were mobbed every payday ; now , a few old - timers gather in one of three tired bars and a dingy Moose Lodge , needing little prompting to carp about the Forest Service and environmentalists .
Oakridge has struggled to find a new economic base .
On the edge of town , where the old Pope and Talbot mill burned down in 1991 , an industrial park was created , but it is covered largely with weeds .
The town has authorized water and sewer services for up to 200 prime home sites in the hills above , and it hopes to attract retirees and commuters from the Eugene area , said Don Hampton , a City Council member .
Along with a growing trade in outdoor recreation , becoming a distant bedroom and retirement community may be the town ’s best hope , bringing tax revenue and service jobs , though it is not clear how much opportunity this will offer ambitious young people .
“ There ’s no substitute for having a payroll , ” said Dan Rehwalt , 77 , who worked for decades as a machinist with lumber mills and the railroad .

It 's short and sweet , and reproduced in stunning HTML here :
S 2725 IS 109th CONGRESS 2d Session S. 2725
To amend the Fair Labor Standards
Act of 1938 to provide for an increase in the Federal minimum wage and to ensure that increases in the Federal minimum wage keep pace with any pay adjustments for Members of Congress .
IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES May 4 , 2006 Mrs. CLINTON ( for herself , Mr. KENNEDY , Mr. JEFFORDS , Mr. LEAHY , Mr. HARKIN , and Mr. OBAMA ) introduced the following bill ; which was read twice and referred to the Committee on Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions < hr > A BILL To amend the Fair Labor Standards

My first though , " Good for her ! "
My second thought , " Wow , must be an election year ! "
My third thought , " .. that 's going to do something bad to the economy , somehow . "
My fourth was sort of an untypable grunt and my fifth was , " I need coffee , where are my pants ? "
It should be noted that a few states already have minimum wages in place that exceed the Federal minimum wage , and Oregon ( $ 7.50 ) and Washington ( $ 7.63 ) are the only states that currently have a minimum wage that exceed Clinton 's proposed wage .
Alaska 's wage , currently at $ 7.15 , automatically adjusts to at least $ 1 above federal minimum wage .
Some cities also have even higher minimum wages , such as Sante Fe ( $ 9.50 ) , all of which would not be affected dramatically by the sudden increase in wages .

Poll : 69 percent oppose pardon for Libby in CIA leak case
I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby leaves a Washington courthouse after being convicted in the CIA leak case last Tuesday .
Just 18 percent said they would support a pardon for Libby , the former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney , while 69 percent said they opposed the idea .
Meanwhile , a narrow majority said they believe Cheney was part of a cover - up in the case .
The new poll was conducted for CNN by Opinion Research Corp. between Friday and Sunday .
Pollsters quizzed 1,027 adults for the survey , which had a sampling error of 3 percentage points .
President Bush 's job approval rating increased slightly , rising to 37 percent from the 34 percent he received in the earlier poll .
Cheney 's approval rating in the survey fell from 39 percent in a January poll to 34 percent in the latest survey , while 54 percent said they disapproved of the vice president 's job performance .
Though he has a lengthy resume in Republican administrations dating back to Gerald Ford 's presidency , 60 percent of those polled said they did not consider him qualified to serve as president should it become necessary ; only 32 percent said he would be qualified to lead the country himself .
And asked whether the vice president was " part of a cover - up " to keep special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald from learning who leaked the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson , whose husband had become a critic of the war in Iraq , 52 percent said yes ; 29 percent said no .
Another 20 percent had no opinion .

Tornado disaster victims ask , ' Where 's FEMA ?'
David Edwards and Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday March 7 , 2007 Print This Email This
Days after tornadoes devastated their town , citizens in Hope , Arkansas are crying out that they still has not received help from FEMA , the federal government 's emergency management agency .
As 8,000 government mobile homes sit unused only 160 miles away , FEMA says it can't employ them until the tornado - ravaged area is declared a federal disaster area , CNN reports .
As that has yet to happen , the trailers sit idle .
" It 's unacceptable , it 's reprehensible , and it's a symbol of what 's wrong with FEMA , " says Rep. Mike Ross ( D - AR ) , who later announced in a press release that a Congressional hearing is to be held on the lack of federal response to the tornadoes .
The carnival floats in parades through the region 's cities traditionally take an irreverent look at world events , but the Central Council of Muslims in Germany condemned one float in Düsseldorf which featured fiberglass models of two bearded men wearing turbans and explosives belts and brandishing guns .
The word " Cliche " was printed on one of the men , while the other bore the word " Reality . "
The depiction of Islam was " barefaced lies " and the float was " using negative images to seek attention , " the Central Council 's secretary general Aiman Mazyek told Tuesday 's edition of the Westdeutsche Zeitung daily .
Mazyek said he asked himself what the float was meant to signal .
" This is how I read the message : ' We love our prejudices and we strengthen them with blatant lies if necessary , ' " Mazyek told the paper .
" It has nothing to do with humor , " he added .
Carnival back to satirical themes
Organizers of the festivities in the carnival centers of Cologne , Düsseldorf and Mainz had promised a return to satirical themes this year after a relatively restrained showing in 2006 in the wake of the controversy over the publication by a Danish newspaper of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed .
French presidential candidates Sarkozy and Royal depicted as boxing cockerels
Cologne played host to the main parade , with 99 floats edging through the city , cheered on by hundreds of thousands of revellers in costume and wearing wigs .
One float in Cologne showed US President George W. Bush being spanked by the Statue of Liberty while another depicted French presidential candidates Segolene Royal and Nicolas Sarkozy as boxing cockerels .
Carnival is a tradition stemming from Catholic regions in the west and south of Germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east .
The processions take place on what is known as Rose Monday , although opinions differ on the origin of the term .
Some say it is derived from the word " rhosen " from the Rhineland dialect , meaning dashing or romping .
Others link it to Rose Sunday , so - called since the Middle Ages because the pope traditionally presented a golden rose to a worthy citizen on that day .

Volatile variables in the Java language can be thought of as " synchronized lite " ; they require less coding to use than synchronized blocks and often have less runtime overhead , but they can only be used to do a subset of the things that synchronized can .
This article presents some patterns for using volatile variables effectively -- and some warnings about when not to use them .
Locks offer two primary features : mutual exclusion and visibility .
Mutual exclusion means that only one thread at a time may hold a given lock , and this property can be used to implement protocols for coordinating access to shared data such that only one thread at a time will be using the shared data .
Visibility is more subtle and has to do with ensuring that changes made to shared data prior to releasing a lock are made visible to another thread that subsequently acquires that lock -- without the visibility guarantees provided by synchronization , threads could see stale or inconsistent values for shared variables , which could cause a host of serious problems .
Volatile variables
Volatile variables share the visibility features of synchronized , but none of the atomicity features .
This means that threads will automatically see the most up - to - date value for volatile variables .
They can be used to provide thread safety , but only in a very restricted set of cases : those that do not impose constraints between multiple variables or between a variable 's current value and its future values .
So volatile alone is not strong enough to implement a counter , a mutex , or any class that has invariants that relate multiple variables ( such as " start < =end " ) .
You might prefer to use volatile variables instead of locks for one of two principal reasons : simplicity or scalability .
Some idioms are easier to code and read when they use volatile variables instead of locks .
In addition , volatile variables ( unlike locks ) cannot cause a thread to block , so they are less likely to cause scalability problems .
In situations where reads greatly outnumber writes , volatile variables may also provide a performance advantage over locking .
Conditions for correct use of volatile
You can use volatile variables instead of locks only under a restricted set of circumstances .
Both of the following criteria must be met for volatile variables to provide the desired thread - safety :
Writes to the variable do not depend on its current value .
The variable does not participate in invariants with other variables .
Basically , these conditions state that the set of valid values that can be written to a volatile variable is independent of any other program state , including the variable 's current state .
The first condition disqualifies volatile variables from being used as thread - safe counters .
While the increment operation ( x++ ) may look like a single operation , it is really a compound read - modify - write sequence of operations that must execute atomically -- and volatile does not provide the necessary atomicity .
Correct operation would require that the value of x stay unchanged for the duration of the operation , which cannot be achieved using volatile variables .
( However , if you can arrange that the value is only ever written from a single thread , then you can ignore the first condition . )
Most programming situations will fall afoul of either the first or second condition , making volatile variables a less commonly applicable approach to achieving thread - safety than synchronized .
Listing 1 shows a non -thread - safe number range class .
It contains an invariant -- that the lower bound is always less than or equal to the upper bound .
Listing 1 . Non -thread - safe number range class
@NotThreadSafe public class NumberRange { private int lower , upper ; public int getLower ( ) { return lower ; } public int getUpper ( ) { return upper ; } public void setLower ( int value ) { if ( value > upper ) throw new IllegalArgumentException ( ... ) ; lower = value ; } public void setUpper ( int value ) { if ( value < lower ) throw new IllegalArgumentException ( ... ) ; upper = value ; } }
Because the state variables of the range are constrained in this manner , making the lower and upper fields volatile would not be sufficient to make the class thread - safe ; synchronization would still be needed .
Otherwise , with some unlucky timing , two threads executing setLower and setUpper with inconsistent values could leave the range in an inconsistent state .
For example , if the initial state is ( 0 , 5 ) , and thread A calls setLower ( 4 ) at the same time that thread B calls setUpper ( 3 ) , and the operations are interleaved just wrong , both could pass the checks that are supposed to protect the invariant and end up with the range holding ( 4 , 3 ) -- an invalid value .
We need to make the setLower ( ) and setUpper ( ) operations atomic with respect to other operations on the range -- and making the fields volatile can't do this for us .
Performance considerations
The primary motivation for using volatile variables is simplicity :
In some situations , using a volatile variable is just simpler than using the corresponding locking .
A secondary motivation for using volatile variables is performance :
In some situations , volatile variables may be a better - performing synchronization mechanism than locking .
It is exceedingly difficult to make accurate , general statements of the form " X is always faster than Y , " especially when it comes to intrinsic JVM operations .
( For example , the VM may be able to remove locking entirely in some situations , which makes it hard to talk about the relative cost of volatile vs. synchronized in the abstract . )
That said , on most current processor architectures , volatile reads are cheap -- nearly as cheap as nonvolatile reads .
Volatile writes are considerably more expensive than nonvolatile writes because of the memory fencing required to guarantee visibility but still generally cheaper than lock acquisition .
Unlike locking , volatile operations will never block , so volatiles offer some scalability advantages over locking in the cases where they can be used safely .
In cases where reads greatly outnumber writes , volatile variables can often reduce the performance cost of synchronization compared to locking .
Patterns for using volatile correctly
Many concurrency experts tend to guide users away from using volatile variables at all , because they are harder to use correctly than locks .
However , some well - defined patterns exist , which , if you follow them carefully , can be used safely in a wide variety of situations .
Always keep in mind the rules about the limits of where volatile can be used -- only use volatile for state that is truly independent of everything else in your program -- and this should keep you from trying to extend these patterns into dangerous territory .
Pattern # 1 : status flags
Perhaps the canonical use of volatile variables is simple boolean status flags , indicating that an important one - time life - cycle event has happened , such as initialization has completed or shutdown has been requested .
Many applications include a control construct of the form , " While we 're not ready to shut down , do more work , " as shown in Listing 2 :
Listing 2 .
Using a volatile variable as a status flag
volatile boolean shutdownRequested ; ... public void shutdown ( ) { shutdownRequested = true ; } public void doWork ( ) { while (! shutdownRequested ) { // do stuff } }
It is likely that the shutdown ( ) method is going to be called from somewhere outside the loop -- in another thread -- and as such , some form of synchronization is required to ensure the proper visibility of the shutdownRequested variable .
( It might be called from a JMX listener , an action listener in the GUI event thread , through RMI , through a Web service , and so on . )
However , coding the loop with synchronized blocks would be much more cumbersome than coding it with a volatile status flag as in Listing 2 .
Because volatile simplifies the coding , and the status flag does not depend on any other state in the program , this is a good use for volatile .
One common characteristic of status flags of this type is that there is typically only one state transition ; the shutdownRequested flag goes from false to true and then the program shuts down .
This pattern can be extended to state flags that can change back and forth , but only if it is acceptable for a transition cycle ( from false to true to false ) to go undetected .
Otherwise , some sort of atomic state transition mechanism is needed , such as atomic variables .
Pattern # 2 : one - time safe publication
The visibility failures that are possible in the absence of synchronization can get even trickier to reason about when writing to object references instead of primitive values .
In the absence of synchronization , it is possible to see an up - to - date value for an object reference that was written by another thread and still see stale values for that object 's state .
( This hazard is the root of the problem with the infamous double - checked - locking idiom , where an object reference is read without synchronization , and the risk is that you could see an up - to - date reference but still observe a partially constructed object through that reference . )
One technique for safely publishing an object is to make the object reference volatile .
Listing 3 shows an example where during startup , a background thread loads some data from a database .
Other code , when it might be able to make use of this data , checks to see if it has been published before trying to use it .
Listing 3 .
Using a volatile variable for safe one - time publication
public class BackgroundFloobleLoader { public volatile Flooble the Flooble ; public void initInBackground ( ) { // do lots of stuff the Flooble = new Flooble ( ) ; // this is the only write to the Flooble } } public class SomeOtherClass { public void doWork ( ) { while ( true ) { // do some stuff ... // use the Flooble , but only if it is ready if ( floobleLoader.theFlooble != null ) doSomething ( floobleLoader.theFlooble ) ; } } }
Without the the Flooble reference being volatile , the code in doWork ( ) would be at risk for seeing a partially constructed Flooble as it dereferences the the Flooble reference .
A key requirement for this pattern is that the object being published must either be thread - safe or effectively immutable ( effectively immutable means that its state is never modified after its publication ) .
The volatile reference may guarantee the visibility of the object in its as - published form , but if the state of the object is going to change after publication , then additional synchronization is required .
Pattern # 3 : independent observations
Another simple pattern for safely using volatile is when observations are periodically " published " for consumption within the program .
For example , say there is an environmental sensor that senses the current temperature .
A background thread might read this sensor every few seconds and update a volatile variable containing the current temperature .
Then , other threads can read this variable knowing that they will always see the most up - to - date value .
Another application for this pattern is gathering statistics about the program .
Listing 4 shows how an authentication mechanism might remember the name of the last user to have logged on .
The lastUser reference will be repeatedly used to publish a value for consumption by the rest of the program .
Listing 4 .
Using a volatile variable for multiple publications of independent observations
public class UserManager { public volatile String lastUser ; public boolean authenticate ( String user , String password ) { boolean valid = password IsValid( user , password ) ; if ( valid ) { User u = new User ( ) ; activeUsers.add( u ) ; lastUser = user ; } return valid ; } }
This pattern is an extension of the previous one ; a value is being published for use elsewhere within the program , but instead of publication being a one - time event , it is a series of independent events .
This pattern requires that the value being published be effectively immutable -- that its state not change after publication .
Code consuming the value should be aware that it might change at any time .
Pattern # 4 : the " volatile bean " pattern
The volatile bean pattern is applicable in frameworks that use JavaBeans as " glorified structs . "
In the volatile bean pattern , a JavaBean is used as a container for a group of independent properties with getters and / or setters .
The rationale for the volatile bean pattern is that many frameworks provide containers for mutable data holders ( for instance , HttpSession ) , but the objects placed in those containers must be thread safe .
In the volatile bean pattern , all the data members of the JavaBean are volatile , and the getters and setters must be trivial -- they must contain no logic other than getting or setting the appropriate property .
Further , for data members that are object references , the referred - to objects must be effectively immutable .
( This prohibits having array - valued properties , as when an array reference is declared volatile , only the reference , not the elements themselves , have volatile semantics . )
As with any volatile variable , there may be no invariants or constraints involving the properties of the JavaBean .
An example of a JavaBean obeying the volatile bean pattern is shown in Listing 5 :
Listing 5 . A Person object obeying the volatile bean pattern
@ ThreadSafe public class Person { private volatile String firstName ; private volatile String lastName ; private volatile int age ; public String getFirstName ( ) { return firstName ; } public String getLastName ( ) { return lastName ; } public int getAge ( ) { return age ; } public void setFirstName ( String firstName ) { this .
firstName = firstName ; } public void setLastName ( String lastName ) { this .
lastName = lastName ; } public void setAge ( int age ) { this .age = age ; } }
Advanced patterns for volatile
The patterns in the previous section cover most of the basic cases where the use of volatile is sensible and straightforward .
This section looks at a more advanced pattern where volatile might offer a performance or scalability benefit .
The more advanced patterns for using volatile can be extremely fragile .
It is critical that your assumptions be carefully documented and these patterns strongly encapsulated because very small changes can break your code !
Also , given that the primary motivation for the more advanced volatile use cases is performance , be sure that you actually have a demonstrated need for the purported performance gain before you start applying them .
These patterns are trade - offs that give up readability or maintainability in exchange for a possible performance boost -- if you do n't need the performance boost ( or ca n't prove you need it through a rigorous measurement program ) , then it is probably a bad trade because you 're giving up something of value and getting something of lesser value in return .
Pattern # 5 : The cheap read - write lock trick
By now , it should be well - known that volatile is not strong enough to implement a counter .
Because ++x is really shorthand for three operations ( read , add , store ) , with some unlucky timing it is possible for updates to be lost if multiple threads tried to increment a volatile counter at once .
However , if reads greatly outnumber modifications , you can combine intrinsic locking and volatile variables to reduce the cost on the common code path .
Listing 6 shows a thread - safe counter that uses synchronized to ensure that the increment operation is atomic and uses volatile to guarantee the visibility of the current result .
If updates are infrequent , this approach may perform better as the overhead on the read path is only a volatile read , which is generally cheaper than an uncontended lock acquisition .
Listing 6 . Combining volatile and synchronized to form a " cheap read - write lock "
@ ThreadSafe public class CheesyCounter { //
Employs the cheap read - write lock trick //
All mutative operations MUST be done with the ' this ' lock held @ GuardedBy ( " this " ) private volatile int value ; public int getValue ( ) { return value ; } public synchronized int increment ( ) { return value ++ ; } }
The reason this technique is called the " cheap read - write lock " is that you are using different synchronization mechanisms for reads and writes .
Because the writes in this case violate the first condition for using volatile , you cannot use volatile to safely implement the counter -- you must use locking .
However , you can use volatile to ensure the visibility of the current value when reading , so you use locking for all mutative operations and volatile for read - only operations .
Where locks only allow one thread to access a value at once , volatile reads allow more than one , so when you use volatile to guard the read code path , you get a higher degree of sharing than you would were you to use locking for all code paths -- just like a read - write lock .
However , bear in mind the fragility of this pattern :
With two competing synchronization mechanisms , this can get very tricky if you branch out beyond the most basic application of this pattern .
Summary
Volatile variables are a simpler -- but weaker -- form of synchronization than locking , which in some cases offers better performance or scalability than intrinsic locking .
If you follow the conditions for using volatile safely -- that the variable is truly independent of both other variables and its own prior values -- you can sometimes simplify code by using volatile instead of synchronized .
However , code using volatile is often more fragile than code using locking .
The patterns offered here cover the most common cases where volatile is a sensible alternative to synchronized .
Following these patterns -- taking care not to push them beyond their limits -- should help you safely cover the majority of cases where volatile variables are a win .

Google ’s ambition to maximise the personal information it holds on users is so great that the search engine envisages a day when it can tell people what jobs to take and how they might spend their days off .
Eric Schmidt , Google ’s chief executive , said gathering more personal data was a key way for Google to expand and the company believes that is the logical extension of its stated mission to organise the world ’s information .
Asked how Google might look in five years ’ time , Mr Schmidt said : “ We are very early in the total information we have within Google .
The algorithms will get better and we will get better at personalisation .
“ The goal is to enable Google users to be able to ask the question such as ‘ What shall I do tomorrow ? ’ and ‘ What job shall I take ? ’ ”
The race to accumulate the most comprehensive database of individual information has become the new battleground for search engines as it will allow the industry to offer far more personalised advertisements .
These are the holy grail for the search industry , as such advertising would command higher rates .
Mr Schmidt told journalists in London : “ We can not even answer the most basic questions because we do n’t know enough about you .
That is the most important aspect of Google ’s expansion . ”
He said Google ’s newly relaunched iGoogle service , which allows users to personalise their own Google search page and publish their own content , would be a key feature .
Another service , Google personalised search , launched two years ago , allows users to give Google permission to store their web - surfing history , what they have searched and clicked on , and use this to create more personalised search results for them .
Another service under development is Google Recommendations – where the search suggests products and services the user might like , based on their already established preferences .
Google does not sell advertising against these services yet , but could in time use them to display more targeted ads to people .
Yahoo unveiled a new search technology this year – which monitors what internet users do on its portal , and use that information to build a profile of their interests .
The profiles are then used to display ads to the people most likely to be interested in them .
The technology will be incorporated into Yahoo ’s advertising revamped advertising system dubbed Project Panama .
Autonomy , the UK - based search company is also developing technology for “ transaction hijacking ” , which monitors when internet surfers are about to make a purchase online , and can suggest cheaper alternatives .
Although such monitoring could raise privacy issues , Google stresses that the iGoogle and personalisation services are optional .
The Information Commissioner ’s Office in the UK said it was not concerned about the personalisation developments .
Earlier this year , however , Google bowed to concerns from privacy activists in the US and Europe , by agreeing to limit the amount of time it keeps information about the internet searches made by its users to two years .
Google has also faced concerns that its proposed $ 3.1 bn acquisition of DoubleClick will lead to an erosion of online privacy .
Fears have been stoked by the potential for Google to build up a detailed picture of someone ’s behaviour by combining its records of web searches with the information from DoubleClick ’s “ cookies ” , the software it places on users ’ machines to track which sites they visit .
Mr Schmidt said this year that the company was working on technology to reduce concerns .
‘ Why the onslaught ? ’
Conservative activist / writer Dinesh D’Souza has , for some reason , apparently been criticized for blaming the left for the terrorists ’ hatred of the United States in general , and 9/11 in specific .
Apparently , it ’s all about the culture .
As D’Souza explains it , Osama bin Laden and other dangerous Islamic radicals believe the U.S. is too secular , too permissive , too diverse , too free , and too tolerant … and D’Souza believes they ’re absolutely right .
Therefore , logically , the left invites attacks by reinforcing the beliefs al Qaeda has about the United States .
The answer , apparently , is to shift our culture to the right , appease the terrorists , and stay safe .
After this jaw - dropping , book - length argument drew criticism , D’Souza took to the Washington Post to defend himself .
[ I ] n my recent appearance on Comedy Central ’s “ The Colbert Report , ” I had to fend off the insistent host .
“ But you agree with the Islamic radicals , do n’t you ? ” Stephen Colbert asked again and again .
Why the onslaught ?
Just this :
In my book , published this month , I argue that the American left bears a measure of responsibility for the volcano of anger from the Muslim world that produced the 9/11 attacks .
First , Stephen Colbert did ask the question “ again and again , ” right up until D’Souza answered it — by acknowledging that he agrees with some of the things radical Islamic extremists are against in America .
The problem was n’t that the interviewer was incessant ; it ’s that D’Souza admitted that he was sympathetic to terrorists ’ cultural critique of the United States .
Second , D’Souza does more than just argue that the left “ bears a measure of responsibility . ”
He actually insists that the left is the “ primary cause of the volcano of anger toward America that is erupting from the Islamic world . ”
It ’s a little late to backpedal now , Dinesh .
If you wanted to soften the argument , you should have started before the book was published .
In his WaPo piece , D’Souza , apparently feeling a little sorry for himself , said the response to his idea has been “ a little hysterical . ”
I ’m having a hard time trying to imagine what kind of response D’Souza expected .
He wrote what has accurately been described as a “ sleazy , shameless , ignorant , ahistorical , tendentious , meretricious lie , ” which blames Americans for terrorists ’ hatred , and recommends doing more to appease those who want to kill us .
How , exactly , are reasonable people supposed to react to such transparent lunacy ?
Did D’Souza expect to be invited to Harvard to host a symposium on how evil modern America is ?
If D’Souza wanted to be embraced as a serious person with a credible thesis , he should have written a serious book with a credible thesis .
Ridiculous screeds tend not to go over particularly well .
The fact that D’Souza is surprised suggests he ’s even less in touch with reality than his book indicated .
D’Souza seems particularly sensitive about his patriotism .
… I feel silly having to say it : I do n’t hate America .
My last book was called “ What ’s So Great About America , ” and there is no question mark in the title .
If I hated this country , why would I have left my family and friends in India and moved to the United States , married an American and become a U.S. citizen ?
I came here because the United States gives me the freedom to make the life that I could not have made in India .
D’Souza ’s obviously confused .
You can love America , but if you hate Americans , describe them as quite literally “ the enemy , ” and insist they change in order to appease terrorists , your patriotism might be suspect .
Just a thought .
Ahead of expected fuel duty protests , Mr Brown told the TUC Opec countries to produce more oil and refine more .
He said it was a " global challenge " which needed " global solutions " .
But France is to offer fuel tax rebates to farmers and retailers in Austria have cut prices after being threatened with a one - off tax on profits .
' More investment needed '
Belgium , Poland and Hungary have also announced measures to cushion the impact of rising prices on consumers .
Mr Brown called for more worldwide investment in refineries and alternative energies .
He said he understood " the problems being faced by hauliers , farmers and motorists , by ordinary consumers across the country faced with gas and electricity bills at a time of this doubling of oil prices " .

However , Shadow Transport Secretary Alan Duncan accused Mr Brown of laying the blame for his own problems " at the feet of the Arabs " .

Panic - buying
Fuel protesters angry at increases in the price of petrol and diesel plan to stage three days of protests this week .
Although they have urged motorists not to panic - buy fuel , there have been long queues reported at some petrol stations over the past 24 hours .
In 2000 , blockades of oil refineries caused widespread shortages .
But the government and the oil industry say they have taken steps to ensure protests do not have the same effect .
Mr Brown said price rises were a risk to the world economy and said he had held talks with the finance ministers of all the world 's major economies .
Queues have been building up at some petrol stations
He is calling for 500,000 extra barrels of oil a day to be produced by Opec , the association of oil - exporting nations .
He is also pushing oil - producing nations to divert their current windfall into funding more production and refining facilities .
At the same time , Mr Brown wants more effort put into finding greener alternatives , with the World Bank to set up a fund to help developing countries do the same .
The IMF should create a fund for poorer countries hit by the rising prices , part - funded by Opec , he said .
Demonstrations
The Fuel Lobby protesters say they will start three days of demonstrations if ministers do not meet them on Tuesday .
The group wants the public to " attend " oil refineries on Wednesday to protest .

Lobby spokesman Andrew Spence said : " We are not calling for a blockade , but if oil companies decide they cannot send out lorries while there is a public presence at their site , then that is a matter for them . "
Sir Jonathan Porritt , chairman of the Sustainable Development Commission , said the last thing the government should do was cut fuel duty .
Fuel prices needed to be kept high to drive changes in consumer behaviour and drive investment in new energy efficiency technology .

Working at the frontier between chemistry and physics , the University of Nebraska - Lincoln 's Xiao Cheng Zeng usually finds his reward in discovering the unexpected through computer modeling .
Zeng and his colleagues regularly find new and often unanticipated behaviors of matter in extreme environments , and those discoveries have been published several times in major international scientific journals .
Their findings , though , have been so far ahead of existing technology that their immediate practical impact was essentially nil -- until now .
Zeng and two members of his UNL team recently found double helixes of ice molecules that resemble the structure of DNA and self - assemble under high pressure inside carbon nanotubes .
This discovery could have major implications for scientists in other fields who study the protein structures that cause diseases such as Alzheimer 's and bovine spongiform ecephalitis ( mad cow disease ) .
It could also help guide those searching for ways to target or direct self - assembly in nanomaterials and predict the kind of ice future astronauts will find on Mars and moons in the solar system .
Zeng , post - doctoral student Jaeil Bai and doctoral candidate Jun Wang reported their findings in the Dec. 11-15 online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Zeng and his colleagues use powerful computers to model how materials behave at the nanoscale ( where measurements are made in billionths of meters ) under extremes of temperature , pressure and confinement .
The team found the self - assembling double helix of nano - ice following a months - long experiment on UNL's Prairie Fire supercomputer .
The experiment was a follow - up on a 2001 discovery through computer modeling by Zeng and another team of four new kinds of one - dimensional ice inside carbon nanotubes .
Scientists elsewhere later confirmed through laboratory experiment the existence of three of the new nano -ices .
One result in particular intrigued Zeng , Bai and Wang .
Scientists at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago confirmed the existence of a chain of octagon - shaped ice crystals inside a 1.4 - nanometer carbon tube , just as Zeng and company expected .
But the Argonne group also found an additional , unexpected chain of water molecules inside the octagon .
Zeng said that report inspired his team to take another look at one - dimensional ice , but this time with a Prairie Fire that was 20 times more powerful that it had been five years earlier .
The 2001 results were achieved at atmospheric pressures , but Prairie Fire 's added processing power enabled Zeng , Bai and Wang to design simulations that greatly increased the pressure on the water molecules .

" We were shocked to see these molecules arrange themselves in this way , " said Zeng , university professor of chemistry .
" We thought it would be like two tubes , one inside the other , but it did n't do that .
It was helical , like DNA .
I 'm just speculating , but maybe the helix is a way for molecules to arrange themselves in a very compact , efficient way under high pressure .
" This ice formation can be viewed as a self - assembling process , and self - assembly is a way for molecules to bond together through weak hydrogen bonds .
One example of a self - assembling material is protein .
Proteins can self - assemble into structures like amyloid fibrils that can build up in the brain to cause Alzheimer 's disease or prions that cause mad cow disease . "
Another implication , Zeng said , is that these self - assembling helical ice structures may give scientists and engineers a different way to think about weak molecular bonds and the self - assembly process as they try to develop ways to direct self - assembly in making new materials .
He said that while scientists have a good understanding of covalent bonds ( the strong type of bonding where atoms share electrons ) , knowledge is not as complete about the weak bond , such as hydrogen bonds , that are essential to the self - assembly process .
In weak bonding , atoms do n't share electrons .
" We 're happy to see potential applications that can maybe advance some fundamental science , " Zeng said .
" We 're not engineers in direct contact with technology , but if our research can make some contribution , we 're happy . "
Zeng and his colleagues achieved their results by running four series of molecular dynamics simulations on PrairieFire and Department of Chemistry computers , using simulated carbon nanotubes ranging in diameter from 1.35 to 1.9 nanometers .
They used Earth - like temperatures ranging from 117 degrees Fahrenheit to 9 degrees below zero F. , but with pressures ranging from 10 to 40,000 atmospheres , with each series lasting no more than a few 10s of nanoseconds .
Most of the experiments produced the expected tubular structures , but in a simulation in a 1.35 - nanometer tube at minus - 9 degrees F. and 40,000 atmospheres , the ice transformed into a braid of double helix that resembles DNA in structure and in the weak bonds between the helixes .
Additionally , in a simulation in a 1.9 - nanometer tube at the same temperature , pressure on the confined liquid water was instantly raised from 10 atmospheres to 8,000 .
The confined liquid froze spontaneously into a high - density , triple - walled helical structure .

Earlier today , when my iPod and my upgraded iTunes 7 got together and decided that my purchased music would really be happier living on a farm upstate with other m4 p's , I did whatever I could to convince the music to come back .
I tried to reverse the polarity on my iPod , and I tried modify the navigational deflector on my Powerbook , without any success .
It also turns out that the isolinear optical chips are only on MacBook Pros , but even if I had them here , Data was too busy laughing at me with his emotion chip to be of any use .
So I opened my hailing frequencies , and sent a subspace message to support at Apple .
Okay , I 'm done with corny Star Trek metaphors . . . but admit it , was n't that fun ?
Though the company was unresponsive last time I contacted them about an iTunes Music Store purchase issue , they responded very quickly this time .
A very kind woman named Kate called me , and told me that she 'd read my blog about my problems with my purchased music .
Wait .
She read my blog ?
Okay .
That 's weird and unexpected , and a stark reminder that , despite my impression that readership has fallen steadily in the last year , people still read my blog .
She said that Apple wants to keep their customers happy , and ensure that they 'll be confident purchasing things from the iTunes Music Store , so she was going to push a Big Red Button that would allow me to have a do over , and download all of my purchased music again , free of charge .
This seemed excessive to me , and way above what would be reasonably expected , but before I could tell her that , she told me that she 'd read on my blog that I did n't expect Apple to treat me any differently than they 'd treat any other customer .
She assured me that this is Apple 's corporate policy , and they 'll do this for anyone who has a catastrophic loss of their iTunes Music Store purchases , regardless of the cause .
I think that 's really cool .
Can you imagine walking into a record store and telling them , " Hey , guys , I lost all my CDs over the weekend .
I know it 's my fault , but . . . can I have some new ones ? "
I think that 's worth mentioning again , in hey - look - at - me bold text :
If you make a purchase from the iTunes Music Store , and something horrible happens and you lose all your music , Apple will give you a one - time only do - over to replace all of your purchased music , free of charge .
E-mail from Apple support was equally helpful .
A woman named Sheila apologized for the inconvenience , and repeated the offer to give me a do - over on my downloads .
She also included some polite advice on the importance of backing up music , and how iTunes 7 makes that easy with just a few clicks .
( It is as easy as they say .
I spanned 10 CDs of Lost episodes and purchased music . )
In retrospect , this was so quickly addressed and fixed by Apple , I 'm a little embarrassed that this turned into such a huge thing , especially once it hit Digg , and became a " let 's attack Apple because we can " thread .
I 'm a Digger , too , and I believe that when the wisdom of the masses becomes the tyranny of the mob , it reflects rather poorly on all of us .
I 'd also like to stop and admire all the schoolyard insults that were hurled my way over there .
It 's reassuring to know that there 's still a place on the Intertubes where people can get in touch with their inner 6th grade bully .
( Oh , it looks like this post hit Digg , too .
Hello again . )
One thing that I want to clarify -- for myself as much as for anyone else who read my blog earlier -- I identified this as a DRM issue because the only files that disappeared were ones that had DRM on them .
After a day 's worth of reflection , however , it 's more accurate to identify it as a backup issue -- which has sort of been addressed by the backup your whole library feature in the new version of iTunes .
I 'm still not crazy about DRM , and I do n't like anything that restricts what I can do with what I purchase .
However , I also believe that artists should profit from their works , and stealing stuff is bad , but I 'm not sure if restrictive DRM is the best way to handle it .
That 's an argument that 's been run into the ground forever , so on that subject , I 'll just say " Abortions for some , tiny American flags for others !
In all seriousness , though , I want to thank Kate and Sheila from Apple for quickly responding to and addressing my problem .
The way you treat a customer once they 're out of the store is even more important than the way you treat them when they 're in the store , and Apple has always taken good care of me , as a customer .
Will I continue to buy things that are DRM - laden ?
If it 's something that 's hard to find and I absolutelymusthaveitrightnowbecauseineedit probably .
But I think I 'll be making physical purchases of CDs more frequently than not from now on .
Also , do n't forget that lots of CDs have incredible design in their packaging .
Tool 's 10,000 Days immediately comes to mind .
I also know that some people who are very much in touch with their inner 6th grader will say that this is just a publicity move , and I 'm a stupid dupe for playing along .
Well , it is good publicity to take care of your customers , and since it turns out that a lot more people than I can fit into my back yard read my blog , I 'm happy to spread the word a little bit .
Part of the autism spectrum disorders , Asperger Syndrome ( AS ) is a type of developmental disorder .
This particular group of neurological conditions is usually accompanied by repetitive thought and behavior patterns and degrees of communication and language impairment .
Unlike most children with autism , Asperger children will retain their early language skills .
Unlike children with Nonverbal Learning Disorder , Asperger children do n’t have a problem with other forms of communication .
They have other types of learning disabilities that include speech as well as other areas .
AS children tend to be very obsessive on a particular object or topic they have interest in and stay fixated on only that .
They will actually know everything there is to know about their topic of fixation and will talk about little else .
In contrast , a child with NLD will know how to verbalize anything to which is being discussed .
Children with Asperger Syndrome tend to have repetitive routines or rituals and have peculiarities in their speech and language .
They have a tendency to be emotionally and socially inappropriate and have difficulties interacting positively with peers .
Many AS children have problems with nonverbal communication , but it is n’t the same as NLD children .
It is n’t that they cannot understand anything other than verbal .
They tend to not be able to see outside of themselves .
They do share the same motor control issues and clumsiness of NLD children , though .
The largest reason for Asperger children ’s isolation is their narrow interests and poor social skills .
Their inappropriate and eccentric behavior can make making new friends hard , even though they will approach others .
Compounded by the obsession on only one topic or interest makes peer socialization limited and may also cause others to withdraw from wanting to play with them .
Many AS children will also experience motor skill developmental delays that make riding a bike , playing on outdoor climbing equipment , or playing catch very hard to learn .
Nonverbal Learning Disorder ( NLD ) , also called Nonverbal Learning Disabilities can often times go undiagnosed and not be noticed well into a child ’s school career , unlike AS .
A child with a nonverbal learning disability cannot understand other forms of communication and has a hard time reading and retaining information .
Because of their extraordinary gift of verbalization they are often thought to be gifted , unlike AS children .
Their disability is not recognized until after a few years in school and sometimes later .
Like AS children , NLD children can have problems relating to peers and do n’t take to change well .
They are capable of playing many types of games and have a variety of interests as long as the rules are repetitive and verbally given .
They tend to also have the same clumsy nature and difficulty in motor skills , especially the finer ones .
Children with Nonverbal Learning Disorder tend to be great in school in the first few grades where constant verbal clues and instruction are given .
Also , during those grades most teachers are actively involved with their students and they are not left to do things on their own .
Once schoolwork becomes more independent as the school years progress , the NLD child will start to loose control of what they know .
They have no idea what to do with out verbal instruction or constant verbal clues .
Reading is not understood and they cannot find where they are just by familiar landmarks .
These children have a hard time retaining learned material and are often late or get lost .
Unlike AS children that might take more time to learn these skills but are capable with much less trouble .
AS children can read and write if they are interested or made to interested in a subject .
It is their solitary interest that holds them back , not inability to process other forms of communication as with NLD children .
NLD children are also labeled as disruptive , rude , lazy , and difficult .
This not true they actually work hard and try to learn as much as possible but their disability robs them of the ability to comprehend anything nonverbal .
AS children have been labeled the same but their difficulty lies in their inability to see beyond the one interest they have .
So their concentration leaves and they cannot stay focused .
There are many similarities between NLD and AS , but there are several differences .
They may appear outwardly similar but the underlying issues that cause them are very different and they require a totally different set of treatments for rehabilitation .
It 's a trait often requested in lonely hearts ads and scientists have now shown that a good sense of humour is important for women , but not men , in choosing a romantic partner .
A woman is even willing to overlook other shortcomings in a man if he can make her laugh , North American researchers say in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior " Our results suggest that humour can positively affect desirability as a relationship partner but this effect is most likely to occur when men use humour and are evaluated by women , " says Dr Eric Bressler , an assistant professor at Westfield State College in Massachusetts Bressler and Canadian researcher Dr Sigal Balshine , an assistant professor at McMaster University in Ontario , demonstrated in an experiment that a good sense of humour , or GSOH as it appears in personal ads , does make a difference .
They showed groups of women pictures of two equally attractive men and presented autobiographical statements that were either funny or serious .
After reversing the experiment and showing groups of men photographs of two women , they asked both sexes to select who they would choose as a romantic partner .
The humorous people were seen as more socially adept but less trustworthy , honest and intelligent .
Men did not select the funny person but women did .
" Women chose funny men as relationship partners despite often rating them as less honest and intelligent , " the researchers say .
Funny men were preferred even if their humour was unsophisticated , the researchers add .

Facebook LONDON ( AP )  New " landmark " research finds that alcohol and tobacco are more dangerous than some illegal drugs like marijuana or Ecstasy and should be classified as such in legal systems , according to a new British study .
In research published Friday in The Lancet magazine , Professor David Nutt of Britain 's Bristol University and colleagues proposed a new framework for the classification of harmful substances , based on the actual risks posed to society .
Their ranking listed alcohol and tobacco among the top 10 most dangerous substances .
Nutt and colleagues used three factors to determine the harm associated with any drug : the physical harm to the user , the drug 's potential for addiction , and the impact on society of drug use .
The researchers asked two groups of experts — psychiatrists specializing in addiction and legal or police officials with scientific or medical expertise — to assign scores to 20 different drugs , including heroin , cocaine , Ecstasy , amphetamines , and LSD .
Nutt and his colleagues then calculated the drugs ' overall rankings .
In the end , the experts agreed with each other — but not with the existing British classification of dangerous substances .
Heroin and cocaine were ranked most dangerous , followed by barbiturates and street methadone .
Alcohol was the fifth - most harmful drug and tobacco the ninth most harmful .
Cannabis came in 11th , and near the bottom of the list was Ecstasy .
According to existing British and U.S. drug policy , alcohol and tobacco are legal , while cannabis and Ecstasy are both illegal .
Previous reports , including a study from a parliamentary committee last year , have questioned the scientific rationale for Britain 's drug classification system .
" The current drug system is ill thought - out and arbitrary , " said Nutt , referring to the United Kingdom 's practice of assigning drugs to three distinct divisions , ostensibly based on the drugs ' potential for harm .
" The exclusion of alcohol and tobacco from the Misuse of Drugs Act is , from a scientific perspective , arbitrary , " write Nutt and his colleagues in The Lancet .
Tobacco causes 40 % of all hospital illnesses , while alcohol is blamed for more than half of all visits to hospital emergency rooms .
The substances also harm society in other ways , damaging families and occupying police services .
Nutt hopes that the research will provoke debate within the U.K. and beyond about how drugs — including socially acceptable drugs such as alcohol — should be regulated .
While different countries use different markers to classify dangerous drugs , none use a system like the one proposed by Nutt 's study , which he hopes could serve as a framework for international authorities .
" This is a landmark paper , " said Leslie Iversen , professor of pharmacology at Oxford University .
Iversen was not connected to the research .
" It is the first real step towards an evidence - based classification of drugs . "
He added that based on the paper 's results , alcohol and tobacco could not reasonably be excluded .
" The rankings also suggest the need for better regulation of the more harmful drugs that are currently legal , i.e. tobacco and alcohol , " wrote Wayne Hall , of the University of Queensland in Brisbane , Australia , in an accompanying Lancet commentary .
Hall was not involved with Nutt 's paper .
While experts agreed that criminalizing alcohol and tobacco would be challenging , they said that governments should review the penalties imposed for drug abuse and try to make them more reflective of the actual risks and damages involved .
Nutt called for more education so that people were aware of the risks of various drugs .
" All drugs are dangerous , " he said .
" Even the ones people know and love and use every day . "

いいロボットボイスをきいていると、あとでまたすぐ何かいいのがきいてみたくなりますね。それに、ふしぎなくらい時間がはやくたっていって、日曜の午後など、おや、もう夕方になってしまったのかと思うことが、よくあるのではないでしょうか。
というのは嘘。（JJおじさんごめんなさい）ひとくちにロボットボイスといっても、種類はいろいろ。テクノポップでおなじみのヴォコーダー、西海岸系でおなじみのトーキングボックス（トーキング・モジュレーター）、近年のポップスで多用されまくっているオートチューンによるピッチ補正、Text To Speechに代表される音声合成による人工的な音声などなど...今回はYouTubeの映像を見ながら、こういった様々なロボットボイスの勉強をしてみましょう。
※なんつって適当な知識なので間違ってる部分も結構ありそう。やさしくツッコミいれていただけるとよろこびますワン！（犬）
■ Vocoder
シンセサイザーで生成した音と、人間の声を合成するのがヴォコーダー（VOCODER）。テクノロジーについてつっこんだ話をすると難しくなりがちだけれど、ヴォコーダーについてはとても面白い原理でなので、簡単に説明します。
実際にしゃべる時、僕たちの身体の中で何がおこっているかというと、まず声帯をふるわせることによって、ある周波数の「音」が発生する。そして、その「音」を口の中で複雑に歪ませる事によって、人が理解することができる「言葉」に変換しているというわけ。声帯というのが周波数発生装置、口というのがフィルターの役目をしているといってもいいかもしれない。（実際は喉の管の物理的な特性やら様々な要素が絡み合っているのですが、簡単に端折るとこういうことになる...と思う）
ヴォコーダーというのは、いわば声帯をシンセサイザーに置き換えてしまうという技術で、シンセサイザーによって発生させた音階と、マイクで入力した人間の音声の倍音構成（スペクトル）を機械的に合成することによって、言葉に音階をつけています。
ヴォコーダーによって合成された音は、こんな感じ。
ディスコ 神Giorgio Morder御大によるヴォコーダーの解説映像（貴重！）
Kraftwerk " We are the robots " 。ヴォコーダーで歌ってます。ビデオも鼻血が出るくらいカッコイイ。ヴォコーダーがあると、ついコレをやってしまう人も多いのでは。
Yellow Magic Orchestra " Technopolis " ヴォコーダーといえ ば
「トキオゥ」。ヴォコーダーがあると、ついコレをやってしま（以下略
■ Talk Box / Talking Modulator
簡単に説明すると、口にくわえたチューブの先端から楽器の音を出し、口の形をかえることによって音をゆがめ、それをマイクで拾う、というもの。
さっき声帯というのが周波数発生装置、口というのがフィルターの役目をしていると書いたけれども、トークボックスでは複雑なフィルターをかけることができる人間の口をエフェクターとして利用しているわけです。音を機械的に合成しているヴォコーダーに比べて、かなり生っぽい粘り気のある質感になるのが特徴。ただこれ、頭蓋骨が共鳴するので、脳にものすごく負担がかかるらしいので注意。やりすぎると吐血するとか（！！）
これは映像をみたほうが早いと思う。
トークボックスの名手、 故Roger Troutmanのアドリブ演奏。その昔、やっぱり故人だけど、2pacのCalifornia Loveというヒット曲があったけど、あのサビの部分をやっていた人がこの人。トークボックスのやり過ぎが原因ではなくて、実の兄に射殺されちゃったというのは皮肉な話。
で、そ のRoger Troutmanに影響を与え たStevie Wonderのトークボックスによ る" Close To You " 。文句なしに格好いい。トークボックスやヴォコーダーが面白いのは、例えばこんな感じで普通の人がやっても、同じ音が出せるという事。ソースになる音源さえ同じならコツをつかめば同じ声で歌うことができる。これは声帯という個々人の特徴をシンセに置き換えるという技術ならではの面白さ。（ちなみにRoger Torautmanがよく使っていたのはYamahaのDX-100だとか）
ちなみ にDaftPunk のOne more time やHarder , Better , Faster , Strongerはヴォコーダーらしいけど、かなりトークボックスっぽいテイストになっている。その筋では有名なエフェクターDigiTech Talkerと後述のAutoTuneの合わせ技という噂。
■ Auto - Tune
Auto - Tune、知る人ぞ知る、今巷に溢れている楽曲ほとんどで使われてるんじゃねえのってぐらい大流行のテクノロジー。一言でいうと「外した音を無理やり修正するソフト」。この技術の登場によって、ヘタな人でもそれなりに聞こえるし、歌唱力の限界をこえた曲もつくれるようになるという、可愛くても歌はピンとこないのーという悩みがアイドル産業からフッ飛んでしまうぐらいの破壊力をもったソフトウェア。これで写真をレタッチするように、声もレタッチできるようになったわけです。やったね！
元々はちょっとハズれたところを補正するための技術だったのだけど、補正する度合いを強くするといい感じのロボっぽさになるということで、ヴォコーダー的に使われる事が多いみたい。

■音声合 成
上記でとりあげたヴォコーダー、トークボックス、Auto-Tuneのような人間の声に操作を加えて整える、というものとは異なり、最初からコンピュータにしゃべらせちゃいましょうというアイデア。Text To Speech ( TTS ) 、スピーチシンセサイザーとも呼ばれる。音声の合成方法は、実際の人の声をバラバラにして、その断片をつなぎあわせて言葉にしていく連結的合成（シンセでいうとPCM音源みたいなもんですかね）とか、ゼロから声を生成するフォルマント合成とか、手法はいろいろあるのだけど、詳しくはWikipediaを参照。英語版にはOS別のTTSについて詳しく説明してあって面白い。（ちなみにWipeoutXLのアイテムととった時の声はAmigaOSのTTSを使ってるらしいよ）
Windows やMacにもバリアフリーの一環として音声合成システムが実装されていて、それを使用して曲をつくる人たちがでてきた。TTSに音階をつける方法はいろいろあるけど、見渡したところVocalWriterというソフトが使いやすかった。他にもTTSを使用せずに独自で音階のついた音声を合成するソフトはあって、YamahaのVocaloid、CryptonのCANTOR、NTT-ATのワンダーホルンなど、合成音声で歌わせるソフトがいろいろでてきているみたい。

According to the latest roadmap for Intel coming out of Asia , you can expect Intel to refresh its line of quad - core Core 2 Extreme in Q3 of this year .
The new chip is the 2.93 GHz QX6800 , which will run on an 1066MHz frontside bus and contain 4MB of L2 cache , according to a story on Chinese - language site HKEPC .
It will be priced , like the current model QX6700 , at $ 999 when sold in batches of 1000 processors .
The third quarter is also expected to see the arrival of Intel ’s Core 2 Extreme CPU for notebooks , the dual - core X7800 .
It ’s is believed to be priced at $ 851 .
I stumbled across this presentation today .
It was presented by Simon Peyton - Jones and talks about a new way of doing parallelism under Haskell .
Much cooler than that STM nonsense .
The presentation explains things much better than I could , but in contract to STM , basically it ’s moving the parallelism annotations away from the code and into the data types .
So now we have the concept of a “ parallel array ” of floats .
The key to the coolness is that parallelism can be nested , as is shown quite well in his parallel quicksort example .
How does it work ?
Easy as pie is how it works !
Actually its operation is pretty straightforward , as long as you ’re not the one implementing it .
Nested parallelisms conceptually get “ flattened ” into one level of parallelisms .
After that it ’s all book - keeping to know when one operating should be dispatched to some other thread .
The other key to making it fast is that composed functions — and after the parallel code gets transformed , there are a lot of composed functions — get “ fused ” together .
“ Fusion ” seems to be the new buzzword in Haskell .
I swear , it must have shown up in just about every ICFP paper in the past few years .
Here ’s an example of fusion advocacy .
Fusion basically seems to be the new wave of deforestation , which used to be the new wave of listlessness .
In any case , it ’s a fancy program transformation that allows you to specialize / inline one function according to another , thus eliminating intermediate products .
It ’s cool and only works when you do n’t have side - effects .
In contrast to STM , I have to say , Nested Data Parallelism does look vaguely practical , even with a straightforward implementation .
There ’s even the obligatory “ grain of salt ” benchmark slide about a third of the way through demonstrating how awesome it is .
In one of his first slides , too , he makes reference to running Haskell code on a GPU .
I wonder what he actually said about that in his talk .
Anyway , if you skip down to the last slide , you see the typical Simon Peyton - Jones conclusion .
Basically “ there are programming problems that are too complex for a programmer to deal with himself .
But there ’s a solution !
But this solution only works with pure functional languages !
That ’s why Haskell is the future !
All we have left to do is implement it efficiently ” .
He may have his own mini-Jobs reality distortion field , but I actually believe him .
Three more guys walked through the door yesterday .
The first proudly wore a Microsoft lapel pin .
‘ This is something new ‘ , I thought , ‘ maybe we ’ll get lucky this time ‘ .
Two hours later , I said to my colleagues : ‘ I ca n’t do this any more … we are just wasting time ‘ .
We want to hire a few more people , and some new agency is flooding us with Microsoft certified contractors .
We are not looking specifically for certifications , but somehow nine out of ten cats show off with MCSD .
NET .
A couple of them attached MCSD .
NET to their name , in the first line of the CV , as if it was their biggest achievement to date .
After the interviews , that thought seems very close to the truth .
I like to start a job interview with a few easy questions , just as an elimination round .
Lately , my favourite task is writing a login handler – the problem is common enough so that most people should have encountered it in their first year of work , the solution is short enough so that anyone who writes software for a living should be able to finish it in five minutes , and it has just enough code to show the writing style and flush out those obviously deviant .
The problem looks simple enough to catch people off guard , but has a few subtleties which can tell if the candidate was ever seriously involved in a big software project .
I appreciate that there are tools , wizards and components out there which solve this , but any would - be developer should really be able to take care of such a problem .
I do n’t expect candidates to know all the API details , but middleware and server developers must know the workflow and general guidelines involved with executing a DB query .
So far , of the fifty or so hopefuls , only one knew how to do it correctly ( and those were the fifty that passed a CV check ) .
And I am not talking about students fresh out of college – we are now hiring for experienced positions to help with a big project .
One even had nineteen years in the industry – how he survived for that long without getting his hands dirty is beyond my imagination .
I pity the companies he worked for .
He first argued that the question is stupid , then started talking about how interview performance does not really reflect coding skills .
Out of respect for his two decades in the industry , I tried to explain why I want him to write the stupid login , but no luck .
After repeated requests to write it if he knows how , he went through the pain of staring at a blank whiteboard for about fifteen minutes and was sent home straight away – we did not even want to give him a fair trial .
With his attitude , he simply could not fit in .
##Hide your MCSD.NET
I do n’t think that a percentage of people with MCSD .
NET who cannot write a login handler is greater than in the overall programmer population , but I am really confused with the whole idea of that certification .
What does it mean anyway , if a vast majority of certified developers cannot cope with a simple login ?
Did those three guys yesterday really expect that they will get the job just because they had some silly pins ?
Should not that certification guarantee at least some level of competence ?
I am sure that there are some really good developers with MCSD certifications , because their companies wanted to join Microsoft ’s partnership programmes , and the interview performance of those fifty guys is not doing any justice to them , even if it ‘ does not really reflect coding skills ‘ .
And it ’s certainly not doing any good PR for Microsoft ’s certifications .
Printing MSCD next to the name on a CV is starting to look , from that perspective , really self - defeating – first , it is obviously not a sign of competence , and second , much worse – it ’s a signal that the person behind the CV thinks highly of that certification .
My internal spam filter is starting to mark CVs with prominently displayed MCSD certifications as junk .
It ’s lunch time , and the lasagna on the menu is tempting .
But you ’re trying to cut down on fat , so you go with the chicken Caesar salad instead .
After all , after years of warnings about cholesterol and salt and fat content , you probably think you know a thing or two about healthful choices .
But it turns out that what Californians “ know ” about the nutritional value of the food they order in chain restaurants may be the stuff of mythology .
When more than 500 Californians were shown lists of four dishes served at chain restaurants and asked to identify the one with the most fat or the least salt or the fewest or most calories , 68 % of them chose the wrong item every time .
Advertisement
Just 27 % got only one of the multiple - choice questions right .
And not one of the 523 Californians who were surveyed aced the test .
The four - question quiz -- which focused on food served at Denny ’s , Chili’s , McDonald ’s and Romano ’s Macaroni Grill -- was commissioned by the California Center for Public Health Advocacy , a nonprofit group based in Davis , and conducted by Field Research Corp .
The findings were the same , regardless of education or income levels .
Even the center ’s executive director , Harold Goldstein , flunked the test , despite holding a doctorate in public health .
“ More and more fast - food restaurants are claiming that they are providing healthy choices , and commonly the choice will have a word like ‘ salad ’ in it , ” Goldstein said .
“ But you could be blindfolded throwing a dart at the menu board , and you ’ve got a better chance at making the healthy choice . ”

The findings do not bode well for a state in the middle of an obesity epidemic , said Alecia Sanchez , a Sacramento - based spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society .
More than half of California adults are overweight or obese and at risk of diabetes , heart disease and high blood pressure .
One in three cancer deaths is related to poor diet , inactivity or obesity , Sanchez said .
Goldstein ’s center is using the survey results to lobby for a bill , introduced by state Sen.
Alex Padilla ( D - Pacoima ) that would require chain restaurants in California to include nutritional information on their menus , much as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires nutritional labeling for food sold in grocery stores .
The center ’s survey found that 84 % of those polled supported such a law .
“ The reality is that people are eating out , ” said Sanchez , adding that nearly half of all food dollars are spent at restaurants .
“ So we need to give them the tools to be able to do that . ”

While stopping short of saying that people would be better off not eating out so much , Goldstein said that forcing fast - food restaurants to publicize nutritional information could have an added benefit .
“ I think it is quite likely to pressure chains to make some changes in their product so that they wo n’t have to say that one chocolate shake has 1,160 calories , ” he said .
The measure is opposed by the California Restaurant Assn. as impractical and overly expensive .
Many restaurants already make the information available on their websites or in pamphlets , and offer customers a wide variety of food and portion sizes , said spokeswoman Kearsten Shepherd .
Besides ,
Shepherd said , even though spending on restaurant meals has gone up , a majority of meals still are prepared at home , and labeling on grocery items has n’t prevented the obesity crisis .

“ It ’s about dietary habits , individual choice , education , ” she said .
Walt Riker , vice president for McDonald ’s Corporate Media Relations , said in an e-mail that the chain provides customers with nutritional information on the Web , in - store brochures , tray liners and packaging .
“ An objective review of our actions , and the reality inside our restaurants , will clearly show that McDonald ’s is providing more choice and variety than ever before , that we are providing more information to consumers than probably anyone else , ” he said .
Goldstein countered that tray liners provide nutritional information for food items only after the customer has ordered .
“ I ’m not sure what the industry expects , ” he said .
“ That we ’ll take our laptop to the restaurant ? ”

And what about that chicken Caesar salad ?
If you were dining at a Romano ’s Macaroni Grill and abandoned the lasagna in hopes of cutting back on fat , you ’d be making a mistake .
The chain ’s website says that the chicken Caesar salad has 69 grams of fat , while the traditional lasagna has 54 grams .
The American Heart Assn. recommends limiting fat to no more than 30 % of daily calories , about 73 grams a day or 53 grams a day for sedentary women and the elderly .

Von einer Gesellschaft , die auszog , das Gruseln zu lernen Rüdiger Suchsland
" Tal der Wölfe - Irak " stellt die liberale Gesellschaft auf die Probe ihrer eigenen Toleranz
Das Interessanteste an dem türkischen Film " Tal der Wölfe - Irak " , im Original " Kurtlar vadisi Irak " , ist die Reaktion auf ihn .
Hinter dem Streit um den
Film steckt ein ungelöstes Problem der offenen Gesellschaft .
Kaum zwei Wochen nach dem " Karikaturenstreit " provoziert der Start dieses türkischen Actionreißers über den Irakkrieg , von dem zu hören ist , dass er in seiner Heimat sehr erfolgreich sein soll , die westlich - demokratische Mehrheitsgesellschaft .
Die deutsche Republik reagiert hysterisch .
Was Anlass sein könnte , Toleranz und Großzügigkeit , überhaupt die Stärke einer liberal - pluralistischen Gesellschaft zu beweisen , wird zu ihrem Debakel .
Warum dürfen Türken eigentlich keine schlechten Filme machen ?
Und seit wann sind Dummheit und schlechter Geschmack in Deutschland verboten ?
Verbotsforderungen sind jedenfalls zu hören , seit Serdar Akars türkischer Film " Tal der Wölfe - Irak " , vor einer Woche in den deutschen Kinos gestartet ist .
Die selbstbewusste Antwort einer offenen Gesellschaft , oder die Überreaktion einer ängstlichen ?
Wenn in den Feuilletons der Tageszeitungen die politischen Redakteure anfangen , Filmkritiken zu schreiben , wird es jedenfalls gefährlich .
Dann ist wieder einmal " Debatte " angesagt , der Kampf der Meinungen , und dann wird ein Film zur Waffe im sozialmoralischen Kampf .
Der türkische Film " Tal der Wölfe - Irak " ist zwar längst nicht so schlecht und so dumm , wie einige selbsternannte Filmexperten der deutschen Öffentlichkeit nun weiß machen wollen , aber er bietet einer reduzierten Lesart als notdürftig verpacktes ideologisches Pamphlet auch wenig Widerstand .
Gerade in Deutschland , wo man schon historischen Grund genug hätte , mit dergleichen vorsichtig zu sein , sind nun die Aufforderungen , den Film zu verbieten , besonders laut .
Zwar kommen diese Verbotsaufforderungen von den üblichen Verdächtigen , vor allem von der Seite , die auch immer schon gegen die Aufnahme der Türkei in die Europäische Union war , doch manch " links - alternative " Stimme leistet gern vorauseilende Schützenhilfe .
Der bayerische Ministerpräsident Edmund Stoiber forderte die deutschen Kinobetreiber auf , den , so wörtlich , " rassistischen und antiwestlichen Hass - Film " sofort abzusetzen .
Der baden - württembergische Innenminister Heribert Rech ( CDU ) vom rechtskonservativen Filbinger - Flügel der schwäbischen Union , mitten im Landtagswahlkampf , schloss sich postwendend an : " Der Film schürt antisemitische und antiamerikanische Ressentiments . "
Auch der CDU - Europaabgeordnete Elmar Brok verlangte , die angebliche " Verbreitung von Feindbildern " zu beenden .
Und der neue kultur - und medienpolitische Sprecher der CDU / CSU - Bundestagsfraktion , Wolfgang Börnsen , sagte : " Filme , die Hass säen , bei Heranwachsenden zur Rache aufrufen , gegen Glaubensgemeinschaften undifferenziert Front machen , die Werte anderer Kulturen herabsetzen und blanke Gewalt predigen , haben im Kino nichts verloren . "
Als ob seine Definition nicht irgendwie auf etwa die Hälfte aller US - amerikanischen Produktionen genauso gut zuträfe .
Der nordrhein - westfälische Jugendminister Armin Laschet ( CDU ) nannte den Film schließlich jugendgefährdend und " sozial desorientierend " .
Und Stoibers Mann fürs Grobe , CSU - Generalsekretär Markus Söder , zog erwartbare Verbindungslinien und drohte mit " Konsequenzen " für den EU - Beitritt der Türkei .
" Bei aller Freiheit ... "
- Augenzwinkern mit der Zensur
Flankiert wurde derlei kaum überraschender und in Wahlkampfzeiten auch in seiner Stoßrichtung leicht zu durchschauender Alarmismus aber auch durch Stimmen aus anderen Lagern : Der Berichterstatter einer Frankfurter Zeitung fühlte nach seinem Kinobesuch im spürbar unvertrauten Berlin - Neuköllner Kino die Ahnung einer " Blutrache am Westen " und wunderte sich erstaunlicherweise allen Ernstes , dass bei einem türkischen Film in einem türkischen Stadtteil in einem türkischen Kino plötzlich auch die Besucher vor allem Türken sind .
Sein Kollege von der Hamburger " Zeit " sah den " Ausdruck eines neuen türkischen Antisemitismus , der nicht mehr nur im Halbdunkel agiert " - als ob nicht gerade die Türkei , das erste Land mit moslemischer Bevölkerungsmehrheit , das Israel anerkannt hat , traditionell bemerkenswert tolerant und freundlich gegenüber Juden wäre .
Charlotte Knobloch vom Zentralrat der Juden in Deutschland kritisierte vor allem den in den Plot des Films eingewebten Antisemitismus - ein israelischer Arzt entnimmt im US - Foltercamp Abu Ghraib Gefangenen Nieren und sendet sie nach " London " , " New York " und " Tel Aviv " , worin man das antisemitische Stereotyp des Juden als eines skrupellosen Geschäftemachers sehen mag .
Darin gleich den " Stil des Nazi - Arztes Dr. Mengele " zu erkennen , und " antisemitische Hetz - Legenden im Breitwandformat " zu folgern ( Spiegel Online ) setzt allerdings schon eine gewisse Voreingenommenheit voraus .
Unerwähnt bleibt hingegen konsequent , dass es auch dieser
Arzt ist , der im Film versucht , die bösen Amerikaner in ihrem Blutrausch zu bremsen .
Spätestens da war auch für " den " Türken - Experten links von der rechten Mitte , den grünen Europa - Abgeordneten Cem Özdemir , die Stunde gekommen , um sich zu Wort zu melden : " Dieser Film erschwert einmal mehr all jenen die Arbeit , für die das Wort ' Dialog ' keine billige Gutmenschen - Floskel ist - und dieser Tage ist es offensichtlich Mode , anderen absichtlich oder unabsichtlich die Arbeit zu erschweren . "
Bald darauf sprang ihm sein Parteichef Reinhard Bütikofer bei , und wurde deutlicher gegen den " offensichtlich hetzerischen Film " : " Bei aller Freiheit sollte man an die appellieren , die zuständig sind , verdient euer Geld anders . "
Der " Filmexperte " der FDP , Hans - Joachim Otto , sagte , zwar gelte die Kunstfreiheit auch für antiamerikanische Filme .
Mit dieser müssten Filmemacher jedoch , ebenso wie Karikaturisten mit der Presse - und Meinungsfreiheit , verantwortungsbewusst umgehen - nichts anderes also , als Augenzwinkern mit der Zensurdrohung .
" Kritisieren ist das eine , Verbieten ist das andere "
Statt alldem nun zu widersprechen oder wenigstens offen zu debattieren , reagiert die Mehrheitsgesellschaft mit grotesk vorauseilendem Gehorsam : Die Kette der Cinemaxx - Kinos nahmen den Film trotz guter Kassenergebnisse aus dem Programm - was angeblich nicht mit den Politiker - Forderungen zu tun habe .
Ein Sprecher betonte , die Entscheidung sei vor Forderungen nach einem Verbot gefallen , gab aber zu , nach rein wirtschaftlichen Kriterien hätte man den Film weiter zeigen können .
Doch Stoibers Medienminister Eberhard Sinner frohlockte " Die Absetzung dieses Hass - Films durch die größte deutsche Kinokette ist ein wichtiges Signal der gesellschaftlichen Verantwortung . "
Vergleichsweise wenige Stimmen widersprechen der Verbotsforderung .
Deutlich wurde nur der " Bundesverband Regie " ( BVR ) : Der umstrittene Film könne " nicht als volksverhetzend betrachtet werden " , erklärte der Verband :
Nach Sichtung des Films kann allenfalls festgestellt werden , dass der Film Passagen enthält , die in der gegenwärtigen Auseinandersetzung der Kulturen durchaus diskussionswürdig sind .
Andererseits enthält der Film sogar friedenstiftende Elemente .
Ansonsten stellt der Film eine typische Bedienung des Action - Genres dar , mit dem Unterschied , dass diesmal der Held der Fiktion nicht aus dem Westen und der Böse aus dem Osten kommt , sondern umgekehrt .
In der Union meldete sich nur der saarländische Ministerpräsident Peter Müller gegen Verbote zu Wort :
Rassistische Filme sind zu kritisieren , egal gegen wen der Rassismus sich richtet .
Kritisieren ist das eine , Verbieten ist das andere .
Ich glaube , da haben wir eine klare Grenze , die ist erreicht dann , wenn zum Rassenhass aufgestachelt wird .
Ob das das Ziel dieses Filmes ist , weiß ich nicht .
Jedenfalls ist der Film ja zugelassen worden durch die Prüfstelle , und deshalb gehe ich davon aus , dass das eine fundierte Entscheidung ist .
Auch die FDP - Europaabgeordnete Silvana Koch - Mehrin plädierte für Debatten statt Verbote :
Der aktuelle Streit und die Forderungen nach Absetzung des Films zeigen vielmehr , wie notwendig ein Dialog auf beiden Seiten ist .
Konsequent kritisierte sie daher Stoiber : " Ich finde , dass sich Herr Stoiber und die anderen genauso verhalten wie die Regimes in den arabischen Ländern , die die europäische Meinungs - und Pressefreiheit angreifen " , Stoiber falle " denjenigen in den Rücken , die westliche Werte gegen islamistischen Fundamentalismus verteidigen und macht damit auch noch Werbung für den Film . "
Bei den Grünen war es nur Christian Ströbele , der seinem Vorsitzenden widersprach :
Das mag ein unerfreulicher Film sein .
Aber für irgendwelche Maßnahmen sehe ich überhaupt keinen Anlass .
Glücklicherweise ist es immerhin nicht mehr ganz so einfach , in Deutschland etwas zu verbieten .
Autoritäre Reflexe
Tatsächlich steckt hinter der ganzen Aufregung aber ein tieferer Konflikt : " Tal der Wölfe - Irak " trifft ins Herz einer westlichen Gesellschaft , in der die Angst regiert , und illustriert eine erschreckende Unsicherheit .
Während der Film auch schon in den Niederlanden , Dänemark und Österreich - weiß Gott keine Länder , die sich derzeit durch besondere Toleranz gegenüber orientalischen Bevölkerungsgruppen auszeichnen - , in Belgien , England und der Schweiz lief , ohne zu Protesten und erregten Zeitungsdebatten zu führen , reagiert Deutschland mit Hysterie .
Als ob man darauf gewartet hätte , ergreift man dankbar den erstbesten Anlass , sich den eigenen antiliberalen Reflexen hinzugeben .
Wieder schnappen die autoritären Reflexe zu , und die neuerdings beschworene neue Bürgerlichkeit zeigt ihre ausgrenzenden Seiten .
Wer den Film am Wochenende zum Beispiel im Berliner Zoopalast ansehen wollte , dem bot sich ein merkwürdiges Schauspiel .
Neben der für einen türkischen Actionspielfilm in Originalfassung mutmaßlichen Zielgruppe - viele junge , ihrem Aussehen nach türkischstämmige Männer mit Lederjacken , ein paar vermutlich auch deutsch - türkische junge Frauen , einige wenige davon mit Kopftuch - und ein paar junge Leute mit bunten Punkfrisuren , sah man das Kino fast zu Hälfte gefüllt mit älteren Paaren .
Viele von ihnen trugen Lodenmäntel , einige einen Schal von Hermes oder Chanel .
Wer genauer hinsah , erkannte auch den Redakteur eines öffentlich - rechtlichen Polit - Magazins und die für Bildung zuständige Redakteurin einer Wochenzeitschrift .
So ganz recht passten sie alle nicht hierher , und manche Stirn war schon vor Beginn besorgt gerunzelt .
Und spätestens , als die gleichen Leute dann nach dem Film mit noch besorgteren Minen diskutierten und bestimmte Schlüsselvokabeln des gegenwärtigen Diskurses - " Integration " , " versagt " , " verbieten " , " Banlieu " - durch den Raum schwappten , war klar : " Tal der Wölfe - Irak " war im deutschen Bildungsbürgertum angekommen .
Es hatte endlich einen
Film gefunden , um sich mal wieder richtig zu gruseln und die eigene Empörung über die schlimmen Türken zu genießen .
Mehr als die Hälfte der Deutschen haben laut neuesten Umfragen Angst vor einer muslimischen Bedrohung .
Aber wo die Angst regiert , da ist der Liberalismus in der Defensive .
Eine Debatte innerhalb der muslimischen Welt
Mit dem Film , der übrigens auf einer gleichnamigen Fernsehserie beruht , hat all dies aber nichts zu tun .
Die Handlung ist schnell erzählt : Nach der US - amerikanischen
Besetzung des Irak im Jahr 2003 kämpft ein dreiköpfiges türkisches Spezialkommando , geführt von einem , wenn man so will : türkischen James Bond , gegen die Exzesse des örtlichen Generalbevollmächtigten der US - Streitkräfte .
Dieser , gespielt von dem bekannten Darsteller Billy Zane ( " Titanic " ) , ist ein Filmschurke , wie er im Buche steht : arrogant , skrupellos und überaus brutal .
Es gehört zu den bekannten Stereotypen , dass dieser Bösewicht besonders schlimm ist , weil er weich ist , dandyesk , mit einer Vorliebe für beige Anzüge und Klaviermusik .
Dass sein Lieblingsstück Beethovens " Hymne an die Freude " ist , dürfte auch kein Zufall sein : Das Lied ist schließlich EU - Hymne und Aufklärungsmanifest in einem .
Die Amerikaner tun fast durchweg schlimme Dinge : Eine Hochzeitsgesellschaft im Nordirak wird von US - Soldaten niedergemetzelt , ohne Rücksicht auf Anstand und Moral .
Am Ende bringen die Türken den bösen Ami , der überdies Sam Marshall heißt , eine Kombination aus " Uncle Sam " und dem Gründer des Marshall - Plans womöglich , zur Strecke .
Moral : Die Türken zeigen es den Amerikanern .
Es kann also kein Zweifel sein : Der Film ist einseitig , er zeigt ein antiamerikanisches Zerrbild , man darf ihn stilistisch als übles Machwerk bezeichnen .
Ästhetisch dominiert wird alles von den Stereotypen des Actionfilms : Explosionen , Schießereien .
Und darin ist das vermeintlich antiamerikanische Manifest dann ein sehr amerikanischer Film , der das übliche Gut - Böse - Schema Hollywoods übernimmt und in " Rambo " - Manier fortsetzt .
Nur werden diese stilistischen Mittel gegen die Amerikaner gewendet .
Das ist legitim , denn diese Mittel gehören schließlich nicht den USA .
Zudem ist " Tal der Wölfe " viel komplexer , als man auf den ersten Blick annimmt : Eine bittere Studie über Freundschaft und Versöhnung , die oszilliert zwischen Pathos und nacktem Zynismus , das von Provokation und Zweifel geprägt ist .
Schließlich wird hier , auch wenn dies kein Fall jenes Kunstkinos ist , das man hier normalerweise zeigt , unglaublich viel geredet und deklamiert , schließlich ist eine Hauptfigur des Films ein Priester und Sufi-Meister , der einen ganz anderen friedfertigen Islam repräsentiert , sich der Botschaft des Films widersetzt , gegen Selbstmordattentäter wettert , gegen Heilige Kriege ( " Wer einen Unschuldigen tötet , der hat die ganze Menschheit getötet . " ) und für Versöhnung .
Die wirkliche Kontroverse , die der Film als Folie benutzt , ist also eine Debatte innerhalb der muslimischen Welt : Die zwischen dem säkularen türkischen Nationalismus , der alten Ideen des Osmanischen Reiches , dem friedfertigen , universalen Islam und dessen fundamentalistisch - panislamistischer Radikalisierung .
Abu Ghraib ist kein perverser Regieeinfall eines durchgeknallten Filmemachers
Was " Tal der Wölfe - Irak " über das Widerspiegeln einiger Weisheiten vom türkischen Stammtisch hinaus nun zu einem besonderen , und auf seine Art sehenswerten Film macht , ist aber vor allem , wie er seine B - Movie - Handlung mit Motiven aus der Zeitgeschichte aufpeppt : Schon der Beginn verweist auf einen authentischen Vorfall 2003 , als 11 türkische Soldaten , damals US - Verbündete , von US - Truppen verhaftet und als Geiseln genommen wurden .
Das Massaker der Hochzeitsgesellschaft hat es ebenso gegeben , wie die Vorkommnisse von Abu Ghraib , die der Film deutlich , aber ohne Voyeurismus zeigt .
Dass Amerikaner , im übrigen die traditionellen Verbündeten der Türken , so gezeigt werden können , ist Folge von Bush und seiner Politik .
Abu Ghraib ist kein perverser Regieeinfall eines durchgeknallten nationalistischen Filmemachers .
Es könnte und dürfte einem bei solchen Bildern klar werden , was die US - Politik der letzten Jahre nicht nur dem Bildergedächtnis im Orient und nicht nur der langfristigen US - Außenpolitik , sondern vor allem der Selbstwahrnehmung der Bevölkerung zugefügt hat .
Das macht " Tal der Wölfe " so unangenehm .
Wer sich jetzt nach dem Kinobesuch im Publikum empört und große Augen ob der " gewalttätigen Bilder " macht , sollte sich fragen , welche Bilder er eigentlich meint ?
Die Provokation dieses
Films liegt vor allem in jenen Momenten , in denen er die TV - Nachrichten nachstellt .
Wer darauf mit Verbotsforderungen reagiert , kapituliert vor seinen antiliberalen Reflexen .
Man will das Unerträgliche , Untragbare , die eigene Scham Berührende auslöschen .
Und wer den Film nur auf anti-amerikanische , - christliche , - semitische und / oder - westliche Hetze reduziert , konstruiert vor allem selbst anti-islamische oder anti-türkische Hetz - Legenden .
Der Fall " Tal der Wölfe " illustriert eine erschreckende Unsicherheit und Angst der deutschen Demokratie .
Der Liberalismus verheddert sich in den eigenen Vorurteilen .
Kaum kommt etwas , das vielen nicht passt , und schon schwingt man mit der Zensurkeule .
Was einem nicht gefällt , das will man verbieten .
Das mag aus der Stimmung erklärlich sein , die momentan in Europa herrscht .
Aber so wenig wir berechtigt sind , Karikaturen zu verbieten , die manchen nicht passen , so sehr müssen wir auch einen solchen Film ertragen können .
Hinter den Verbotsforderungen steckt der autoritäre Charakter der Fordernden .
Vielmehr ist der Umgang mit " Tal der Wölfe " eine Nagelprobe auf die Toleranz der Gesellschaft .
Toleranz ist nicht leicht zu haben .
Toleranz ist nichts Nettes , Hübsches , nichts , was wärmt .
Sondern etwas , das man auch von sich selbst ertrotzen muss .
Es gibt ein Recht auf Dummheit , es gibt ein Recht auf schlechten Geschmack .
Kunst ist frei , und muss es bleiben .
Und das Kino , warum muss man das nur immer wieder betonen , ist keine moralische Anstalt .

Politični blogi po svetu in pri nas – modna muha ali obvezno orodje ?
So blogi političnih osebnosti nekaj , kar že na daleč smrdi po poceni oglaševanju ali pa predstavljajo pomembno orodje za komuniciranje z državljani ?
Kategorija : Kolumna | Datum objave : Monday , 16 .
04 . 2007 | Avtor : Barbara Kvas
Za sedaj so trije .
Trije visoki politiki , ki blogajo .
En je predsednik , drugi minister , tretji evropski komisar .
Pestrejše izbire si ne bi mogli želeti .
Teme , ki jih obravnavajo so različne .
Njihov pristop do pisanja pa tudi .
Le kaj bi bilo , če bi se še kdo od slovenskih politikov usedel za računalnik in tipkal .
Bi se njihove besede dale brati ?
Bi sploh želeli brati njihove umetnije ?
V tokratni anketi na našem portalu vas sprašujemo o tem ali bi brali blog še katerega izmed naših ministrov .
V času , ko tole tipkam - četrtek malo pred polnočjo - štirje pravite , da bi brali ministrove besede .
Ministrovo delo je pomembno v našem političnem sistemu in vsak minister ima pod seboj ogromno ljudi , imajo ogromno pooblastil in opravljajo pomembno delo .
Vsaj tako nam je bilo rečeno .
Vsaj tako pravijo .
Pa sploh vemo to čno kak šno delo in kako ga opravljajo ?
Čisto zares ?
In kako razmišljajo ?
Bi bilo zanimivo pogledati , kaj se jim plete po glavi , kaj ni res ?
Dva izmed naših bralcev sta mnenja , da bi bilo branje ministrovih blogom nezanimivo .
Da ju njihovo delo ne zanima .
Čeprav ne vem , zakaj sta takega mnenja , lahko vsaj približno ugibam .
PR službe .
Te naj bi pisale govore in predstavljale delo ministra .
Med mnogimi , tudi sama sem takega mnenja , čeprav se trudim ostati optimistična , prevladuje prepričanje , da ministri sami sigurno ne bi pisali bloga .
Da bi zanje pisal nekdo drug , nekdo , ki je ministru blizu , vendar vseeno ni on .
Dejstvo , da bloga ne bi pisal minister sam , pa ni ključnega pomena .
Največji problem je v tem , da bi pisali le pozitivne vidike , le tisto , kar bi v javnosti zgledalo pozitivno .
Minister je dober .
Minister obvlada svoje delo .
Minister si zelo prizadeva in deluje izključno v prid državljanov .
Taka pisanja bi se sigurno pojavljala na vseh blogih .
Žiga Turk , minister brez listnice , predstojnik Službe vlade za razvoj , je nedavno začel blogati .
Za blog Vest . si je izjavil , da ne bi bilo dobro , če bi vsi politiki blogali .
Sam pa sedaj bloga od marca in dokaj redno opisuje svoje poglede in misli .
Vendar pa ni prvi med slovenskimi politiki , ki blogajo .
Prvi je bil evropski komisar za znanost in raziskave dr .
Janez Potočnik , ki je na pobudo kolegice Margot Wallström začel blogati maja lansko leto .
Bloga v različnih časovnih zaporednjih , predvsem pa o svojem delu kot komisar .
Najbolj poznan bloger pa je vsekakor predsednik Janez Drnovšek .
Na spletni strani Gibanje.org Janez D. redno izraža svoje misli .
Deli svoje pozitivne izkušnje s svetom in mediji redno objavljajo vse , kar napiše na blogu .
Vendar pa ne dovoljuje komentarjev .
Pravi , da je povedal vse in se ne namerava prepirati z ljudmi , ki ga ne razumejo in ne namerava učiti ljudi , ki se z njim strinjajo .
Vsekakor je to negativno , vendar pa meni ni ravno nerazumljivo .
Mislim , da se Janez D. Dobro zaveda kakšna je stopnja kultiviranosti v Sloveniji in da mnogi njegove transformacije ne razumejo in se iz njega norčujejo .
Vsekakor je omenjena trojica zanimiva .
Njihove besede je zanimivo prebrati .
Ob branju se zavedamo , da je bil tekst , ki ga beremo napisan za nas .
Da so se Oni odločili komunicirati z nami , navadnimi smrtniki .
Da so nam čisto malo odgrnili zavese na oknu , skozi katere lahko ob določenih trenutkih malo pokukamo .
Da se zavemo , da so ljudje .
Tako kot mi .
Da ima tudi on krtačke za čiščenje stranišč , da on ne je mesa in da on obožuje nogomet .
Kakšna je prihodnost blogov politikov v Sloveniji ?
Si upam napovedati ?
Lahko bi se ozrla v tujino in si rekla - morda bodo pa tudi v Sloveniji s časom dognali , da so blogi nove veselice .
Da morajo narediti stik z nami , malimi ljudmi , če želijo našo podporo .
V tujimi nekaterim uspeva .
Dobro uspeva .
Vendar le , če ne pišejo in se ne snemajo le v času volilne kampanje .
V Združenih državam namreč ta oblika hinavščine presega mere dobrega okusa .
Vseeno pa naj ne bom prehitra , morda bosta Hillary ali Barack blogala in se snemala , tudi ko bosta predsednika – seveda , kdor koli od njiju pač bo .
Poglejmo si Italijo , Veliko Britanijo ali Nemčijo .
Veliko jih bloga .
Bodo blogi zaživeli tudi v slovenskem političnem prostoru ?
Bodo tudi pri nas postali obvezno orodje ?
Tony Wright said raw food could be the key to fending off sleep
After five days he recorded in his online diary visions of " giggling dancing pixies and elves " appearing on his computer screen , such was the impact that going without sleep had on the 42 - year - old .
On Friday he claimed to have beaten the record for sleep deprivation , although the Guinness Book of Records no longer recognises attempts at the challenge .
Health risks
It says it no longer recognises attempts at the challenge , set in 1964 by American student Randy Gardner , because of the potential health risks involved .
But apart from the dancing pixies and some blisters on his feet from all - night pool playing , writer and researcher Mr Wright appears to have come through the experience unscathed .
His home for the last 11 nights has been the Studio Bar in Penzance where , buoyed by a regular stream of visitors , he says he has achieved his aim , despite not gaining official recognition .
Monitored by webcam and CCTV , his daily routine consisted of eating a diet of raw food - including fruit , salad , seeds and nuts - drinking herb tea , writing his blog for BBC Cornwall and chatting with friends .
At other times , he appeared to be suspiciously motionless , prompting concerns for his safety and sparking rumours that he had nodded off .
Writing while sleep deprived is easily the most difficult thing to do
Tony Wright
Writing in his online diary , Mr Wright said : " The webcam seems to give an unhelpful impression of total stillness when one is merely pondering one 's creative insights ( or in this case lack of them ) .
" Several emails appeared and the phone rang to point out the lack of vital signs so efforts were made to ensure my existence had not prematurely ended . "
But by day six he " began to feel really confident that the record was mine for the taking " .
However , even writing the blog was becoming too much by day eight .
" Every attempt to glance at the screen can end up in a nosedive , " he wrote .
But he added : " I 'm no quitter , shaking the concussion from my last crash out of my head I grabbed my sunglasses and without hesitation looked straight into the middle of the screen .
" No swirling hieroglyphs , dancing pixies or sudden NSE ( near sleep experience ) , at last a safe screen for heavily sleep deprived bloggers . "
Mr Wright 's home for the challenge was the Studio Bar in Penzance
On day 10 he realised what many others have in the past , that being sleep deprived is not good for writing .
" As it turns out writing while sleep deprived is easily the most difficult thing to do , for that reason I have decided I wo n't write anymore , so this will be my last entry , " he said .
At the end of it all , Mr Wright announced it as a victory for his theory that a raw food diet enabled him to switch between sides of the brain that require a different amount of sleep .
" I 've really been looking to bring attention to changing variables in human lifestyle , " he said .
" For example if you build in a diet similar to our ancestors , will our brain work in a different way , does it mean we can have less sleep ? "
Dolphins sleep on one side of the brain , but human organs are not designed that way
Dr Chris Idzikowski
Dr Chris Idzikowski of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre told BBC
News that he was sceptical about the claims .
" It 's a nice idea if it works , " he said .
" Dolphins sleep on one side of the brain , but human organs are not designed that way . "
He said that someone would have to be monitored in a controlled environment to prove the ability to switch sides of the brain .
That would also prove if the subject was constantly awake .
" If you do n't wire them up , you do n't know what they are up to , whether there is any cat - napping or not , which they may not be aware of . "
Dr Idzikowski said it was unlikely raw food would affect the ability to stay awake and added that Mr Wright should not suffer any ill - effects from his self - imposed ordeal .
" Humans have an amazing ability to bounce back from lack of sleep , " he said .
" It 's like jet - lag .
I would have thought that he would be fully recovered in three days . "
I welcome your leader criticising the decision by the NUJ to boycott Israeli goods ( April 20 ) .
For many years we have been working with trade unions in the region , the Histadrut ( Israeli TUC ) and the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions ( PGFTU ) , to meet and establish links with British unions .
What trade unionists need in the region is solidarity , engagement and respect , not divisive calls that can only help the extremists .
The general secretary of the PGFTU said in a letter only this week to Ofer Eini , chairman of the Histadrut , that " we must emphasise our mutual need for peace in our two societies , for the benefit both of workers and because peace will reflect stability " .
If the two union federations want to work for peace together it is our duty to support them .
It is a pity that the NUJ did not take part in our recent delegation to the region to show real solidarity with fellow trade unionists , rather than taking on gesture politics .
Chair , Trade Union Friends of Israel
You suggest that , in voting to boycott Israel , the NUJ has strayed too far from its legitimate business .
We do not think such arguments apply to our grave concerns as doctors about the health - related impact of Israeli policy on Palestinian society .
Persistent violations of medical ethics have accompanied Israel 's occupation .
The Israeli Defence Force has systematically flouted the fourth Geneva convention guaranteeing a civilian population unfettered access to medical services and immunity for medical staff .
Ambulances are fired on ( hundreds of cases ) and their personnel killed .
Desperately ill people , and newborn babies , die at checkpoints because soldiers bar the way to hospital .
The public - health infrastructure , including water and electricity supplies , is wilfully bombed , and the passage of essential medicines like anti-cancer drugs and kidney dialysis fluids blocked .
In the West Bank , the apartheid wall has destroyed any coherence in the primary health system .
UN rapporteurs have described Gaza as a humanitarian catastrophe , with 25 % of children clinically malnourished .
The Israeli Medical Association has a duty to protest about war crimes of this kind , but has refused to do so .
Appeals to the World Medical Association and the British Medical Association have also been rebuffed .
Eighteen leading Palestinian health organisations have appealled to fellow professionals abroad to recognise how the IMA has forfeited its right to membership of the international medical community .
We are calling for a boycott of the Israeli Medical Association and its expulsion from the WMA .
There is a precedent for this : the expulsion of the Medical Association of South Africa during the apartheid era .
A boycott is an ethical and moral imperative when conventional channels do not function , for otherwise we are merely turning away .

Pharaoh 's Helicopter ?

There are some very strange hieroglyphics in the Temple of Osiris at Abydos .
According to many UFO enthusiasts and Atlantis proponents , these glyphs depict highly developed crafts , specifically a helicopter , a submarine , some form of flying saucer , and a jet plane .
What are these inscriptions all about ?
The glyphs , unretouched .

The glyphs are a result of both erosion of the stone surface ( evident elsewhere in the temple ) and the process of filling in and re-carving the stone to replace some of the original hieroglyphics .
The technical term for such a surface that has been written on more than once is a palimpsest .
The usurping and modifying of inscriptions was common in ancient Egypt throughout its history .
The Abydos glyph was modified at least once in antiquity , and perhaps twice .
Some of the filling has fallen out in places where the older and the newer inscriptions overlap , and the result is unique and odd - looking .
Glyphs superimposed .

The text is part of the titulary of Ramesses II and can be translated as " The one of the Two Ladies , who suppresses the nine foreign countries . "
This replaces the royal titulary of Seti I that was originally carved into the stone .
More technically , the actual " helicopter " seems to be a portion of the psd.t sign and the X3s.t sign on top of each other , with portions missing .
An apparent change in scale also mucks things up .
The glyphs in context .

If the ancient Egyptians had vehicles such as helicopters , submarines , and jet airplanes , one would expect to find some evidence of this other than in a single inscription on the lintel of a single temple .
This type of large machinery requires a vast amount of support ( including fuel , parts , factories , etc. ) but there is no trace of any such support in all of Egypt .
The Egyptian literature is also bereft of any boast , much less passing mention , of advanced aircraft .
Obviously this situation does n't seem peculiar to those who really want to believe that the ancient Egyptians flew around in airplanes .

It ’s a slow Sunday morning so I was going to browse around a new language I ’d been hearing rumors of , and maybe send them a little link love if I liked what I saw .
However it seems all their tutorials , manuals , white papers , and almost everything else are in PDF .
Yuck .
Not worth my time .
They ’re complaining that they ca n’t get any thought leaders to pay attention to them .
If they insist on publishing on the Web in a format designed for paper books , it ’s no wonder no one has noticed them .
Write back when you start noticing this little thing called HTML , guys .
I ’ve got a feeling it ’s going to be big one of these days .
Seriously folks , PDF is wrong for the Web and always has been .
Unless you ’re distributing fliers to your salespeople that they ’re going to take to a print shop and have printed up for their next meeting , there ’s really no reason to publish PDF on the Web .
Whenever I see a link to a PDF , I know that the author was so enamored of their tool that they did n’t stop to consider the desires or convenience of the reader .
They put their needs ahead of their readers .
HTML has been around for almost 20 years now .
The time has long since passed for using HTML incapable tools that can only print to PDF .
If you ’re going to publish on the Web , then you need to publish in HTML ; and that means you need to author in HTML or a format that can be easily converted to HTML .
PDF is a sure sign that a site is being put up for the ego - gratification of its authors , and has little interest in communicating with anyone else .
For most documents today , the Web is the most important medium .
It is more important to have a good web site that people can read than it is to have attractive dead trees .
If a publisher / author does not have the time or budget to manually convert printed formats into HTML for the Web , then they should author in HTML first and print that , rather than authoring in Word and posting it as PDF on the Web .
HTML is a much better paper format than PDF is a web format .
With a little CSS or XSLT trickery , an HTML authored book is indistinguishable from one written in Word .
PDF is nothing more than a prepress format in the same family as raw PostScript , dvi files , XSL - FO , and a dozen other technologies designed for 1980s - era Linotypes .
It has a niche , but that niche is not the Web .
If you want people to read what you write , then publish in HTML , never PDF .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
You let the holidays come and go without pulling the trigger .
But March Madness looms , not to mention the new season of " The Sopranos . "
You know it 's time to go high definition , but with all the 1080 p 's and HD MIs and whatever , buying the right TV seems as straightforward as buying the right nuclear submarine .
Good news :
Now that prices , and the technology , have stabilized , HD is officially a no - brainer .
So take this guide and pick your set .
LCD $ 250 - $ 6,000 : Up to 40 inches or so , LCD flat panels are the best option .
They provide the brightest HD picture at the best price and are also the most energy - efficient .
Higher - end models will serve gamers well and double as computer monitors .
PLASMA $ 1,000 - $ 8,000 : For big rooms , plasma still wins on price - to - performance , though LCDs are catching up .
Screen " burn - in " problems are mostly fixed .
Live in the mountains ?
Be careful : Some plasmas overheat at high altitudes ( not enough air ) .
REAR PROJECTION $ 1,000 - $ 5,000 :
Of the three flavors of rear - projection TV , the most popular is DLP .
DLP screens are more affordable than plasma but are also much bigger and heavier - and the picture fades noticeably when viewed from the side .
FRONT PROJECTORS $ 1,000 - $ 35,000 :
For those with a big budget and plenty of wall space , a high - definition projector will dish up that magical movie theater experience .
But bear in mind : massive screen and awesome speakers sold separately .
Key Questions
How cheap will these things get ?
Price declines are tapering off .
That means there 's little danger you 'll end up kicking yourself for not holding off another month .
What 's 1080 p , and do I need it ?
There are several levels of HD resolution ; 1080 p is the high end .
The vast majority of HD content , including cable and broadcast programming , will be sub -1080 p for years to come .
Unless you 're a hardcore gamer - or rich - 720 p is fine .
How big a screen ?
Viewing distance should be at least 1.5 times screen size ; any closer and the image looks bad .
So do n't splurge on that 84 - inch set unless you can sit 10 1 / 2 feet away .
Should I get External speakers ?
Yes .
A " home theater in a box " system is the most cost - effective way to amp up your TV experience .
What about HDMI connections ?
Yes .
And the more the better .
Newer components - DVD players , DVRs , stereos , etc. - will use HDMI .
The cables are nice and compact too .
Are " premium " cables worth it ?
No .
The cheap ones work fine .
Do I need a universal remote ?
Yes .
Try a Logitech Harmony .
Is it worth it to get a warranty ?
Maybe .
The math is a wash at best .
But if you 'll sleep better , do it .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Sales of existing homes posted the biggest jump in nearly three years in February , though sellers got the gains the way Detroit automakers spur sales - by cutting prices .
The National Association of Realtors said Friday that home sales rose 3.9 percent last month to an annual rate of 6.7 million from a revised 6.4 million pace in January .
It was the biggest percentage increase since March 2004 .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had looked for a slowdown to a 6.3 million pace .
But even though sales rose from January , the pace was still down 3.6 percent from February 2006 .
But the report also showed the median price of a home sold in February fell 1.3 percent to $ 212,800 from a year earlier .
That was the seventh straight month that prices fell from a year earlier .
While home prices can swing widely from month to month , a drop in prices from a year earlier is relatively rare - and is sign of how weak the housing market has become .
Before the current price weakness started in mid-2006 , it had been 11 years since prices showed a drop compared to a year earlier .
And while the year - over - year decline may seem modest , it is 7.6 percent below the record high hit just last July .
Half the homes sell for more than the median and half sell for less .
" The analogy to the auto industry is a good one .
Why did we sell more houses ?
Because we lowered the price , " said Michael Strauss , chief economist at Common Fund , a money management firm serving not - for - profit clients .
The strong sales pace was also helped by one of the warmer Decembers on record .
Sales of existing homes are recorded after closing , not when a sales contract is signed , usually a month or two before the closing date .
The report is also a snapshot of the market before the recent problems with subprime mortgages started to curtail financing - and the number of buyers on the market .
The problems with subprime loans made to buyers with weak credit began surfacing in late February and accelerated in March .
" The housing sales data we got today is history , " said Bill Hampel , chief economist Credit Union National Association .
" The news on the subprime has all come since these contracts were signed . "
Hampel said the reaction of the markets and regulators to the problems in subprime mortgages means that many buyers will no longer be able to qualify to borrow as they could as late as last year to buy a home , which will continue to push down prices and sales going forward .
A rise in home foreclosures will also add to the glut of homes on the market , which will mean more downward pressure on prices .
" All of this points to a softer housing market than we otherwise would have expected , " said Hampel .
The Realtors said they 're hopeful that prices could start to turn around later this year .
Pat Vredevoogd Combs , a Grand Rapids , Mich. , Realtor who is president of the trade group , said the weakness in pricing should help bring in buyers who had been priced out of the market during the white - hot boom years .
" Overall , home prices should rise slowly this year , and many buyers have an opportunity now that was only a dream during the five - year boom , " she said in the group 's statement .
But Strauss agreed with Hampel about continued weakness .
He said the most important number is the large supply of homes for sale - a number that showed growing weakness despite stronger sales .
There were 3.7 million homes for sale last month , up nearly 6 percent from the 3.5 million in January , and up by a quarter from a year earlier .
" Inventories went up even more than sales went up , " he said .
" There is an inventory overhang that we 've got to clear out to bring money back into the sector . "
The glut is due largely to overbuilding during the record housing boom of 2005 and early 2006 .
Thursday , KB Home ( Charts ) , the No. 5 U.S. home builder , reported earnings plunged 84 percent and warned that higher foreclosures and tighter lending standards in the broader market could prolong weakness in the sector .
The CEO of D.R. Horton ( Charts ) , the No. 1 U.S. builder , told an investor conference earlier this month that prices and new home sales in 2007 are " going to suck . "
Earlier this month , New Jersey builder Hovnanian Enterprises ( Charts ) became the latest to report a loss following shortfalls at Pulte Home ( Charts ) and Centex ( Charts ) .
Even builders still reporting earnings , such as D.R. Horton and Toll Brothers ( Charts ) , have reported sharply lower income .
Home prices :
Do n't expect a quick rebound
One of the latest innovations is thin - film photovoltaic ( PV ) laminate .
Rather than requiring the heavy glass and unwieldy racks of previous systems , the peel - and - stick laminate simply adheres right onto the panels of a standing - seam metal roof .
Requiring about 5 - 10 minutes installation time per panel , this solution is lightweight , quick and easy and demands considerably less labor than its predecessors .
The complete process is simple : Just apply the PV laminate , install the new roof panels and connect the output from the PV to an inverter , which changes the direct current to alternating current used in our homes .
Then , just flip the switch !
With the help of a few roofers and an electrician , your home can be solar powered in the course of an afternoon .
And when you consider state and federal tax incentives , net metering and your savings in electricity costs , your new system is not only a boon to the environment , but will ultimately pay for itself and save you money .

The 1970 killings by National Guardsmen of four students during a peaceful anti-war demonstration at Kent State University have now been shown to be cold - blooded , premeditated official murder .
But the definitive proof of this monumental historic reality is not , apparently , worthy of significant analysis or comment in today 's mainstream media .
After 37 years of official denial and cover - up , tape - recorded evidence , that has existed for decades and has been in the possession of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , has finally been made public .
It proves what " conspiracy theorists " have argued since 1970 --- that there was a direct military order leading to the unprovoked assassination of unarmed students .
Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) documents show collusion between Ohio Governor James A. Rhodes and the FBI that aimed to terrorize anti-war demonstrators and their protests that were raging throughout the nation .
It is difficult to overstate the political and cultural impact of the killing of the four Kent State students and wounding of nine more on May 4 , 1970 .
The nation 's campuses were on fire over Richard Nixon 's illegal invasion of Cambodia .
Scores of universities were ripped apart by mass demonstrations and student strikes .
The ROTC building at Kent burned down .
The vast majority of American college campuses were closed in the aftermath , either by student strikes or official edicts .
Nixon was elected president in 1968 claiming to have a " secret plan " to end the war in Southeast Asia .
But the revelation that he was in fact escalating it with the illegal bombing of what had been a peaceful non-combatant nation was more than Americans could bear .
As the ferocity of the opposition spread deep into the grassroots , Nixon 's Vice President , Spiro Agnew , shot back in a series of speeches .
He referred to student demonstrators as Nazi " brownshirts " and suggested that college administrators and law enforcement should " act accordingly . "
On May 3 , 1970 --- the day before National Guardsmen under his purview opened fire at Kent State -- Rhodes echoed Agnew 's remarks by referring to student demonstrators as " the strongest , well - trained militant revolutionary group that has ever assembled in America
They 're worse than the brownshirts and the Communist element and the night riders and the vigilantes .
They are the worst type of people that we harbor in America . "
Rhodes told a reporter that the Ohio National Guard would remain at Kent State " until we get rid of them " referring to a demographic group that was overwhelmingly white , middle class and in college .
The next day , Rhodes , the administration and the FBI sent those students a lethal message .
Rhodes was the perfect messenger .
Bumbling and mediocre , with a long history of underworld involvement , Rhodes was a devoted admirer of Nixon , and of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover .
Public records reveal that Rhodes was a virtual stooge for the FBI because of the agency 's files tying Rhodes directly to organized crime .
When Kent 's ROTC building was torched on May 2 under suspicious circumstances ( student protestors could n't get it to light until a mysterious " biker " showed up with a canister of gasoline ) it provided the perfect cover for Rhodes to dispatch the National Guard .
But contrary to law , they were supplied with live ammunition .
On May 4 , in the presence of a peaceful , unthreatening rally , the Guard was strung along a ridge 100 yards from the bulk of the protestors .
Earlier , rocks and insults had been hurled at the Guard .
But not one of the numerous investigations and court proceedings involving what happened next has ever contended any of the students were armed , or that the Guard was under threat of physical harm at the time of the shooting .
For 37 years the official cover story has been that a mysterious shot rang out and the young Guardsmen panicked , firing directly into the " mob " of students .
This week , that cover story was definitively proven to be a lie .
Prior to the shooting , a student named Terry Strubbe put a microphone at the window of his dorm , which overlooked the rally .
According to the Associated Press , the 20 - second tape is filled with " screaming anti-war protectors followed by the sound of gunfire . "
But in an amplified version of the tape , a Guard officer is also heard shouting " Right here !
Get Set! Point ! Fire ! "
The sound of gunshots follow the word " Point . "
Four students soon lay dead .
Two days later , two more would die at Jackson State University , as police fired without provocation into a dorm .
Strubbe gave a copy of the Kent tape to the FBI soon after the shooting ( he has kept the original in a safe deposit box ) .
Eight Guardsmen were later tried for civil rights violations , and acquitted .
Neither their officers , nor Nixon , nor Agnew , nor Rhodes , nor the FBI , were ever brought to trial .
But massive volumes of research --- including an epic study by James A. Michener and William Gordon 's Four Dead in Ohio --- strongly imply an explicit conspiracy to intimidate the national anti-war movement .
After 37 years , Strubbe 's tape got its first widespread public perusal last week .
Six months ago , Alan Canfora , 58 , one of the nine wounded Kent students , learned it had been given to Yale University 's archives .
Last week he played it to a group of students and reporters at a small university theater .
The fact that the Guard got direct orders to set , aim and shoot flies directly in the face of the official cover story that they were responding in panic to a random shot fired at them , or that they were defending themselves from some kind of student attack .
In fact , it seems highly likely no shot ever rang out prior to the order to fire .
Nor could the Guard , who killed a student as much as 900 feet away from the rally , say they were under any serious attack from the students .
The Kent State killings are now prominently featured in virtually every history book of the United States used in American schools .
The accounts often include the famous photo of an anguished Mary Ann Vecchio crying for help next to the dead body of student protestor Jeffrey Miller .
( They were 265 feet away from where the shot that killed Miller was fired . )
Rendered into song by Neil Young 's classic " Ohio , " there are few more definitive moments in the history of this nation .
But meaningful analysis of the implications of this tape has been mysteriously missing from the American media .
The Associated Press did carry a widely - runstory about the surfacing of this evidence , as did National Public Radio .
But the Columbus Dispatch , in Ohio 's capital , buried the report on page A - 5 under the innocuous headline " Victim shares audio tape of Kent State shootings . "
Virtually absent from the major US media has been a concerted examination of the fact that the keystone in this monumental American saga has been re-set .
For we now know that a premeditated , unprovoked order was indeed given to National Guardsmen to fire live ammunition at peaceful , unarmed American students , killing four of them .
The illegal order to arm the Guard with live ammunition in the first place could only have come from the governor of Ohio .
The very loud , very public nod to shoot some " brown shirt " students somewhere in order to chill the massive student uprising against the Southeast Asian war was spewed all over the national media by the second - highest official in US government .
Now the magnitude of Kent State 's impact on American politics and culture , already immense , has been significantly deepened .
Alan Canfora intends to use this tape to re-open investigations into what happened at Kent State 37 years ago .
But the media 's apparent unconcern about confirmation of the official order to carry out these killings may bear a simple message : that we should be prepared for them to happen again .

You kind of have to enjoy the way that , no matter what happens , no matter how weak his position is George W. Bush stays the same petulant bullying brat he always has been , and shows that it 's not just Iraq where he can't change tactics .
President George W. Bush assailed the Democratic - led Congress on Saturday for challenging him over funding the Iraq war and the firing of federal prosecutors , and demanded that lawmakers back down .
- Reuters
Oooh , he demanded !
Showing that even some Republicans have stopped quaking in fear when Bush stomps his foot and demands things , this morning 's Sunday talk shows featured Senators Arlen Specter , Chuck Hagel , and Lindsey Graham all criticizing the handling of the prosecutor firings and calling for compromise on whether and under what circumstances Karl Rove and others would testify to Congress .
( The compromises they suggested were n't adequate , mind you , but it 's significant that they 're not standing with Bush on this . )
Bush 's twin blasts against the Democrats marked a striking departure from weeks of trying to foster a cooperative spirit with them to make progress on immigration law overhaul , energy initiatives and health care .
White House officials said Bush still wants progress on those issues , but felt compelled to lay down markers on principles close to his heart : the separation of powers between the White House and the legislative branch and his role as commander in chief in charge of the Iraq war .
- Reuters again
" Principles close to his heart " - read , " I 'm the decider . "
That 's his principle , that no matter the polls , no matter the stinging electoral rebuke dealt him and his party in November , he only ever has to pretend to compromise , and others must always submit to him if he really wants something .
He seemingly can't acknowledge , even to himself , that things have changed , and that demanding things is no longer enough .
Like a playground bully , he 'll keep blustering and fighting and striking out wherever he thinks he sees weakness , and that 's exactly why Democrats have to continue standing strong .
Because his only principle is that he should always get what he wants .
Sun continues to hold Java 's copyright and will retain final say on what becomes part of the official Java platform , but the company is now welcoming submissions from developers willing to grant Sun joint copyright ownership of their code .
Some partners are ready to sign on the dotted line .
Terracotta , a San Francisco ISV , would love to see its Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) clustering technology become a bundled part of the Java platform .
Its initial efforts to attract Sun 's attention proved fruitless , but once Sun began considering open - source options earlier this year , the company 's attitude shifted , according to Terracotta founder Ari Zilka .
" It 's easy to find [ Sun ] and interface with them now .
We do n't have to convince a huge monolithic software company .
We have to convince a few people , " Zilka said .
" It 's a lightweight process .
It turns from an 18 - month conversation into an 18 - week conversation , and the community now has a stronger voice . "
Zilka said he'd be happy to share Terracotta 's copyrights with Sun .
The open - source model resonates with him : Terracotta offers its software free and begins charging for it when customers move the technology into production .
" I understand why Sun is doing this .
The way the Java community is right now , you earn the right to make money , then you start charging , " Zilka said .
After years of enduring a wary relationship with the open - source community , Sun appears ready to embrace the enthusiastic masses .
On Monday , the Santa Clara , Calif. , company grandly laid claim to being one of the largest open - source contributors in the industry , thanks to the millions of lines of code Java comprises .
For years , Java has been surrounded by a fringe community of outliers doing unsanctioned , innovative work .
Now those developers will have the opportunity to integrate their work with the Java mainstream .
They include people like Jim Pick , who maintains an open - source JVM called Kaffe .
" I think this kills [ Microsoft ] .
Net , " Pick said .
It also may kill momentum behind his own project , but Pick does n't care .
While those looking for a JVM now will have access to Sun 's official version , Pick said he 'll maintain Kaffe as long as users remain interested in the project .
Meanwhile , Pick is looking forward to a Java renaissance .
" Look at all the projects over the years that should have gone into Java but did n't because they were n't on Sun 's agenda , " he said .
" It 's stuff that would have revolutionized the industry .
People will now be able to publish it , distribute it , have it find its audience and take off .
You can't do that without a free - software approach . "
For Windows users making the switch over to Ubuntu , one of the first task to learn is how to add and remove software packages .
In the Windows world , installing software applications is easily accomplished by running the setup program and using Add / Remove program to manage all software installed on the system .
Security updates are usually installed using Windows update program .
On Ubuntu , the equivalent to all of the above is to use a package manager that installs , uninstalls , and keeps track of all the components each piece of software needs .
To accomplish this when using GNOME , two package managers can be used : Aptitude for command line package management and Synaptic for graphical management .
In Part 1 , we 'll look at Synaptic .
Synaptic Management
While many tools exist to manage software packages , for Windows users , it 's best to get used to one tool .
Luckily Synaptic can help with the learning curve .
To open Synaptic , click Systems \ Administration \ Synaptic Package Manager ( Synaptic requires root privileges and you will be prompted for your password to access ) , or from the command line :
sudo synaptic ( and enter your password when prompted )
The main window is divided into several sections .
The left sidebar displays the different package categories starting with All , then followed by each individual category .
As you click on each catagory , the upper right window pane will display all packages available for the selected catagory .
Installed packages will show with the checked boxed filled in .
Clicking on a package will display information about the package below and right clicking on a package will display all necessary information such as version , dependencies , location of installed files , description , etc .
Configure Synaptic
In Ubuntu , packages reside in package repositories that includes all software and updates that can be installed .
Sort of a central one stop shopping for software so you do not need to hunt around the Internet .
Before starting , a couple of changes need to be made to download from the repository , include downloads for third party tools , and other settings .
In Synaptic Package Manager , click Setting \ Repository ( root privileges is required and you will be prompted to enter your password ) from the menu .
Ubuntu Software Tab
If you had installed Ubuntu from a CDROM , uncheck the check box under Installable from CDrom / DVD ( circled in above screen shot ) .
This will switch to using repositories on the Internet instead of the CDROM .
Do not click close or exit just yet .
Next , you may want to add or remove extra software repositories to your system ( 4 repositories shown in above screenshot , directly above Cdrom option ) .
Below list the different repositories and the pros and cons as why you may want to add them :
MAIN – Canonical - supported Open Source Software – contains all of the default Ubuntu packages , that have been tested and officially support by the official Ubuntu Project team .
Leave enabled since this is considered safe .
Universe – Community - maintained Open Source software – because of the amount of testing required by the official Ubuntu Project team , Ubuntu distribution only contains a subset of Debians software .
Universe is a subcategory that contains community software that has been packaged by supporters of Ubuntu .
While there is a small amount of risk , it is safe to enable universe since the community does an excellent job of testing and fixing bugs .
RESTRICTED – Proprietary drivers for devices – reserved for software that is commonly used and supported by the Ubuntu Project team .
Some of the software may not be completely available under a free license , therefore may not be completly supported by the team .
This software is included because it is considered essential for Ubuntu to run on certain hardware , but is kept completely separate to it can be easily removed .
It is safe to enable this repository .
Multiverse – contains packages that are considered copyright or includes licenses that need to be purchased and are not free .
Disable this repository if you only want to use free open source software and not have to worry about licenses or copyright infringements .
Updates Tab
In the Updates tab , you will want to leave the first two boxes checked under the Ubuntu updates section .
Next set the update frequency you prefer or leave it at the default of daily .
It 's best to leave the Only notify about available updates checked to provide a safety net so you know exactly what is being installed or have the option to uncheck and not install ( for Windows users this is the equivalent of Automatic updates for patches ) .
The remaining tabs , do not need to be configured at this time .
Click the Close button , then click Close again in the Repository changed window .
In the toolbar , click on the Reload button to download any updates .
Installing Packages
Now to install packages , start scrolling through the list or use the search tool , and as you find packages to install right click and select Mark for Installation ( note you can mark more than one package to install at a time ) .
When packages are selected , click the Apply button on the toolbar .
Synaptic will display a prompt of which packages will be installed along with other information and automatically download and install all selected programs .
Synaptic will also prompt you if a package depends on another package to install and ask to approve the installation .
Remove Packages
To remove packages , just find the package , right click and select Mark for Removal ( to leave behind any config files that may have changed ) or select Mark for Complete Removal ( to remove everything , including config files ) .
Multiple packages can also be selected and uninstalled at a time .
Update Packages
One nice feature of Synaptic is the capability to update packages .
Simply click the Mark all Upgrade button on the toolbar .
Synaptic will mark any packages that need updating , then download and install them for you after you click Apply .
You should run update periodically to make sure you have the latest fixes and security patches .
Setting Synaptic Preferences
Now that you are becoming familiar with Synaptic , you may want to customize the settings to your preference .
To configure , select Settings \ Preferences from the menu .
Preferences includes five tabs , General , Columns and Fonts , Colors , Files , Network and Distributions .
Configure these options to your preference or leave them at their default settings .
When finished , click Ok to save settings .
As a Window user testing or switching over to Ubuntu , using Synaptic to manage , add and remove applications and patches makes package management on a Linux based operating system simple .
In part 2 , we 'll look at managing packages from the command using Aptitude which will become very userfull for remote management or automating using scripts .
As cells age , their protein composition changes .
Two recent papers address these changes : the first addresses the proteome of colon epithelia , and the second focuses on a specific chemical modification in the proteins of the cerebellum .
Li et al. perform a comprehensive analysis of the colon epithelial proteome over the course of aging .
The approach is intellectually straightforward with few surprises , but it ’s technically sound , and I think it ’s important for biogerontologists to appreciate how far proteomic technology has come — the approach used by these authors could be applied to any system of interest , comparing the old and young states and allowing us to learn about the mechanisms of age - related change in our favorite tissues :
In order to screen the aging related proteins in human normal colon epithelia , the comparative proteomics analysis was applied to get the two - dimensional electrophoresis ( 2 - DE ) profiles with high resolution and reproducibility from normal colon epithelial tissues of young and aged people .
Differential proteins between the colon epithelia of two age groups were found with PDQuest software .
The thirty five differential protein - spots were identified by peptide mass fingerprint ( PMF ) based on matrix - assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( MALDI - TOFMS ) and database searching .
…
The identified differential proteins appear to be involved in metabolism , energy generation , chaperone , antioxidation , signal transduction , protein folding and apoptosis .
The data will help to understand the molecular mechanisms of human colon epithelial aging .
The second paper , also a good example of the best technology and technique currently available , focuses not on differential protein expression but rather on differences in the chemical alteration of cellular protein .
The specific alteration of interest here is nitration , a marker of oxidative stress .
Gokulrangan et al. :
3 - Nitrotyrosine ( 3 - NT ) is a useful biomarker of increasing oxidative stress and protein nitration during biological aging .
The proteomic analysis of cerebellar homogenate from Fisher 344 / Brown Norway ( BN / F1 ) rats shows an age - dependent increase in protein nitration …
When proteins were separated by solution isoelectrofocusing and analyzed by NSI MS / MS , we obtained MS / MS spectra of 3 - NT containing peptides of four proteins – similar to ryanodine receptor 3 , low density lipoprotein related receptor 2 , similar to nebulin - related anchoring protein isoform C and 2,3 cyclic nucleotide 3 - phosphodiesterase .
Although the functional consequences of protein nitration for these targets are not yet known , our proteomic experiments serve as a first screen for the more targeted analysis of nitrated proteins from aging cerebellum for functional characterization .
Studies of this latter kind are an important complement to the sort represented by the former kind : Covalent modifications such as nitration ( and oxidation , and glycation , and ubiquitination , and sumoylation , and … ) can dramatically alter protein function , but they are not encoded in the genome ; hence this information is lost in a simple enumeration of the identities and abundances of every protein in the cell .
In order to understand the peculiarities of aging cells ’ behavior , we must learn not only about their gene expression and proteome but also the condition in which the macromolecules find themselves at any given point in time .
Given the relatively low overall yield of corn ethanol per acre , several alternatives have been proposed .
These include the growing of soybeans , rapeseed and safflower to produce biodiesel .
With some of these crops yields can range anywhere from 3 - 7 times that from corn ethanol per acre and have several other advantages including a much better EROEI .
The one that caught my eye though was the proposal to convert algae into biodiesel .
Several posts on TOD have referred to algae as holding more promise for biodiesel production , but I had yet to see any substantive proof of its feasibility .
I spent several hours over the last few days researching this and I found some interesting facts that I thought I would share on TOD .
The bulk of these findings are based on Dr. Krassen Dimitrov ’s work .
I invited him to present a summary of his work at TOD but he suggested I do it .
He even suggested I “ link it ’ to me .
Talk about not taking credit !
My role was to verify his calculations , make a synopsis and add additional information that I learned on this subject .
I also communicated with Dr. Briggs at UNH about this and his views are included .
The last 2 years have seen a major global push towards the use of biofuels .
This has included corn , soybeans , sugarcane , sunflower and rapeseed among others .
The U.S. Government has mandated an increased usage of ethanol in gasoline , which has resulted in a boom in the construction of corn - to - ethanol plants .
The short - sightedness of this policy can be seen by anyone not standing for reelection to the US Senate .
Soaring demand has led to a more than 60 % increase in corn prices .
These price increases have , however , not deterred the ethanol industry , which continues to add more and more corn - to - ethanol plants to the drawing board .
While industry estimates vary it is quite likely that we could be using more than 50 % of the total domestic corn production to supply less than 10 % of the national demand for gasoline by 2010 .
Editor ’s note by HO :
There has been the occasional discussion of algae as a possible source of biofuels .
The interest in this topic is continuing to increase , and thus , when fireangel sent in this piece , it seemed to me to be appropriate to consider allowing the piece to be posted as a guest post .
At the end I will have some concluding remarks ( I had mentioned that I would , and this is acceptable ) , but for now , let me step back and yield the floor .
During the oil crisis of the 1970s , Congress funded the National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) within the Department of Energy to investigate alternative fuels and energy sources .
The Aquatic Species Program ( ASP ) focused on the production of biodiesel from high lipid - content algae growing in outdoor ponds .
These programs also used carbon - dioxide from coal fired plants to increase the growth rate and lipid content of algae .
They estimated that under optimum growing conditions micro-algae will produce up to 4 lbs./ sq. ft./ year or 15,000 gallons of oil / acre / year .
Micro-algae are the fastest growing photosynthesizing organisms .
They can complete an entire growing cycle every few days .
Based on this one can extrapolate that it would take about 10 million acres to produce 145 billion gallons of biodiesel which could supply the entire US gasoline requirements ( assuming gasoline powered vehicles could be replaced over time ) .
That is just 2.3 % of total area used to grow crops in the US !
So why is n’t someone doing something constructive in this field ?
There are at least 4 different ventures in the works , including Aquaflow Bionomic , Solio Biofuels , GS Cleantech , and GreenFuel Technologies .
GreenFuel seems to be the most advanced in mass commercialization of this technology .
GreenFuel Technologies along with De Beers in South Africa ( no relationship to the diamond miner ) have been making some rather audacious claims on this front .
As mentioned here they plan to single handedly make peakists shake in their boots .
Greenfield / De Beers plan to produce about 391,000 barrels per day in 5 years .
That is no chump change .
There are just a couple of major oil fields coming online within the next 5 years which produce anywhere close to that .
So Should Chris Skrewbowski start including De Beers in his mega projects list ?
Not so fast .
According to GreenFuel ’s patent application a 1.3 sq. km. plant can generate 342,000 barrels of biodiesel per year .
Now , I am not very familiar with km - acre relationship so I had to look it up .
I got my wife to double check my numbers as I kept believing I screwed up somewhere .
GreenFuel claims to be able to produce 45,000 gallons / acre / year .
I have converted these to an easy to compare number to that of APS above .
So GreenFuel is thus claiming to do 3 fold as well as , the highest estimate under super - optimistic conditions that has never been produced on a large scale .
Also , ASP had dismissed closed photo bioreactors has prohibitively expensive but it was not clear what price of oil they were taking into their equation .
This last alliance of GreenFuel and De Beers which is making it ’s stand against the dark forces of peak oil is even convincing the common public that it can do this .
De Beer ’s has sold shares to the common public ( without a prospectus ) and 29 franchises to build 91 plants ( for 6 Million Rand each ) .
Additionally they guarantee that each plant will produce more than 850 barrels of biodiesel per day .
Let ’s examine their claims in light of ( pun intended ) how much lipid photosynthetic organisms can synthesize .
Photosynthetic organisms ( PO ) , such as algae , transform visible light in the 400 - 700 nm part of the spectrum - called photosynthetically active radiation ( PAR ) - into the chemical energy of carbon - containing compounds .
PAR varies with latitude , seasonality and geographical factors .
PAR in the southwest US is about 105w / s
The energy - in the form of biomass - that can be obtained via photosynthesis thus depends on the level of PAR and the efficiency of the conversion process Q .
Ebiomass = PAR x Q
Photosynthetic organisms use eight photons to capture one molecule of CO2 into carbohydrate ( CH2O ) n
Given that one mole of CH2O has a heating value of 468 kJ and that the mean energy of a mole of PAR photons is 217.4 kJ , then the maximum theoretical conversion efficiency of PAR energy into carbohydrates is :
468 kJ /(8 x 217.4kJ ) = 27 %
This is the ideal yield on PAR energy that is : ( i ) actually absorbed by the photosynthetic organism , ( ii ) in conditions where this organism operates with 100 % photosynthetic efficiency ( every photon that is absorbed is effectively used in photosynthetic reactions ) , and ( iii ) the organism does not waste any energy on any life - support functions , other than building biomass .
We will call this efficiency Qtheo .
If 27 % is theoretical maximum , then what is most likely ?
Dr. Dimitrov presents reasonable evidence to suggest that Q is likely to be around 10 % at best .
While that to some may sound like he is being overly pessimistic , it is my belief that he is in fact being a bit optimistic .
Here are his assumptions ,
90 % photosynthetic efficiency i.e how well an organism avoids photosaturation ... Q= 24.3
80 % conversion of this amount for us ..i.e the plant uses 28 % energy for its own needs ... Q=19.44
70 % optical efficiency of the process , which measures optical coefficient , cleanliness and reflection of light from reactor wall ..
Q=13.60
98 % efficiency in coverting biomass to biodiesel ..
Q=13.33
98 % plant efficiency ( 2 % down time ) Q=13.06
I have studied these in depth and I believe that getting anything over 15 % is going to be an impossible task in the near future .
A more likely situation is that Q will be around 10 .
Applying this to PAR of 105w/s/ sq.m or 3.3GJ / yr/sq.m. we get a maximum biofuel energy content of 0.89 GJ / yr .
Now , biodiesel has an energy content of 0.133 GJ / gallon .
Greenfuel says that they plan on getting 342,000 bbl per year from a 1.3 sq km plant .
That is an energy content of 1.47 GJ / sq.m/yr .
The more likely scenario is ,
Now , Heading
Out pointed out that the PBR design consists of inclined tubes and hence I am underestimating the yields in a given area because of that .
Based on their pilot plant I have to agree that he is right .
But , when you are talking about miles and miles of these then the vertical height of these individual columns acts as a limiting factor .
If you picture another set of these columns behind the first one , you will see that it 's proximity to the first one would affect it 's access to sunlight .
To access sunlight perfectly it would have to be a significant distance away .
Hence GreenField cannot improve yields / sq.m by going vertical , except perhaps in its pilot plant .
So if we assume the above numbers are correct the that 's 1.2 gallons / sq.m./yr or about 5000 gallons / acre /yr
The other 50 % is proteins and carbohydrates which would have some food value .
Dr. Dimitrov assumes lower price for this portion derived from algae and based on present prices he is right .
However I believe that the food and fuel markets are merging .
Let me explain my position on this .
Higher oil prices will result in higher corn prices ( as more is used for ethanol ) and this will impact food prices across the spectrum .
On the other hand if we have a bad corn harvest and ethanol becomes unprofitable and companies cut back on production , it will decrease supply enough to push oil / gasoline prices higher to the point we start using corn to make ethanol again .
Hence assigning a $ 2.5 a gallon price on biodiesel and $ 1.50 on protein and food derivatives we get revenues of $ 4.8/ sq.m / year .
Let 's look at the costs of this revenue .
GreenFuel ’s PBR design .
The largest cost is of course going to be the construction of the plant .
GreenFuel promises to use polycarbonate tubes for its construction , which have installed costs as high as $ 190/ sq.m .
However since GreenFuel plans to build at least 91 of these massive plants I am going to give them a lower cost of $ 150 assuming that they can negotiate huge discounts .
Polycarbonate is the best choice as it has excellent PAR transmission but blocks UV much better than acrylic or glass making it ideal for grwoing algae .
Next are the land costs .
Dr. Dimitrov generously assumes they can get the land for free .
If the US starts taxing carbon emissions then maybe there is a remote possibility for getting land for free next to carbon dioxide spewing power plants .
I too will give them the benefit of the doubt here but we must remember that this is likely to work against them .
Large amounts of land at specific locations with great sunlight and fresh water availability are not cheap .
Next we consider the operational and maintenance costs .
These include personnel costs for repair and cleaning and costs for parts and repairs .
Assuming 0.03 full time employee 's per 1000sq.m , that translates into $ 1.20 / sq.m/yr ( assuming total costs of $ 40,000 per employee , including healthcare and other benefits ) .
These costs were obtained by using the costs for maintaining sun-tracking heliostats such as those used in concentrated solar power .
The costs for operating GreenFuel 's plant are likely to be about the same assuming they use neutral buoyancy spheres to clean inner surface .
All other costs including administrative , parts and labour , quality testing , transesterification , water , pH control total up to about 0.60 / sq.m .
These are again the costs for concentrated solar power generation ( $ 0.50 ) with zero costs assigned to water and pH control .
Transesterification costs are assumed to be just $ 0.10 , which is 30 % lower than any number I could find from many different studies .
Some put this as high as ( $ 0.50 ) .
Suffice to say that these costs are extremely low compared to real numbers .
Adding it up we get a total cost of about $ 1.8/sq.m/yr .
That leaves gross profit of $ 3.00 .
That means at current prices it would take 50 years to just cut even on their investment .
That is clearly not feasible .
For one thing these polycarbonate sheets take a lot of UV damage and their useful life is almost always less than 15 years ( usually 10 years ) .
Also whoever is investing for 15 years would be crazy to want a zero return on their investment .
Even if someone had some philanthropic goals it would be inflation adjusted returns of zero .
Even making assumptions of 6 % inflation ( whoever believes the official CPI needs to get their head examined ) and zero returns requires oil prices greater than $ 240 a barrel !!
So great we have a technology which will save us once oil prices get high enough , right ?
That assumption too would be a mistake as at $ 240 a barrel , polycarbonate costs are probably going to be a lot higher .
Ditto for repairs and parts .
Labour may be cheaper if $ 240 a barrel results in massive unemployment .
Also , I would like to point out that going vertical will not affect GreenFuel 's costs .
From these calculations it is apparent that the limiting factor is the cost of polycarbonate .
Also , if the world tries this on a massive scale it is likely to put immense pressure on the polycarbonate market and hence its price .
For a closed system polycarbonate is the best choice .
Everything else reduces yields .
However if there is something that gives good cost to yield trade off it might be a better idea than Green Fuel 's choice .
After going through a few studies done by different institutions I have found that there quite a few technological hurdles which need to be cleared even if costs can be brought down .
1 ) Low yields ( in spite of optimum conditions )
2 ) Contamination
3 ) Lack of water in areas with best sunlight
4 ) Low Lipid content of algae
5 ) Open small pond method is problematic due to repeated contamination and much lower yields
6 ) Energy required to constantly move large amounts of algae within the photo bioreactor is likely to be extensive
7 ) Low yields would also hurt GreenFuel ’s potential carbon sequestration credits , should they ever get those
I communicated with Dr Briggs at UNH about Dr. Dimitrov ’s work .
His position was
1 ) GreenFuel is drastically overstating its potential yield .
He was not aware of the exact claims as the patent application is incredibly confusing in that area .
I was happy to point out the exact points made .
2 ) However 15,000 gallons / acre is achievable
3 ) Q=10 % is unnecessarily too low
4 ) More by - product credit needs to be applied for non-lipid content
5 ) PBR costs may be different than that used by him , but costs need to come down substantially
6 ) He also made an important point about meat prices which I thought was interesting .
He felt that the corn to ethanol boom would result in higher meat prices and that was a good thing as meat is ridiculously cheap compared to fruits and vegetables .
Since it takes 10 times as much land and energy to produce a certain amount of calories from meat as from grains , he feels meat should be priced much higher
My remarks ,
1 ) needs no comment .
2 ) at what cost and how ?
Can this be done on a mass scale ?
3 ) I adjusted theoretical Q to 13 based on some of his comments .
But I am reluctant to adjust my base case of Q=10 to higher levels as it seems unrealistic .
15,000 gallons ( 3 x our base case yields , with Q at maximum possible ) may be possible in areas where PAR is much higher .
Also if we are to do this on a large scale we will be utilizing land everywhere and not just in the southwest .
Hence average PAR is likely to be a lot lower .
If 15,000 gallons can be achieved then too with current prices and using a modest 6 % inflation return the plant is likely to be unprofitable .
However with those yields at twice current prices things start looking a lot better .
Even under our most optimistic scenarios at current prices things do not look too promising .
As Robert Rapier 's Thermal Depolymerization post showed , costs are more likely to be underestimated than overestimated .
4 ) I have tripled the by - product credits given by Dr. Dimitrov
5 ) I have reduced costs of construction by 20 % .
6 ) I am in total agreement with him on this .
As the third world countries continue increasing their meat consumption this might happen sooner than we think .
In conclusion it seems that while their intentions may be heroic , GreenFuel and De Beers have promised way more than they can possibly deliver .
I am so confident of this that I would love to extend a familiar $ 1000 bet on this .
Unfortunately as seen here , no one can verify how much any of Green Fuel 's plants produce at any time .
The future may hold a lot of promise for this technology though .
A cheaper replacement for polycarbonate along with setting up reactors in third world countries with more PAR and cheaper labor may make this very realistic .
Maybe we will read something like this in 2025 .
“ Biodiesel prices rose on the MUMEX ( Mumbai mercantile exchange ) as India pledged to cut production to balance out the glut in inventories .
India ’s biodiesel minister was quoted as saying “ $ 600 a barrel is a fair and equitable price . ”
Saudi Arabia which just turned importer last month is complaining that the high prices are wrecking its fragile economy and threatened to finally start using its Trillion barrel of “ proved “ resources to destroy the Biodiesel cartel . ”
A small end note from Heading Out .
If one reads the patent claims for this process that are referenced above it can be seen that the program considers the use of artificial light as part of the source of the energy input .
Given that the plant is being established at a power station , this energy cost may be small , and the land may be available at the plant .
There is some information on the plant that is installed in South Africa here and here and the coming US operation here .
My apologies that current time constraints have limited my input to this .
A Justice Department spokesman said Thursday that Mr. Gonzales did not remember the discussions cited in the e-mail .
“ The attorney general has no recollection of any plan or discussion to replace U.S. attorneys while he was still White House counsel , ” said Tasia Scolinos , the department spokeswoman .
“ The period of time referred to in the e-mail was during the weeks he was preparing for his confirmation hearing , Jan. 6 , 2005 , and his focus was on that , ” Ms. Scolinos said .
“ Discussions of changes in presidential appointees would have been appropriate and normal White House exchanges in the days and months after the election as the White House was considering different personnel changes administrationwide . ”
When the Rove inquiry described in the Jan. 6 e-mail message — sent by Colin Newman , a White House lawyer , to David G. Leitch , another lawyer — was forwarded to Mr. Sampson , then a top aide in the Justice Department , he replied with an outline of his thinking , as presented to Mr. Gonzales .
“ As an operational matter we would like to replace 15 - 20 percent of the current U.S. attorneys — underperforming ones , ” Mr. Sampson wrote .
In the message , Mr. Sampson said , “ The vast majority of U.S. Attorneys , 80 - 85 percent , I would guess , are doing a great job , are loyal Bushies , etc . ”
Even then , Mr. Sampson realized there might be a backlash caused by replacing a large number of prosecutors and said it would be “ weird ” to remove prosecutors before they had completed a single four - year term .
“ I suspect that when push comes to shove , ” he wrote , “ home state senator likely would resist wholesale ( or even piecemeal ) replacement of U.S. Attorney they recommended . ”
The White House and Justice Department have defended the dismissals as appropriate , pointing out that the prosecutors are political appointees who serve at the pleasure of the president .
But some of the fired prosecutors told Congress that Republican lawmakers had pressed them about corruption or voter fraud investigations , provoking charges from Democrats that the dismissals may have been political and that they threatened the traditional independence of the prosecutors .
The White House has said Mr. Rove passed on complaints to the White House counsel ’s office , and perhaps to Mr. Bush , about prosecutors ’ failure to investigate voter fraud cases .
He also pushed for the appointment of a former aide as the United States attorney in Arkansas , which outraged local officials and the state ’s senators because the prosecutor , J. Timothy Griffin , had limited experience .
Introduction
We see it all around us , recently .
Web applications get niftier by the day by utilising the various new techniques recently introduced in a few web - browsers , like I.E. and Firefox .
One of those new techniques involves using Javascript .
More specifically , the XmlHttpRequest - class , or object .
Webmail applications use it to quickly update the list of messages in your Inbox , while other applications use the technology to suggest various search - queries in real - time .
All this without reloading the main , sometimes image - and banner - ridden , page .
( That said , it will most probably be used by some of those ads as well . )
Before we go into possible weaknesses and things to keep in mind when implementing an AJAX enabled application , first a brief description of how this technology works .
The Basics
Asynchronous Javascript and XML , dubbed AJAX is basically doing this .
Let me illustrate with an example , an email application .
You are looking at your Inbox and want to delete a message .
Normally , in plain HTML applications , the POST or GET request would perform the action , and re-locate to the Inbox , effectively reloading it .
With the XmlHttpRequest - object , however , this request can be done while the main page is still being shown .
In the background a call is made which performs the actual action on the server , and optionally responds with new data .
( Note that this request can only be made to the web - site that the script is hosted on : it would leave massive DoS possibilities if I can create an HTML page that , using Javascript , can request thousands of concurrent web - pages from a web - site .
You can guess what happens if a lot of people would visit that page . )
The Question
Some web - enabled applications , such as for email , do have pretty destructive functionality that could possibly be abused .
The question is — will the average AJAX - enabled web - application be able to tell the difference between a real and a faked XmlHttpRequest ?
Do you know if your recently developed AJAX - enabled or enhanced application is able to do this ?
And if so — does it do this adequately ?
Do you even check referrers or some trivial token such as the user - agent ?
Chances are you do not even know .
Chances are that other people , by now , do .
To be sure that the system you have implemented — or one you are interested in using — is properly secured , thus trustworthy , one has to ‘ sniff around ’ .
Incidentally , the first time I discovered such a thing was in a lame preview function for a lame ringtone - site .
Basically , the XmlHttpRequest URI ’s ‘ len ’ parameter specified the length of the preview to generate and it seemed like it was loading the original file .
Entering this URI in a browser ( well , actually , ‘ curl ‘ ) , specifying a very large value , one could easily grab all the files .
This is a fatal mistake : implement an AJAX interface accepting GET requests .
GET requests are the easiest to fake .
More on this later .
The question is — can we perform an action while somebody is logged in somewhere else .
It is basically XSS / CSS ( Cross Site Scripting ) but then again , it is n’t .
My Prediction
Some popular applications I checked are hardened in such a way that they use some form of random sequence numbering : the server tells it , encoded , what the application should use as a sequence number when sending the next command .
This is mostly obscured by Javascript and a pain in the ass to dissect — but not impossible .
And as you may have already noted : if there is improper authentication on the location called by the XmlHttpRequest - object , this would leave a possibility for malicious purpose .
This is exactly where we can expect weaknesses and holes to arise .
There should be proper authentication in place .
At all times .
As all these systems are built by men , chances are this is n’t done properly .
HTTP traffic analysis
Analysing HTTP traffic analysis with tools like ethereal ( yeh I like GUIs so sue me ) surely comes in handy to figure out whether applications you use are actually safe from exploitation .
This application allows one to easily filter and follow TCP streams so one can properly analyse what is happening there .
If you want to investigate your own application , the use of a sniffer is n’t even necessary but I would suggest you let a colleague that has n’t implemented it , play around with your app and a sniffer in an attempt to ‘ break ’ through it .
Cookies
Cookies are our friend when it comes to exploiting , I mean researching any vulnerabilities in AJAX implementations .
If the XmlHttp - interface is merely protected by cookies , exploiting this is all the easier : the moment you get the browser to make a request to that website , your browser is happily sending any cookies along with it .
Back to my earlier remark about a GET - requests being a pretty lame implementation : from a developers point of view , I can imagine one temporary accepts GET requests to be able to easily debug stuff without having to constantly enter irritating HTTP data using telnet .
But when you are done with it you really should disable it immediately !
I could shove a GET request hidden in an image link .
Sure the browser does n’t understand the returned data which might not even be an image .
But my browser does happily send any authenticating cookies , and the web - application on the other end will have performed some operation .
Using GET is a major mistake - a- to - make .
POST is a lot better , as it harder to fake .
The XmlHttpRequest can easily do a POST .
But I can not get a script , for instance I could have embedded one in this article , to do a POST request to another website because of the earlier noted restriction : you can only request to the same web - site the web - application is on .
One can modify its own browser , to make request to other websites , but it would be hard to get the browser on somebody elses machine to do this .
Or would it ?
If proper authentication , or rather credential verification , still sucks , I can still set up a web - site that does the exact POST method that the AJAX interface expects .
That will be accepted and the operation will be performed .
Incidentally I have found a popular site that , so far , does not seem to have proper checks in place .
More on that one in another article .
Merely using cookies is again a bad idea .
One should also check the User - Agent and possibly a Referrer ( the XmlHttpRequest nicely allows one to send any additional headers so you could just put some other token in the Referrer - field ) .
Sure these can still be faked — but it may fend off some investigating skiddiots .
Sequence Numbering , kinda …
A possible way of securing one ’s application is using some form of ‘ sequence - numbering ’- like scheme .
Roughly , this boils down to this .
One should let the page , or some include javascript , generated on the server side , include some token that the performs some operation on which gives a result which is used in any consecutive request to the webserver .
The webserver should not allow any request with another ‘ sequence number ’ , so to speak .
The servers ’ ‘ challenge - string ‘ should be as random as possible in order to make it non-predictable : if one could guess what the next sequence number will be , it is again wide open for abuse .
There are properly other ways of hardening interfaces like this , but they all basically come down to getting some fixed information from the webserver as far away from the end - users reach as possible .
You can implement this as complex as you want but can be implemented very basic as well .
For instance when I , as a logged - in user of a web - enabled email - application get assigned a Session - ID and stuff , the page that my browser receives includes a variable iSeq which contains an non-predictable number .
When I click “ Delete This Message ” , this number is transmitted with the rest of the parameters .
The server can then respond with new data and , hidden in the cookies or other HTTP Requests field , pass the next sequence number that the web - server will accept as a valid request , only .
As far as I know , these seems the only way of securing it .
This can still be abused if spyware sniffs HTTP communications — which they recently started doing .
Javascript Insertion
On a side note I wanted to throw in a remark on Javascript Insertion .
This is an old security violation and not really restricted to AJAX , and not an attack on AJAX .
Rather , it is an attack utilising the XmlHttpRequest object for malice .
If I would be able to insert Javascript in the web - application I am currently looking at in my other browser window , I would be able to easily delete any post the site allows me to delete .
Now that does n’t seem all that destructive as it only affects that user ?
Wrong , any user visiting will have its own posts deleted .
Ouch .
Javascript insertion has been a nasty one for years and it still is when people throw their home - brew stuff into production .
On a weak implemented forum or web - journal , one could even post new messages — including the Javascript so that any visitor — with the proper permission — would re-post the message keeping the flood of spam coming .
As these technologies keep developing — and lazy website developers do not update their websites to keep up with these changes .
The recent ‘ AJAX enhancements ’ that some sites got recently might have been improperly implemented .
This year might be a good time to check all those old web - applications for any possible Javascript insertion tricks .
If you did n’t mind the cookies getting caught — the sudden deletion of random items and / or public embarrassment might be something to entice you to verify your the code .

One of the new lava streams created on the island , just north of Sicily , has already started flowing into the sea .
Coastguard patrol boats have been deployed and the population of 750 people has been urged to stay away from the danger areas .
The last major eruption in 2002 caused a collapse that led to a small tsunami .
The wave reached 10 metres ( 33 ft ) high and caused serious damage to Stromboli village on the north of the island .
' Clearing zones '
The BBC's Christian Fraser in Rome says the new lava flow is heading down the west flank of the volcano and at the moment poses little risk .
But experts say it has to be watched closely .
An eruption on Stromboli in 2002 caused a small tsunami
A member of the civil defence authorities for the Aeolian Islands told Reuters news agency : " There 's a general alert .
The emergency services are monitoring the situation , clearing zones at risk .
" But at the moment we do n't foresee an evacuation . "
The volcano , which rises 2,000 metres from the ocean floor , has been active for the past 2,000 years .
Most eruptions consist of gas explosions that hurl small blobs of lava over the crater rim .
There are several explosions each hour .
The larger eruptions and lava flows are less frequent .
The one in December 2002 forced the closure of the island to visitors for a number of months .
Fair is fair ... or is it ?
The Sony Betamax Supreme Court decision was one of the most important " fair use " decisions of the last 25 years , but it 's been a constant source of frustration for Marybeth Peters , the Register of Copyrights in the US since 1994 .
As head of the Copyright Office , Peters is in charge of the triennial DMCA anticircumvention review process .
And every three years , her office sees the Sony case used as the basis for the most popular requested exemption : DVD ripping .
Marybeth Peters
Each time the Copyright Office deals with the issue , consumer groups contend that fair use rights to use the material on DVDs are being violated by access controls , and they want an exemption in order to back up discs or to use video clips in noninfringing ways .
After all , did n't the Sony case put an official blessing on all recording equipment that had substantial noninfringing uses ?
Does n't this mean that consumers have a right to use DVD rippers and that an anticircumvention exception should therefore be made for all DVDs ?
The EFF certainly thought so , arguing as much at the first triennial rulemaking back in 2000 .
But when I spoke with Peters about fair use , she pointed out that the Sony decision is in fact a narrow one and that fair use itself is often ambiguous unless defined by a judge .
The Court 's ruling in the Sony case was limited to " free , over - the - air television for time - shifting , " she tells Ars .
" It is not space - shifting ; it 's not anything beyond that .
It 's not off cable , it 's not off video - on - demand , and yet if you talk to most consumers , they think that anything they do in the home that comes through their television set is fair use . "
" That becomes a consumer expectation that you hear about that they want enabled , " she continues , " and I do n't disagree with that ; that 's what the market is demanding , and that 's what the market should provide , but do n't call it fair use . "
" I do n't want to say it 's a crapshoot "
Her comment points out that fair use in the US can be a vague concept .
Section 107 of the Copyright
Act allows for the fair use of material " for purposes such as criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching ( including multiple copies for classroom use ) , scholarship , or research " but speaks in broad terms rather than specific instances .
Fair use can extend beyond these listed purposes ( note the " such as " statement in the law ) , but to qualify as " fair , " a use has to pass the famous four - part test , which considers the following factors :
The purpose and character of the use , including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes ;
The nature of the copyrighted work ;
The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole ; and
The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work .
What this means in practice is that people cannot know if something is fair use without testing their theory in front of a judge .
This has happened on plenty of occasions — like the Sony / Universal case that opened the door to legal VHS recordings from TV broadcasts — but these rulings are generally quite narrow , applying only to the specific circumstances of the case .
" Once a court has actually handed down a decision with regard to specific facts , " Peters says , " if you fall within those facts , you 're safe , but once you start wandering away from those facts then — I do n't want to say it 's a crapshoot — but it 's not clear . "
In the minds of many Americans , though , " fair use " means a whole host of things that are not contained in the Copyright Act or outlined in a judicial decision .
As Peters puts it , " ' fair use ' has become a shortcut for what ' I think the balance should be as I look at the copyright law . ' "
Take DVD ripping as an example .
As noted above , it 's an issue that Peters hears about without fail every three years as users seek a DMCA exemption to the anticircumvention protections that extend to DVDs .
Why has the Copyright Office rejected the proposed exemption at each triennial rulemaking to date ?
In her words , it 's because the widely - hacked CSS encryption on DVDs does not actually prevent fair use at all , and those who think otherwise do n't understand exactly what rights fair use grants them .
This is about a fix of a conceptual bug in the current version of Squeak , though it ’s the detailed analysis why this was a bug that I think is worth a blog post .
A while ago when ifNil : and ifNotNil : were not standard in the commercial Smalltalks of the day , there was an occasional argument on c.l.s now and then whether they were a good thing or superfluous sugar not providing any new functionality .
The typical case against ifNil : is something like
foo ifNil : [ self doSomething ]
which can trivially be rewritten in “ classic ” Smalltalk .
The case that is less trivial , though , is
^self foo ifNil : [ self defaultFoo ]
It ’s important that the value being tested is computed and not just fetched from a variable .
For a computed value , we cannot in the general case reduce the above to
^self foo isNil if True : [ self defaultFoo ] if False : [ self foo ]
because this would evaluate self foo twice — something we would want to avoid if self foo had side effects .
Avoiding double evaluation would call for a variable to hold onto the result of self foo :
| foo | foo := self foo . foo isNil if True : [ self defaultFoo ] if False : [ foo ]
which is significantly more verbose than the ifNil : alternative .
So , while ifNil : in this case can still be reduced to “ classic ” Smalltalk , doing so takes us down an abstraction level — from a single message doing exactly what it says to messing around with variables , tests and branches .
While in some languages such exposed plumbing is a fact of life , in Smalltalk we like to hide it when we do n’t need to deal with it directly .
Now , looking at ifNotNil : , it ’s important to note that its typical use case is different .
In fact , this is what ’s interesting about ifNil : and ifNotNil : in general — they are asymmetrical .
While ifNil : allows us to provide a useful value in the cases when the “ main ” branch of the computation returns nil , it ’s unlikely that we ’d ever use ifNotNil : in a mirrored pattern as
^self foo ifNotNil : [ nil ]
This shows that the cause of the asymmetry is the obvious fact that typically nil is used as a token indicating the absence of a value .
A non-nil object is interesting in its own right , while nil is n’t .
So , ifNotNil : is primarily useful not as a value - producing expression , but rather as a control statement that triggers computation when another expression produces a useful result , in the simplest case going as something like
foo ifNotNil : [ self doSomething
With : foo ]
This use of ifNotNil : could again be reduced to isNil if False : .
The case when the receiver of ifNotNil : is computed is more interesting because of the same problem of avoiding multiple evaluation , the obvious solution to which would again make the code much bulkier :
| foo | foo := self computeFoo. foo ifNotNil : [ self doSomething
With : foo ]
The way to hide the plumbing here is to have ifNotNil : accept a one - argument block and feed the receiver into it , allowing us to fold the above back into a single expression
self computeFoo ifNotNil : [ : foo | self doSomething With : foo ]
This illustrates another asymmetry of ifNotNil : and if Nil : — while ifNil : block needs no arguments because nil is not an “ interesting ” object , it ’s often helpful for ifNotNil : to take the non-nil receiver as argument .
A number of years ago Squeak had ifNil : and ifNotNil : implemented exactly this way .
The former would take a niladic block as the argument and the latter ( as far as I can remember ) would only accept a monadic one .
When a few years ago Eliot and I were adding the two to VisualWorks we kept almost the same pattern , extending the ifNotNil : case to also accept a niladic block .
In Squeak the two messages have since then been reimplemented as special messages , expanded by the compiler into the equivalent == nil if True :/ ifFalse : forms .
Inexplicably , in the process ifNotNil : was changed to only accept a niladic block — precisely the case that is less valuable !
Also interestingly , the fallback implementation in ProtoObject still allows a monadic block in a “ pure ” ifNotNil : but not as the ifNotNil argument of ifNil:ifNotNil : and ifNotNil:ifNil : !
Their classification under the ‘ testing ’ protocol is a minor nit in comparison .
And now for the fix .
It is available as a zip file MonadicIfNotNil.zip with two change sets .
One modifies the handling of ifNotNil : and related messages to allow monadic blocks .
The second contains the tests and should obviously be filed in after the compiler changes in the first set .
The change was fairly straightforward .
Most of the work was dancing around the original error checking code that assumes only niladic blocks are legal as arguments of macroexpanded messages .
The expansion simply promotes the block argument into a method temp , expanding
self foo ifNotNil : [ : arg | ...]
into
( arg := self foo ) ifNotNil : [...]

There ’s controversy surrounding The Journal of Spurious Correlations , a new social - science journal devoted exclusively to publishing negative results .
“ Nobody likes our name , ” says David Lehrer , a graduate student in comparative political economy at the University of Helsinki , who helped found the journal .
“ People say it ’s a bit goofy , that it should be more serious . ”
But no one questions the seriousness of its mission .
Historically , scientific journals have published only positive results — data showing one thing connected to another ( like smoking to cancer ) .
As a rule , they did n’t publish negative results ( this drug did n’t cure that disease ) .
Medical journals began publishing negative results a few years ago , but social science did n’t follow the trend .
This is a problem .
Not publishing negative results means that generations of researchers can waste time and money repeating the same studies and finding the same unpublishable results .
Then there ’s publication bias .
If , for example , a study found that welfare states have more terrorism than nonwelfare states , it would probably get published .
If eight studies did n’t find a connection between welfare and terrorism , they probably would n’t make it into print , because technically , they did n’t find anything .
So a survey of published literature might suggest that welfare and terrorism are linked , even though eight studies potentially proved otherwise .
This could have serious implications .
“ Social - science research results lead to huge , important decisions , ” Lehrer says , about free trade , for example , or government spending on weapons .
“ That should require total transparency . ”
But since no one publishes negative results , Lehrer says , those important decisions are sometimes based on biased information .
And there are data supporting his theory : early this year , a study found that the leading political - science journals are “ misleading and inaccurate due to publication bias . ”
This is a guest article by Gerry Wolff , coordinator of TREC - UK .
' TREC ' stands for the Trans - Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation , their website is at www.trecers.net .
These webisites are a fantastic source of informaion on concentrating solar power .
Introduction
It is said that , in 212 BC , Archimedes used polished bronze shields to focus sunlight , trying to set fire to wooden ships from the Roman Empire that were besieging Syracuse .
Although we do n’t know whether he succeeded , the Greek navy recreated the experiment in 1973 and managed to set fire to a wooden boat at a distance of 50 metres .
In the 16th century , Leonardo da Vinci proposed the use of concave mirrors to concentrate sunlight to heat water .
It was not until the late 19th century and early 20th century that the idea of capturing solar energy with mirrors was tried on an industrial scale in California , Egypt and other places with lots of direct sunshine .
But the era of cheap fossil fuels snuffed out these early developments and it was the mid 1980s before serious attempts were made again to apply the technique of ‘ concentrating solar power ’ ( CSP ) .
The basic idea is to arrange mirrors so that they concentrate sunlight into a relatively small area and then use the resulting heat to raise steam to drive turbines and generators , just like a conventional power station .
Direct sunlight is needed and CSP works best when sunshine is plentiful , as it is in hot deserts .
In those kinds of conditions , CSP is currently the most cost - effective way of capturing solar energy but this might change in the future with further developments in photovoltaics ( PV ) .
A nice feature of CSP is that it is possible to store solar heat in melted salts ( eg nitrates of sodium or potassium ) so that electricity generation may continue at night or on cloudy days .
This is currently a lot cheaper than flow batteries or other technologies for bulk storage of electricity .
Because CSP plants are so similar to conventional power stations , it is also possible to use gas as a stop - gap source of heat when there is not enough sun .
With heat storage and hybridisation with gas - firing , CSP plants can provide base load , intermediate load and peaking power according to need .
There are several variations on the scheme that I have outlined , including systems that use heat to drive a Stirling engine and generator , and hybrid schemes that use mirrors in conjunction with PV .

New developments and potential
2
Currently , there are CSP plants in the Mojave desert producing 354 MWe ( peak ) , and there are smallish installations elsewhere in the world .
But concerns about COemissions and future energy supplies have led to a recent surge of interest in CSP , with new plants now being planned or built around the world .
The statistics are quite startling .
Every year , each square kilometre of hot desert receives solar energy equivalent to 1.5 million barrels of oil .
Multiplying by the area of deserts worldwide , this is several hundred times the entire current energy consumption of the world .
It has been calculated that , if it was covered with CSP plants , an area of hot desert of about 254 km x 254 km—less than 1 % of the total area of such deserts - would produce as much electricity as is currently consumed by the whole world .
An area measuring 110 km x 110 km , a small fraction of the area of desert in North Africa and the Middle East , would produce the same amount of electricity as the European Union consumed in 2004 .
In a report published in January this year , the American Solar Energy Society says that “ ... analysts evaluated the solar resource in the Southwest [ of the US ] and ... found that CSP could provide nearly 7,000 GW of capacity , or about seven times the current total US electric capacity . ” ( emphasis added ) .
What has this got to do with the UK ?
Of course , the UK is not over - endowed with hot deserts and it is natural to assume that CSP is not relevant to our needs .
But for reasons that I will describe , CSP could become a major source of carbon - free energy for the UK and many other countries that do not themselves have deserts .
One possibility , which is not entirely frivolous , is to take Mahomet to the mountain : relocate energy - intensive industries so that they can make direct use of thermal or electrical energy from CSP plants in desert areas .
For example , the heat and electricity that is needed to convert bauxite into aluminium could be provided by CSP plants in the Australian desert , close to where the bauxite is mined .
Naturally , this would not assist the production of aluminium in the UK , but in the highly inter - dependent global village that we live in now , this kind of solution to energy - supply problems could be a major benefit .
Another possibility is to transport solar energy over long distances using hydrogen as an energy vector .
In principle , the hydrogen could be derived from water by the direct application of solar heat and there have been some experiments along these lines .
But until such time as this can be done efficiently on a large scale , hydrogen may be generated by the electrolysis of water using solar electricity .
Hydrogen that is produced in this way could be used as fuel for trains , road vehicles or even planes .
But if hydrogen that is derived from CSP is merely a means of recreating electricity in the UK or other distant location , then it quickly begins to lose its shine .
It has been calculated that about 75 % or more of the original electrical energy would be lost in conversions and processing that would be required between CSP electricity at its source and electricity at a distance , created by the combustion of hydrogen .
If electricity is what is needed at the destination , then in almost all circumstances it is very much more efficient to transmit solar electricity directly using high - voltage transmission lines .
HVAC works well over relatively short distances but for longer distances , HVDC is the preferred option .
With transmission losses at about 3 % per 1000 km , electricity may for example be transmitted from North Africa to the UK with less than 10 % loss of power .

The DESERTEC concept
The ideas that I have sketched are part of the ‘ DESERTEC ’ concept , a set of proposals for future electricity supplies in Europe , the Middle East and North Africa ( EUMENA ) that has been developed by the ‘ TREC ’ international network of scientists and engineers .
The proposals are described in considerable detail in the ‘ MED - CSP ’ and ‘ TRANS - CSP ’ reports prepared by a team of researchers at the German Aerospace Center .
Copies of these reports may be downloaded via links from www.trec-uk.org.uk/reports.htm
The second of those reports shows how , in the period up to 2050 , Europe could meet all its needs for electricity , make deep cuts in CO 2 emissions from electricity generation , and phase out nuclear power at the same time .
Compared with the situation now , there would be an increase in the diversity of sources of energy and there would be an overall reduction in imported sources of energy .
Those two things together would mean an overall increase in the resilience and security of electricity supplies .
CSP would be just one element in the mix - up to 15 % of the total - and would be an exception to the rule of reduced imports .
An important part of the DESERTEC concept is the creation of a large - scale HVDC transmission grid , spanning the whole of EUMENA , and designed to work in conjunction with existing HVAC grids .
This proposal chimes well with an independent proposal by Airtricity to create a Europe - wide HVDC grid .
One advantage of this kind of grid is that it provides an answer to the often - voiced objection to wind power — that “ the wind does not blow all the time ” .
This is true in any one relatively small area but it is almost never true across a large area like Europe .
Another advantage of large - scale HVDC grids is that surplus electricity in any one area - more than the local people can use - may be moved to other areas where it is needed , thus reducing the wastage of energy that may otherwise occur .
An interesting aspect of the Airtricity proposal is that all the power cables would be laid under the sea !
Modern designs of HVDC cable make this a realistic option now .
One advantage is that it would largely eliminate any problems of visual intrusion .
And it would greatly simplify the processes of planning and construction .
One of the most fascinating aspects of the DESERTEC concept are various spin - off benefits , especially for local people in host countries .
For example , waste heat from CSP plants may be used for desalination of sea water - a very useful bonus in arid regions .
The shaded areas under CSP mirrors are protected from the full glare of the tropical sun and may be used for many purposes , including horticulture using desalinated sea water .
Throughout EUMENA , there would jobs and earnings in a large new industry .
More generally , the development of a win-win collaboration amongst countries of EUMENA , with substantial benefits for all , would be a good way to promote good relations and mutual understandings across the region - a positive alternative to the confrontational policies of recent years .

Costs
The cost of collecting solar thermal energy equivalent to one barrel of oil is about US $ 50 right now ( already less than the current world price of oil ) and is likely to come down to around US $ 20 in the future .
The MED - CSP report , published in 2005 , suggests that CSP will need public support for a time ( like other renewable forms of energy ) but that , with economies of scale and refinements in the technology , the cost of CSP electricity is then likely to tumble relative to more traditional sources of electricity .
The TRANS - CSP report calculates that CSP is likely to become one of the cheapest sources of electricity in Europe ,
A report in Business Week ( 2006 - 02 - 14 ) quotes the CEO of Solel as saying “ Our [ CSP ] technology is already competitive with electricity produced at natural - gas power plants in California ” .
Similar claims are being made by others in the industry .
Speaking about CSP at the Solar Power 2006 conference in California , the US venture capitalist Vinod Khosla said “ ... we are poised for breakaway growth - for explosive growth - not because we are cleaner [ than coal - fired electricity ] but because we are cheaper .
We happen to be cleaner incidentally . ”

Security of supply
Although few people express any worries about the fact that the UK produces only about 60 % of the food we eat , a surprisingly large number of people seem to think that it would be quite unacceptably risky to import some of our electricity from North Africa and the Middle East .
For several reasons , I believe that any possible risk is more apparent than real .
The number of countries with hot deserts is quite large so we would not need to be overly - dependent on just a few sources of CSP electricity , as we are with some other sources of energy .
Given the substantial benefits that CSP would provide for host countries , there is little incentive to disrupt their operation .
The transmission grid can be designed to accommodate damage in very much the same way that the internet was designed to be resilient in the face of military attack : rather than rely on a few large transmission lines , electricity may be transmitted over a network of smaller transmission lines ; and submarine cables , as proposed by Airtricity , would be relatively safe from attack .
CSP plants would be difficult to damage by any kind of attack and they would be easy to repair .
Conclusion
The DESERTEC scenario , which has been developed with considerable professionalism and care , shows that concentrating solar power can be an important source of carbon - free electricity , not just for countries in the sun belt but for many other countries as well — including the UK .
Additional potential benefits include the not - insignificant prize of improved relations amongst different groups of people .
All the relevant technologies are available now .
With the right political impetus , the necessary infrastructure can be put in place quite soon .

There 's a critique of my recent posts on Ubuntu over on adamw 's blog titled " What is it ? " .
He starts off with the following provocative thesis :
Another of those bizarre raves about Ubuntu .
It ’s a perfect example of the genre , really .
The guy installs the distro , installs some updates , runs Firefox , reboots , and concludes it ’s the best thing he ’s ever seen .
Why ?
Because , make no mistake about it , there ’s absolutely no substance to this review .
Every distro uses the same font rendering engine - freetype .
Every distro includes Firefox .
There ’s nothing special about the Ubuntu installer ( the One installer is as good or better , if a bit less polished ; other distros have similar features ) .
The sound thing is just regular Distribution Hardware Randomness - note how he compares Ubuntu to ‘ earlier ’ distros , likely any distro of the same kernel vintage would work .
The only conclusion I ’ve come to yet is that what people _say_ impresses them about Ubuntu is not what actually impresses them about Ubuntu .
What impresses them is something else that they do n’t manage to actually write down .
Let me give a little background about myself before I answer that question as well as other points in the post .
I was introduced to Linux by my long - time friend Jim Smith back in the early 90's when the kernel was at version 0.99pl13 ( I think ) .
At least the kernel was n't at the 1.0 release level yet .
The distribution was SLS .
Since then I 've used Yggdrasil , Slackware , Suse , and Redhat / Fedora Core .
I sampled a bit with Mandrake , but never stayed with it for long .
I even installed Free BSD when some of my more hard - core Unix friends were around to help with the occasional problem .
On the commercial side I 've used Ultrix ( DEC 's version of BSD , 1986 ) , SCO ( the original Santa Cruz Operations Xenix 286 and 386 , 1989 ) , Univel ( from the AT&T / Novell joint venture running on a 486 , 1994 ) and Solaris ( 1996 onward ) .
Lots of Solaris , both on the server as well as the workstation .
And it 's all been for Real Work .
No web surfing , Flash , streaming video , or serious gaming .
My last big task was participation in a long development effort of an HLA - based multi-federate distributed simulation running on Solaris servers connected to multiple Java - based clients running on Windows XP .
I know that most , if not all , the distributions can get similar tasks done .
In fact , that distributed HLA - based simulation I just mentioned was ported from Solaris 8 to RHEL 4 , a task I helped to start up before I left ( 2004 ) .
Some really sharp engineers finished it after I 'd left , and it was successful .
It was successful not just because the engineers were very sharp , but also because RHEL , and more specifically the 2.6 kernel , had matured to the point that it supplied the same OS features and functionality that Solaris provides and the application used extensively .
If we 'd tried that effort on an early version of the 2.6 kernel or 2.4 , it would have failed .
So .
After a long day at the office , it 's fun to come home and play on the computer .
I do n't mean just games .
I mean surfing and streaming content as well ( at least that 's what it means to me ) .
And I 'd like to do that in conjunction with " real work " .
I can certainly do this on a Windows machine .
It would be nice to have the same level of capability on a Linux ( or even * BSD for that matter ) machine .
That 's why my focus is what it is , and why I 'm pleased to see how features I take for granted on Windows are as easy to set up and use on a Linux distribution .
But let 's continue ...
One man 's substance is another man 's fluff , so I 'll concede the point .
Remember , however , that this is just a personal blog .
If you want real reviews heaven only knows there 's plenty of " harder hitting " reviews to choose from .
I can't compete with them , and I do n't even try .
What I do comment on are my personal experiences and what strikes my fancy .
With regards to the font , there is indeed a visual difference .
I do n't know what it is , but when installed off the ISO and before any tweaks are performed on the fonts , I find Ubuntu 7.04 's font selection and rendering to be better than Suse 10.2's .
I have sat the monitors of both machines side - by - side to make sure , and Ubuntu 's is better .
I'm in the process of determining why , and I 'll write about it later , but the emphasis is what I 've experienced without having to change anything after first installation .
You make an interesting comment about sound .
Sound on the Ubuntu machine has never worked with Fedora , all the way up to Fedora Core 6 .
Sound has always worked with Ubuntu , going back to at least 6.06 LTS ( I know , I booted them and tried a few simple experiments to prove the point ) .
The success of sound on this platform has to be tempered by the fact that the motherboard is based on an old nForce2 chipset .
This is by no means state of the art now .
But then you have to ask " If Ubuntu can support it , why ca n't Fedora ? "
Especially if it is just kernel related .
Now that 's interesting .
Here I am blogging away about what impresses me and I 'm accused of now writing it down .
What impresses me about Ubuntu every time I install it in a VM is the fundamental - to use a controversial term - GNOMEness of everything .
It ’s very definitely the GNOME of distros , where SUSE and Mandriva are the KDE .
You do n’t get a lot of choices .
Everything is very streamlined , very efficient , and very well designed .
There are little bits of this experience hiding in this review trying to get out , like the smooth way the Ubuntu update process works ( using a very well designed updater and judicious use of the notification system ) .
To me Ubuntu is , and I mean this in the nicest possible way , a triumph of style over substance - it ’s not that it does n’t _have_ substance , but it does n’t have any _more_ substance than anyone else ( it really has less ) ; it just uses style to give the impression that it does .
I ’m not suggesting this is lame or cheap , I ’m suggesting it ’s something others could learn from .
The process of installing Mandriva or SUSE is utterly different .
In many ways it ’s better ; you get more stuff and more choices for what to do with it .
But it ’s an experience no - one exactly enjoys , it ’s more a task you slog through and then arrive at the end thinking ‘ well , I ’m glad THAT’S over ’ .
Installing Ubuntu , by contrast , feels kind of …cool .
Sure , if you want to do something the installer does n’t want you to do , you ’re up a creek without a paddle , but the feeling is important .
This applies even to the One installation , which is much more streamlined than DrakX .
It ’s still slightly inelegant .
It still asks you more questions than you quite feel comfortable answering .
It still feels , basically , like looking after the neighbour ’s kids .
Installing Ubuntu feels like the _other_ neighbour ’s extremely cool university student offspring taking you to all the best clubs in town .
It ’s glitzy and shiny and makes you feel a bit like a rock star .
I think that ’s the feeling all these Ubuntu reviews try ( and fail ) to pin down .
Boot into the live desktop .
Let the user check out those features she finds are important to her .
This is where you start to build a good positive experience .
Get it installed .
Install from the live desktop .
You 've already got the libraries and X booted for a great graphical installer .
Install it with the most - used applications and the tools for further configuration after the installation to hard disk .
Get it installed quickly and cleanly and continue to build the user 's confidence and positive experience .
After installation , show the user a stylistic catalog of additional applications she can install and use .
Want to play back DVDs ?
Show her how .
Want to use the latest version of Java ( Java 6 ) ?
Show her how .
Whatever it is she could do on Windows or Mac OS X , give her the same equivalent experience , and then help her quickly find it and easily install it .
Add / Remove does this .
For the sophisticated user who wants fine grained control and understands the system , open it up with Synaptic .
Yes , they can royally screw things up that way , but that 's what freedom means .
Freedom to make a choice , even a bad one .
Just remember that with freedom comes the responsibility of accepting the consequences of your actions .
I still believe MDV is a far better distro than Ubuntu .
( I also think SUSE is . )
You can , ultimately , do a lot more stuff a lot better .
But it does n’t make you feel like a rock star .
I think we ( and our erstwhile colleagues / competitors at Novell ) need to work on that a bit .
And that I agree with .
In fact , I 've said ( and written ) that the Gnome implementation of Ubuntu 7.04 is the best ( out of an admittedly limited ) implementation I 've every used .
Better than Suse 10.x , better than SLED 10 , and better than Fedora Core .
Everything Works Smoothly .
The Ubuntu 7.04
Gnome implementation does a good job of implementing everything according to the principal of least astonishment or rule of least surprise ) .
There 's plenty of substance to Ubuntu , or else I 'd not waste my time .
But style plays a big part in the selection process .
Our society is saturated by style ( insanely good to horribly bad ) such that when it 's missing or poorly implemented it stands out like a sore thumb .
Note , for example , the excellent use of style in the Mac interface ( all Mac interfaces ) , and how Microsoft is slowly getting this clue and is attempting to use it in such areas as Vista ( to good effect ) , the design of the XBox 360 interface and even the oft - maligned Zune .
Ah-men brother about installing Suse and Fedora Core .
Suse 's installer has gotten better with each release , but it 's still time consuming , and if you missed something out of the nearly - infinite selections you can make in detailed mode , then you get a repeat with Yast2 .
As for feeling like a rock star , that is a bit over the top .
I just like the fact that when you install Ubuntu It Just Gets Out Of The Way .
It is simple .
As for being up a creek without a paddle , that 's where " Add / Remove Applications " and the Synaptic Package Manager come into play .
Add / Remove gives you the glitzy catalog - style view of applications , while Synaptic lets you get down into the fine grained nitty - gritty of distribution management .
Ubuntu has a staged approach to installation that I 've come to appreciate .
I like Ubuntu 's installation approach over Suse 's because with Ubuntu you get to work a heck of a lot faster .
I have been involved in more than one Suse installation where after spending too much time selecting applications and features to install , Suse 's installation just crapped out at the end .
I 've had my greatest problems in that area with notebooks .
With Ubuntu I get a much higher level of confidence it will work when it boots from the live CD , followed by a successfull installation .
Then I can go in and finish the installation of specific tools and applications .
Ah !
Mandriva !
The ulterior motive finally surfaces ...
It 's funny you should mention Suse .
It 's my primary distribution of choice , and my blog is littered with little reports about my experiences with it .
I think that Suse 10.2 has the best KDE desktop of the various distributions I 've touched to date , and prefer to work with KDE rather than Gnome .
And I think that Suse could benefit using Ubuntu 's method of boot and installation rather than Suse 's classical method .
To me this is not a zero - sum game .
I 'm not looking for a single winner in this process .
More fundamentally I 'm looking for healthy alternatives to Microsoft Windows .
I mentioned Vista earlier , and as pretty and stylish as it has become , it has picked up habits that really disturb me .
I feel that Microsoft Windows has gone from being merely intrusive to being heavily invasive of my use of my computer .
The prime driver is DRM .
Microsoft put it in to help the poor studios continuously re-sell the same content over and over and over again .
Microsoft is in the perfect position to apply the same technology to software updates , including the entire OS .
Then I 'm really screwed .
I wind up with a machine not much different than the XBox 360 , in which Microsoft has complete control and I do n't .
I want to foster a dialog with other Linux users so that all of Linux improves over time .
We need Linux ( and other free alternatives ) now more than ever .
It may not turn out this way , but I see a time where our computers are so locked down and controlled that we loose the fundamental freedom to really innovate .
I do n't want to have to go through an authority just to get into my machine 's hardware .
And I 'm afraid that 's where we 'll wind up if we 're not careful .

Animal study suggests even low caffeine doses could affect fetus .
Mothers - to - be may chose to change their diets , just in case .
Getty
Tentative evidence has emerged to suggest that low doses of caffeine , equivalent to just one or two cups of coffee per day , can affect the development of unborn babies .
The findings are almost certainly too preliminary to prompt public health officials to change official advice to pregnant women , who at present are told only to avoid large amounts of caffeine .
But the researchers involved , who have detected behavioural and cellular changes in rats whose mothers drank caffeine during pregnancy , say they themselves are advising pregnant women to avoid caffeine altogether .
Joseph Nunez and his colleagues from Michigan State University in East Lansing , who presented their results on 16 October at the annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in Atlanta , Georgia , say the findings came as a surprise .
In an initial experiment , they examined brain cells from new - born rats whose mothers had been given a dose of caffeine , equivalent to one or two cups of coffee for a human , every day during pregnancy .
" I was a skeptic , " says Deborah Soellner , a colleague of Nunez's .
" I did n't expect to see this at such a low dose . "
But in the exposed rats , Nunez 's team found odd effects in brain cells of the hippocampus , a region of the brain associated with memory and spatial navigation .
For example , the cells absorbed less glutamate , a molecule that makes brain cells more active .
Whatever glutamate was absorbed also exited the cells sooner than usual .
Reduced inhibition
“ I did n't expect to see this at such a low dose . ”
Deborah Soellner , Michigan State University
To see how the cellular changes were affecting behaviour , the Michigan team took baby rats whose mothers had been caffeined - up and ran them through a series of behavioural tests .
Nunez says that the animals showed no cognitive defects , but were more active and less inhibited than those whose mothers had not received caffeine .
The rats were more willing to explore new environments , for example .
When placed in a small dark space with an opening into a larger lit area , it took control animals around 4 minutes on average to emerge .
But the caffeine rats left after an average of just 25 seconds .
Other tests showed similar , if less pronounced , changes .
The rats were more likely to explore exposed environments , and spent more time interacting with other animals .
" You have an animal that does n't know when to stop , " says Nunez .
Safe not sorry
Read Jim Giles 's diary reports from the neuroscience conference on our reports / society for_neuroscience / " > newsblog .
Although there is no reason to assume that these differences are negative or harmful , Nunez would like pregnant women to be advised to avoid caffeine as a precautionary measure .
On his display was pinned a photograph of his four - month - old baby ; he says his team 's rat results started to emerge when his wife was pregnant , so he immediately advised her to stay away from caffeine .
Current public health guidelines say only that women should limit themselves to 300 millilitres or less a day , but that is equivalent to what Nunez fed his rats .
He points out that caffeine is able to cross the placenta , and the developing fetus is known to take up to 4 days to clear out the caffeine from a single cup of coffee drunk by mum .

Nunez says that any effects of caffeine on humans may have been missed because it is so widely used and assumed to be relatively safe .
" No one has ever systematically done this research before , " he says .
Nunez 's team plans to follow up their studies by looking in more detail at the effect that caffeine is having on brain cells .

「 ガーベジコレクション 」 、「 リフレクション 」 、「 アスペクト指向 」 、「 クロージャ 」 、「 イテレータ 」 、「型推論」など、近年、プログラミング言語の世界に新しい概念が続々となだれ込んでいるように見えます。しかし、これら「プログラミング言語の新潮流」の背景には、実はあまり知られていない歴史が隠されているのです。
プログラミング言語のメインストリーム
プログラミング言語はお互いに影響を与えながら成長しています。プログラミング言語の歴史において、主要な言語がどのように影響を与えたかを、概略図に示しましょう（図1）。スペースの関係上この図では非常に簡略化しています*が、実際には数えきれないほどの言語*がさまざまに影響を与え合っています。
図 1 プログラミング言語系統図（概略）
王道を行 くFortran、COBOL、C/C++、Java、C#
プログラミング言語には、王道とでも呼ぶべき定番のものが連綿と続いてきました（図1上部）。その中でも「始祖」に当たるのがFortran（Formula
Translator）でしょう。1954年生まれのFortranは、史上最初の高級言語として誕生し、また科学技術計算の分野ではいまだに現役で活躍しています。特にベクトルプロセッサを積んだスーパーコンピューティングの領域では、ほかの言語の追随を許しません。また、事務計算用言語として誕生したCOBOL（Common Business Oriented Language）もまだまだ現役*です。
C言語は、UNIXの主要開発言語として普及しました。現在ではその地位を、C++にかなり明け渡しつつありますが、それでもなお現役で活躍しています。
あくまでもオブジェクト指向機能を付加したCとして（ほぼ）上位互換を目指すC++に対し、より高級な言語としてSun Microsystemsから華々しく登場したのがJavaです。また、マイクロソフトがJavaへの対抗馬として誕生させたのがC#になります。
軽量で人気を集めるスクリプト言語
一方 、1987 年 のPerlの登場以来、スクリプト言語と呼ばれる分野が発展してきました。もともとスクリプト言語は、システムをプログラムできるようにするための言語として登場しました。例えば「チャットスクリプト」は、モデムを経由してネット接続する場合に、先方の対応（プロンプトなど）に応じて適切な出力を行いログインを行うもので、スクリプトの典型です。また、コマンドラインでの繰り返しを自動化するための「シェルスクリプト」などが、初期のスクリプト言語の対象でした。
当初のスクリプト言語は、機能の少ない簡易言語という雰囲気でしたが、Perlが登場したことで、一般的なプログラミングにも使える機能を備え、プログラミング言語の新しい領域が切り開かれました。多くのスクリプト言語はテキスト処理能力に優れているのですが、この特質はテキスト主体のプロトコルであるHTTPとも相性が良好です。Perl、PHP、Pythonなどのスクリプト言語は「P言語*」と呼ばれ、Webアプリケーション開発言語として注目されています。
一風変わっているの がJavaScriptです。1995年にリリースされたNetscapeブラウザに組み込まれていたこの言語は、もともとLiveScriptという名前で開発されていましたが、Javaの人気にあやかるべくJavaScriptと改名されました。やや文法が似ているものの、名前が連想させるほどにはJavaとの直接の関係はありません。Ajaxの流行もあり、「世界で一番ユーザーの多い言語」*として定着しつつあります。
このページで出てきた専門用語 この図では非常に簡略化しています だから、自分の愛着のある「あの言語」が載っていないからといって文句を言わないで欲しい。わたし自身、泣く泣く割愛した言語も多い。
数えきれなほどの言語 コンピュータ史上かつて存在した言語の総数は、一説には数千とも数万とも言われている。オモチャのようなプログラミング言語まで含めると、正確な数は誰にも分からないに違いない。
COBOL もまだまだ現役 「 オープンソースマガジン」の読者は、COBOLに触れる機会はあまりないかもしれない。しかし、例えばわたしの会社（ネットワーク応用通信研究所）では、Linux、PostgreSQLの上にオープンソースCOBOLコンパイラ（OpenCOBOL）とオフコン風トランザクションモニタ（Montsuqi）を開発し、医療系事務システムを開発している。分野によってはまだまだ現役である。
P言語 Rubyは頭文字 が 「 P」で始まらないので仲間はずれである、と思っていたが、YAPC::Asia Tokyo 2006 で「 Rubyはロングテールの付いたP言語である」という発言があった。これで晴れてP言語に仲間入りできた……ような気がする。 世界で一番ユーザーの多い言語 何しろ、Webブラウザを使う人のほぼすべてが、JavaScriptインタープリタ組み込みのブラウザを使っているわけだから。今や携帯電話にもJavaScriptが載っている。

The Piratebay was raided by the Swedish police yesterday .
Today we read that the site will be back within two days , what reminds me of the trick they pulled off last year .
In May 2005 all major media outlets reported that The Piratebay was taken down by Swedish anti-piracy organisations .
However , that was a hoax , and a pretty clever marketing strategy to announce their redesign .
And today , the Piratebay.org site states :
SITE DOWN – WILL BE UP AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL WITHIN A DAY OR TWO
This is exactly 1 year after the succesful hoax
A HOAX ?
Probably not , but the new servers will not be located in Sweden , a Piratebay admin stated :
We are currently working hard on a solution and I would be very disappointed in us if we could n’t get TPB up and running again within a week .
It is very possible that we move into other countries , possibly Holland , with Russia as a Backup .
There are some problems with decentralization , but a solution which would keep TPB up even if one location is taken down would be good .
However , he also said :
We still have n’t had the chance to see the warrant , so we do n’t exactly know what they were looking for .
No lawyer is assigned yet … .
The rumor is that the warrant was issued against the provider ( PRQ ) , however there is NO list yet ( update : there is ) of other affected sites ( apart from PiratbyrÃ¥n ) .
Let ’s wait and see

Why must you ride your high seated bike around town ?
Will not a normal bike do ?
Are you looking for attention ?
Did your parents not hold you enough as a baby ?
Perhaps you want to join the circus .
Guy seated on a really high bike .
What moves you so to ride perched so high in the sky ?
Is it you wanting to look down in disdain at the people below ?
And how do you seat yourself on such a high mount ?
Need you a ladder ?
A jetpack ?
What happens when you stop ?
I despise you on - a - high - seated - bike man .
You attention - seeking cyclist .
You do not amuse me .
You do not amaze me .
I am not fascinated by your high bike .
I ignore you .
If I had a stick , I would stick it in your spokes .
Oh , then how you would fly -- an Icarus on wheels , traveling too close to the sun .
And what glee would shine upon me , when I witnessed you tumbling down to the Earth below .
Here we have yet another unhappy camper :
Confessions of a Community College Dean : In Which I Get a Little Panicky : I 'm not an economist .
Readers who actually understand economics are invited to explain why I 'm off my rocker on this one ....
[ T ]he U.S. is running nasty and increasing deficits at the government level , the household level , and the international level .
We owe more to other countries than we ever have , and much of that debt comes from selling government securities to foreign central banks ( esp. in Asia ) .
Household debt is skyrocketing , and the interest rate increases of the last year or two are poised to nab anybody stupid enough to have taken out an adjustable - rate mortgage in the great housing boom of the last five or six years .
The national debt grows apace , and has been refinanced over the last few years to progressively shorter - term loans , meaning that higher interest rates will hurt badly and quickly .
Think of it as putting the national debt on an ARM , then watching interest rates go up .
Since we import most of our oil , and the price of oil keeps going up , our trade deficit is likely to keep increasing ....
Plus we do n't manufacture very much , so we do n't export very much .
We also borrow money for wars of choice , which themselves actually interrupt the flow of oil ....
China is keeping its currency artificially low , to keep its exports cheap .
Then it lends us the money to buy those exports .
It underpays its own workers so that we can have cheap stuff .
How long its own workers will stand for that is anybody 's guess ....
Since there are so many U.S. dollars flowing out of the country , their value is dropping on the world market ....
The only way to entice foreigners to keep buying a depreciating currency is to raise interest rates to compensate for the depreciation .
Raising interest rates kills the folks with ARMs , increases our national debt payments , and hurts the business climate ....
Although productivity has been going up , real wages have n't .
I know it 's gauche to talk about income distribution , but there 's no other way to explain ....
So my question to my economics - literate readers : how are we not screwed ?
( That 's the technical term . )
If China lets the yuan float , we get inflation .
If the Euro starts to displace the dollar as the denomination for international trade , demand for dollars drops and we get higher interest rates , eventually tipping us into a nasty recession ....
If somebody manages to blow up a key pipeline or refinery , the sky 's the limit ....
I 'm thinking I must be missing something really basic and wonderful that will reduce these concerns to nothing more than blips on the screen ....
Please tell me why I 'm wrong .
I 'll sleep much better if I can dismiss this as the ravings of someone who just needs a vacation .
No .
You 're not wrong .
You 're not raving .
Nevertheless , the most likely scenario is one in which we come out of all of this OK .
What is this most likely scenario ?
It is of ( a ) gradual inflation in China and elsewhere ( maybe 5 % per year for five years ) , ( b ) gradual reductions in the value of the dollar ( maybe 5 % per year for five years ) , accompanied by ( c ) gradual interest rate increases in the U.S. so that the dollar decline never turns into a ( d ) sudden dollar crash .
If that is the case , then -- gradually -- U.S. housing prices deflate , construction and consumer spending fall , and imports drop .
U.S. - made products become more competitive at home , and so manufacturing production and employment for domestic uses rises .
The falling real value of the dollar leads to an export boom , which causes export manufacturing to boom as well .
Over five years or so , we see a net of eight million jobs ( relative to trend ) in construction and consumer services ( and supporting occupations ) vanish , and eight million jobs ( relative to trend ) in manufacturing ( and supporting occupations ) appear .
If the expanding sectors expand fast enough , we see a tight labor market that brings real wages back to their normal share of production .
And moving an average of 1.6 million jobs a year from sector to sector -- the U.S. economy can do that without any sort of uproar .
Of course , people are still likely to be unhappy with the process .
Rising interest rates and rising import prices will make people feel poor -- something in this process has to reduce Americans ' total spending on consumption , investment goods , and government purchases from 107 % of income to 100 % of income , and whatever it is will crimp spending by making Americans feel poorer .
But even so it is a " soft landing . "
As I said , that 's the most likely scenario .
But there are other scenarios -- the ones that you fear : stagflation , recession , financial crisis , oil shock , global depression , panic , revulsion , and discredit .
The other scenarios become more probable every day .
You see , to achieve a soft landing requires that a huge number of people around the world watch the real value of their dollar - denominated assets melt away slowly for half a decade without ever being impelled to sell off the dollar - denominated positions in their portfolios .
It could happen .
It happened in the late 1980s , thanks to the Japanese central bank and the collected investors of Japan .
It will probably happen again .
It requires mammoth irrationality on the part of investors , and an extraordinary eagerness on the part of central banks to eat enormous losses on their dollar reserves .
It is not a rational - expectations equilibrium .
But it will probably happen .
But if it does n't happen again -- if there comes a day when the world 's central banks and investors all decide that it is time to sell their dollar - denominated assets , then ...
Well , then we get to see how good a central banker Ben Bernanke really is .
There is a really bad global equilibrium out there , which the world economy might jump to at any moment .
The offences admitted to would be subject to various penalties
Keele University researchers said it showed petty crime was rife among the middle classes and exposed the " law - abiding majority " to be a myth .
Their poll of 1,807 people in England and Wales found 61 % had committed one of a series of offences .
They included paying " cash in hand " to avoid VAT and stealing items from work .
The study found that around one - third of those questioned ( 34 % ) paid " cash in hand " to avoid taxation and about one in five ( 18 % ) had taken something , such as stationery , from work .
Other findings included :
One in 11 had wrongly used identification for their own gain
7 % of those questioned had padded out an insurance claim to get more money
A total of 11 % avoided paying their television licence
A total of 8 % did not disclose faulty goods in second - hand sales
And 6 % asked a friend in a bureaucratic job to bend the rules
Of those who admitted to an offence , nearly two - thirds ( 62 % ) had broken the law on up to three occasions and 10 % admitted to nine or more offences .
The study 's author , Professor Suzanna Karstedt , said : " Contempt for the law is as widespread in the centre of society as it is assumed to be rampant at the margins and among specific marginal groups .
" Anti-social behaviour by the few is mirrored by anti-civil behaviour by the many .
" Neither greed nor need can explain why respectable citizens cheat on insurance claims or in second - hand sales , and do not hesitate to discuss their exploits with friends in pubs . "
The study , of people aged 25 to 65 , was published by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King 's College , London .
Daily Show : Absurdity and hypocrisy of immigration reform David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday May 23 , 2007 Print This Email This
In this clip from The Daily Show , Jon Stewart skewers many of the absurdities presented by the new immigration bill , which he acknowledges is more difficult for Congress to come to agreement on " than just a renewal of the Puppies are Better Than Hitler Act . "
The first part of the segment features protesting immigrants , outraged right - wing Senators declaiming against a loss of their sovereignty , and President Bush taking a long walk outside to deliver two sentences on how pleased he is and then turn on his heel and leave .
After Stewart explains some of the hoops the bill would set up for immigrants seeking to enter the country legally , he turns to Aasiv Mandvi for comment .
The Indian - born Mandvi starts off , " It was n't easy for our European ancestors .
... I think these new immigrants have it easy . "
Remember Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs ?
I wrote about him last week :
[ O ] ne ca n’t help but get a little cynical hearing Obama talk about “ changing the tone ” and all that bullshit , while hiring a well - known smear - meister best known for his work trashing other Democrats .
Maybe I should n't be so cynical .
Obama repudiated the hardball tactics of his own staff .
And he made it seem he was clueless about a major story dealing with his own campaign .
In a front page New York Times interview published Friday , Obama suggested that his marching orders to stay on the high road were ignored , quite a public flogging .
Obama , in his two - week old campaign , is offering himself as the antidote to a cynicism he asserts is poisoning U.S. politics .
One of Obama 's stump lines goes something like this :
His rival in the Democratic primary " is not other candidates , " he says , " it 's cynicism . "
Gibbs and Wolfson mixing it up is campaign business as usual .
The back - and - forth , however , exposed Obama to a risk -- being called a hypocrite .
Obama decided not to handle matters internally , however .
" I told my staff that I do n't want us to be a party to these kinds of distractions because I want to make sure that we 're spending time talking about issues , " Obama told the paper .
He added , " My preference goinard is that we have to be careful not to slip into the game as it is customarily played . "
Whether you work from home or not , most people have some type of home office or place where they do work from home either for their employer or for themselves .
In this post , we are going to look at five things to consider when designing your home office to maximize productivity .
1 . Proximity Matters
When you are designing a home office , make sure you put things that you need often near where you need them .
For example , if you want to get better about shredding documents with sensitive information on them , do n't put your shredder across the room or in the closet .
It needs to be out where you can easily get to it .
The more effort it takes to do something , the less often you will want to … [ Read more ...] about 5 Tips for a Productive Home Office
Humiliated at the table for the last time , we are now determined to secure victory at any cost .
We briefly considered more training and practice , but I believe these solutions were presented in a humorous context .
Once the fits of laughter had ceased , we began to research toxic amphibians and the ochre sap one might squeeze from their drooping pustules .
You may find the results immoral , but you need to consider Ping Pong as a global phenomenon .
For example , when playing by Djibuti Rules , it ’s considered perfectly normal to release a hungry lion .
Like clay or grass , each venue presents unique challenges .
We just shipped out four boxes of games and prizes to Ziggurat Con to make sure they got there , but we ’ve also put the word out to our vast network of tabletop industry contacts to emphasize the need .
As it stands , we sent several kits with maps , miniatures , and dice , a substantial supply of Magic cards , and piles of fantasy and sci-fiction reading in addition to the requested shirts and books from our own holdings .
Keek even made them an official logo , like so :
Hopefully that will get things started off right .
I own an Xbox 360 from launch and it had never given me no sass , so frantic reports online about the fragility of this equipment were never taken especially seriously .
It is difficult to determine the actual distribution of these failures since virtually every establishment publishes , republishes , and then ruminates over the same incidents .
Anecdotally speaking , it had never happened to me or anyone that I know , so it loomed like some boogieman - unpleasant , to be sure , but largely a theoretical proposition .
Well , it happened .
I was always mildly curious about the precise numbers , information whose value has diminished .
When it happens to you , the failure rate might as well be one hundred percent .

It has come to our attention that a story originally published in the Mail on Sunday has apparently been misinterpreted by some of our readers .
In order to prevent further misinterpretation , we have removed the article from our website .
The following letter was published in the Mail on Sunday on May 13 , 2007 :
Your article about the Inco nickel factory at Sudbury , Canada , wrongly implied that poisonous fumes from the factory had left the area looking like a lunar landscape because so many plants and trees had died .
You also sought to blame Toyota because the nickel is used , among countless other purposes , for making the Prius hybrid car batteries .
In fact any damage occurred more than thirty years ago , long before the Prius was made .
Since then , Inco has reduced sulphur dioxide emissions by more than 90 per cent and has helped to plant more than 11 million trees .
The company has won praise from the Ontario Ministry of Environment and environmental groups .
Sudbury has won several conservation awards and is a centre for eco-tourism .

New technology products often take us by surprise .
In 1992 , for example , we could n’t possibly have dreamed of how the Internet would transform the world by 1997 , only 5 years later .
The best innovations are things “ you never knew you wanted but cannot live without ” kind , inventions that come out of nowhere .
YouTube , for example .
Or TiVo .
But certain other technology products are so obvious that when they finally emerge many people shrug and wonder “ what took it so long ? ”
We knew they were coming , but year after year they never actually materialized .
When they do materialize , we are overjoyed .
After years of waiting , for example , we are finally getting MP3 players into cel phones .
We are using wireless networks and bluetooth more and more , but we knew we wanted this stuff years ago .
The technology consumer will often heap glowing praise on these kinds of new technologies as they emerge , calling them innovative and groundbreaking , when in fact the functionality of the products is merely filling a hole that everyone knew was there .
The Apple iPhone is a perfect example : while the UI is indeed remarkable , almost nothing about it is technologically innovative or new .
If you asked me ( or just about any of my friends ) to describe the perfect cel phone feature set , it would look a lot like an iPhone .
In fact , as the owner of a Windows PocketPC phone for nearly 5 years , nothing about the iPhone ’s tech specs surprised me .
The UI , again , is great and very innovative , but the hardware itself and the basic concept of the device is wholly old news .
Digital music production , and the death of MIDI , is another example :
Ten years ago , electronic music was largely created by connecting a bunch of dedicated hardware devices together and controlling them via a desktop - computer based sequencer program .
But nowadays everything can be done on a single computer .
Electronic musicians knew this was possible for at least a decade before it finally became a reality .
It was inevitable .
The new TV - on - the - Internet product called Joost is the latest example .
Joost , if you do n’t know about it , is a dedicated desktop app that streams video on demand from a variety of internet - based “ channels ” .
Everyone is super excited about it , but if you scratch the surface you ’ll see that , technologically , there ’s not much new about Joost .
There ’s streaming video , compression … what else ?
It ’s basically YouTube without the You .
What is new , I imagine , is ( again ) , the user interface , which the Joost team chose to break out of the web browser and build as a standalone application .
That ’s potentially transformative , but make no mistake :
Anyone with half a brain could have though of Joost years ago .
I ’m sure many people did , too .
In all these cases , the technology in question was already well - known and pretty much anticipated by everyone in the target markets .
Like the dreamers at the halfbakery , we were simply waiting for somebody to build it correctly .
The X - Factor(s )
What is the x-factor that breaks these products out of the realm of fantasy and brings them to market as real things ?
I actually see three x-factors :
Hardware ( Speed / Storage / Bandwidth / Compression / Power ) : I lump these five factors together because they are all merely steady incremental improvements to technologies which have existed for decades .
As these factors improve , new products become possible .
For example , the most palpable difference between 1998 ’s Eiger Labs MPMan F10 , the first commercial portable MP3 player , and the 2007 iPod Shuffle , is that the iPod Shuffle can hold sixty times as much music on it for less than a third of the cost .
Mobile phones and portable computers have been around for decades , but neither were viable products until the batteries could be made small enough .
Video on the Internet , wireless networking , HD DVD players , and just about anything having to do with 3D graphics — all of these are not areas of innovation , but rather areas where the underlying technologies have improved enough to permit the products that use them to shine .

Money ( Infrastructure Capital and Business Deals ) :
It does n’t take a genius to come up with the idea for the iTunes Music Store .
What it does take , however , is two things that only piles of money and a powerful business foundation can buy :
A robust technology infrastructure ( i.e. , lots of servers and bandwidth ) , and lots of exclusive licensing deals with all the major record labels .
Similarly , Joost ’s biggest advantage over some dude in a garage writing their own video player application is that Joost has billions of dollars in venture capital money to construct massive server farms and to strike deals with content providers .

User Experience Design :
This is my favorite part .
The Apple iPod ’s user interface ( specifically the clickwheel and the UI controlled by the clickwheel ) is to this day the key market differentiator between the iPod and the countless other Mp3 players that came before and after the iPod .
What made flickr so addictive and fun to use was the snappy user interface : the uploading and storage of photographs as a business model was nothing new , but the AJAX - based user interface really made photo - management fun , and not a chore .
Finally , compare Google Maps to MapQuest :
In one stroke Google crushed MapQuest by simply making a UI that did n’t require endless page refreshes .
( A fourth x - factor is the slow but steady progress of artificial intelligence technology , which will open the floodgates to many other technologies and products .
For now , however , I ’ll leave it off . )
You can probably easily come up with five technology product ideas that fall under the category of “ does n’t exist yet even though everyone already knows they want it . ”
And I ’ll bet for every one of these ideas , one or more of the above three “ x- factors ” is what prevents that technology product from existing right now .
In fact , I ’ll take a crack at it .
Here are five technologies that do n’t exist as viable marketed products and which I find myself wanting almost every day :
A portable device which allows me to download / purchase music and videos directly and listen to them instantly A shared calendaring system that works on all platforms A single protocol or standard for all personal information , including contacts and social networks A fingernail - sized GPS - locatable chip I can affix to every valuable posession I own so I can find them when I lose them A speech - to - text device that understands me perfectly
People are already working on all of these things , I assume .
A few of them probably already exist in some below - the - radar form .
But what I find super exciting is that I can imagine User Experience Design being a najor differentiator for each of them , that the first successful incarnation of these products will win out over its competitors simply by having an elegant user interface .
This means that I or one of my UXD peers might end up helping to usher a technology whose time has come into the successful mainstream .
That ’s pretty cool .
In fact , maybe a good business strategy for a UX designer would be to research emerging technologies to find applications and devices that suffer from terrible UI design , and to then either offer UXD services to those companies to imporve their products , or help other companies build that better mousetrap .
Or , better yet , to simply patent UI designs for these existing technologies .
Is that ethical ?
How Do I Choose the Best Sportsbook ?
Great question , but there is no right answer .
The first thing you need to decide is what are the most important factors for you .
For example , if you live in the United States , your options are a bit limited and you first need to find sportsbooks that will accept bets from US - based customers .
Another factor is how to get your money to the sportsbook ( deposit options ) and when you hopefully win , how will you withdraw your funds ( payout options ) .
Factors such as availability of the platform on mobile or on the computer / software combination you prefer such as Mac , older Windows OS , etc. are all important .
After all , if you have no way to get on the site and place your bets , it does n’t really matter how good the site is .
Ultimately , you have to be able trust the site to make payouts when you win and to offer support and help when you need it .
How do you review the sites listed here ?
All of the sites listed and recommended on SportsBettingReviews.com were actually used by at least 5 people on our staff over a period of 2 - 3 months .
In fact , we are regulars on most of these sites and have placed many , many bets in a variety of sports .
While many of the sites have strong poker and casino games , we try to focus our reviews on the sports betting offerings of each site .
If you have been a sportsbook customer of these sites and have frequented SportsBettingReviews.com over the years you will have noticed our recommendations changing .
Some sites have gone out of business or have consolidated with other sites .
In some cases unfortunately , sites that were strong and had integrity have taken a turn for the worse and in all cases we remove these sites from our recommendations .
If you have sites you frequent and would like us to consider , please do not hesitate to drop us a comment and we ’ll be sure to take a look .
Why are sportsbook deposit and payout options so important ?
When you read through our comprehensive reviews you ’ll notice that most sportsbooks have many deposit and payout options .
In the ideal world , you can simply deposit money using your normal credit card or paypal account just like you would do when buying items on Amazon .
Likewise , when withdrawing funds , you should be able to request a check sent directly to your home or an electronic transfer to your bank account .
Unfortunately , things are n’t so simple .
In fact , if you live in the United States , it can be quite difficult to deposit and withdraw funds .
It is not surprising that it is normally easier to deposit funds to a sportsbook then it is to withdraw the money you have won .
Luckily , there are many options available including money orders , Western Union and Bitcoin among others .
Please read through our reviews as well as the many articles on SportsBettingReviews on this subject to help familiarize yourself with the various options for depositing and withdrawing funds from the sportsbooks listed here .
How Do I use Bitcoin and Why is it So Popular ?
By now you have probably heard of Bitcoin .
It ’s a digital currency which was invented in 2008 .
While it is pretty volatile and may seem complicated to newbies , it ’s actually quite easy to use if you follow our recommended suggestions .

Ugly fonts , cutesy fonts , unreadable fonts , bad fonts . . . they have terrorized us for far too long , infiltrating our homes via e-mail , IM , and low - rent ValPak ads .
Here , LMNOP presents the seven worst fonts -- and the people who use them .
1. Comic Sans MS
This is indeed the AOL of fonts ; the very accessibility that made it popular and novel in the 1990s became its downfall .
These days , just like an e-mail from an " @ aol.com " address has a distinct lack of credibility , an e-mail written in this font makes the sender seem ridiculous and out of touch .
Common abusers : Clueless execs who think it makes their e-mail signature seem fun ( because nothing bridges the six - figure salary gap between boss and worker bee like a good typeface ) ; kids who identify with its kiddie - ness and thus apply it to their IMs , e-mails , and even school papers ; homemade advertisements for DAYCARE PROVIDER'S or PARTY PLANNER'S ( Comic Sans people tend to be apostrophe abusers as well )
Probable famous user : Elizabeth Hasselbeck
2. Bradley Hand ITC
Who is Bradley , and why hath his hand wrought such abuse ?
This is one of many script fonts that are supposed to approximate a cursive -y , handwritten look and have lost their charm after years of abuse at the hands of adolescent females .
Common abusers : Sorority girls .
Sorry to any sensible sisters out there who know how to use fonts properly , but you have to admit that Bradley Hand ITC makes its way into far too many college girls '
IM profiles , and a good chunk of them are of the Greek persuasion .
In fact , if I had a dollar for every time I have seen a Dave Matthews / John Mayer lyric wistfully inserted into a profile ( just below the " Alpha Delta Whatever , love my big , " etc. , and above the cut - and - pasted Windings heart / flower offset in pink ) , I would have me some serious dollars .
Probable famous user : Lauren Conrad from the O.C .

3. Curlz MT
Curlz MT picks up where Comic
Sans left off in terms of forced casualness and raises you a big sack of illegibility .
Even before this font was so totally overused , it was really only good in small doses .
Anyone who uses this font today for e-mail or IM is just totally nuts , because you are basically saying that the actual content and readability of your e-mail is secondary to the real message you want to get across , i.e. , " LOOK AT ME !
AREN'T I WHIMSICAL ?
DON'T YOU LOVE HOW EVEN A BORING E-MAIL ABOUT CARPOOLING TO SOCCER PRACTICE CAN BE MADE FUN AND FANCIFUL WHEN YOU PUT CURLY SERIFS ON THE WORDS ? " Curlz MT is not a font ; it 's a cry for help .
Common abusers : Middle - aged ex-cheerleaders trying to hold on to the magic of the good old days ; women who have woken up at the age of 40 and realized they never did the fun things they wanted to do
Probable famous user : Britney Spears
See also : Gigi
4. Papyrus
Papyrus is all over the place ; I 've seen it in the IM profiles of many kinds of people , usually guys .
I think the goal with Papyrus is to look kind of scholarly , but let 's be honest : you 're not using AIM to network with other Nobel winners .
Common abusers : College - aged guys who want a font that 's not boring but also not , you know , all gay and cursive and shit .
Probable famous user : Brad Pitt
5. Vivaldi
Why do people get so carried away with fonts that mimic real handwriting ?
It drives me insane when people use really heavy script fonts to add a " personal touch " to their e-mail signatures -- like , " Look !
It 's like I really signed it !
Even though it's on a computer ! "
Hey , wow .
You 're pretty clever .
Common abusers :
Old people ; people who think they are classy .
Probable famous user : Martha Stewart
See also : French Script MT
6. Kristen ITC
This is another " fun " font like Comic Sans or Curlz , but it of course has its own unique twist on things .
Kristen ITC fans are usually elementary school teachers , childcare professionals , and other people with kid-centric jobs .
These people love to employ quotes like , " We do n't stop playing because we grow old - - we grow old because we stop playing , " and they really like to use a font that serves as a constant reminder that THEY HAVE NOT STOPPED PLAYING , DAMMIT !
DON'T YOU SEE HOW PLAYFUL THESE LETTERS LOOK ?
YOU ARE TALKING TO SOMEONE WHO IS YOUNG INSIDE !
Common abusers :
The same people who buy adult - sized jean jumpers
Probable famous user : Jessica Simpson
7. Viner Hand ITC
Do n't ask me why , but Viner Hand seems to have become the go - to font for angsty pre-teens and would - be goths .
Well , I hate to be the one to break it to the Linkin Park fan contingent , but calligraphy is to angst what scones are to rave parties .
Common abusers : Eighth graders writing poems about how nobody understands them
Probable famous user : Fred Durst
Any others you want to add to the list ?
UPDATE 10 /12 : Many thanks to the commenter who pointed out that I had mixed up " Bradley Hand " and " Viner Hand " in my America 's Most Fonted graphic .
It has now been fixed to showcase the appropriate ugly ' Hand ' font .
One in four younger Muslims in the United States believes suicide bombings to defend Islam are justified in at least some circumstances , although nearly 80 per cent of all Muslim Americans say such attacks are never acceptable , and most are critical of Al Qaeda , according to a poll released yesterday .
The Pew Research Center study paints a picture of a diverse , complex and still largely immigrant community that for the most part has blended comfortably into American life .
Most Muslim Americans are moderate , mainstream and middle class , the study shows .
They are largely assimilated , happy with their lives , and their income and educational levels are comparable with most Americans .
In a conference call yesterday from Washington , D.C. , Pew Research Center director Andrew Kohut said the support for suicide bombings – although limited – was one of the few trouble spots the study found in an overwhelmingly positive portrait of the U.S. Muslim community .
Overall , 78 per cent of Muslim Americans said suicide bombings of civilian targets to defend Islam cannot be justified ; 13 per cent say they can be , in some circumstances .
The view is strongest among those younger than 30 , but for all Muslim Americans , such support is far lower than among Muslims in many other nations , including in several Western European countries .
The poll also found most U.S. Muslims are Democrats or lean that way , but also tend to be social conservatives .
The poll also found that native - born black Muslims , who make up about 20 per cent of the Muslim community in the U.S. , are the most disillusioned segment , tending to be more skeptical of the view that hard work pays off and less satisfied with the way things are going .
The Pew poll estimates there are roughly 2.35 million Muslim Americans .
The study was based on telephone interviews with 1,050 adult Muslims , some of whom were interviewed in Arabic , Urdu or Farsi .
The margin of error for the poll , which was conducted between January and April , is plus or minus 5 percentage points .
LOS ANGELES TIMES
This limited - edition monograph of sorts was released to accompany Cerith Wyn Evans ’ ICA installation a few months back .
It takes the form of a clear plastic flip album inserted with photographs Evans ’ took on a recent trip to Japan .
The photos often employ displacement or elision , scenes seem to be cut in half , sun glare distorts the colours and pictures are taken at unorthodox angles and viewpoints .
The incongruoux mix of chaotic urbanity and serene nature also provides jolts of discomfort as one flicks through the photos .
The individuality of the images then , seems enhanced – rather than an objective record logically filed , the photographs are uniquely peculiar visions that express a singular subjectivity .
In looking through this piece we use Evans ’ eyes to look , and rather than fixing upon the objective world we are alienated by it .
Instead , we are forced to focus not on what we see but the ways in which we see .
The albums are signed and numbered by Evans on the backsheet .

Hot off the Presses : Wowhead sold for over $ 1 million 23 Jun
2007
For those that have read my about page , I used to be involved in the MMO ( massively multiplayer online ) space .
Since quitting and focusing on ( what I see as ) more lucrative markets ( local and blogging ) , I ’ve still kept a good relationship with pretty much all the large players – while I tired of it , keeping abreast of news is interesting .
So today , after tucking the missus to bed and getting on the computer to catch up on some email , I saw an interesting email in my inbox ( from a trusted acquaintance ) .
Wowhead , a popular World of Warcraft website , was purchased for over $ 1 million .
Some quick background ( hold on , it can be a bit confusing ) :
Before WoW launched officially , a lot of EverQuest players were invited to beta test .
One of them was Thott , leader of one of the largest EQ guilds ( Afterlife ) .
Being a resourceful programmer , and utilizing WoW ’s LUA programing interface , he wrote Thottbot .
The program basically stored information on all quests / items / creatures / characters / etc that the user came across , and then uploaded it into a centralized system ( Thottbot ) .
Users around the world could then load up information , find out how to do quests , where to go , etc .
Distributed with the most popular WoW add - on ( Cosmos ) , the site was an instant hit .
Before Thottbot , the pre-eminent database site for online games was Allakhazam .
It had the largest subsites for the ( then ) most popular games – EverQuest , Final Fantasy XI , Dark Ages of Camelot , and Star Wars Galaxies .
Allakhazam was a subscription site , making money from people willing to pay for features like advanced search ( incidentally , all the content on Allakhazam was actually user - submitted ) .
I had the mental fortitude to snap up Thottbot ( for IGE ) right before WoW came out of beta .
I ca n’t disclose the details , but it was in the $ xxx , xxx range .
For the amount of traffic the site got , it was an absolute steal .
With Thottbot on the scene , Allakhazam greatly suffered .
Why would people pay for a subscription with everything for free on Thottbot ?
Another quick aside : for those new to MMOs , companies like IGE sell virtual currency and goods for real - world dollars .
For all the ( unwarranted ) hype of Second Life , IGE et all are far bigger – they push hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of goods every day .
A lot of players do n’t like them – they believe virtual good sellers corrupt the ‘ pure ’ nature of the game .
Allakhazam.com was operated by a guy who used the nickname ‘ Allakhazam ’ .
He was one of the fiercest anti-IGE players around .
I had once offered him $ 1 million ( before WoW even entered alpha ) – he was n’t interested .
Anyway , the site took a hit , and after a few years of struggling to survive , he eventually broke down .
He sold out to IGE for roughly $ 7 - 10 million .
The justification was that he sold the site to ‘ Affinity Media ’ , which owns ( but is n’t ) IGE .
Anyone with half a brain knew that they were the one and same .
So – with Thottbot / Allakhazam owned by IGE , they pretty much owned the WoW fansite market ( and thus a huge audience to push their wares to ) .
At least , if it was n’t for Wowhead .
A late - comer , the site was an instant hit , with its clean UI and fast loading speed ( think of Thottbot as Altavista , and Wowhead as Google ) .
You can see on Alexa how Wowhead has grown while the others have stagnated .
And so ‘ Affinity Media ’ has struck again .
Verified by three different sources , the price was confirmed at over $ 1,000,000 .
The lower limit was 1 million , while the upper was $ 1.5 million .
And people thought running a fansite was n’t worth it
UPDATE : Some people have asked for proof – I ca n’t give you that .
But – I did confirm with another source .
As far as I am concerned , this is solid .
So Digg it .
UPDATE2 : IGE has been ‘ supposedly ’ sold off by Affinity Media .
They used FUD when they purchased OGaming .
They used FUD when they purchased Allakhazam .
Just some more FUD – rest assured IGE / Affinity Media are still very connected .
UPDATE3 : The FUD does n’t end .
Remember – I sold OGaming to IGE , while they claimed it was ‘ RPG Holdings ’ that purchased it .
I ’ve experienced it firsthand .
I talked to another contact – it is a bit byzantine ( how the site was ‘ sold ’ ) , but as it stands , IGE US LLC ’s parent company is Affinity Media .
Certain properties may have been sold , but not the company itself .
UPDATE4 : The sale is confirmed :
News travels fast !
We were hoping to have the time to put together a proper announcement about this , but it appears word is already out , so we wanted to acknowledge it : now that IGE is out of the picture , Wowhead has decided to become a part of the ZAM Network .
I leaked the sale before it was officially announced , so that shows I did have someone on the inside ( my past with Thottbot etc just confirms it ) .
All the same contacts are saying the same thing – Affinity is still very much involved with IGE .
UPDATE5 : At the recent VRGood Summit , it seems Brock Pierce ( CEO of IGE ) talked about getting out of the game , with no mention of IGE having been sold from Affinity .
Consider this sale supposedly happened over two weeks ago , seems a convenient thing to forgot .
Not to mention walking around with an ‘ Affinity ’ badge .
UPDATE6 : I ’ve written about why Allakhazam , then Thottbot , and now Wowhead became the top dogs .
More developer / design - focused .
The surge in violence we face at the hands of small groups will continue to increase well into the future .
One reason is that the barriers to entry for warfare have fallen ( see my book , Brave New War for the definitive background on this ) and the new methods that are being developed ( at both the organizational and tactical levels ) are exceedingly effective .
Another reason is that while the physical and information distance between people has been radically reduced through globalization , our social distance -- defined by culture , function , hierarchy , economic role , etc. -- remains little changed .
This means that many of the causes of violence that have taken all of human history to develop are rapidly being unlocked ( not unlike Pandora 's box ) through rapid integration .
An excellent way to explore this is through Donald Black 's work on sociology , best applied to this topic in , " The Geometry of Terrorism . "
He posits that the psychology or ideologies of specific groups is of much less importance than the social connectivity of that group to its social superior -- violence in the form of terrorism is typically directed upwards ( Van Creveld 's , theagainst the ) .
Large social distances equal danger .
Our problem is that as physical distances decline in importance , these social distances become a not merely a necessary condition but a sufficient condition for violence .
Even small provocations can set it off .
Is Social Integration the End Game ?
... in the long term it ( technology ) destroys the social geometry on which terrorism depends .
Black 's nuanced view of the social origins of violence provides a blueprint for finding ways to reduce the origins of violence .
However , given its complexity , we should be prepared to assume that this violence will continue for a significant period of time until :
However , I am not as sanguine on the ability of technology to reduce social distance .
In fact , just the opposite .
Technology can radically increase social distance as we see daily in comment / discussion threads and in the polarized media .
The online comity does not exist .
We are increasingly using the medium to artificially create social distance .
As a result , everything seems to point to more fragmentation rather than less , particularly at the individual level .
In the long run it 's Virginia Techs with bioweapons
Applpi
Applpi is a library in the Coq proof assistant that enables concurrent programs to be modeled and verified in Coq , and the models to be run as OCaml programs .
It contains a formalization of a concurrent language based on the pi-calculus , a formalization of a specification language based on spatial logic and lemmas for formal verification .
Applpi has been applied to the verification of an HTTP server .

Bush Announces More Sanctions for Sudan White House announces new sanctions for Sudan for its role in the Darfur crisis .
May 29 , 2007  -- President Bush announced this morning that the United States would implement targeted unilateral sanctions against Sudan for its role in the Darfur crisis .
" I promise this to the people of Darfur , the United States will not avert our eyes from a crisis that challenges the conscience of the world , " Bush said in remarks delivered at the White House .
The sanctions are meant to punish the Khartoum government for its unwillingness to allow a peacekeeping force into Darfur , a region the Bush administration says is witnessing genocide .
" For too long the people of Darfur have suffered at the hands of a government that is complicit in the bombing , murder and rape of innocent civilians , " Bush said .
A senior official in the Sudanese Foreign Ministry responded to the sanctions , saying they would not affect Khartoum 's decisions regarding the deployment of a peacekeeping force .
" I think these sanctions are not justified .
It is not timely , " Mutrif Siddig said .
President Omar al - Bashir 's government has blocked the deployment of a peacekeeping force it agreed to allow in last fall .
Then - U.N. Secretary - General Kofi Annan negotiated a " hybrid " force made of U.N. and African Union peacekeepers .
Small initial batches of peacekeepers have already been deployed , but the Sudanese government has denied access to the remaining troops .
Existing economic sanctions on Sudan are to be tightened and expanded by the Treasury Department to cut off 30 Sudanese companies from the U.S. financial system .
The sanctions will affect several companies in Sudan 's lucrative oil industry , as well as a company accused of arming militias responsible for much of the killing in Darfur .
Bush announced the sanctions five weeks ago in a speech at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , D.C. , but stopped short of enacting them after a last - minute plea by U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon for more time to negotiate with Sudan .
" I have made a decision to allow the secretary - general more time to pursue his diplomacy , " Bush said at the time .
Subsequent talks with Khartoum appear to have yielded no progress .
The sanctions announced today remain largely the same as those announced by Bush last month .
The United States will also ban travel by a Sudanese government official and a military officer blamed for the violence in Darfur .
Also targeted for sanctions will be an " obstructionist " rebel leader who is said to have prevented peace efforts .
Those three individuals will also have their U.S. dollar assets frozen .
Bush also reiterated his call to draft a U.N. resolution to increase pressure on Bashir 's government .
The United States and Britain have been drafting a U.N. Security Council resolution that would mandate international sanctions on Sudan for stonewalling efforts to end the killing in Darfur .
The resolution goes beyond the United States ' unilateral sanctions enacted today , expanding an existing arms embargo .
The resolution will also seek asset freezes and travel bans for individuals connected to the violence , beyond the three the United States sanctioned today , as well as Sudanese government - controlled entities .
The resolution is said to include a partial no - fly zone for Darfur , banning offensive military flights over the region .
While some groups have called for a no - fly zone as a way to stop the violence , others say such a measure will hamper humanitarian efforts .
The Chinese government , which holds veto power on the Security Council , remains a significant obstacle to the passage of a resolution .
China has invested heavily in Sudan 's energy sector and has so far resisted efforts to pass U.N. sanctions on Sudan .
China said again today that it was opposed to a U.N. resolution on Sudan .
" Expanding sanctions can only make the problem more difficult to resolve , " China 's African affairs representative Liu Guijin said in Beijing .
He did not say whether China would veto such a resolution .

What would Aristotle make of it ?
More than 2,000 years after the Greek philosopher declared Mother Nature had made all animals for the sake of man , there are moves to put the relationship on a more equal footing .
Judges in Austria are considering whether a British woman , Paula Stibbe , should become legal guardian of a chimpanzee called Hiasl which was abducted from its family tribe in West Africa 25 years ago .
The animal sanctuary where he has lived is about to close and to stop him being sold to a zoo , Ms Stibbe hopes that she can persuade the court he deserves the same protection as a child .
APES AND US Gorillas , bonobos , orang - utans and chimps are great apes Chimpanzees and bonobos differ from humans by only 1 % of DNA and could accept a blood transfusion or a kidney
All great apes recognise themselves in a mirror Elephants and dolphins show similar self - awareness Great apes can learn and use human languages through signs or symbols but lack the vocal anatomy to master speech Great apes have displayed love , fear , anxiety and jealousy
In 1997 the UK government banned experiments on great apes but not on primates such as marmosets and macaques Sources : Ian Redmond , Charlotte Uhlenbroek
Chimps genetically close to humans
Spanish MPs are also being urged to back a similar principle , one already endorsed by the Balearic parliament and held dear by the international organisation The Great Ape Project - that apes be granted the right to life , freedom and protection from torture .
So should apes such as those at London Zoo , which opens its Gorilla Kingdom on Thursday complete with gym and climbing wall , get the same rights as their zookeepers ?
They need greater protection in the eyes of the law , says Ian Redmond of the UN's Great Apes Survival Project , who believes welfare groups could use guardianship as a way to rescue ill - treated apes .
Some rights are conferred on apes but only because they are endangered .
And the international trade ban is flouted in Africa and South - East Asia , where mothers are shot and their infants shipped off as pets , circus performers or lab animals .
Vivisection on apes is banned in much of Europe but still goes on in the US and Japan .
" Apes are special because they are so closely related to us , " says Mr Redmond .
" Chimpanzees and bonobos are our joint closest living relatives , differing by only one per cent of DNA - so close we could accept a blood transfusion or a kidney .
Gorillas are next , then orang - utans . "
If you take a chimp away from its family groups it 's a real wrench
Charlotte Uhlenbroek
Hiasl the chimp
But there is a stronger cognitive argument , he says , because the apes ' intelligence and ability to reason demands our respect .
" Show a gibbon a mirror and the reaction suggests he or she thinks the reflection is another gibbon .
But all the great apes have passed the ' mirror self - recognition ' test and soon begin checking their teeth or examining parts of their body they could n't see without the mirror .
This self - awareness surely suggests that they know they exist . "
Family ties
Apes also share a range of human emotions , says zoologist Charlotte Uhlenbroek , who thinks they should be afforded legal protection enshrined in law .
The great apes : Status check
In pictures
They have a similar lifespan to humans and form strong family bonds which they maintain for life , she says .
And apes have displayed a tenderness which could be described as love , anxiety when separated , and fear , jealousy and trauma .
" If I was an alien from Mars and looked at human society and a society of apes then in terms of the emotional life I would see no distinct difference , although we live very different lives because of language and technology . "
Giving them rights does not mean throwing open all the cage doors because some zoos are important to preserve the species , but it is vital to establish a principle that apes should not be treated like objects , she says .
Daniel Sokol , a medical ethicist , says apes possess cognitive and emotional faculties that make them worthy of moral consideration .
Orang - utans can kiss and cuddle
" Justice and consistent thinking require that we treat non-human animals who share morally - relevant properties in a respectful way , and that surely means giving them the opportunity to flourish and not be tortured or subject to cruel or degrading treatment . "
But Steve Jones , professor of genetics at University of London , says human rights are a construct which can't be imposed on animals .
" Where do you stop ?
It seems to be that being human is unique and nothing to do with biology .
Say that apes share 98 % of human DNA and therefore should have 98 % of human rights .
Well mice share 90 % of human DNA .
Should they get 90 % of human rights ?
And plants have more DNA than humans . "
I 've yet to see a chimp imprisoned for stealing a banana
Professor Steve Jones
Chimps can't speak but parrots can .
Defining creatures and allowing them rights based on criteria invented by one group is itself an enormous breach of human rights , he says , and one need look no further than Austria in 1939 to see why .
" Rights and responsibilities go together and I 've yet to see a chimp imprisoned for stealing a banana because they do n't have a moral sense of what 's right and wrong .
To give them rights is to give them something without asking for anything in return . "
There is a moral case to make about animal welfare , he says , but it has nothing to do with science .
I accept the point about rights going with responsibilities , but only to an extent .
Humans are usually granted certain rights even if they discard those responsibilities : even our worst criminals have the right not to be tortured and so on .
I would therefore grant certain minimum rights to any creature that can pass the mirror recognition test : the right to life , food , water , a territory , etc .
Obviously these rights would only apply to those animals in the care of or interacting with humans - we can not be expected to police their own habitats .
Rich Smith , Uxbridge , Middlesex
These efforts at granting apes rights are based on the premise that humans and apes show advanced cognition and have evolved from a common ancestor .
Until the evolution / creation debate can be satisfactorily resolved , it is premature to go ahead with this effort .
If apes are granted rights similar to humans , it helps the supporters of evolution who will point to these rights as proof that the evolution debate has been settled by the community at large .
Animal welfare is a good thing , but let 's not forget the millions of humans who are suffering under sub - human conditions .
If we can't take care of our own species , how realistic can we be of taking care of other species .
Clifford Gunapalan , Toronto , Canada
I agree that the great apes should definitely be accorded the legal rights to life and protection from torture , and that anyone who deliberately kills or tortures one should be punished .
This may indeed start us down a slippery slope , but it is the right thing to do nonetheless .
Michael McClennen , Miami , Florida , US
I do n't in any way support cruelty to animals but fail to see how it is possible to give animals the same rights as humans .
It would seem to be difficult to enforce such rights because animals cannot communicate to say when their rights have been abused or violated .
It is probably better to protect species , like apes , through animal protection regimes and endangered species regimes which provide protection from hunting and torture etc without needing to go as far as affording animals human rights .
Ruth , Glasgow
In places where human rights are guaranteed , you can talk of apes rights .
In those places of the world where humans survive on less than 1 dollar a day , would they ever think of human rights for apes ?
Why are we more concerned about what 's happening to apes than what 's happening to humans .
Demola , Ikeja , Lagos , Nigeria
Hmm , ca n't help wondering what Prof Jones ' view on children is .
It is entirely possible to have rights without being capable of exercising them or having responsibilities in return .
Rights can be exercised on another 's behalf .
It depends if the right holder has the kind of interests that can be protected by rights .
Given the capacities of apes , it would seem to me they could have interests that could give rise to rights , unless it can be said children have no rights either .
Sasha Ellis , Glasgow
That chimps share 99 % of our genes is an oft - quoted statistic , but we also share 33 % of our genes with Daffodils .
Should we amend the Geneva Convention to indict over - zealous gardeners ?
The percentage of genes that we share with another species is not relevant to the fight for animal rights ( a fight I support ) .

IT WASN ’T AN edifying spectacle : a group of middle - aged white guys competing with one another to see who could do the best impersonation of Jack Bauer , torture enthusiast and the central character on Fox ’s hit show “ 24 . ”
In Tuesday ’s Republican presidential primary debate , Fox News moderator Brit Hume -- who appears to have been watching too much “ 24 " himself -- raised what he described as “ a fictional but we think plausible scenario involving terrorism and the response to it . ”
He then laid out the kind of “ ticking - bomb ” scenario on which virtually every episode of “ 24 " is premised -- precisely the kind that most intelligence experts consider fictional and entirely implausible .
Imagine , Hume told the candidates , that hundreds of Americans have been killed in three major suicide bombings and “ a fourth attack has been averted when the attackers were captured ... and taken to Guantanamo ....
U.S. intelligence believes that another , larger attack is planned ....
How aggressively would you interrogate ” the captured suspects ?
Rudy Giuliani -- a man who knows he has a few cross - dressing episodes to live down -- did n’t hesitate .
“ I would tell the [ interrogators ] to use every method ....
It should n’t be torture , but every method they can think of . ”

“ Water - boarding ? ” asked Hume .
“ I would -- and I would -- well , I ’d say every method they could think of , ” affirmed Giuliani .
As governor of the State That Dares Not Speak Its Name -- at least not in GOP circles -- Mitt Romney naturally had to up the ante .
“ You said the person ’s going to be in Guantanamo .
I ’m glad they ’re at Guantanamo ....
Some people have said we ought to close Guantanamo .
My view is , we ought to double Guantanamo . ”
I am politician , hear me roar !
And , oh yeah : “ Enhanced interrogation techniques have to be used . ”
Not to be left out , Rep. Duncan Hunter of California boasted that , “ in terms of getting information that would save American lives , even if it involves very high - pressure techniques , ” he would offer only “ one sentence : Get the information . ”

And finally , Colorado Rep. Tom Tancredo : “ We ’re wondering about whether water - boarding would be a -- a bad thing to do ?
I ’m looking for Jack Bauer at that time , let me tell you . ”
Ha ha .
This remark was greeted by uproarious laughter and applause from the audience because , after all , who does n’t enjoy thinking about a hunky guy threatening to gouge out a detainee ’s eye with a hunting knife ?
Unlike Hunter and Tancredo , Giuliani and Romney took pains to insist that they did n’t favor torture , just ... you know , “ enhanced interrogation . ”
But water - boarding , which neither would disavow , is unquestionably a form of torture .
It involves taking a bound , gagged and blindfolded prisoner and pouring water over him or holding him underwater to induce an unbearable sensation of drowning .
It was used in the Spanish Inquisition and by Pol Pot ’s Khmer Rouge -- fellas who make Jack Bauer look like a softie .
In Tuesday ’s debate , only John McCain and Ron Paul bucked the collective swooning over enhanced interrogation .
Paul mused about the way that torture has become “ enhanced interrogation technique .
It sounds like newspeak , ” he noted , referring to George Orwell ’s term for totalitarian doubletalk in his novel “ 1984 . ”
Paul obviously never got the memo .
For most of the Republican primary candidates , “ 1984 " is n’t a cautionary tale , it ’s a how - to manual .

Only McCain reminded the audience that “ it ’s not about the terrorists , it ’s about us .
It ’s about what kind of country we are . ”
McCain ’s chest - beating Republican rivals would do well to listen to him , and to read the letter Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , sent May 10 to all U.S. troops there : “ Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information ....
They would be wrong .
Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal , history shows that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary ....
What sets us apart from our enemies in this fight ... is how we behave .
In everything we do , we must ... treat noncombatants and detainees with dignity and respect . ”
In Tuesday ’s debate , Tancredo brushed off “ theoretical ” objections to torture as a luxury we can’t afford :
If “ we go under , Western civilization goes under . ”
And what ’s a little torture when Western civilization itself is at stake ?
But Western civilization is n’t about speaking English , or flags , or football or borders .
If Western civilization is about anything at all , it ’s about the arduous , centuries - long struggle to nurture an idea of human dignity that ’s not dependent on nationality or power .
As Petraeus put it , there are some “ values and standards that make us who we are . ”

Tancredo ’s right about one thing though .
If we embrace the use of torture , we wo n’t need to worry that extremist Islamic terrorists might destroy Western civilization .
We ’ll have killed it off ourselves .

[ This lecture was given at Mises University 2005 . ]
When I was given the title " Ethical Assumptions of Economics , " my first thought was to say , " economics has no ethical assumptions . "
But then I thought this might not be the best way to earn my keep here .
So I 'm going to talk about some senses in which economics might have implications for ethics .
There are these two terms that we often hear as characterizing Austrian economics .
One is " value - freedom , " or Wertfreiheit .
Wertfreiheit does not mean free in a valuable way ; it just means a description that does n't involve evaluation .
To be value - free is simply to describe things , to tell how things are , without advocating any particular point of view .
And closely related is this notion of " value - subjectivism , " the notion that Austrian economics in some sense recognizes only subjective values , only the values to the participants whose actions are being described or explained , and does n't evaluate their actions .
Well , if Austrian economics is value - free and value - subjectivist , then it might seem as though it could n't have much in the way of implications for ethics .
But there are several respects in which ethics and economics nevertheless interestingly interact .
First , it 's worth pointing out that economics is often presented in ways that are perhaps not completely value - free .
For example , words like " welfare " and " property " and so forth tend to have value connotations .
Now you can try to interpret them value - neutrally , but ordinarily when we say that such - and - such promotes social welfare , it sounds like we 're in favor of it — since we are part of society , and we do care about our own welfare .
And when we say that something is someone 's property , that often implies that it's their legitimate property , and so calling something someone 's property might imply that they ought to have it , not just that they happen to possess it .
You might think this can be used to bias the discussion , but medicine 's a value - free science too ; strictly speaking , in purely descriptive terms , medicine is indifferent between health and sickness — it just wants to describe what causes what — but since as a matter of fact practitioners of medicine are practicing it in order to promote health , naturally they 're going to describe it in such a way , where it 's understood that all the participants in the discussion agree that they 're trying to promote health rather than promoting sickness .
Objective Value
There 's perhaps a deeper worry that 's raised by the Greek philosopher Socrates in a couple of Socratic dialogues that are attributed to Plato ( but it 's not clear whether they 're really by Plato or not ) , the Hipparchus and the Eryxias , where he explores the meanings of certain economic concepts like " wealth " and " profit , " and gives something like an argument that these can't really be value - neutral terms .
Socrates asks the person he 's talking with , " how would you define profit ? "
And the person answers , " getting more in exchange for less . "
You put in a smaller amount , and you get back a greater return than you put in .
That 's profit .
( Now this does n't really distinguish between profit and interest , risk premium , and all that , but never mind . )
Socrates says — translating his example into our money — " if I gave you one $ 10 bill , and you gave me three $ 1 bills back , I would n't think I 'd made a profit , even though I 'd gotten more in exchange for less —
I 'd given only one bill and I got three back . "
So what matters is the value of the bills , and the fact that a $ 10 bill is more valuable than a $ 1 bill .
You can't just describe the exchange in terms of empirical mass quantities ; you have to describe it in terms of value .
You do n't really profit unless you 're getting something of greater value .
And of course Socrates wants to spin this into , ultimately , a moral argument that you do n't really benefit from what you get unless what you get really is of greater real value .
So if I get a lot of money by cheating you , then since cheating you is a great harm to my soul and is not outweighed by the benefit of the money I get , I have n't really profited .
" To be value - free is simply to describe things , to tell how things are , without advocating any particular point of view . "
It 's clear enough what someone like Mises would say to this .
He 'd say : well , it 's certainly true that you can't define profit in terms of just getting more physical things in exchange for fewer physical things ; but you do n't have to interpret it in terms of objective value — you can interpret it in terms of subjective value .
You get a profit , not if you get things that are genuinely objectively better in return , but if you get things you value more instead of what you value less .
Part of the reason Socrates and Mises disagree here is that Socrates thinks that valuing something more involves judging that it 's better , and these judgments can be true or false .
And what you really want is not to get what you think is better ; what you really want is to get whatever is better .
And that whole way of thinking is something that Mises opposes , so they 're not really going to see eye to eye here .
Value Subjectivism
Is Austrian economics committed to rejecting any kind of objective morality ?
We can distinguish between two kinds of value - subjectivism .
You can have explanatory value - subjectivism , which simply means that in explaining someone 's actions , you appeal to their evaluations , not yours — just as in explaining someone 's actions you appeal to their beliefs and not yours .
If you see someone walking out on a bridge , and you know the bridge is unsafe and is likely to collapse , but they do n't know that , then in interpreting why they 're doing what they 're doing you should n't attribute to them your belief that the bridge is unsafe if they do n't have that belief .
If you try to explain their action by appealing to your belief that the bridge is unsafe , your explanation is n't going to be any good .
So likewise , if you 're explaining their actions you also have to appeal to their values .
Suppose that you hate vanilla ice cream , and you see someone trying to get some .
What they 're doing would make no sense if you assumed that they share your value .
Instead , your evaluation of their taste in ice cream does n't make any difference to explaining — whether they 're right or wrong to like vanilla ice cream , nevertheless the fact that they like it is what explains their going after it .
So explanatory value - subjectivism does n't say anything one way or the other about whether there is such a thing as objective value ; it just says that if you 're going to explain people 's actions , you explain them in terms of their desires , not yours .
Normative value - subjectivism , on the other hand , means that there are no objective values , that there is nothing to value over and above just whatever any person happens to want .
There 's no right or wrong way to want things ; you can't be right or wrong about your ultimate desires .
So these are two different things , and you can see that at least it 's not obvious that explanatory value - subjectivism entails normative value - subjectivism .
Now Mises seems to have thought it did , and I think his reason for thinking this is not just that he somehow confused two kinds of subjectivism ; I think there 's a deeper reason he thought this .
The fact that Mises thinks that these two go together , and that both explanatory value - subjectivism and normative value - subjectivism are true , helps to explain why a lot of people interpret Austrian economics as being against any kind of objective value .
Rothbard , on the other hand , accepted explanatory value - subjectivism .
He thought that in explaining people 's actions , or in trying to understand and describe economic behavior , you appeal to their beliefs and desires , not yours — but he thought normative value - subjectivism was false .
He thought that there was , on the basis of philosophical arguments — the kinds of arguments he gives for example in his book The Ethics of Liberty , where he tries to develop a libertarian theory of rights — he thought you could give arguments to establish that certain values were objectively valid .
But he thought those arguments did n't make any difference to how you interpreted people 's economic behavior .
If economics is value - free in the sense that it does n't presuppose any particular values , as Mises and Rothbard both seem to agree about economics , you might wonder how economics can serve as a basis for advice .
Economists are often called upon to give advice ; how can they do that ?
Well , there are several different possibilities .
Mises 's view is that it 's impossible to give advice about ultimate goals — except in terms of just saying , " well , I like this goal , you should pursue that , " but you can't really give any reasons , Mises thinks , for ultimate goals .
But given a certain ultimate goal , you can give reasons for adopting certain means to it .
And economics is useful for that .
Economics can tell us what sorts of actions tend to have what sorts of consequences .
So if you happen to want to have , or want to avoid , certain consequences , then the economist can tell you what things to do that are likely to get you the consequences you want and to avoid the consequences you do n't want .
Although you might be in the field of medicine working on germ warfare , in which case you 're interested in causing sickness , most doctors , most of the time , are interested in curing disease , we hope , and so if you go to a doctor for advice , the doctor can just assume that what you want is what will promote health .
But of course it's not part of the medical expertise to tell you whether health is a good thing .
Nowhere in medical school can you learn any reason for thinking health is a good thing .
That 's not a medical question .
Mises would say it 's not an answerable question at all ; others might say , well yes , maybe it is an answerable question , but at any rate it's not a medical question — maybe it's a philosophical question or a theological question or something like that .
Socrates used to say that the doctor can tell you what 's likely to make you live or die , but the doctor can't tell you whether you'd be better off alive or dead .
That goes outside of the doctor 's area of expertise .
The philosopher tells you whether your life is worth living or not : " the unexamined life is not worth living , " so if you 're not examining your life , you 're better off dead .
That 's what Dr. Socrates would say .
Mises thinks economics can tell us how to pursue the ends we happen to have , and given that most people prefer prosperity to poverty and cooperation to chaos , Mises thought that there 's some general , all - purpose advice that economists can give .
Mises thought economics could tell us how to pursue the ends we happen to have .
Rothbard went further .
Rothbard went further .
In the last chapter of Power and Market , Rothbard says that although economics per se can't give us positive ethical advice — it can't tell us what goals to aim at — it can criticize certain goals as being incoherent .
And although I say that Rothbard here is going beyond Mises , in a sense Rothbard would think of himself as continuing what Mises was doing , even if Mises did n't call it this .
So for example Mises argues that socialist calculation is impossible : you cannot rationally allocate resources in a socialist economy .
Well , suppose that was your goal — to rationally allocate resources in a socialist economy .
It certainly seems relevant to find out that the goal is impossible .
If the goal is impossible , then it seems like you do n't have any good reason to pursue it .
This is a way of criticizing ends : not criticizing ends on the grounds that they 're bad , that it would be a bad thing to achieve this goal , but rather to argue that the goal can't be achieved at all .
So in the last chapter of Power and Market , Rothbard runs through what he calls various positions of " anti- market ethics , " and tries to refute various positions on the grounds that they posit goals that are somehow economically impossible , or logically incoherent , or in one way or another can be shown not to be possible .
But he does n't think that economics can per se give us positive goals to aim at , or show us what is really worthwhile ; he thinks you have to do philosophy for that .
That 's why he only does this criticism of ethical theories in Power and Market , and you have to go to The Ethics of Liberty to get his positive ethical arguments .
Positive Ethics
The question is : can economics or praxeology give us anything more than that ?
Can it give us any implications for positive ethical theorising ?
What more can it tell us about ethics ?
I 'm going to explore some various possibilities .
If you 're hoping that I 'm going to derive an ethical system from the axioms of praxeology for you today , well — we do n't have time for that !
So I 'm just going to give various suggestions about various issues .
First of all there 's this big dispute between Mises on the one hand and Carl Menger , the founder of the Austrian School , on the other .
Menger had a category of what he called " imaginary goods . "
He said that in order for something to be a good , it has to meet a certain number of criteria , one of which is that it has to be suitable for achieving certain goals or satisfying certain human needs .
But , he says , there are some things that do n't really satisfy any human need , while you think they do — like fake cures , things that are supposed to cure you but they do n't really work ; he seems for some reason to have included cosmetics in this category ; you might wonder about that .
But anyway , he thinks various things that do n't really meet any human need are not real goods , they 're imaginary goods , because although they may be suitable means to certain goals , those goals are not in fact genuine human needs .
Mises thought this was a horrible mistake .
Mises said the economist has no business pontificating about whether these are genuine needs or not ; if you want to explain human behavior , what we think of the person 's desires is irrelevant .
If you want to understand the market for horoscopes , or if you want to understand the market for something genuinely valid , it does n't make any difference .
As long as people think horoscopes are valuable , then they 'll be willing to pay for them , and if they do n't think they 're valuable , then they wo n't , regardless of whether they really are valuable or not .
Mises thought this category was irrelevant for economics .
Mises thought the only mistakes you can make are about the means to your ends , not about the ends themselves .
But he did n't just think it was irrelevant for economics , he thought it was irrelevant , period .
It was n't just that classifying something as an imaginary good was a job for the philosopher rather than for the economist ;
Mises thought that it was n't a job for anybody — because he thought the only way we can make mistakes is about means .
We can't evaluate ends as right or wrong .
Our ends are just whatever we want .
If you want to justify what you 're doing , you have to appeal to some further end you have .
Why am I walking over here ?
In order to get to the chair .
Why do I want to get to the chair ?
In order to sit down .
Why do I want to sit down ?
Well , at some point you just have to end with " because I want to , and that 's that , " Mises thought .
Mises thought the ultimate goal is not capable of being rationally assessed .
The only things you can criticize are people 's means .
The only mistakes you can make are about the means to your ends , not about the ends themselves .
However , there 's a distinction which Mises does n't consider which might complicate this .
It 's the distinction between instrumental means and constitutive means .
And here 's a way of thinking about this .
Suppose that I want to play the Moonlight Sonata ; and so I save money to buy a piano , and to buy sheet music , and to take piano lessons and so forth , so that I 'll be able to play the Moonlight Sonata .
These are all means to the end of playing the Moonlight Sonata ; if you ask me why am I saving this money , why am I buying a piano , etc. , I would say these are all means to my ultimate goal , which is to play the Moonlight Sonata .
But now suppose you come upon me in the middle of playing the Moonlight Sonata , and I 'm hitting a particular note .
And you ask me : " Why are you hitting that particular note ?
Is it just that you find that note valuable in and of itself ? "
And I would answer : " No , I 'm playing that note because I want to play the Moonlight Sonata , and I can't play the Moonlight Sonata without playing that note at that point . "
Well , in a sense , then , playing that note is a means to playing the Moonlight Sonata ; but it 's not a means in the other way .
It 's not a means that 's external to the end ; it 's a means that 's part of the end .
When a means is external to or merely instrumental to an end , then it would make sense to say , " I wish I could have the end without having to go through all these means . "
I wish I could be at the top of the mountain without having to climb all this way up , or I wish I could play the Moonlight Sonata without having to save all this money to buy a piano .
But it does n't make any sense to say , " I wish I could play the Moonlight Sonata without having to play all these notes " — because the Moonlight Sonata just is those notes in that order .
So there are cases where a means can be a constitutive part of the end rather than being an external means to it .
And a lot of things that Mises considers ultimate ends you might think are really means , but they 're constitutive means rather than instrumental means .
So then the question is : well , can we deliberate about constitutive means ?
How do we determine whether something is a constitutive means to an end ?
It seems it 's not a matter of cause and effect any more ; it 's more a matter of logical or conceptual analysis .
" Ethical internalism is the view that you can't have any moral duties that you do n't have any motivation to pursue . "
Why does Mises think that if you 're an explanatory value - subjectivist , you have to be a normative value - subjectivist ?
I think that his reason comes in his two - step argument for why he thinks explanatory value - subjectivism implies utilitarianism .
( Both these steps , I think , are denied by Rothbard . )
So first he thinks that explanatory value - subjectivism implies normative value - subjectivism : if you can only explain things in terms of people 's subjective values , then you have to give up the idea of there being any objective standard of value .
I 'll say in a minute why I think he thinks that .
Second , he thinks that that position in turn implies utilitarianism .
And you might think that 's very odd ; because you might think that if someone says economics implies utilitarianism , it sounds like they think that economics implies a positive ethical theory — because we usually think of utilitarianism as a particular ethical theory , a theory that says that certain things are objectively good .
The standard versions of utilitarianism , like John Stuart Mill 's version , assert that a certain goal — human welfare , happiness , pleasure , satisfaction — is intrinsically valuable and worth pursuing , objectively so .
And then our job is to pursue it .
Clearly Mises can't mean that .
Since Mises thinks that there are no objective values , when Mises embraces utilitarianism he can't be embracing the view that human welfare is an objective value .
What Mises means by " utilitarianism " is a little bit different from the kind of utilitarianism that people like John Stuart Mill advocate .
By " utilitarianism "
Mises means something like simply giving people advice about how to achieve the goals they already have .
So you 're not necessarily endorsing their goals , but utilitarianism says that really the only real role for any kind of evaluation is simply to talk about means to ends , because you can't evaluate the ends .
And I think we can see both why he thinks explanatory value - subjectivism implies normative value - subjectivism , and why he thinks that in turn implies utilitarianism of his sort , in this quote from Theory and History :
All nonutilitarian systems of ethics look upon the moral law as something outside the nexus of means and ends .
The moral code has no reference to human well - being and happiness , to expediency , and to the mundane striving after ends .
It is heteronomous , i.e. , enjoined upon man by an agency that does not depend on human ideas and does not bother about human concerns .
So that 's the position that Mises thinks he 's attacking .
He 's attacking the view that the proper moral code is completely independent of what actually makes people happy or what they actually happen to want .
And in a sort of slap at Kant , he calls this sort of thing " heteronomous . "
Now the term " heteronomous , " which is supposed to be the opposite of " autonomous " — " autonomous " means somehow governed by a law you give to yourself , and " heteronomous " means governed by a law imposed on you from something else —
Kant had used the term " heteronomous " to mean following your inclinations , which are external to and distinct from your rational will , and therefore you 're acting heteronomously when you obey your inclinations .
Now Mises is sort of turning Kant 's terminology upside - down here .
But Mises thinks it 's presumptuous to tell people that they ought to be pursuing something completely unrelated to anything they actually happen to want , desire , or have any motivation or personal reason to pursue .
Now I think the reason he thinks that is that if you think that all action , as praxeology teaches , is a matter of pursuing ends , and the ends you pursue are your own — you can't pursue someone else 's end unless it also happens to be your own end — then it just does n't even make sense to demand of people that they pursue some end that they have no motivation for , no interest in , no personal reason to pursue .
So you might say that he 's relying on something like the " ought implies can " principle — that it does n't make sense to demand that you morally ought to do something unless you can do it .
If I said , " you are morally obligated all to fly up to the ceiling right now , " that would n't make any sense , to say that you ought to do it or that you should feel guilty for not doing it , because you do n't have the choice , you do n't have any control over whether you do that or not .
I think that Mises thinks that because our actions can only be actions aiming at ends that we have — we can't perform an action without aiming at some end , and the end has to be an end we 've got — it just does n't make any sense to demand of us that we act in accordance with some objective code of ethics .
" It 's not terribly controversial : most people are pro-happiness . "
However , I think that what he 's really arguing for here is better understood as a kind of ethical internalism rather than genuine normative value - subjectivism .
Ethical internalism is the view that you can't have any moral duties that you do n't have any motivation to pursue .
Now that 's a broad family of theories , because according to some theories the moral duty just gives you a motivation , whereas for other theories , no , you 've already got your motivations , and the moral duty can't get its foot in the door unless you 've already got one .
Those are very different kinds of internalism .
But still the internalists all agree that there are no moral duties without some corresponding motivation on your part .
And I think that Mises is really arguing for that .
But it 's important to see that that 's not the same thing as normative value - subjectivism , because it might be that , given your motive , and given some appropriate story , the moral duty really is an objective one .
And likewise , the reason he thinks that this has to be purely utilitarian , that there can't be any actions that are right or wrong in themselves , but only as part of promoting some further goal , is that he thinks all action has to have a means - end structure .
But again , you can have a means that is constitutive rather than instrumental .
If I 'm playing this particular note because I want to play the Moonlight Sonata , then that note is a means to playing the entire sonata , but it 's not an external one .
Likewise , people who say a certain action is morally right in and of itself might mean that it is n't an external or instrumental means to some further goal , but is just part of , say , the good life .
The Goal of Happiness
Now something like Mises 's view was recently defended by Leland Yeager in a book called Ethics As Social Science , where he accepts Mises 's view that ultimate goals cannot be rationally assessed .
He says : therefore , ultimate goals are rationally arbitrary , but the means to those goals are n't , and therefore the advantage of utilitarianism of Mises 's sort , which simply says , " promote whatever satisfies human desires , " is that it 's the best theory because it minimises the amount of ethical arbitrariness .
All that 's arbitrary is just this ultimate goal , happiness ; but although it 's arbitrary , it 's not terribly controversial : most people are pro-happiness .
Whereas if you add more intrinsic values in addition to happiness , things like moral duties and so forth , then you 're increasing the number of ultimate ends .
And since ultimate ends are rationally arbitrary , your theory is getting more arbitrary the more of those you add .
I 'm not so sure about that ; if you really think the whole thing rests on an ultimate thing that 's arbitrary , I 'm not sure that whether it 's one or many makes that much difference .
But at any rate , the assumption that you can't rationally assess ends is something that I 'm not convinced of .
There 's something called reflective equilibration , which is the idea that you weigh various beliefs and values and judgments against each other and see whether they conflict with each other .
If they conflict with each other then you revise them to make them not conflict .
And so if you 've got some ultimate end , you can't assess it as a means to some further end , perhaps , but you can assess it by whether it fits in consistently with everything else .
Now that 's a kind of assessment .
You might think it 's a kind of wimpy assessment , but it 's an assessment .
We started off with Socrates , and Socrates has to come in again .
There 's this tradition I call the eudaimonic tradition , from the Greek word for happiness or well - being , eudaimonia .
And this is a tradition that runs through Socrates , Plato , Aristotle , the Stoics , and it runs on through the medieval philosophers and the Scholastics , Aquinas and so forth ; in fact it 's the dominant ethical tradition of the first 2,000 years of Western philosophy .
It 's not until after the end of the Middle Ages that it begins to be whittled away by new theories .
And this is the view according to which there is an ultimate good , which usually gets called " happiness " — but that can be somewhat misleading , because it 's not a pleasant feeling of satisfaction , although it may involve that — but it's a state of your life objectively going well , your life being an objective success , something like your being successful at living a good human life : that 's what eudaimonia is .
That 's the ultimate good .
And morality is not just an instrumental means to that good ; it 's actually part of it .
Morality stands to the ultimate human good as playing one note stands to playing the whole sonata — or actually , probably as playing two - thirds of the sonata stands to the whole sonata ( or if you 're a Stoic , as playing the entire sonata stands to playing the entire sonata ) .
And there are some interesting connections between this tradition and Austrian economics , simply because Austrian economics in a way indirectly grows out of this tradition .
The earliest forerunners of Austrian economics are the late Scholastics , who developed a subjective theory of value in the explanatory sense of " subjective , " and they developed many of the early theories and early parts of what would later go on , running through the French School , finally to become the Austrian School .
And if you look at Rothbard 's History of Economic
Thought , there 's a long section on how cool the Scholastics were .
So from the fact that the Scholastics are forerunners of Austrian economics , and the Scholastics are coming at the tail end of this tradition that runs back to Socrates and Aristotle and so forth , I think it 's not that surprising that there are some commonalities .
For this tradition means - end analysis is central : we evaluate things in terms of their being means to ends .
But each person has an ultimate end .
And this ultimate end is n't just feeling satisfied or something like that ; it 's an objective state of human flourishing .
And we can talk about wrong ends as well as wrong means , because those wrong ends are really misidentified constitutive means .
So in other words , if you wrongly value something as an end , what 's really going on is that you are taking it to be a constitutive part of your ultimate good when it is n't .
Now according to this tradition , why do they say that we have just one ultimate end ?
Why not say that we have lots , that there are lots of things we want : ice cream , fame , not being killed ?
We 've got all these different things , but why suppose that they 're all constituents of some big super - end ?
Well , I think part of the reason they think this is : what happens when you make trade - offs ?
Suppose there are two ultimate ends you have : ice cream and fame .
Those are two ultimate ends you have , and they come in degrees .
( That 's why I did n't use not being killed , because that 's less a matter of degree . )
So you want more ice cream , and you want more fame .
And sometimes those go together , like winning an ice - cream - eating contest .
But still there are lots of cases where these goals might conflict , and so you have to do trade - offs , and decide between them .
If you 're deciding between them , that 's an action .
Actions have to have a means - end structure , right ?
So if you 're trying to decide how to trade off between ice cream and fame , then doing that must be a means to some end .
Well , what is the end ?
It ca n't be the end of maximizing the ice cream , because you have n't decided whether that 's what you 're going to do .
It ca n't be the end of maximizing fame , because you have n't decided that .
It ca n't be the end of getting the maximization of both , because it 's a trade - off — that 's impossible .
Instead , you 're trying to maximize something of which these two are parts , some general , overall satisfaction — that 's what you 're trying to maximize .
You might wonder whether " maximize " is even the right word , but anyway you 're trying to promote some good that includes both of these intrinsic good ; these are intrinsic parts of your overall good .
And it's that sort of thing that leads the eudaimonists to think that whenever you 're acting , you 're always promoting some ultimate good of yours , some ultimate end or aim .
Why not just say that the ultimate aim you 're pursuing is some psychological state , like pleasure ?
We know how John Stuart Mill would have analyses this ; he 'd say , well , you like ice cream because ice cream is n't really your final end , ice cream promotes pleasure .
And you like fame because it also gives you pleasure .
And so it 's really pleasure that 's the ultimate goal , and ice cream and fame are simply means to that .
And then your trade - off is just to determine which one will give you the most pleasure .
Or as Mises puts it , Mises talks about getting rid of uneasiness .
And sometimes he seems to mean this in a purely formal sense : simply getting something that satisfies you more instead of something that satisfies you less , getting something you prefer over something you " dis- prefer , " to use a Stoic term .
( Actually to misuse it , in this context . )
But sometimes
Mises talks as though there 's this feeling you get of uneasiness : which of the various things I can choose will make this feeling go away ?
Getting rid of that horrible feeling of uneasiness is the goal .
Sometimes Mises sounds like that , sometimes he does n't .
At any rate , you might say : why not take that view ?
Why not say that our ultimate goal is some psychological feeling like pleasure , or decreasing felt uneasiness , or something like that , and that everything else we do is a means to that ?
Morality is not just an instrumental means to living a good human life : it 's actually part of it .
It stands to the ultimate human good as playing one note stands to playing the whole sonata .
Well , here 's the problem with that view .
Suppose I buy life insurance .
And you ask me , why am I doing that ?
And I say : so that my loved ones will do well after my death .
So it looks like I 'm treating buying life insurance as a means to my loved ones ' doing well after my death .
Now this is either an ultimate goal of mine , or it's a means to some further goal .
Well , whichever one it is , this is not a feeling .
And it 's also not the cause of a feeling .
Unless you 're assuming that you 're looking down from heaven after you 're dead — or up , if things go worse — but anyway you 're hanging around after death and seeing your loved ones doing well , and you 're getting a charge out of that .
But it seems like you do n't have to assume that you 're actually going to experience your loved ones ' doing well in order to buy life insurance .
People who do n't believe in an afterlife , or people who believe in an afterlife where they 're off somewhere not being involved with human concerns , still buy life insurance .
So it seems that this is something we do that is not a means to pleasure .
Now obviously someone could say : well , wait a second , you get pleasure out of the thought that your loved ones will do well after your death , right ?
Yeah , that 's true .
So here 's something , the belief that my loved ones will do well .
And that causes pleasure .
And maybe that 's part of my reason for buying life insurance .
But is it really plausible to say it 's really that belief rather than their actually doing well ?
Because one is n't a means to the other .
Your loved ones ' doing well in the future can't be a cause of your belief that they 'll do well now , unless you believe in backward causation .
So even if you believe that the belief is part of your goal , there 's still the goal of their actually doing well too — unless you think you do n't really have that goal at all , you really just have the belief as your goal .
Suppose I offer you a magic pill that costs half the cost of the life insurance .
And this magic pill will make you believe that your loved ones will do well after you 're dead .
And so you can either have the life insurance for $ 100 , or this pill for $ 50 .
If all you care about is the belief that your loved ones will do well , then you 'd take the pill over the life insurance .
Well , from the fact that presumably at least a lot of people would buy the life insurance rather than the pill , that suggests that they care about their loved ones ' actually doing well .
And likewise Aristotle thinks that this is naturally the way we think .
He raises the question : can people 's welfare be affected after they 're dead ?
And he did n't believe in an afterlife , at least not a personal afterlife — he thought there was some aspect of you that lived on , but it was n't your personal identity — so he was n't talking about an afterlife .
He thought that if there 's something you cared about , a loved one or some project , and right after you die the project either succeeded or failed , he thought that would make some difference to how we evaluate the success of your whole life .
So our ultimate good , according to this tradition , is not pleasure — although pleasure 's part of it , pleasure 's one of the things we care about , relief from felt uneasiness is great , but it 's not the only thing that we actually pursue .
Aristotle would say that your life 's being an objective success includes the well - being of your friends .
It 's not that the well - being of your friends causes you some jollies — it does , sure , but that 's not all there is to it .
In fact , he would say that the welfare of your friends causes you pleasure because it 's part of your good , not vice versa — that pleasure is a byproduct of getting what you think is good rather than the opposite .
Rights and Utility
Okay , let me finish up with a largely unrelated question — though it 's not completely unrelated , because these all interconnect .
The question is about the relation between rights and utility .
The question is whether rights derive from utility — in other words , is the reason that we have rights the fact that rights are a strategy that 's most likely to promote either our personal self - interest or social welfare ( you can take either an egoistic or a universalistic version of utilitarianism ) — is that the ultimate foundation of rights ?
Or are our rights completely independent of utility ?
There are those who think that our rights are completely based on utility , that the only grounding for rights is that they somehow are strategies for promoting human welfare , either one 's own or everybody 's .
And in some sense Mises seems to think something like that .
On the other hand , you might think rights are completely independent of utility , that rights just are what they are , regardless of their results .
Maybe Walter Block thinks that , I 'm not sure .
Rothbard is often said to have thought that , but if you read The Ethics of Liberty it 's not so clear ; there is some sort of eudaimonic thing going on in the background there , with the Aristotelian stuff in the early chapters .
I want to end by giving some quick reasons why I think that it 's a mistake to think either that rights depend wholly on utility or that rights are wholly independent of utility .
Here 's why I think rights can't depend wholly on utility : because whatever we choose , we choose either as an ultimate end or as a means — in economic terms , either as a producer 's good or a consumer 's good .
Either you choose it as some ultimate thing you want for its own sake , or you choose it as a means to producing some further thing .
So if any sort of utilitarianism is true , then morality is a producer 's good , not a consumer 's good .
And it 's solely a producer 's good ; I mean , everyone agrees that it 's partly a producer 's good .
Everyone agrees that one of the things about morality that 's good is that it has good results .
But if you 're a utilitarian , you have to think that morality is not a constitutive means to the good , it 's simply a purely instrumental means .
Why is that problematic ?
Well , nearly all sophisticated utilitarians — and this definitely includes Mises — think that it's not a good strategy to promote human welfare to constantly be deciding everything on a case - by - case basis .
Most sophisticated utilitarians are some kind of rule - utilitarians , or indirect utilitarians .
They think that you have to commit yourself to some general set of principles or values .
You can't just decide everything that comes up on a case - by - case basis .
The best way to achieve long - term results of the kind you want is to commit yourself to acting in a principled fashion .
" I think that it 's a mistake to think either that rights depend wholly on utility or that rights are wholly independent of utility . "
Here 's an example that John Hospers , a former Libertarian Party candidate for President , gives in one of his books .
He says : suppose you 're an umpire in a game , or a referee , and you 're making decisions , making calls — " he 's safe , " " he 's out , " — and you suddenly begin to reflect philosophically while you 're standing out there , and you think , " What 's the purpose ?
What 's my purpose here as a referee ?
Well , my purpose is to facilitate the game going well .
What 's the purpose of the game ? "
And suppose that you conclude that the purpose of the game is to give pleasure to the spectators .
I do n't know whether that 's the right story about the purpose of the game , but suppose that 's what you conclude .
Then you might conclude : " Well , then , when I give my calls and decide who 's safe and who 's out , I should make whatever call will be most pleasing to the spectators .
And so I wo n't pay any attention to the actual rules of the game ; I 'll just consider : is it a home game or an away game ?
How happy are the people in the stands going to be with my ruling ? "
Now this might maximize spectator pleasure in the short run , but soon it'll become obvious that winning or losing in this game no longer depends at all on the skill and abilities of the players .
The players can just do any darn thing , and you 'll automatically rule in favor of team A if there are more people in the stands favoring team A .
Once it turns out that you 're ruling in this manner , all the fun 's going to go out of the game for the spectators .
If you 're constantly ruling with an attempt to please the spectators , that 's going to end up in the long run making the spectators very unhappy .
You 're much more likely to please the spectators in the long run if you just stick to the rules of the game .
Likewise , most utilitarians think that you 're more likely to promote human welfare in the long run if you stick to definite rules .
And libertarian utilitarians think these definite rules include rules of property rights and non-aggression and so forth , that sticking to those in the long run causes more happiness , because people can count on having their rights respected , they 're not constantly worried that suddenly their rights are going to be overridden for social utility , and so forth .
So they 're going to be better off .
So what most utilitarians say is that you should behave as if you valued these rules for their own sake , even though you really value them just for the sake of utility .
But my worry is : what does it mean to say that you should value something as if it were valuable for its own sake ?
I mean , either you value it for its own sake or you do n't .
If you value it for its own sake , then you 'll choose it if it competes with some other value ; if you do n't value it for its own sake , then you 'll give it up if you find some other way of promoting the same goal .
If your only reason for respecting rights is to promote social utility , then you'd be irrational not to give up rights in any particular case when you could promote social utility otherwise .
So my worry is that this rule - utilitarianism or indirect consequentialism or whatever you want to call it is praxeologically unstable .
However , I also think there are good praxeological reasons not to think that rights are completely independent of utility .
And that 's because given precisely the view I discussed earlier , according to which whenever you 're doing trade - offs between different things , where you 've got different ends , you have to regard them as different parts of an overarching end .
Well , unless rights are the only thing you care about , the only value you have — and I 've sometimes told Walter that that 's his view ( although it is n't really , but it 's fun to say that ) — unless rights are the only values you have , then you have to say : here are a bunch of values , there 's the content of justice or rights , but there are also these other values , and they all have to fit together .
And if all your values have to fit together , then it does n't really make sense to think that you can sort of separate one off and completely decide it without paying attention to any of the rest of them .
I think each part of your value system has to have its content at least responsive to the other parts .
And this is what the Greeks called " unity of virtue . "
Now people often say that the unity of virtue just means that if you have one virtue , you have to have them all ; but I think the real core of the view is that the content of any one virtue is partly determined by , or responsive to , the content of the other virtues .
Your account of what justice requires can't be completely independent of your account of what courage requires , or your account of what generosity requires , or your account of any other virtue .
Using FizzBuzz to Find Developers who Grok Coding January 24 , 2007
Posted by Imran Ghory in job interviews
On occasion you meet a developer who seems like a solid programmer .
They know their theory , they know their language .
They can have a reasonable conversation about programming .
But once it comes down to actually producing code they just do n’t seem to be able to do it well .
You would probably think they ’re a good developer if you ’ld never seen them code .
This is why you have to ask people to write code for you if you really want to see how good they are .
It does n’t matter if their CV looks great or they talk a great talk .
If they ca n’t write code well you probably do n’t want them on your team .
After a fair bit of trial and error I ’ve come to discover that people who struggle to code do n’t just struggle on big problems , or even smallish problems ( i.e. write a implementation of a linked list ) .
They struggle with tiny problems .
So I set out to develop questions that can identify this kind of developer and came up with a class of questions I call “ FizzBuzz Questions ” named after a game children often play ( or are made to play ) in schools in the UK .
In this game a group of children sit around in a group and say each number in sequence , except if the number is a multiple of three ( in which case they say “ Fizz ” ) or five ( when they say “ Buzz ” ) .
If a number is a multiple of both three and five they have to say “ Fizz - Buzz ” .
An example of a Fizz - Buzz question is the following :
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 .
But for multiples of three print “ Fizz ” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “ Buzz ” .
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “ FizzBuzz ” .
Most good programmers should be able to write out on paper a program which does this in a under a couple of minutes .
Want to know something scary ?
– the majority of comp sci graduates can’t .
I ’ve also seen self - proclaimed senior programmers take more than 10 - 15 minutes to write a solution .
I ’m not saying these people can’t write good code , but to do so they ’ll take a lot longer to ship it .
And in a business environment that ’s exactly what you do n’t want .
This sort of question wo n’t identify great programmers , but it will identify the weak ones .
And that ’s definitely a step in the right direction .

A study of the WebmasterWorld states that 75 % of all blogs on Google 's blogspot are spam .
According to this study the top 15 doorway domains consist of 14 domains , where the spam percentage is over 74 % .
This means that in four search results of current study , three sites turned out to be spam .
The researchers scanned 1000 most searched queries : ' phentermine ' on blogspot.com and the query ' ringtone ' on hometown.aol.com .
The WebmasterWorld experts easily identified more than a half of the search results as spam .
The following list shows the spam percentage on ' top doorway domains ' :
- blogspot.com 77 % - netscape.com
74 % - hometown.aol.com
84 % - hometown.aol.de 91 % - oas.org 78 % - xoomer.alice.it 77 % - home.aol.com 95 % - freewebs.com 52 % - blogstudio.com 99 % - maxpages.com 81 % - usaid.gov 85 % - blogsharing.com
93 % - sitegr.com 100 % - torospace.com 95 % - blog.hix.com
100 %
The list shows that some of these blogs are used exclusively , or almost exclusively , for spam .
The main reason for such a torrent of splogs is the fact that these sites provide blog space for free , just to attract more traffic .
The next list show the spam percentage of spam sites on ' top - level domains ' ( TLD ) :
- .info 68 % - .biz 53 % - .net 12 % - .org 11 % - .com 4.1 %
The aim of this research shows that at the moment Internet actually consists of spam and if we think about it : what would have happened if certain World Wide Web structures , among which Google , Yahoo and other search engines , had not fought spam ?

It is extremely rare for someone to survive a bullet in the head
Michael Moylan was admitted to hospital in Florida on Wednesday complaining of severe head pain .
His wife April fled when a bullet was discovered .
She was subsequently arrested for illegal possession of a firearm .
Moylan , a convicted felon , later told police she had accidentally shot her husband as he slept when she drew a gun kept under her pillow .
She fired the weapon by mistake after being woken up by a burglar alarm in the early hours of Wednesday morning , reports quoted Moylan as saying .
Her previous conviction for cocaine dealing disqualifies her from owning a firearm in the United States .
Mr Moylan , meanwhile , remains in hospital in a stable condition .
A spokesman for the local sheriff told the BBC a decision had yet to be made on whether to charge Mr Moylan , who is also a convicted felon .
The sheriff 's spokesman said it was " logistically not a useful thing " to arrest Mr Moylan at this stage .
If arrested , he said , Mr Moylan would have to appear in court within 21 days and the sheriff 's office would have to pay any of his outstanding medical bills .
" There is no reason for the public to have to pay for this crime , " he said .
Conflicting accounts
Mr Moylan arrived at a Florida hospital on Wednesday , saying he was woken up with a headache so severe he thought he had suffered an aneurysm .
He also reportedly told doctors he thought his wife had elbowed him in the head during the night .
A local newspaper , The Fort Pierce Tribune , quoted the sheriff as saying : " The nurse looked at him and said : ' It appears that you 've been shot . '
And he said : ' No way . ' "
A police search of the couple 's house uncovered a gun and blood - stained rags .
When initially questioned by police , husband and wife reportedly gave conflicting accounts of what had happened .

Here , we demonstrate that the active component of marijuana , delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) , competitively inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) as well as prevents AChE - induced amyloid beta-peptide ( A - beta ) aggregation , the key pathological marker of Alzheimer 's disease .
Computational modeling of the THC - AChE interaction revealed that THC binds in the peripheral anionic site of AChE , the critical region involved in amyloidgenesis .
Compared to currently approved drugs prescribed for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease , THC is a considerably superior inhibitor of A - beta aggregation , and this study provides a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism through which cannabinoid molecules may directly impact the progression of this debilitating disease .

Cannabinoids reveal importance of spike timing coordination in hippocampal function Nat Neurosci .
9 : 1526-1533 .
Cannabinoids impair hippocampus - dependent memory in both humans and animals , but the network mechanisms responsible for this effect are unknown .
Here we show that the cannabinoids Delta( 9 ) - tetrahydrocannabinol and CP55940 decreased the power of theta , gamma and ripple oscillations in the hippocampus of head - restrained and freely moving rats .
These effects were blocked by a CB1 antagonist .
The decrease in theta power correlated with memory impairment in a hippocampus - dependent task .
By simultaneously recording from large populations of single units , we found that CP55940 severely disrupted the temporal coordination of cell assemblies in short time windows ( less than 100 ms ) yet only marginally affected population firing rates of pyramidal cells and interneurons .
The decreased power of local field potential oscillations correlated with reduced temporal synchrony but not with firing rate changes .
We hypothesize that reduced spike timing coordination and the associated impairment of physiological oscillations are responsible for cannabinoid - induced memory deficits .
cannabinoids impair all stages of memory including encoding , consolidation , and retrieval

Yesterday , I discussed protein a little bit , and it ’s such an important topic that I think it deserves its own Tuesday 10 ( Read all Tuesday 10 columns here ) .
In all the debates this year about sugar ( carbohydrates ) and hydrogenated oil ( fat ) , we forget that protein warrants consideration as well .
The wrong proteins in the diet will quickly sabotage optimal health .
It helps to understand that protein is a macronutrient .
What we call “ protein ” is , in fact , a family of amino acid molecules .
When grouped together in various combinations we get proteins .
There ’s no protein molecule hanging out in that hamburger ; rather , the animal tissue is made of many different amino acid building blocks .
Protein is just a catch - all term we use .
This is why vegetarians wo n’t keel over as people once feared .
However , that does n’t validate the popular myth that plant protein is equivalent or even superior to animal protein .
Plant protein and animal protein is not equivalent , for several reasons :
Animal protein is more complete and contains more essential amino acids – the amino acids we ca n’t synthesize in our bodies and thus require in our diets for optimal health – than plant protein .
Contrary to popular belief , dietary animal protein is consistently associated with greater bone mineral density and fewer bone fractures ( PDF ) , while dietary plant protein is associated with lower bone mineral density .
Animal protein may increase calcium excretion , but it increases calcium absorption to a greater degree , resulting in a net positive effect on bone health .
Plant proteins often come with plant toxins , while animal protein is generally harmless .
That ’s probably why plant protein consumption has been linked to increased disease risk and animal protein consumption has little to no effect .
Heck , the plant proteins often are toxins themselves , as with the case of wheat gluten .
It takes more calories to get adequate amounts of protein on a vegetarian diet .
Living on beans and tofu increases the amount of carbohydrates in one ’s diet significantly ( and unnecessarily ) .
I hope no one believes that anymore .
Here are my ten ideal sources of protein , and their popular but inferior counterparts .
1. Winner : Grass - Fed Beef
Loser : Grain - Fed Beef
The average cow is raised on cheap grain that will kill it after about six months ( they ’re conveniently slaughtered before this happens – but not always ) .
Hardly something I want to put in my body .
Grass - fed , organic beef wo n’t make the vegetarians happy , but this beef is rich in beneficial fatty acids that are missing from the factory - raised cattle .
It ’s cleaner , healthier , more flavorful , and richer in nutrients .
And grass - fed beef is typically raised in humane conditions .
If you eat beef and can get your hands on it , grass - fed is a must .
It ’s getting quite easy to find these days , but you can order online from many outlets as well .
2. Winner : Pastured Chicken
Loser : Regular frozen chicken
No comparison .
Did you know chicken has flavor ?
Yeah , bizarre , I know .
Chicken raised properly on pasture and allowed to eat bugs and grasses ( not shoved by the cluckload into dirty factories ) is rich in EFAs and is one of the best sources of protein available .
Also , if you cover a whole one in salt , pepper , and garlic , stuff it full of herbs , rub it down with grass - fed butter or olive oil , and place it in a preheated oven , you ’ve got one of the greatest dinners in the history of the world .
3. Winner : Wild Salmon
Loser : farmed salmon
Fish is healthy , right ?
Do n’t even bother patting yourself on the back for eating salmon if it ’s from a farm .
Farmed salmon is produced in a way that ’s the seaside equivalent of a chicken factory .
As a result , the fish are often sick and infected .
They ’re fed cheap feed that does not yield the desirable omega - 3 - rich flesh .
They ’re miserable and full of inflammatory omega - 6 fatty acids .
Stick with wild only .
Most restaurants use farmed salmon , so you have to get a little aggressive about this .
Notice a trend here with my emphasis on good fats in protein foods ?
Source makes a huge difference in the quality of protein you get .
Meat is – or was – a very valuable food because it ’s so dense in nutritious fat and protein .
What an efficient , rich source of energy !
Helpfully , our modern factories have eliminated the nutritional value and left us with weak , flabby , carcinogenic , diseased patties and drumsticks .
Hey , thanks , guys .
( Although we consumers do n’t get off easy : maybe if we ate less … )
Loser : fish sticks and popcorn shrimp
I do n’t think I need to go into this one .
5. Winner : Pastured Eggs
Loser : egg substitute and / or regular eggs
If eggs were meant to be eaten as mechanically - separated , low - fat , chemically - altered whites in a carton , the chickens would have done it by now .
But an egg is a chick in the making .
It ’s rich in antioxidants , good fats , vitamins , and – for the calories – a lot of protein .
Doubly so if your eggs come from pastured hens .
Things like Egg Beaters are the result of food manufacturers exploiting fears based on grossly inaccurate health information .
There ’s nothing healthy about such unnatural products .
6. Winner : Greek Yogurt
Loser : Low - fat , sugar - sweetened yogurt
No comparison .
The Greek stuff is richer , fattier , more nutritious and lower in sugar .
Again , when choosing an animal protein source , choose one that also provides valuable fats to maximize nutrition .
Do n’t go for the conventional animal products that are high in chemicals , hormones , bad fats , and sugars .
Yogurt is n’t a staple of my diet , but if I eat it it ’s certainly not a plastic cup of sugar - infused strawberry dessert .
7. Winner : Shellfish
Loser : Deep - fried and breaded clams and oysters
When anthropologists search ancient human coastal settlements , they invariably find piles and piles of discarded shells .
Our ancestors were n’t gathering shellfish to make jewelry .
They were n’t hoarding pearls .
They were gathering them because shellfish , including clams , oysters , mussels , and snails , are sources of animal protein that also happen to be full of iron , zinc , selenium , iodine , omega - 3s , and other marine nutrients that we need to thrive .
And , since farmed shellfish are raised just like wild shellfish – in the ocean feeding off microscopic lifeforms – without any junk food input from humans , farmed shellfish are just as good as wild .
Limit or avoid shellfish farmed in China , however , as the waters there run a little more polluted than other waters .
8. Winner : Whey Protein Isolate
Loser : Whey Protein Concentrate
I know , I know – I just got done saying how important it is to eat whole food protein that comes with other nutrients .
So what the heck is whey protein isolate , a processed protein powder that ’s anything but “ real , whole food , ” doing on this list ?
Ultimately , I ’m about results .
I ’m about food with proven health benefits as shown through science , and the body of literature supporting whey protein isolate as a worthy source of protein is impossible to ignore :
Since whey protein isolate is higher in protein ( the stuff that ’s giving all the health benefits ) than whey protein concentrate , eat the former if you can get it .
9. Winner : Liver ( from grass - fed or pastured animals )
Loser : Tofu
Though it ’s known primarily as nature ’s multivitamin because it contains ample amounts of vitamin A ( important for bone health and testosterone production ) , copper ( important for heart health ) , choline ( important for liver health ) , folate ( important for brain and fetal health ) , and B- vitamins ( important for almost everything ) , people tend to forget that liver is a rich source of protein , too .
It might look weird to compare it to tofu , but since nothing else really compares to liver – and tofu is really easy and really fun to pick on – I went with the soy - based meat alternative .
10 .
What ’s your favorite protein source ?
Give me a shout , Apples .
What protein do you favor ?

Note : “ Cows ’ milk is for baby cows , ” the saying goes .
You ’ll notice I left cheese and milk out of this list .
While I like a good aged gouda , I wanted to make this list as all - inclusive as possible – and potentially allergenic dairy proteins are not suitable for everyone .
Raw dairy is healthy and enjoyable for many people who can tolerate it , but generally , I think quality meat works better for more people than quality milk .
Cheese , the fermentation of which denatures some of the problematic components while increasing beneficial nutrients , is generally better tolerated than milk , especially aged cheeses like gouda .
Cream and butter are fine in cooking ( or coffee ) , because I do n’t fear saturated fat , but I am concerned about folks who substitute nutritious meat with highly - processed cheese .

Perhaps Iraq 's insurgency is much larger than the Defense Department has reported .
Other observers estimate that up to 20 percent of the two million former Baathists may be involved in the insurgency .
This estimate would partly explain the insurgency 's ability to withstand high losses while increasing its market share of violence .
The other likely explanation is one the military itself makes : that the insurgency is n't a fragile hierarchical organization but rather a resilient network made up of small , autonomous groups .
This means that the insurgency is virtually immune to attrition and decapitation .
It will combine and recombine to form a viable network despite high rates of attrition .
Body counts -- and the military should already know this -- are n't a good predictor of success .
Given this landscape , let 's look at alternative strategies .
First , out - innovating the insurgency will most likely prove unsuccessful .
The insurgency uses an open - source community approach ( similar to the decentralized development process now prevalent in the software industry ) to warfare that is extremely quick and innovative .
New technologies and tactics move rapidly from one end of the insurgency to the other , aided by Iraq 's relatively advanced communications and transportation grid -- demonstrated by the rapid increases in the sophistication of the insurgents ' homemade bombs .
This implies that the insurgency 's innovation cycles are faster than the American military 's slower bureaucratic processes ( for example : its inability to deliver sufficient body and vehicle armor to our troops in Iraq ) .
Second , there are few visible fault lines in the insurgency that can be exploited .
Like software developers in the open - source community , the insurgents have subordinated their individual goals to the common goal of the movement .
This has been borne out by the relatively low levels of infighting we have seen between insurgent groups .
As a result , the military is not going to find a way to chop off parts of the insurgency through political means -- particularly if former Baathists are systematically excluded from participation in the new Iraqi state by the new Constitution .
Third , the United States can try to diminish the insurgency by letting it win .
The disparate groups in an open - source effort are held together by a common goal .
Once the goal is reached , the community often falls apart .
In Iraq , the original goal for the insurgency was the withdrawal of the occupying forces .
If foreign troops pull out quickly , the insurgency may fall apart .
This is the same solution that was presented to Congress last month by our generals in Iraq , George Casey and John Abizaid .
DENVER --
When John Amaechi told the world he was gay , he steeled himself for a torrent of negativity that never really materialized , the former pro basketball player told the Republican Party 's largest gay organization Saturday .
" I underestimated America .
I braced myself for the wrath of a nation under God , " Amaechi said at the Log Cabin Republicans ' annual convention .
" I imagined that it would be a firestorm , that it would be some insane number of letters demanding my deportation or my death .
" And in fact , 95 percent of the correspondence I 've had have been overwhelmingly supportive and positive , " Amaechi said .
" But I will say that the 5 percent that I 've had have been unbelievably , viscerally , frighteningly negative . "
Amaechi is a psychologist who works with corporations and also with children , " and I worried what America would make of that , " he said .
" And it is not an issue . "
Among the most vitriolic of critics was former NBA All - Star Tim Hardaway , whose anti-gay remarks led to his disassociation with the league .
Amaechi , who was raised in England , played in 301 NBA games over five seasons with stops in Cleveland , Orlando , Utah , Houston and New York .
" Probably 30 of my former [ NBA ] teammates have my e-mail and my
telephone contacts and probably 16 or so of those I was in regular
touch with and there are probably 10 people who I have [ on instant
messenger ] .
And zero -- nobody -- who 's active in the NBA has been in
touch with me since the day I came out , despite the fact that most
of them knew I was gay in the first place . "
-- Former NBA player John Amaechi
The 36 - year - old former player said that while he 's heard from everyone he played with at Penn State , he has yet to hear from a single former NBA teammate since coming out in February .
" Probably 30 of my former [ NBA ] teammates have my e-mail and my telephone contacts and probably 16 or so of those I was in regular touch with and there are probably 10 people who I have [ on instant messenger ] .
And zero -- nobody -- who 's active in the NBA has been in touch with me since the day I came out , despite the fact that most of them knew I was gay in the first place , " Amaechi said .
He also wondered why nba.com , the league 's official Web site , has never mentioned his homosexuality when it was such a huge sports story everywhere else .
Amaechi said he thinks the sports world is slowly accepting gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender athletes but he was n't sure if that was indicative of society 's acceptance or even whether sports was an appropriate barometer .
" They are our gladiators , our heroes .
On the other hand , there 's not many of you would trust them with your children , with your car keys or to do your accounting , " he said .
" Let 's face it , for the most part , the stereotype is that they -- we -- are dumb as rocks .
So , I do n't know if they are a terribly good group to be looked at as kind of indicative of societal change or as leaders in that respect . "
At times , Amaechi said he finds himself a little out of place as a gay sports ambassador .
" I 've spent a lot of time in this country and I do adore it on many levels , but we live in a country where a man can be lured to a parking lot , beaten and chased to his death on a freeway , " Amaechi said .
" We live in a country where a shoeless child can be strapped to a fence post and left to die .
...
And yet somehow we expect that the general public will sit up and pay attention when they can focus on ' Gay Shaq . '
" I do n't understand that .
What happens to human empathy when the death of children , of innocents , do not inspire the kind of change we 're looking for ?
But an athlete potentially sacrificing an endorsement here or there or the chiding of his teammates , that would cause this kind of change ? "
In his speech titled " Is Pro Sports Changing ? "
Amaechi said not all change is relevant , a point he illustrated with a story about doing plyometric training in Phoenix with other elite athletes during his playing days .
A young football player begged to be allowed to jump onto the highest of three boxes .
He almost made it but clipped the edge and fell to the floor , skinning his shins .
" Until he grew up , until he got the strength that he needed , until he got the size he needed , until his physical ability and his experiences matched his will , he is indistinguishable from those who could jump on the middle box , " Amaechi said .
" All he has to show for his attempt at this top box is shins with no skin .
" Sometimes change has a threshold , and until you reach it , there is not really any progress . "
As for politics , Amaechi chided Democrats and Republicans alike .
" It 's hard for me to hide the fact that I am no fan of this administration , as much for their foreign policy as for their stance on [ gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender ] issues , " he said .
" However , I am no fan of the Democratic candidates who take four days before they decide that Gen .
Pace 's comments were not very nice . "
Gen .
Peter Pace is the Pentagon 's top general who two months ago called homosexuality immoral and said the military should not condone it by allowing gays to serve openly in the armed forces .
He later expressed regret but did not apologize .
Amaechi surprised many in the audience by declaring he's not a sports fan and that he has no desire to pick up a basketball again , although he is intrigued by the thought of playing for a gay team .
" I have n't watched a professional basketball game in three , maybe four years , " he said .
" And it 's not because I hate the NBA or I harbor any kind of [ resentment ] .
None of that .
It 's just that Saturday afternoon , I can think of something better to do . "

Contrary to its " do no evil " pledge , Google has used evil federal anti-trust law as leverage to force Microsoft to change Windows Vista to permit consumers to choose which desktop search program will be used .
Shame on Google .
On the other hand , Microsoft does not have clean hands — it 's attempting to use antitrust law to block Google 's acquisition of Double - Click .
Sometimes I wonder — what 's worse for the economy — patents , or antitrust law .
But they are not all that different , are they : the agency that monopolizes the right to decide when force may be used gives companies the right to sue other companies for being too monopolistic — that is , A can sue B for competing too vigorously and successfully in the market ; and with patents , the monopoly - state grants little monopolies to companies to give them the right to sue other companies for competing with them .
The feds sure hate competition , do n't they ?— in both senses .
They do n't want anyone horning in on their racket ; and they also do n't like the market competition of enterprises .
And yet the result of anti-trust and patent law is endless money - wasting , lawyer - hiring legal bickering ... " legal " competition that wastes resources and costs billions of dollars , a type of lose - lose competition that generates nothing but loss , unlike the real competition of the market which leads to gains for all .

The video game economy suffered a great depression of its own .
The video game crash of 1983 ( also known as the Atari shock in Japan ) was a large - scale , two - year crash of the video game industry .
Too many consoles were springing up at the same time , which saturated the market .

All kind of made the franchise still , but only as secondary characters or antagonists .
( Lookin ’ at you , Eggman . )
Do n’t get me wrong – I love my new MacBook Pro ( 2.16 Ghz , 120 GB HD , 2GB RAM , if you care ) , but there ’s a few things that annoy me .
Some of these things they do n’t tell you about before you buy it and others just take a while to notice .
1 . Not enough keys .
By default , all the function keys work as brightness , sound and keyboard light controls .
I ’d prefer the opposite .
The use the function keys , you have to hold down the ‘ fn ’ key , awkwardly placed on the left bottom corner of the keyboard ( where the control key should be ) .
Page - Up , Page - Down , Home and End are also missing .
I used these all the time to scroll .
Now I have to use Fn - Up , Fn-Down , etc .
But the two finger scroll on the trackpad is n’t too bad .
2. Power management .
I really hate the fact that closing the lid turns almost everything off .
Opening it again requires you to reconnect to the network and applications to reconnect as well .
At work , this means me typing in two passwords and a 14 - digit passcode to get access to my email again .
What I really want is for the machine to do nothing when I close the lid , then sleep or hibernate when I tell it to .
Macs do n’t have a hibernate mode , but the sleep mode is pretty good .
It consumes almost no power at all .
There is a Hibernate - like “ Safe Sleep ” mode , but it only kicks in when your battery is completely dead .
3. Power options .
My work - provided laptop allows you to swap out the DVD drive ( which I hardly use ) for an extra battery .
This allowed me to do 5 hours or more of slugging through meetings .
You ca n’t replace the DVD drive in a MacBook , so I ’m stuck carrying around a power adapter .
The 85 - watt MacBook Pro adapters are bigger than the 60 - watt MacBook adapters too .
I love the MagSafe connector .
For something that you plug in several times a day , it ’s really quick .
The magnet is strong enough that it will pull it into the right spot if you just get the end close .
The plug is symmetrical , so you there ’s no “ right side up ” either .
That said , it ’s annoying that you ca n’t buy one except from Apple .
I love my iGo universal power adapter , but it ’s useless to me now because I ca n’t get a MagSafe tip for it .
4 . The screen does n’t swing back far enough .
Now this is n’t a problem in the cramped airplane seat I ’m currently in , but when the machine is on your lap and you ’re looking down at it , I ’d like it go recline back a few more degrees .
My old laptop would go back almost 180 degrees .
5 . The case seems easy to damage .
I ’m not sure how easy it is to scratch , but I feel like I ’m going to nick it at any minute .
Plastic cases like on the MacBook seem better about this .
Thankfully , Santa brought me a hard case for Christmas and now I can throw the machine in a bag without worrying about it .
6 . The trackpad button sticks up too much .
It ’s not flush with the rest of the case and it ’s even a little sharp around the edges .
7. No VGA - out .
It ’s annoying that if I want to give a presentation that I have to carry around one of those silly dongles .
I know Steve Jobs hates all things analog , but how about dumping one of those Firewire ports no one uses .
I ’d even settle for an S - Video out instead .
8 . No docking solution .
When I sit down at my desk , I need to plug in the DVI , power and USB for keyboard and mouse .
As a result , I do n’t bother unless I ’m going to be there for a while .
As a consolation , the screen is big enough to work on .
9 . No memory card reader .
Most PC laptops these days have an SD card reader which is handy for transferring files to a digital camera or Treo .
I guess there ’s some use for the ExpressCard slot .
10 .
It ’s not the most stable machine around .
It crashes at least once a week , usually after opening or closing the lid .
The later updates have helped fix crashes with the wireless networking .
Sometimes I just ca n’t get it to wake up after closing the lid and end up rebooting it .
The titanium case PowerBooks / MacBooks have been out for 5 years now , so I ’m sure a revamped enclosure will be out soon that will address some of these problems .
In the meantime , my MacBook Pro is wicked fast and fun to use .
It ’s beautiful to look at inside and out and I love having a real Unix environment to use underneath .
It seems that coexisting in a mostly - Windows world has gotten easier over the last few years , partly because of samba file sharing , Java - based applications , cross-platform Firefox and Thunderbird , Apple ’s own suite of applications like iTunes , iCal and iSync and even the ability to run fast versions of Windows with BootCamp or Parallels .
In any case , I ’m sure I ’ll be able to find a few more things to hate about it before it ’s time to upgrade .
Moto : Sbarro's Designs
About Sbarro and the hubless wheel
Sbarro the italian inventor / engineer who designed and built the first working hubless wheels ( patent now held by Globeholding , in Geneva ) produced this design sketch .
Sbarro has built many working rim rider vehicles and at least two working rim rider motorcycles .
A rim rider wheel is a wheel with no center hub , just a clean empty hole .
The Wheel itself is in essence the outer race of a very large bearing .
I believe that Franco Sbarro is the only designer that has employed this type of hubless wheel .
Globeholding ( the current patent holder ) appears to be agressively defending their intellectual property rights ( even I have received emails from them ) , so lets hope that means they have some great plans in the works ...
Working bikes
Here are some images of the actual working vehicles Sbarro has built ( from his site ) .
Other Sbarro designs
Here 's a simple design sketch I found in one of my motorcycle mags .
Here 's some Sbarro inspired work passed on to me by Scott Beale who found them during a search on www.search.com.

I thought it would be interesting to include a quote ( reformatted ) about Sbarro's ( Globeholding 's ) wheels from Ian Drysdale that I found on usenet :
Grudgingly offered for your reading pleasure , and in the vain hope of forestalling further questions .
Q : Thanks to D - Wave Systems — a startup company that ’s been in the news lately for its soon - to - be- unveiled “ Orion ” quantum computer — is humanity now on the verge of being able to solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time ?
A : No .
We ’re also not on the verge of being able to build perpetual - motion machines or travel faster than light .
Q : But could n’t quantum computers try all possible solutions in parallel , and thereby solve NP - complete problems in a heartbeat ?
A : Yes , if the heart in question was beating exponentially slowly .
Otherwise , no .
Contrary to widespread misconception , a quantum computer could not “ try all possible solutions in parallel ” in the sense most people mean by this .
In particular , while quantum computers would apparently provide dramatic speedups for a few “ structured ” problems ( such as factoring integers and simulating physical systems ) , it ’s conjectured that they could n’t solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time .
Q : But is n’t factoring an NP - complete problem ?
A : Good heavens , no !
While factoring is believed to be intractable for classical computers , it ’s not NP - complete , unless some exceedingly unlikely things happen in complexity theory .
Where did you get the idea that factoring was NP - complete ?
( Now I know how Richard Dawkins must feel when someone asks him to explain , again , how “ life could have arisen by chance . ” )
Q : How could the people at D - Wave not understand that quantum computers could n’t solve NP - complete problems in polynomial time ?
A : To his credit , Geordie Rose ( the founder of D - Wave ) does understand this ; see here for example .
And yet , essentially every article I ’ve read about D - Wave gives readers exactly the opposite impression .
The charitable explanation is that the D - Wave folks are being selectively quoted or misquoted by journalists seeking to out - doofus one another .
If so , one hopes that D - Wave will try harder in the future to avoid misunderstandings .
Q : But even if it gave only polynomial speedups ( as opposed to exponential ones ) , could n’t the adiabatic quantum computer that D - Wave built still be useful for industrial optimization problems ?
A : D - Wave ’s current machine is said to have sixteen qubits .
Even assuming it worked perfectly , with no decoherence or error , a sixteen - qubit quantum computer would be about as useful for industrial optimization problems as a roast - beef sandwich .
Q : But even if it was n’t practically useful , would n’t a 16 - qubit superconducting quantum computer still be a major scientific advance ?
A : Yes , absolutely .
Q : So , can D - Wave be said to have achieved that goal ?
A : As Dave Bacon pointed out earlier , it ’s impossible to answer that question without knowing more about how their machine works .
With sixteen qubits , a “ working demo ” does n’t prove anything .
The real questions are : how high are the fidelities , and what are the prospects for scalability ?
Q : But clearly D - Wave is n’t going to give away its precious trade secrets just to satisfy some niggling academics !
Short of providing technical specifics , what else could they do to make computer scientists take them seriously ?
A : Produce the prime factors of

Q : Alright , what else could they do ?
A : Avoid talking like this :
The system we are currently deploying , which we call Trinity , is a capability - class supercomputer specifically designed to provide extremely rapid and accurate approximate answers to arbitrarily large NP - complete problems …
Trinity has a front - end software interface , implemented in a combination of Java and C , that allows a user to easily state any NP - complete problem of interest .
After such a problem has been stated the problem is compiled down to the machine language of the processors at the heart of the machine .
These processors then provide an answer , which is shuttled back to the front end and provided to the user .
This capability can of course be called remotely and / or as a subroutine of some other piece of software .
Or to translate : “ Not only have we built a spaceship capable of reaching Pluto in a few hours , our spaceship also has tinted windows and deluxe leather seats ! ”
If I were them , I ’d focus more on the evidence for their core technological claims , given that those claims are very much what ’s at issue .
Q : While Dave Bacon also expressed serious doubts about the Orion quantum computer , he seemed more enthusiastic than you are .
Why ?
A : Generous and optimistic by nature , Dave strives to give others the benefit of the doubt ( as the Chinese restaurant placemat would put it ) .
Furthermore , as Quantum Pontiff , he ’s professionally obligated to love the quantum sinner and forgive the wayward quantum sheep .
And these are all wonderful qualities to have .
On the other hand , when the hype surrounding some topic crosses a certain threshold , arguably a pricklier approach becomes called for .
Q : If D - Wave fizzles out , will many journalists and policymakers then conclude that quantum computing is bunk ?
A : It does n’t seem unlikely .
Q : What would it take to get these people to recognize the most elementary distinctions ?
A : That ’s the question , is n’t it ?
Update ( 2/13 ) : Lawrence
Ip , my friend from Berkeley who now works at Google , went to the D - Wave “ launch ” in person and kindly provided the following report .
I just came back from the D - Wave announcement .
Unfortunately I had to leave at the start of the Q&A session .
Here ’s what I took away from it ( minus the marketing fluff ) : – They claim to solve integer programming problems on their system .
Geordie Rose was careful to explicitly say that they are only hoping to see a quadratic speedup .
Herb Martin ( the CEO ) was n’t quite as careful in his opening remarks but then he ’s the “ suit ” .
Geordie said that their current chip is not a universal QC ( presumably because their space of Hamiltonians is limited ) but with some work they expect to be able to make it universal .
– Geordie said compared their approach to the efforts in academia as similar to Celera and the Human Genome Project .
He said they were trying to get something that would scale fast and worry about about the quality of the qubits later .
He contrasted this to the academic community ’s efforts to achieve fine control over qubits before scaling up .
They say that they hope to reach 1024 qubits by the end of 2008 .
–
They demoed 3 “ real - world ” problems where they used their system as essentially a blackbox IP solver .
– Searching for protein matches .
Given a protein try to find the closest match in a protein database .
They serially fed all the items from the database to the chip and asked it to score the match against the given protein .
They said it was solving a maximum independent set problem .
– Finding the best seating arrangement at a wedding reception .
Given constraints on which people ca n’t be seated together and who wants to sit together , find the optimal arrangement .
– Solving a Sudoku puzzle . –
At one point Geordie quoted you .
He excerpted a paragraph from your SIGACT article ( the one where you talk about generating Shakespeare ’s 38th play ) and mentioned your proposal of the inability to solve NP - hard problems as a physical law .
As far as I can remember , the only other computer scientist he quoted was Gordon Moore so you ’re in good company . 🙂
The robotic microhand , made of silicon finger bones and plastic balloon joints , when clenched is about as thick as a dime .
A microscopic robot hand , made of silicon and plastic balloons , could help perform surgery and defuse bombs .
The " microhand " is so tiny that when clenched into a fist it measures a little over one millimeter across , or roughly as thick as a dime [ image ] .
It is made using silicon finger bones and balloons for joints that inflate and deflate to flex the fingers .
The robot hand was designed by microelectromechanical systems scientist Yen - Wen Lu at Rutgers University in Piscataway , N.J. , and mechanical engineer Chang - Jin Kim at UCLA .
The prototype has four fingers arranged into a cross , each digit roughly a half - millimeter long , made via conventional semiconductor manufacturing techniques normally used to assemble electronics .
The microhand is gentle but strong enough to pluck a single delicate fish egg from a sticky egg mass [ video ] .
" You could imagine this being used for microsurgery — at the end of a catheter , for instance .
We found we could grab a nerve bundle with it , " Kim told LiveScience .
" We are also working with a company who said this could help disarm explosives .
Right now the robotic manipulators used there are pretty crude , and a gentle and dexterous hand would be helpful . "
Lu and Kim reported their findings online Oct. 16 via the journal Applied Physics Letters .

A leading expert in personality psychology says yes : Personality can change .
The once accepted idea that an individual ’s personality is set in stone is , well , changing .
“ You read about this twin research where these people who have been raised apart have remarkable similarities , ” said Carol Dweck , a psychologist at Stanford University .
“ They married women with the same name ; they named their dog the same thing ; they both build little ships that fit into a bottle and they show up to their reunion wearing almost identical clothing . ”
She added , “ The implication there is that it ’s all programmed in , ” that personality is permanently stamped into our genes .
The static - character research is typically based on a definition of personality comprising five features , called the five - factor model , including openness to experience , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness and neuroticism .
While these factors are important to a person ’s character , Dweck argues they are n’t the definitive word , and results generated from the model could be missing subtle , yet critical , aspects of personality .
She will present her research this week at an annual meeting of the Association for Psychological Science in Washington , D.C. “ My point is that there ’s a really big in - between area that they do n’t talk about , and these are the crucial beliefs that people develop as they grow and learn , ” Dweck told LiveScience in a telephone interview .
For instance , whether a person views intelligence as a fixed trait or one that can change can greatly impact their “ trademark ” behaviors .
Called fixed or growth mindsets , the two different views of oneself develop early in childhood and can contribute tremendously to personality .
“ It has a big impact on their motivation and achievement , ” Dweck said .
“ It plays a role in business and in social relationships , whether people can solve conflicts , and also whether they can bounce back from failures and rejections . ”
When Dweck studied students at Columbia University , she found that those with fixed views about intelligence were primarily focused on proving their smartness and so were less motivated to learn and less likely to take on challenges .
Dweck and her colleagues have shown that “ when you change the belief , a lot of important things happen : students ’ motivation turns around ; their grades and test scores go up ; managers become better mentors , more successful negotiators . ”
When children or even adults are taught that abilities and character features can develop and change , they become more resilient to setbacks .
Similarly , when it comes to romantic relationships , pop magazines often tout the idea that certain personalities ( or astrological signs ) are like oil and water and it ’s best to just steer clear of each other .
Dweck ’s research shows oil and water can change in a way that compatibility is possible .
A sure sign of a “ failed ” relationship is non-stop arguing .
Individuals with fixed ideas about their personalities do n’t try to resolve conflicts .
Why bother ?
“ They just try to either ignore [ the conflict ] or when it gets really bad they consider leaving the relationship , ” Dweck said .
Perhaps it ’s not as tough as people think to save that relationship .
“ They are just beliefs , and beliefs can change , ” Dweck said .
“ We ’re not saying you should n’t have X - rays or CT scans — they ’re wonderful , they ’ve totally revolutionized the practice of medicine , ” said Dr. E. Stephen Amis Jr. , a former president of the American College of Radiology who is chairman of radiology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in New York .
“ But if you go into the emergency room with recurrent pain and get a CT scan every time you show up , that ’s not good .
Use a little common sense . ”

Studies of atomic bomb survivors in Japan found a statistically significant increase in cancer at high levels of exposure — 50 millisieverts , or mSv , about 16 times the current annual average for Americans from medical exams .
But that figure is controversial ; it is not clear that lower levels of radiation exposure are safe .
Nor would it be unusual for a patient to exceed this level , according to a recent paper from the American College of Radiology .
“ It is worth noting that many CT scans and nuclear medicine studies have effective dose estimates in the range of 10 to 25 mSv for a single study , and some patients have multiple studies ; thus it would not be uncommon for a patient ’s estimated exposure to exceed 50 mSv , ” the paper said , adding that “ the International Commission on Radiological Protections has reported that CT doses can indeed approach or exceed levels that have been shown to result in an increase in cancer . ”
A single CT scan of the abdomen , body or spine can expose a patient to 10 mSv , according to the American College of Radiology patient information Web site ( www.radiologyinfo.org, see Safety ) .
Mammography , on the other hand , delivers only 0.7 mSv , and a bone - density scan is only 0.01 mSv .
There are several steps patients can take to protect themselves , and they should not be shy about asking questions , doctors and other experts say .
“ They can always inquire of the referring physician , ‘ Is this test necessary ? ’ ” said Richard Morin , chairman of the radiology college ’s quality and safety committee , adding that “ exams are often done for reasons that are not quite appropriate . ”
Paul Krugman , looking back to today from March 2 , 2008 , analyzes the recent drop in U.S. stock prices and what it might mean for our economic future :
The Big Meltdown , by Paul Krugman , Commentary , NY Times :
The great market meltdown of 2007 began exactly a year ago , with a 9 percent fall in the Shanghai market , followed by a 416 - point slide in the Dow .
But as in the previous global financial crisis , which began with the devaluation of Thailand ’s currency in the summer of 1997 , it took many months before people realized how far the damage would spread .
At the start , all sorts of implausible explanations were offered for the drop in U.S. stock prices .
It was , some said , the fault of Alan Greenspan , ... as if his statement ... that the housing slump could possibly cause a recession ... had been news to anyone .
One Republican congressman blamed Representative John Murtha ...
Even blaming events in Shanghai ... was foolish on its face , except to the extent that the slump in China — whose stock markets had a combined valuation of only about 5 percent of the U.S. markets ’... — served as a wake - up call for investors .
The truth is that efforts to pin the stock decline on any particular piece of news are a waste of time .
...
In 2007 , as in 1987 , investors rushed for the exits not because of external events , but because they saw other investors doing the same .
What made the market so vulnerable to panic ?
It was n’t so much a matter of irrational exuberance ... as it was a matter of irrational complacency .
After the bursting of the technology bubble of the 1990s failed to produce a global disaster , investors began to act as if nothing bad would ever happen again .
Risk premiums ... dwindled away .
...
For a while , growing complacency became a self - fulfilling prophecy .
As the what - me - worry attitude spread , it became easier for questionable borrowers to roll over their debts , so default rates went down .
Also , falling interest rates on risky bonds meant higher prices ... , so those who owned such bonds experienced big capital gains , leading even more investors to conclude that risk was a thing of the past .
Sooner or later , however , reality was bound to intrude .
By early 2007 , ... collapse of the ... housing boom had brought ... widespread defaults on subprime mortgages ...
Lenders insisted that this was an isolated problem , which would n’t spread ...
But it did .
For a couple of months after the shock of Feb. 27 , markets oscillated wildly , soaring on bits of apparent good news , then plunging again .
But by late spring , it was clear that the self - reinforcing cycle of complacency had given way to a self - reinforcing cycle of anxiety .
There was still one big unknown : had large market players , hedge funds in particular , taken on so much leverage — borrowing to buy risky assets — that the falling prices of those assets would set off a chain reaction of defaults and bankruptcies ?
Now , as we survey the financial wreckage of a global recession , we know the answer .
In retrospect , the complacency of investors on the eve of the crisis seems puzzling .
Why did n’t they see the risks ?
Well , things always seem clearer with the benefit of hindsight .
At the time , even pessimists were unsure of their ground .
For example , Paul Krugman concluded a column published on March 2 , 2007 , which described how a financial meltdown might happen , by hedging his bets , declaring that : “ I ’m not saying that things will actually play out this way .
But if we ’re going to have a crisis , here ’s how . ”

Rust and Smalltalk are perfectly complementary !
Rust has been selected as the Most Loved programming language at StackOverflow Developer Survey for five consecutive years !
No other language commands so much respect .
Rank 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 1 Rust Rust Rust Rust Rust 2 Swift Smalltalk Kotlin Python / TS TypeScript 3 F# TypeScript Python Kotlin Python 4 Scala Swift TypeScript WebAssembly Kotlin 5 Go Go Go Swift Go 6 Clojure Python Swift Clojure Julia 7 React Elixir JavaScript Elixir Dart 8 Haskell C# C# Go C# 9 Python Scala F#/ Clojure C# Swift 10 C# Clojure / JS Bash / Shell JavaScript JavaScript StackOverflow Developer Survey ’s Most Loved
And for good reasons .
Rust is greatly lauded for : memory safety guaranteed by the compiler ( type system ) and making garbage collection unnecessary
close - to - the - metal native code performance
efficient multi-core concurrency
zero -cost abstractions
These strengths are Smalltalk ’s weaknesses , but Smalltalk ’s strengths are also Rust ’s weaknesses : supremely simple object - oriented programming model ( suitable for children and beginners )
supremely scalable object - oriented programming model ( Alan Kay called Smalltalk a “ software internet ” )
flexibility of dynamic typing and late binding
super productivity and flexibility due to live coding ( up to 5X more productive ! )
portability of language virtual machine ( byte code like in JVM and CLR )
convenience of image - based computing ( persistable containerized environment )
( While multi- core concurrency is possible in Smalltalk , as demonstrated by the RoarVM , unfortunately this is an experimental project that has lain fallow for a decade . )
Both programming languages are very useful in their respective domains , but neither can be used universally for all applications .
The nice thing , however , is that these languages are perfectly complementary .
Between them , there is n’t anything you ca n’t do .
If you need critical , real - time performance , Rust is your ticket , although programming is considerably more complicated .
For just about everything else , Smalltalk is tickety - boo : web , desktop , mobile , data science , machine learning , Internet of Things , robotics , virtual reality , enterprise business computing , and so on .
And it ’s much easier , too .
It ’s worth noting that in 2017 , StackOverflow ’s survey voted Smalltalk as the second Most Loved language after Rust .
Why it disappeared from all subsequent surveys is anybody ’s guess .

Crypto-Nacl
Hi all , I wanted to let you know that I ported the Crypto - Nacl library from SmalltalkHub to GitHub here : https://github.com/objectguild/Crypto-Nacl
The original author is Tony Garnock - Jones , with contributions from Hernán Morales Durand .
See the README for more details .
Libsodium has evolved a lot over time , which means that there is plenty of additional functionality that can be unlocked through this library .
I do n’t have a need for it at the moment , but that might change in the near future .
My interest is in using the cryptographic features to enhance security of business applications .
Oh , and thanks to the Buenos Aires Smalltalk team ( https://github.com/ba-st/) for inspiration on using GitHub Actions with smalltalkCI Cheers , Jonathan van Alteren Founding Member | Object Guild B.V .

[ ann ] Indie Web
Hi all , Due to the confinement in the pandemic , our forms of telepresence become
more important and many suddenly got even more immersed into an
Oligopoly cyberspace ( Zoom , Google , Facebook , Twitter , Apple , Amazon ,
Microsoft , etc ) with opaque algorithms that under extractive logic
commodify our privacy and communications , try to condition our attention
and habits , as well as to shape our current and future behavior .
But
this is not the only way to inhabit cyberspace .
From the Grafoscopio community [ 1 ] , we would like to invite you to a
series of workshops that we are doing to make visible other ways of
populating and building the web , aligned with the movements of
IndieWeb [ 1a ] , from what we have called “ pocket infrastructures ” .
You can
find more information about these topics in [ 2 ] and in particular about
the workshops in [ 3 ] ( in Spanish ) . [ 1 ]

The second workshop will be tomorrow , Saturday , Aug. 29 from 3:15 PM to
7:15 PM CO ( GMT – 5 ) — I will try to share the other workshops earlier ,
but the site in [ 2 ] will be the consolidated memory of them , for those
who want to join us asynchronously .
We will see how IndieWeb sites help us to untangle and reweave that
other web and how this help us to reconnect in this stranger times .
Rethinking the infrastructure is also to rethink the ways in which it
enables and makes visible ( or not ) certain ways of being and acting .
Infrastructures are embodied discourses .
So thank you in advance for
joining us in rethinking this in practice .
Of course , Pharo is behind scenes , as usual , powering this experience .
But with these IndieWeb workshops I think we have found a sweet spot
that puts coding in front with a practical introduction and motivation
beyond the kind of boring “ Hello World ” .
Following a “ local first ”
approach , documentation will be in Spanish , but source code [ 5 ] and
interactive documentation will be in English to bridge our worlds :-) , [ 4 ]

Static SmalltalkHub
Hi all ,
Since May , SmalltalkHub is in read - only mode , allowing people to get back their data and move it to another forge if needed .
We had several unexpected downtimes with the deprecated version of Smalltalkub ( different software stack due to server migration ) .
To enhance the user experience , we put the static version of Smalltalkhub « SmalltalkHub archive » on - line as the official http://smalltalkhub.com service .
It was already announced that it will be done in November but we decided to do it earlier because it improves the current state : – faster and reliable downloads from smalltalkhub.com ( mcz files are no longer stored in a Mongo DB but served as static files ) – Smalltalkhub archive still allows to list projects , search for a project , see packages , contributors , commits – the deprecated version of smalltalkhub is still on - line until November at http://deprecated.smalltalkhub.com/.
So you have the best of the 2 versions .

Anatomy of a Programming Competition
Introduction
This is a case study of The James Robertson Memorial Programming Competition , which was created to promote the Smalltalk programming language .
This is a case study by example , showing what was done and how it was done .
Promotion and Marketing Advertising the competition at CBC. ca proved ineffective and costly .
The click - through rate was infinitestimally small .
Otherwise , we relied heavily on YouTube and social media .
YouTube Videos Several promo videos were created : using Powtoon using Animaker using Animaker Blogs and Social Media
The main social media sites used included Twitter , Facebook , LinkedIn , Medium , Hacker News , Instagram , and Quora .
Competition Websites
Two websites were created , one for advertising the competition and the other for operating the competition ( team registrations and team submissions ) .
The advertising website has been archived .
This website was based on WordPress.com .
The domain name , jrmpc.ca , was purchased from Google Domains .
The advertising website is also archived live at jrmpc.wordpress.com .
The operational website has also been archived .
In the home page , Internet Archive has a problem with the embedded YouTube link , but the unplayable video is the same as the first one shown above in the YouTube Videos section ( Mission : Impossible - themed ) .
The operational website was hosted at OVH ( VPS SSD 1 running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ) .
The web application was written in Pharo in conjunction with the Teapot framework .
The domain name , teams .
jrmpc.ca , was configured at Google Domains , and the PositiveSSL certificate was purchased from Namecheap .
Contacting Schools
High schools across Canada were contacted by email , as well as snail mail .
Attempts to contact various school boards were unproductive .
T - shirts and Swag Our budget only allowed for T - shirts ( from Big Mouth Promotions ) .
Here is the design ( for the front of the shirt ) : using GIMP and Inkscape examples from a team
The T - shirts were sent to all the participating teams ; they were a big hit with everyone .
About 100 shirts were made available for a public giveaway at the awards ceremony at Ryerson .
If budget allows , I think Smalltalk - styled coffee mugs would be a very nice giveaway .
Competition Software
The open source software for the JRMPC Organiser is now available , thanks to the great effort by Ben Coman who developed it .
JRMPC Organiser screenshot Awards Ceremony Trophies
The trophies for First , Second , and Third Prizes all came from Innovative Imprints in Pickering , Ontario .
Venue
The awards ceremony was scheduled for Saturday , April 18 , 2020 on the campus of Ryerson University .
However , due to COVID - 19 , a virtual ceremony was conducted instead .
Here was the result : Lessons Learned
Since this is the first edition of JRMPC , there were bound to be some teething pains .
We learned several important lessons : First , the website should ’ve been clearer about team composition , esp. the fact that a team must comprise four students .
No exceptions .
Second , the website should ’ve been bilingual so that Quebec would participate .
Third , better instructional materials should ’ve been provided to the teams .
Our existing tutorials and such were found wanting .
Some teams complained that Pharo was too difficult to learn .
Fourth , the competition software should ’ve been fully prepared , tested and debugged by the start of competition .
During the course of the competition , bugs were found and the competition maps revealed weaknesses .
Fifth , a larger team of volunteers should ’ve been assembled .
This competition entailed a great deal more work than I imagined .
Sixth , we were fortunate that we only had 30 registered teams .
In hindsight , we were n’t really set up to handle more .
In order to scale the competition properly , we ’d need more money , more volunteers , and we ’d need to limit the competition to 100 registered teams .
Also , only the first 30 teams would receive T - shirts .
Despite it all , we are pleased at the outcome .
Conclusion
The competition was a smashing success .
Thirty teams registered from across Canada .
Videos were created for each of the five rounds .
I ’ll just show the first and last of them here to avoid repetitiveness :
Hopefully , the information here can help you with your own programming competition .

Smalltalk ’s Successor
Alan Kay , one of the co-creators of Smalltalk , has said that he ’d like to see Smalltalk evolve beyond what it is today .
He believes that Smalltalk is stagnating and failing to advance the software industry .
While I agree with him in principle , I also take a more pragmatic position .
I believe that we cannot wait for this mythical new programming language and that we must use whatever we have available today because the software industry is in crisis .
The demand for more and better software created in a timely manner is continually increasing and it ’s causing considerable stress for programmers and users alike .
At the moment , there is only one programming language that has any hope of meeting this demand .
I do not posit this lightly nor frivolously .
Here are the key reasons why Smalltalk is perfectly suited to this mission …
Smalltalk has a great and storied history .
A programming language ideally should command respect , and there ’s no better way to do this than by demonstrating a wonderful record of achievements .
History matters .
Smalltalk pioneered the language virtual machine and JIT compilation .
It created the world ’s first modern IDE .
It introduced the MVC architectural pattern .
It pioneered TDD ( test - driven development ) and XP ( extreme programming ) .
It made live coding easily accessible .
It pioneered the development of object - oriented databases .
It created the world ’s first refactoring browser .
It was instrumental in developing GUI and WYSIWYG .
begin at 19:28
It influenced the design of Objective -C , Ruby , Java , PHP , Perl , Python , Groovy , Scala , Dart , and other languages .
It popularized object - oriented programming starting with the now - iconic cover of BYTE magazine .
August 1981 Smalltalk has a proven track record .
Smalltalk has been used in the enterprise for more than three decades .
In the 1990s , it achieved the second highest object - oriented market share in the world after C++. IBM even chose Smalltalk as the centrepiece of their VisualAge enterprise initiative .
Today , there are three major Smalltalk vendors with thousands of enterprise users around the globe : Cincom , Instantiations , and GemTalk Systems .
Many of these enterprise users are big names in the financial industry , manufacturing sector , shipping , utilities , etc. , for example , JP Morgan , Desjardins , UBS , Florida Power & Light , Texas Instruments , Telecom Argentina , Siemens , and COSCO .
Smalltalk is incredibly simple and easy to use .
It ’s even simpler and easier than Python !
The syntax is as simple as you can imagine .
It fits on a post card !
Smalltalk is extremely flexible and versatile .
Smalltalk has developed an extensive ecosystem .
In the web space , you have the Seaside and Teapot web frameworks , and Amber and PharoJS for front - end development .
In data science and machine learning , you have the PolyMath library , Roassal data visualization , and language bindings for TensorFlow and Keras .
For Internet of Things , you have the PharoThings platform .
For robotics , you have the PhaROS platform .
Smalltalk is great for virtual reality !
Smalltalk is the most productive programming language in the world .
A study by Namcook Analytics showed that Smalltalk was , on average , twice as productive as JavaScript , C++ , Go , Java , PHP , Python , and C#. Experienced Smalltalkers regularly develop software up to 5X faster than in conventional languages .
Smalltalk ’s remarkable live coding capability plays a critical role here .
Only two other significant languages support live coding : Forth and Lisp .
But Smalltalk makes its very easily accessible .
Smalltalk is infinitely scalable .
Thanks to its pure object - oriented model which views the Smalltalk environment as a sort of “ software internet , ” applications can grow in a manner resembling the Internet .
It has also been likened to biological systems of cells .
begin at 2:16
Any new programming language , no matter how superior to Smalltalk , would lack history , a track record , an ecosystem , a user base , and mindshare .
Marketing the language would face an uphill battle and growing the language ’s mindshare would take a considerable amount of time .
Meanwhile , we wait and we wait and we continue fighting a backlog of software that demands to be written .
Smalltalk Alternatives
There are newer languages that compete with Smalltalk , such as Dart , Go , Julia , Kotlin , Rust , Scala , Swift , TypeScript .
Some are very large and complex ( Kotlin , Rust , Scala , Swift , TypeScript ) .
Some are used in narrow domains ( Julia , Rust , Swift , TypeScript ) .
None are as simple and easy as Smalltalk .
None are as productive and scalable .
None support live coding .
None are as elegant .
So , really , the best choice we have today is Smalltalk .
It comes in various flavours to meet various needs : Instantiations ’ VA Smalltalk for enterprise markets
Cincom ’s VisualWorks for enterprise markets
GemTalk Systems ’ GemStone / S for high - volume , high - availability transaction processing
Pharo for open source requirements
Squeak for the education market
Is there really a need for a successor ?

Pharo and Repl.it
I tried repl.it with a simple script to download and run Pharo headless and also Pharo UI Works nicely - within the top right part of the browser window one can even see and use the Pharo window .
Clickable but X - Windows emulation does not seem to show the full window ( try clicking on " full screen mode " in the welcome window to adjust this ) .
Try this https://repl.it/@astares/Run-Pharo-9#main.sh
Just consider to create an own account on repl.it and use the following code in a main.sh :

What the hell is he doing in that ?!
No doubt you ’ve asked yourself this question before .
Maybe you were sitting in a movie theater watching the trailers when all of a sudden an actor whose talent you ’d admired or whose integrity had seemed so ironclad pops up in a crappy movie .
A movie so god-awful , in fact , that it not only tarnishes them but makes you feel dirty for once believing in them .
After all , you ’d invested something in this person , and now they ’re out there pimping their reputation to the highest bidder in movies they knew full well would suck .
If you look hard enough , you ’ll find one of these embarrassing money grabs on just about every serious actor ’s résumé .
Because for as long as there have been actors , there have been actors willing to cash in .
( And , yes , we know the money can be hard to resist .
Try . )
Around the Entertainment Weekly offices , we have a name for these kinds of mercenary performances : ” paycheck roles . ”
And since we ’ve been burned too many times to count , we feel it falls on us to police these offenses and hold the guilty parties accountable .
Hence , our list of the 25 Most Shameless Paycheck Roles of All Time .
If your name is on this list , please do n’t be cross .
We ’ve included you because we expect more from you .
We care .
And if this kind of caring is wrong , we do n’t want to be right .
25 . Sean Connery in Never Say Never Again
( 1983 ) After 1971 ’s Diamonds Are Forever , Connery said ” never again ” and traded his Walther PPK for more lucrative non-Bond paydays .
It rarely worked ( see : Zardoz ) .
Twelve years later , we saw a man publicly eating crow .
And it was n’t pretty .
The then - 53 - year - old Scot ’s physique was saggy , his thinning hair resembled the last sad wisps of cotton candy , and his macking on a young Kim Basinger was just plain creepy .
And then , freakin’ Octopussy made more money .
24 . Jason Alexander in Dunston Checks In
( 1996 ) The ” hiatus film ” is a long and noble TV tradition .
During rerun season , many small - screen stars cash in their chips for a big - screen quickie .
And we expect these movies to be terrible .
Still , nothing could have prepared us for Seinfeld ‘s George Costanza costarring with an ape .
And do n’t give me any of that ” Eastwood did an ape movie ” nonsense .
Watching this flaccid flick , you ca n’t help experience a little ” shrinkage . ”
23 . Bill Murray in Garfield
( 2004 ) Should there be an exemption for kids ’ movies ?
No , since there ’s actually such a thing as good kids ’ movies .
Murray put his late - career indie street cred on the line to voice the crudely animated , lasagna - eating feline opposite Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt .
You have to wonder just how big a check was needed to get Murray to sign off on weak one - liners like ” I think I ’m going to blow cat - chow chunks ! ”
22 . Marlon Brando in Superman
( 1978 ) Okay , this movie ’s actually respectable .
If only the same could be said of the Method meatball ’s motives for signing on as Superman ’s baby daddy , Jor-El .
Brando , who was never shy about his desire for big paydays in exchange for minimal work , shook down the producers for an eventual total of about $ 14 million for 13 days on the set .
That translates into roughly $ 1.2 million per minute of screen time .
21 . Matt Dillon in Herbie : Fully Loaded
( 2004 ) It was hard not to be moved by Dillon ’s Oscar nod for Crash .
After all , here was an actor who ’d never been taken seriously — a lunch - pail lunk we ’d all secretly been rooting for since The Outsiders — finally getting some respect .
But then , he made this Lindsay Lohan turkey .
It ’s more than a little humiliating watching our favorite greaser getting sprayed in the face with motor oil and losing a war of wits to a VW Bug .
20 . Cuba Gooding Jr. in Chill Factor
( 1999 ) Three years after his Jerry Maguire Oscar , Gooding was still asking folks to show him the money .
How else to explain this slice of tripe featuring a weapon of mass destruction and an ice cream truck ?
Look at that again : a weapon of mass destruction and an ice cream truck .
At one point , Gooding threatens Skeet Ulrich with ” I ’m about to get in your ass like last year ’s underwear ! ”
What does that even mean ?
19 . Elizabeth Taylor in The Flintstones
( 1994 ) Yes , she ’s a living legend … blah blah blah .
But despite her five Oscar noms , Taylor remains about as hopeless at picking out quality roles as she is at choosing husbands .
In fact , I ’m blaming Larry Fortensky for getting her mixed up with this one , where she plays Fred ’s mother - in - law , Pearl Slaghoople .
Taylor slums her way through a litany of groan - inducing puns ( she calls John Goodman ’s Fred a ” skunkasaurus ” ) .
18 . Ben Affleck in Paycheck
( 2003 ) This one ’s almost too easy .
I mean , it ’s right there in the title .
My guess is Affleck — who admits regretting ” the times I took movies just to work ” — never even made it past the script ’s cover page before signing on for this jackpot .
Coasting in smug lug - nut mode , Affleck plays a ” reverse engineer ” ( we know he ’s a brainiac because he wears glasses ) who wakes up with his memory wiped and goons on his tail .
To say that he phones in his performance is too generous .
It ’s more like he ’s using a couple of tin cans and some string .
17 . Buster Keaton in Beach Blanket Bingo
( 1965 ) During the silent era , Keaton was arguably a greater comedic talent than Charlie Chaplin .
But the introduction of sound made him obsolete .
By the LBJ years , this genius was reduced to taking any fluff film that would have him in exchange for a payday .
Take this Annette Funicello - Frankie Avalon hormone - apalooza , which features Keaton wearing his signature porkpie hat and deadpan expression .
Well , his expression is deadpan at least until a bombshell in a bikini crosses his path .
Then his eyes bug out like the world ’s oldest living horndog .
Ah - ooo - gah !
How depressing .
16 . Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich in Eragon
( 2006 ) This one ’s a twofer .
Maybe Irons is a closet nerd with a thing for fire - breathing flops .
After all , he also starred in 2000 ’s Dungeons & Dragons .
But what ’s Malkovich ’s excuse ?
Between the Sam Shepard plays and the artfully cocked beret he likes to wear while combing used - book stores on the Left Bank , we kind of assumed he was , well , too much of a snob for this stuff .
15 . Christopher Walken in Kangaroo Jack
( 2003 ) Sure , the guy works with directors like Spielberg and Tarantino , but he ’s also made so many clunkers , it ’s hard to pick the worst .
The Country Bears ?
Joe Dirt ?
Gigli ?
Tough call , but in the end we went with this Bruckheimer crap confection because he costars with a badly animated marsupial who wears shades and sings ” Rappers Delight . ”
This guy needs an intervention .
He may be the least selective actor alive .
14 . Richard Pryor in Superman III
( 1983 ) Pryor deservedly gets a lot of praise for his no -holds - barred stand - up comedy , but in the early ’ 80s he was like a heat - seeking missile of bad instincts .
No , we ’re not talking about the freebasing .
We ’re talking about movies like The Toy , Brewster ’s Millions , and this unfortunate chapter in the squeaky - clean Man of Steel saga , which renders the once proudly profane Pryor hamstrung and neutered .
13 . Faye Dunaway in Supergirl
( 1984 ) Peter O’Toole is lousy in this too , but at least he disappears for most of the film ( no doubt to head to the bank ) .
Dunaway , on the other hand , is trapped for the entire nightmare , hamming it up like Cruella De Vil on a laughing - gas jag .
Dunaway ( who , it should be noted , is also in Dunston Checks In ) plays a harpy fond of kimonos and world domination … and not nearly as fond of Helen Slater ’s Supergirl .
12 . William Hurt in Lost in Space
( 1998 ) Here ’s a guy who seems to get Oscar noms just for waking up in the morning looking lost .
Hurt must have taken a gander around Hollywood and seen his peers buying up Aston Martins and wondered , ” What the hell am I doing playing imprisoned transvestites in art films ?
I could be stinkin’ rich ! ”
Unfortunately , he winds up looking stiffer than the movie ’s robot .
I swear you can see the self - loathing creep across his face .
11 . Laurence Olivier in Clash of the Titans
( 1981 ) It had to suck to be Laurence Olivier .
Sure , you ’re one of the world ’s greatest actors .
But the catch - 22 is that you ca n’t just say ” Screw it , I ’m gonna cut loose , throw on a toga , and ham it up as Zeus . ”
Or can you ?
Olivier lets his Athenian freak flag fly as the original god father .
While Harry Hamlin undergoes the trials of Perseus , Olivier kicks back on Mount Olympus making googly eyes at Ursula Andress ’ Aphrodite .
10 . Demi Moore in Striptease
( 1996 ) In which Moore was paid a then - record $ 12.5 million to go topless .
Okay , she also did some ” acting ” in this dreadful flashdancer - with - a - heart - of - gold saga .
But nothing she should be proud of .
Not only does Striptease suck , it makes Showgirls look like Schindler ’s List .
And all that Annie Lennox music did n’t help .
Watching Moore writhe around on all fours , you do n’t just feel embarrassed for her , you experience a profound existential malaise .
9. Michael Caine in Jaws : The Revenge
( 1987 ) Caine has done so many paycheck roles , he ’s almost like Walken ’s cockney doppelgänger .
Still , we ’ll pick this fourth Jaws outing because , after all , ” this time it ’s personal . ”
Caine plays a bush pilot named Hoagie .
And he must be a ham - and - cheese hoagie because those are the two settings on his acting .
Ironically , this dud cost Caine more than he made :
When his name was called to accept his Oscar for Hannah and Her Sisters , he was shooting this great white mess .
8. Judi Dench in The Chronicles of Riddick
( 2004 ) Hey , Dames gotta pay the rent too .
Here , Dench ditches the Merchant Ivory frippery to go head - to - head with Vin Diesel in the bloated sequel to 2000 ’s Pitch Black .
Dench does double duty as Aereon , a shape - shifting soothsayer , as well as the narrator of the film ’s opening , where she expounds on Necromongers and the Underverse .
Judi , you had us at Necromongers .
7. Orson Welles in Transformers : The Movie
( 1986 ) Dig this voice cast : Judd Nelson , Casey Kasem , Eric Idle , Leonard Nimoy , and Scatman Crothers .
Crazy , right ?
But perhaps no one was as out of place here as the director of Citizen Kane , well into his Paul Masson - shilling decline .
Welles wields his gargantuan baritone as the voice of Unicron , a ravenous robot - planet that devours everything in its path .
Yes , his last role was a fat joke .
6. Peter O’Toole in Club Paradise
( 1986 ) Some actors see movie shoots as little more than paid vacations ( how else to explain Ocean ’s Twelve ? ) .
But even by those lax standards , O’Toole ’s appearance in this Robin Williams reggae romp is particularly painful to watch .
Lawrence of bloody Arabia himself lumbers through the flick like a sunburned ghoul .
The tagline to this stink bomb says it all : ” The vacation you ’ll never forget — no matter how hard you try . ”
5. Dennis Hopper in Super Mario Bros .
( 1993 ) When you appear in more than 30 movies in the ’90s alone , quality control is gonna get lost in the shuffle .
As a half - lizard villain named King Koopa , Hopper gets tarted up in snakeskin suits and has his hair pulled back into blond Flavor Flav cornrows .
In the single worst videogame - turned - movie ever made ( which is really saying something ) , Hopper does his worst overacting to date ( again , saying something ) .
4. Tony Curtis in The Bad News Bears Go to Japan
( 1978 ) Walter Matthau wisely wanted no part of this inept sequel ( neither , apparently , did Tanner or Lupus ) .
But Curtis was only too willing to check his pride at the door to play a sleazy promoter in what wound up being a smorgasbord of racial gags ( those crazy Asians and their endless bowing !
And get this , they eat raw fish … what savages ! ) .
It ’s amazing Japan remained an ally after this came out .
3. Sir Ben Kingsley in BloodRayne
( 2005 ) They say Gandhi used to get in bed with two naked women just to test his willpower .
We wonder if Kingsley ’s decision to star in Blood Rayne was a similar test .
Directed by hack extraordinaire Uwe Boll ( House of the Dead ) , this miasma of vampire hokum stars Sir Ben as Kagan , king of the vampires .
Between this and Thunderbirds , the Queen ’s gotta be kicking herself a bit about the whole knighthood thing .
2. Richard Burton in Exorcist II : The Heretic
( 1977 ) Looking like he just came off of the world ’s longest ( and sweatiest ) whiskey bender , Burton plays a Vatican investigator charged with reopening the Regan MacNeil case .
Burton ’s soldier of Christ battles a ridiculous demon named Pazuzu and is even forced to wear a snug safari outfit .
Wanna bet those stormy years with Liz Taylor — sorry , Pearl Slaghoople — were looking pretty sweet mid-shoot ?
The truth is out .
The " truthiness " is no longer in doubt .
There is a minimum of one confirmed concentration camp built on American soil in rural Wyoming .
Okay , many have heard the rumors , dismissed them as kook theories , believed by nobody , perpetuated by the ABB ( Anybody but Bush ) crowd or as a topic of interest for the Art Bell and Jeff Rense radio audience .
An undisclosed DHS ( Department of Homeland Security ) order was placed with DigitalGlobe to photograph the near completed work camp facility only listed by location as " central Wyoming " on the mistakenly published photographs .
DHS accidentally placed these photos on a publicly accessible portion of their website on March 28th and they were pulled within one hour .
Fortunately Google had cached the images .
They too though have been removed in the past 48 hours .
The images are not gone forever though .
I am employed by a large Minnesota based construction company doing sub- contracting work for KBR and due to the sensitive nature of these images I wish to remain anonymous .
However these images must get out .
Someone must be the whistleblower , someone must warn the American public what the Bush Administration has in store for dissidents , political opponents , civil libertarians and " fifth columnists " as defined by the Justice Department .
There has been plenty written about this topic and plenty of historical evidence to back up this is a clear and present danger .
2006 Press Releases ( Official KBR Press Release )

Concentration Camps Being Built on US Soil ?
Published by the Daily Kos
Daily Kos Diary Entry
Atty .
Gen. John Ashcroft 's announced desire for camps for U.S. citizens he deems to be " enemy combatants " has moved him from merely being a political embarrassment to being a constitutional menace .
Ashcroft 's plan , disclosed last week but little publicized , would allow him to order the indefinite incarceration of U.S. citizens and summarily strip them of their constitutional rights and access to the courts by declaring them enemy combatants .

Property is hot in virtual world
The 23 - year - old gamer known as Deathifier made the money back in under a year .
The virtual Treasure Island he bought existed within the online role - playing game Project Entropia .
He made money by selling land to build virtual homes as well as taxing other gamers to hunt or mine on the island .
Project Entropia offers gamers the chance to buy and sell virtual items using real cash , a trend which is gaining popularity as the boundaries between the virtual and real worlds continue to blur .
Property boom
There are fortunes to be made in the burgeoning world of MMORPGs ( massive multiplayer online role playing gaming ) .
The views in the virtual world are pretty good
" We 've really only just begun with the estate sales and land management , there is still more room for growth and revenue with the untapped resources surrounding the land . "
Last month , another of Entropia 's virtual properties - a virtual space station - sold at auction for £ 57,000 .
Bridging gap
While the real housing market may be somewhat static , the one in the virtual world is booming , said the space station auction winner , gamer Jon Jacobs , AKA Neverdie .
He said the virtual real estate market was " on fire " as gamers increasingly realised that virtual worlds could start to compete with real worlds at an economic level .
Neverdie plans to use his space station to establish an in - game " night club " through which the entertainment industry can sell music and videos to gamers .
The Entropia economy works by allowing gamers to exchange real currency for PED ( Project Entropia Dollars ) and back again into real money .
Ten PEDs are the equivalent to one US dollar and gamers can earn cash by accumulating PEDs via the acquisition of goods , buildings and land .
Project Entropia was launched in 2003 and now has 300,000 registered accounts .
LONDON
NO sooner had her words been reported in the British newspapers than she frantically took them back , saying that she had been misunderstood and misquoted .
But the question remains : was Gwyneth Paltrow on to something when she noted ( or did n’t ) that “ the British are much more intelligent and civilized than the Americans , ” and that “ people here do n’t talk about work and money ; they talk about interesting things at dinner ” ?
Whether Britons are objectively cleverer and more amusing than Americans , or whether they just sound that way , is one of the deep mysteries of British life for expatriates like Ms. Paltrow , who lives in London with her husband , the British rock star Chris Martin , and their children , Apple and Moses .
Britons seem to have the advantage of accent : their exotic pronunciation can make even dubious observation sound like unimpeachable truth .
They are also experts at the art of speaking coherently and with authority on topics they know little or nothing about .
“ Every Englishman can talk for 15 minutes on any subject without a note , ” Norman Mailer has been quoted as saying .
This somehow makes them seem more persuasive .
When Tony Blair put the case for the Iraq war to Congress in 2003 , his elegant fluency made him appear not only more articulate and intelligent , but also more credible , than President Bush .
If silky - tongued Mr. Blair supports the war , some Americans felt at the time , then there must be something to it .
Silverbrook Research has developed the Memjet , a nanotech - fueled , consumer inkjet printer that can print sixty pages a minute for under $ 200 .
And it works .
An Australian entrepreneur betting his company on a nanotech - fueled , consumer inkjet printer that can print sixty pages a minute for under $ 200 has successfully demonstrated the technology .
Silverbrook Research has spent the last ten years developing Memjet , a printer that uses an array of ink jet nozzles that spans the width of the paper .
Company executives have said they feel that they can ship an 8x10 color inkjet by the end of 2008 that will cost less than $ 200 and print 60 pages a minute .
Whether or not the company will be able to deliver on its promises is the question that plagues any startup .
But one leading printer analyst said he 's witnessed the demonstration personally , and that he 's been briefed on the company 's plans to manufacture components and license the technology to interested parties .
" I 've seen it with my own eyes , " said Charlie LeCompte , president of Lyra Research , which tracks the printer market .
" They 've been showing several models since January .
I 've seen the photo printer running ; I have n't seen the letter printer running , but other people - at Lyra - have . "
" I 've been following this industry for 20 years , and I 've never seen anything of this scale : 10 times faster , 20 times cheaper , all at once , " LeCompte added .
Silverbrook plans to offer the Memjet technology as part of several products : a photo printer , which the company hopes to sell for less than $ 150 ; the 8x10 color inkjet , due to arrive at the end of 2008 for under $ 200 ; a label printer ; and a large - format photo printer , expected to cost about $ 5,000 , and capable of printing poster - sized prints " twenty times faster than anything I 've ever seen , " LeCompte said .
" Conventional wisdom is that you cannot have high speed , quality color and low cost all at once , " said Bill McGlynn , chief executive of Memjet 's home and office business , in a statement .
" This technology turns that notion on its head , making page - wide color printing practical and cost - effective .
We believe this breakthrough technology will change the printing industry by eliminating the cost and performance barriers of color , and by allowing both incumbents and non-incumbents to compete on a new playing field . "
Silverbrook executives could not be reached by post time , although a spokeswoman for the company said that they were in Prague for an international inkjet conference .
The maximum resolution achievable is 1600x1600 , according to Silverbrook .
Photo - quality printing on the 8x10 printer can be achieved at 30 pages per minute ; standard office - quality color prints are printed at 60 pages per minute , and draft mode prints 90 pages per minute .
Typical inkjet printers , known as " serial printers , " use an inkjet nozzle that passes back and forth along a horizontal axis , spraying ink along the surface of the paper .
The Memjet technology uses a series of individual MEMS - based inkjet nozzles , fabricated using conventional semiconductor manufacturing techniques .
Each chip measures 20 millimeters across and contains 6,400 nozzles , with five color channels , the company said .
A separate driver chip calculates 900 million picoliter - sized drops per second .
For a standard A4 letter printer , the result is a total of 70,400 nozzles .
Silverbrook has already signed deals with third - party manufacturers to actually manufacture the components , using the company 's intellectual property , a key requirement if the company is going to be able to scale up production to compete with the millions of printers HP , Epson , and others sell each year .
TSMC will make the print heads , LeCompte said .
Right now , Silverbrook itself is manufacturing the machine that butts , or assembles , the print heads next to one another , although LeCompte reported that Silverbrook management did n't believe that to be a problem .
The ink that the Memjet printers are currently using is dye - based , similar to that used by the rest of the industry .
Silverbrook executives believe that they can design a printer that holds five times as much ink – 50 ml – as a conventional print cartridge , and sell for about $ 20 or less .
How the company will solve clogging problems – the bane of inkjet printers – has n't been fully disclosed , LeCompte said .
According to LeCompte , the technology could be licensed to a struggling competitor in the inkjet arena , allowing it to take on companies like Hewlett - Packard through established sales channels .
Silverbrook itself has filed 1,500 patents , with 2,000 more pending .
" The first thing HP will do is look at all their patents , " LeCompte said .
" With 1,500 patents and 2,000 pending , they 're going to be praying that they 're going to find some overlap .
And there probably will be areas in which they overlap one another .
So there probably will be some sort of cross - license … with some wheeling and dealing going on . "
Silverbrook Research is owned by Kai Silverbrook , who runs a secretive research facility in Australia .
About 300 employees are focused on this one product alone .
Like Bill Gates and other technology entrepreneurs , Silverbrook is supposedly self - taught , and never finished college .
" [ Silverbrook ] has been focusing on this thing for ten years , " LeCompte said .
" My gut says this is going to work . "

In a major victory for the State Department and career military lawyers , the Pentagon Wednesday released a new Army field manual that requires all detainees held by the U.S. military , including suspected terrorists , to be treated according to the Geneva Conventions .
At the same time , President George W. Bush announced that 14 so - called " high - value detainees "  those who have been held by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) in secret locations around the world where they been subject to interrogation techniques that human rights groups have denounced as " torture "  are being transferred to the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , for eventual trial .
Among them are Khalid Sheik Mohammed , who is believed to be the highest - ranking member of al - Qaeda captured by the U.S. and the mastermind behind the 9/11 terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon , as well as several other key senior al - Qaeda operatives , Bush said .
He insisted , however , that they and other accused terrorists should not be entitled to full due - process rights when they are brought to trial .
Under legislation proposed by the administration , hearsay testimony and evidence obtained as a result of coercive interrogations would be admissible in such tribunals .
It would also bar defendants from reviewing evidence that could , in the government ’s opinion , compromise Washington ’s national security .
In his remarks , Bush also defended the use of what he called " tough " but " safe " interrogation techniques of the kind used by the CIA in its so - called " black sites , " and called on Congress to explicitly approve their use by the CIA in the future .
" [ A ]s more high - ranking terrorists are captured , the need to obtain intelligence from them will remain critical  and having a CIA program for questioning terrorists will continue to be crucial to getting life - saving information , " he said .
And he called on Congress to amend the U.S. War Crimes Act , which criminalizes violations of the Geneva Conventions , to ensure that no U.S. personnel " involved in capturing and questioning terrorists could now be at risk of prosecution " under its provisions .
The Pentagon ’s new manual and Bush ’s speech , the third in a series of major addresses designed to rally support for his administration ’s performance in the " global war on terror " in the run-up to the fifth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , received a mixed reaction from human rights groups .
" By announcing adherence to Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions for all detainees , the Pentagon has reaffirmed important protections found in international law , " said Larry Cox , executive director of the U.S. section of Amnesty International .
At the same time , Cox complained that the proposed legislation on military tribunals would deny " fundamental fair - trial protections " to defendants .
He also called on Bush to " rescind any directive that gives the CIA ‘ extraordinary powers ’ to continue to detain people secretly outside the law . "
" The president sent a mixed message , " said Elisa Massimino , Washington director of Human Rights First , a national lawyers ’ group " On the one hand , he announced a new army field manual which contains interrogation techniques which , with a few exceptions , comply with U.S. law and the Geneva conventions . "
" On the other hand , while declaring a commitment to a law - based approach , the president defended the system of secret CIA detentions and an ‘ alternative set of [ interrogation ] procedures ’ that invite cruel , inhuman , and degrading treatment of suspects  treatment that amounts to a clear violation of U.S. and international law , " she added .
Bush ’s remarks and the release of the new army manual came two months after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the administration ’s 2002 directive , which was prepared by political appointees in the Justice Department and Pentagon over the objections of senior career military lawyers and the State Department , that suspected terrorists  or " unlawful enemy combatants "  were not entitled to the protections provided under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions .
Article 3 provides that all detainees are legally entitled to humane treatment " in all circumstances " and may not be subject to " cruel treatment and torture " or " outrages upon personal dignity , in particular , humiliating and degrading treatment . "
Two weeks after the court ’s decision , Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England issued a memorandum that called for " all DoD [ Department of Defense ] personnel [ to ] adhere to [ Article 3 ] standards . "
In fact , the administration has always insisted that all detainees have been treated " humanely " despite a flood of reports by human rights groups , the Federal Bureau of Investigation , former detainees , and detainee attorneys about practices ranging from sexual humiliation and exposure to extreme temperatures to physical assaults and " water - boarding "  a technique used by the CIA , in particular , in which the subject is made to believe that he is drowning .
Because of the way the administration had defined " humane " treatment to include such practices , England ’s memo , while broadly welcomed by the human rights community as an important step to comply with the Supreme Court ’s judgment , also provoked skepticism from some analysts that it would make any real difference .
That skepticism was fueled as well by statements from senior administration lawyers who insisted in testimony before Congress on the same day of the memo ’s release that it was not meant to signal a change in policy .
Indeed , the fact that Bush explicitly repeated his administration ’s insistence that the U.S. " does not torture "  like his demand that Congress amend the War Crimes
Act to exempt U.S. personnel  is likely to provoke continued skepticism about the administration ’s intent , although the manual ’s explicit bans on specific techniques , at least by the military , offered some reassurance .
Indeed , those bans  which were strongly opposed by political appointees at the Pentagon , Vice President Dick Cheney ’s office , and the Justice Department  marked a major victory for the State Department and career military officers and lawyers .
The conflict had delayed publication of the new manual by one year .
The same court decision that upheld Article 3 also found that the military tribunals established by the Pentagon to try suspected terrorists held at Guantanamo violated the Constitution because they were not approved by Congress .
The administration ’s response  reiterated by Bush today  has been to urge Congress to pass legislation that would more or less rubber - stamp the Pentagon ’s original plans .
Several Republican senators on the Armed Services Committee  notably its chairman , John Warner ; John McCain , and Lindsay Graham  have argued , however , that those plans , particularly the rules of evidence , would violate defendants ’ due - process rights and thus should be amended to conform more with procedures used in U.S. courts - martial .
Their position has been backed by most Democrats and by top career military attorneys , past and present .
" The bottom line to today ’s announcements , " said Scott Horton , an international law professor at Columbia University in New York , " is that the administration is giving up on some of the most controversial targets in its detainee treatment program , such as the use of highly coercive interrogation tactics by the military , but wants to keep its military commissions despite the fact that the Supreme Court essentially called them ‘ kangaroo courts . ’ "
Horton also noted that the administration ’s call for amending the War Crimes
Act in ways that would effectively exempt U.S. personnel engaged in the " war on terror " appeared primarily designed to protect senior policymakers , particularly those political appointees who were responsible for authorizing abusive treatment and interrogation techniques , from possible prosecution .

Douglas Adams : The First and Last Tapes .
Part 2 of 3 .
By Ian Shircore
Read Part 1 | Read Part 3
By the summer of 1979 , the first radio series of The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy had been broadcast twice on BBC Radio 4 and this extraordinary mixture of science fiction , comedy and intriguingly speculative ideas was slowly becoming a cult hit .
The proof that it was a genuine cult was the fact that its author , Douglas Adams , was hard up , needing work and fairly happy to grab the lifeline of a script editor 's job working on Dr Who .
The proof that it was a hit had n't quite arrived yet .
Indeed , when freelance journalist Ian Shircore lined up this interview with Adams and tried to get the press interested , the only taker he could find was Penthouse magazine , which eventually printed a few paragraphs and a couple of quotes .
Since then , the cassettes of this leisurely three - hour interview have been lost in the back of a cupboard .
When the lost tapes resurfaced a few weeks ago , these unpublished insights from one of the 20th century 's top SF writers seemed ideal for the launch of Darker Matter .
The interview material is being published in three parts , with the emphasis in this second section on Douglas 's crusade against patronizing comedy conventions , his disillusionment with Dr Who and the multimedia vision that put him 20 years ahead of his time .
By his own account , Douglas Adams started young in comedy .
He claimed it began in the maternity hospital in Cambridge , where he brought unexpected joy into the lives of the nursing staff .
' Apparently I was a very strange - shaped baby .
The nurse carried me down the ward with a towel wrapped round my loins saying " Look , Gandhi " – and the rest of the world has just taken its cue from that ever since . '
But the path from innate talent to wealth , fame and universal acclaim was not entirely straightforward .
At the time of this early interview , the Hitchhiker 's phenomenon was only just beginning to show signs of gathering momentum .
Douglas was starting to reap the rewards of success , albeit on a modest scale – lashing out to buy a £ 33,000 apartment in North London , with the help of a £ 20,000 mortgage , and indulging his dreams of life in the fast lane with the purchase of a modestly sporty MGB tourer .
He still needed an income , though , and working as Dr Who 's script editor , in a BBC office at White City , had turned out to be more of a compromise than he had hoped .
He 'd been a fan of the good Doctor since he was 11 and had been keen to make his mark on the show , both by writing ( he 'd written four episodes ) and through his script editing work .
In the event , his time spent with Dr Who had left him disillusioned .
' I was told : " We want you , Douglas , because of the specific things you 'll be able to bring to the programme , " which I have been systematically not been allowed to do .
' This season of Dr Who will look just like any other season – and I feel very disappointed about that . '
' It 's too big a thing for any one person to change .
It 's like a big raft in the middle of a lake , and you 're trying to move it by swimming .
This season of Dr Who will look just like any other season – and I feel very disappointed about that .'
But if he was n't able to bend Dr Who to his will , Douglas was about to taste the kind of success in his own right that usually only happens in dreams .
Within a few months , the first book , the long - playing record and the second radio series were to turn Hitchhiker 's into a mainstream hit and make him a household name .
Even more importantly , this success would prove he was right to follow his own beliefs , rather than trying to work within accepted broadcasting formats and supposedly commercial formulae .
' People always make this totally artificial distinction between what is commercial and what is good .
They quote that maxim " Nobody ever lost money underestimating the public 's taste " and I think that 's very wrongheaded .
I like to believe the audience is actually intelligent , because it 's made up of other people like yourself .
' People do n't like to have their intelligence insulted .
If you do something with sufficient enthusiasm and put enough into it , people are bound to respond , unless your judgement is totally cock - eyed . '
After a lot of disappointments and false starts , Douglas had finally found his voice and his destiny when he stopped trying to follow other people 's guidelines and started writing what he himself would have been surprised and delighted to find coming out of his radio .
' I thought " What would I really like to hear ?
What would excite me ?
Well , let 's write it , because nobody else is doing anything that excites me , apart from the Pythons . "
' If The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy makes money , I shall enjoy that .
But what I 'll enjoy most is having proved that you do n't have to underestimate people .
I do n't like the notion that you set yourself up as saying " This is what people like , therefore this is what we 'll do . "
That 's patronizing .
' I just want to kill the idea that you have to be bland to appeal to your market . '
' I just want to kill the idea that you have to be bland to appeal to your market , though I know a lot of the BBC old guard still regard Hitchhiker 's as a momentary aberration , a fluke , and not really what radio comedy ought to be about .
' People kept saying to me when I was writing , " This is terribly esoteric .
You 'll only get half a dozen people listening to it .
Shove in a few jokes . " '
Douglas claimed there were actually very few jokes in Hitchhiker 's , in terms of conventional gags and one - liners .
But trying to write something that made up its own rules as it went along was always going to be unnerving .
' In the very first episode , while I was writing it , I kept thinking " There ought to be a joke in here , because I 've gone three pages without a joke . "
I knew I was trying to do something different , but you keep on looking for the odd thing you recognise . '
Douglas explained the problem with conventional ' jokes ' with an example from a scene in the first episode of the radio series , where Arthur Dent comes out with an obvious , punning gag line ( Ford : ' How do you feel ? '
Arthur : ' Like a military academy – bits of me keep passing out . ' ) .
That won an immediate laugh from the cast and crew on the first take , but enthusiasm waned after the first few hearings .
Click to hear a short segment of this interview .
There was a far better joke elsewhere in the scene , and that took time to grow on people ( Arthur : ' Where are we ? '
Ford : ' We 're safe . '
Arthur : ' Oh good . '
Ford : ' We 're in a small galley cabin in one of the spacecraft of a Vogon constructor fleet . '
Arthur : ' Ah .
This is obviously some strange meaning of the word " safe " that I was n't previously aware of . ')
This is perfect Douglas Adams humour , rooted in language , character and the sheer control of tone and pacing that makes Hitchhiker 's a genuine classic of modern literature .
At the time of this interview , Douglas had been juggling the day job with writing the first book , editing the first four 30 - minute radio episodes to squeeze them onto four 22 - minute sides of double LP record , developing ideas for the second radio series and trying to think about the TV version .
' It 's been a terrible tussle .
All these different media demand the story goes in different directions – and this is getting me into all sorts of problems .
When the second series is finished and in the can and I get down to the second book , the plot may actually diverge quite widely from one medium to another .
At the moment , the radio show generates the material and then I sit down and try to write a book and make sense of the material . '
As Douglas Adams peered ahead in 1979 into the multimedia future he correctly foresaw for his work , he was probably the first major artist to take a full - on multi-channel approach .
And he already had an acute sense of the different dynamics of these different media .
' We 're doing the telly next year , but I have n't got very far with that yet .
We 'll start serious thinking about how we 're going to do it at the end of this year .
It 's very important that it looks as extraordinary as it sounded , and it must n't look like Dr Who or Blake 's Seven .
All I have is a very vague visual sense about it , in the way that I started out with a vague audio sense about how Hitchhiker 's should be .
We 've got to work that through .
' And I think a film will have to be totally different again .
Moving from radio to television , you can take most of the words with you .
When you move on to the big screen , you have to start leaving some of the words behind and filling the gap visually , because film is primarily a visual medium .
It becomes a different thing .
I was n't certain that could be done until I saw the stage show .
' That was very different .
It was fairly ramshackle , because it was put together on no budget at all , very , very fast .
It was done by Ken Campbell who is totally wonderful .
He 's not interested in doing anything that 's possible to do – the possible does n't interest him .
The show was 90 minutes long and based on three hours of material , so a lot of the words went , but it still worked .
It was a totally different thing from the radio , but it worked very well .
So it made me think " We can do this on film . " '
In fact , of course , the film version saw many false dawns before finally reaching the screen in 2005 , four years after Douglas 's untimely death .
But his original vision of radio , books , records , TV and film , all built round carefully adapted and redeveloped versions of the Hitchhiker 's saga , has largely come to pass .
The opera and ballet versions are surely on their way , sooner or later .
For Douglas , the infinite possibilities and the practical difficulties of getting material written and meeting deadlines sat uncomfortably alongside each other .
' Occasionally , I get a glimpse and think " This can go on for ever . "
And then I get bogged down on the very next sentence . '
' Occasionally , I get a glimpse and think " This can go on for ever – it'll be terrific . "
And then I get bogged down on the very next sentence .
' Tennessee Williams would get up in the morning and sit by his pool all day , armed with two bottles of Old Granddad , marinating in the sun until 11 pm , when he 'd suddenly write furiously for 25 minutes .
He said his whole life was dedicated to doing anything he could to get rid of those 12 hours a day when he did n't do anything at all .
I understand that .
I find the business of getting up in the morning and going to the typewriter absolutely awful .
' And when the idea comes , I often can't remember where it came from .
I remember very little about writing the first series of Hitchhiker's .
It 's almost as if someone else wrote it . '
Douglas 's favourite Hitchhiker 's bits , why Paul Simon was an inspiration and how to flummox an astrophysicist .

Some of us who sincerely treasure the scientific fact and scientific theory of evolution have brought on some of our own problems with our choice of nomenclature .
For instance , sometimes “ random mutations ” gets uncoupled from natural selection , leading some to believe that it is the randomness of the process that is the be-all and end - all of evolution .
Consider also Francis Crick ’s description of the associations of amino acids with their three base codons as a “ frozen accident . ”
Creationists , ignoring these ( legitimate ) scientific and scientific / poetic usages , have jumped all over the terms such as “ random ” and “ accident ” to characterize scientific evolutionary theory in the following warped way : “ All life forms just suddenly spring into existence as accidents . ”
Though I am aware that sophisticated creationists would embellish this attack , this characterization is certainly the straw man put forth by most of the people out there who tremble at the thought that human beings are ( gad ! ) animals .
It recently occurred to me that , perhaps , creationists ’ willingness to assume that evolutionists are claiming that complex life forms “ just happen ” might be another symptom of “ innumeracy . ”
It might be that they do n’t understand how incredibly rare it is that biological “ accidents ” survive and reproduce .
In his bestseller , Innumeracy : Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences ( 1988 ) , John Paulos introduced the term “ innumeracy ” to refer to “ an inability to deal comfortably with the fundamental notions of number and chance . ”
Paulos bemoaned that innumeracy “ plagues far too many otherwise knowledgeable citizens . ”
How is Innumeracy related to Creationism ?
It seems to me that creationists believe that evolutionary theory holds that after a relatively few accidents , complex life forms spring into existence .
This just could n’t be , creationists argue .
That characterization does n’t work for me either .
That is why I have termed it a straw man argument .
Perhaps skeptical creationists ( they are selectively skeptical ) would even refer to an illustration used by Daniel Dennett in his 1995 work , Darwin ’s Dangerous Idea .
Dennett stated that “ the DNA in your body , unsnarled and linked would stretched to the sun and back several - 10 or 100 - times . ”
A work of such immense complexity just could n’t spring into existence by any simple accident , right ?
But what if creationists better understood the enormous number of mutations that amounted to nothing compared to those that amounted to something ?
What if they understood that we ’re not talking about mere accidents .
We ’re talking about unimaginably unlikely accidents that are equally rare and precious .
This idea reminded me of another illustration used by Daniel Dennett , also presented in Darwin ’s Dangerous Idea .
Borrowing from a short story by Jorge Luis Borges , Dennett ( on page 108 ) asks us to imagine a huge library full of all possible 500 - page long books , each page with 2000 characters .
Each space on each page is either blank or has a character , each character being one of 100 standard upper and lowercase English / European characters .
Dennett does the finite math for us , calculating that such a library would contain 1001,000,000 books .
In comparison , there are only 10040 particles in the observable universe .
Therefore , Dennett ’s “ Library of Babel “ is not remotely a physically possible object . ”
He asked us to keep in mind that this is not a library of all possible books , since his library will not contain Greek , Russian , Chinese , Japanese or Arabic , characters , to name a few .
Dennett uses this Library of Babel illustration as “ an anchoring vision for helping to answer very difficult questions about the scope of biological possibility . ”
Consider , now , the “ library of Mendel ” which is composed of descriptions of genomes is “ just a proper part of the Library of Babel . ”
Each of the 500 - page permutations of the four letters ( the nucleotides that composed the letters of the DNA alphabet ) are already in the Library of Babel .
Dennett warns that genomes are much longer than ordinary books , however .
Dennett writes that the information of the human genome would take up approximately 3000 of the 500 - page volumes of Dennett ’s library .
How big is Dennett ’s Library of Babel ?
Dennett warns that all of our metaphors for bigness ( e.g. , a drop in the ocean ) fall comically short .
Not even an actual astronomical quantity ( such as the number of elementary particles in the universe ) “ is even visible against the backdrop of these huge but finite numbers . ”
Somewhere in this vast library you can find a perfect copy of Moby Dick ( and lots of imperfect copies — most of those so imperfect as to be unreadable ) .
As Dennett plainly points out , though , most of books in this Library would consist of complete “ typographical gibberish .
“ No rules of spelling or grammar , to say nothing of sense , prohibit the inclusion of a volume . ”
When you compare the universe of meaningful books to the size of Dennett ’s library you can see that almost everything out there is gibberish .
Almost everything in Dennett ’s library is a non-useful accident .
The useful accidents are almost impossible to find .
Similarly , most possible DNA sequences , the vast majority actually , “ are surely gibberish , recipes for nothing living at all .
That is what Dawkins means , of course , when he says that there are “ many more ways of being dead ( or not alive ) than ways of being alive . ”
Therefore , it is really ( really ) unlikely that nature will put together new biological accidents that live and reproduce .
I suspect that creationists assume that evolutionists claim that biological accidents resulting in new life forms are about as likely as automobile accidents ; that they happen regularly .
This makes no sense to them .
If I understood evolution in this way , it would n’t make any sense to me either .
Dennett ’s Library of Babel helps to dispel this statistical misconception .
Not all accidents are the same .
Some are extremely unlikely .
So unlikely that you should write them off as “ simply not going to happen . ”
Unless you have 4.5 billion years to work with and quadrillions of little accident generators ( microorganisms and , eventually , organisms ) working overtime .
But guess what ?
We do have 4.5 billion years and a planet full of accidents waiting to happen .
Then again , I suppose that creationists , if they understood the numbers better , would argue that it proves that the creation of new life forms is so utterly improbable that “ God ” must ’ve done it .
This is but another version of the design argument .
Innumeracy is part of this common misunderstanding too .
This problem is also caused , I suspect , by the fact that most creationists do n’t recognize the incremental non-totally random nature of the very rare successful mutation “ accidents ” that do occur .
You do n’t start from ground zero and then shoot up a sheer cliff into a fully formed complex life form .
A good place for exploring that incremental changes drive evolution is Richard Dawkins ’ Climbing Mount Improbable .
Little Rock , Arkansas –
The inflated costs of the new gaming consoles have forced many parents to extreme measures to get their children the latest offerings from Nintendo and Sony .
Some reports have people paying over $ 3000 for a PlayStation 3 .
Other reports show people camping out for days to be the first to get a Wii .
However , they pale in comparison to the tragic story of Marge and Frank Young .
The Youngs had eleven - year - old twins , a son Jim and a daughter , Della .
Jim wanted a PlayStation 3 and Della wanted a Wii .
The parents , because of layoffs at the chicken plant , were too poor to afford either .
However , they did n't want to disappoint their kids .
Frank , who loved his son more than anything , decided to sell his daughter into the Asian sex trade to raise money to buy a PlayStation 3 .
Unknown to him , at the same time his wife , Marge , was selling their son to hustlers in Los Angeles to get money to buy a Wii for their daughter .
After returning home from their prospective sales with smiles on their faces and the latest consoles under their arms , the parents realized their tragic mistake .
They had a Wii and a Playstation 3 , but no children to play with them .
" I had mixed feelings , " said Mr. Young .
" I was touched that my wife was willing to sell our son to get a Wii for our daughter , but I was pissed off that I had a PS3 and no son to play it with .
After a few hours playing Twilight Princess on the Wii , I perked right up though , " said Mr. Young .

Now , some perverted Thai businessman will get to see the look on her face on Christmas morning instead of me . "
Two weeks later they were forced to sell their consoles to make bail on charges that they sold their kids .
" No kids and no consoles .
It 's a tragedy all around , " said Mr. Young .

It had to happen .
Someone is now selling Nothing , and undoubtedly , some suckers are buying it .
It 's a piece of packaging with a clear plastic sphere sticking out of it that contains absolutely nothing .
Well , there 's something in there , but it 's just the same as what 's outside it : thin air .
And get this :
It costs $ 6.28 .
It 's Nothing for something !

Heck , if Seinfeld makes billions of dollars on an entire TV series about nothing , certainly some enterprising entrepreneur can swipe a few thousand from those who want to send a message to their " loved ones . "
But if there 's actually something in there , then this is not nothing , it 's something .
So besides being a poor value , it 's mislabeled .
Might be worth $ 2 worth of laughs , but not $ 6.28 .
Is this that " nothingness " Camus and Hemingway wrote about ?

It took a jury ten days of deliberations to find I. Lewis ( Scooter ) Libby , Jr. , the former chief of staff for Vice - President Dick Cheney , guilty of perjury , obstruction of justice , and making false statements to federal investigators .
On one level , it ’s hard to say why it took so long , because the evidence against Libby was both straightforward and overwhelming .
The central issue in the case was how Libby learned that Valerie Plame Wilson , the wife of the diplomat turned Bush critic Joseph C. Wilson IV , worked for the C.I.A .
Libby testified repeatedly that he had first been informed of her status in a telephone conversation with Tim Russert , the NBC newsman .
But Patrick Fitzgerald , the special prosecutor , called five witnesses , all of them former executive - branch colleagues of Libby ’s , who said that they had each separately discussed Valerie Wilson ’s employment with the defendant .
In the capstone to the government ’s case , Russert testified that he did not tell Libby that Wilson worked at the C.I.A. , because , at the time of their phone call , he did not know it .
It ’s one thing to claim a faulty memory , as Libby did , through his lawyers , at the trial .
It ’s quite another to concoct an imaginary conversation , as the jury ultimately decided that Libby had done .
But , if the evidence was so strong , why did the jury find the case so difficult ?
TOM BACHTELL
The investigation arose , of course , after the C.I.A. sent Joe Wilson , a former Ambassador to Gabon , on a mission to Niger , in 2002 .
He went to look into reports that Saddam Hussein had tried to purchase uranium yellowcake , which is used in the production of nuclear weapons , in that country .
Wilson found no such attempt by any Iraqis , and said nothing publicly about his trip for more than a year .
But after he heard President Bush touting the nonexistent African connection as a justification for the invasion of Iraq , including in a now notorious passage in his State of the Union address , Wilson started speaking out , first to journalists and then , on July 6 , 2003 , in an Op - Ed piece in the Times .
In prose that could have come from a middling spy thriller —
“ Through the haze , I could see camel caravans crossing the Niger River ” — Wilson recounted his journey and raised the question of whether the war was based on , as he delicately put it , “ the selective use of intelligence . ”
Wilson had no more attentive reader than the Vice - President , who carefully underlined his copy of the Op - Ed and jotted a series of indignant questions for his staff in the margin .
“ Have they done this sort of thing before ? ” Cheney asked in his meticulous handwriting .
“ Send an Amb. to answer a question ? ”
Most of all , the notes showed that Cheney was in no mood for innocent explanations .
His last question suggested darkly , “ Or did his wife send him on a junket ? ”
The famous Cheney snarl was practically audible .
Ambassador Wilson had questioned the basis for the Iraq war , so he had to be discredited — in this case , by showing that his trip to Africa had been dreamed up by his wife , who was , indeed , a C.I.A. employee .
( In fact , Valerie Wilson did not send her husband to Niger , which is not generally a sought - after destination for Washington junketeers . )
Cheney ’s intention was to defend the war by going on the offensive against critics like Wilson , and he was n’t the only one in the Administration doing it .
Gossip about the Wilsons was passed around with something close to glee .
Ari Fleischer , the press secretary at the time , said that Libby told him that Valerie Wilson ’s status was “ hush - hush . ” Richard Armitage , then the Deputy Secretary of State , confided to Bob Woodward in an interview in June , 2003 , that Wilson ’s “ wife works in the agency . …
Everyone knows it . ”
Woodward replied , paraphrasing Armitage , that she was “ high enough up that she can say , ‘ Oh , yeah , hubby will go . ’ ” ( The tape was played at the trial . )
Saving string for his next book , Woodward did not disclose the information at the time , but Armitage was fond enough of this conversational nugget that he repeated it to Robert Novak , the syndicated columnist .
So did Karl Rove , the White House aide , who was in on the secret , too .
On July 14th , Novak wrote a column about Joe Wilson ’s mission to Niger , which blew his wife ’s C.I.A. cover .
Republicans tend to look askance at the disclosure of the identities of C.I.A. agents , but it was only because of pressure from congressional Democrats that Fitzgerald was appointed to look into the leak .
In other words , the Administration reacted to Ambassador Wilson ’s perfidy — his decision to tell the truth about one aspect of the fictional justifications for the war — like a crew of deskbound Tony Sopranos .
Still , Libby ’s colleagues were more careful than he was .
Nobody was charged with violating the Intelligence Identities Protection Act , which requires a specific intent to disclose a secret agent ’s identity .
( Just to be safe , Fleischer demanded — and received — immunity before agreeing to coöperate with Fitzgerald . )
No one except Libby was proved to be lying to investigators .
And Libby has not said that anyone told him to perjure himself .
Still , in a moral sense , if not a legal one , it was clear that the business of discrediting the Wilsons was a group undertaking , and it ’s therefore easy to see why the jury struggled with laying blame for the whole operation on Libby .
One juror , Denis Collins , said after the trial that he agreed with the defense claim that Libby was a “ fall guy ” for Cheney , among others , but Collins also thought that Libby was guilty ; under the circumstances , both conclusions made sense .
After the verdict , the Vice - President , as is his custom , was n’t answering questions from the press .
Perhaps Congress , if it finally gets around to investigating why the nation went to war under false pretenses four years ago , will have better luck with him .
The most fevered supporters of the war immediately began pressuring the President to pardon Libby .
For the time being , Bush is probably hoping that the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit , which has been very accommodating to the Administration , especially in cases relating to the war on terror , will do the work for him and figure out a way to dispose of the case — or at least drag it out until after the 2008 election .
( That ’s the customary moment for controversial pardons , like the one Bill Clinton gave Marc Rich , the fugitive financier — who , as it happens , was once a legal client of Scooter Libby ’s . )
The ruination of Libby , by all accounts an intelligent and dedicated man , is not cause for celebration .
But George Bush should n’t be giving pardons ; he should be begging the nation ’s . ♦

Sapphire Radeon X1950 GT
Graphics Card ATI certainly has a curious strategy .
Even though they knew they were coming out with the new Radeon HD 2000 series of graphics cards to replace the X1950 series , they launched the Radeon X1950 GT .
Perhaps it is to help clear off their current VPUs before the new graphics cards are launched .
If that 's the case , then perhaps they should have offered something with a little more muscle .
Although ATI is pricing the Radeon X1950 GT as a more cost - effective alternative to the Radeon X1950 Pro , it is actually slower ( on paper at least ) than its predecessor , the Radeon X1900 GT .
It certainly did not impress us in our tests .
It was consistently slower than the GeForce 7950 GT .
Although it 's not really targeted at that card , we have seen earlier that even an overclocked GeForce 7900 GS can beat it flat .
Of course , we tested it in a new environment - Windows Vista .
But hey , it is the new operating system that everyone is migrating to .
If it 's certified for Windows Vista , it had better work right in Windows Vista , or are we wrong about that ?
It 's been months since Windows Vista was launched .
If they cannot get their Vista driver decently optimized , do n't blame us .
With the release of ATI 's new HD 2000 series of cards , the Sapphire X1950 GT will be a hard sell .
Not only is it saddled with the perception that it is " old technology " ( which it is ) , ATI kneecapped it by making it weak .
If you can still find one , a Radeon X1900 GT would actually be faster and cheaper .
It 's not all that bad though .
Doom 3 and even Company Of Heroes were all playable at high resolutions .
You will have to skip anti-aliasing with the more strenous games , but generally , it can offer reasonably good performance .
Just make sure you pay a good low price for it .

The Royal Society , Britain 's national academy of science , yesterday joined the debate about so - called open access to scientific research , warning that making research freely available on the internet as it is published in scientific journals could harm scientific debate .
The Royal Society fears it could lead to the demise of journals published by not - for - profit societies , which put out about a third of all journals .
" Funders should remember that the primary aims should be to improve the exchange of knowledge between researchers and wider society , " The Royal Society said .
Its position is a thinly veiled attack on proposals by Research Councils UK - the umbrella body for Britain 's eight public backers of research .
The body has said researchers should be obliged to place a copy of their work in an online archive , usually connected with a university , preferably at the same time as the work appears in a subscription - based journal .
The Royal Society , which publishes one of the world 's oldest journals , Philosophical Transactions , called on the research community to carry out further investigation before adopting any position .
Open access proponents said the Royal Society position statement confuses open access publishing , in which authors pay for their research to be published on the web , with author self - archiving .
The latter , which has already been carried out in some disciplines for years , relies on academics publishing on the internet articles that have been accepted by journals .
A spokesman for the Royal Society said : " We think it conceivable that the journals in some disciplines might suffer .
Why would you pay to subscribe to a journal if the papers appear free of charge ? "
It is a great honor for Asianart.com to host a selection of images and captions from the exhibition Sacred Visions .
We would like to thank the Metropolitan Museum and the curators of the exhibition , Steven Kossak and Jane Casey Singer , for their generous permission to use their caption texts and the material from the Metropolitan Museum collection .
We are also grateful to the many private collectors who consented to have their paintings reproduced on - line as well .
The fact that many of the paintings in this epochal show are not seen in these pages does not mean that Asianart.com will not attempt to show these as well in the future .
We are in the process of contacting other lenders in pursuit of permission to enlarge this sampling still further .
We expect to update this exhibition in the near future .
We urge visitors to turn to the excellent catalogue for the further text entries by the curators and the entire corpus of more than 60 paintings .
e Bay Developer program – Fighting through stupidity
I 'm trying to use the eBay Developer APIs to add eBay prices to wishradar .
The entire experience has been nothing but frustrating .
This is the worst designed system I have ever seen .
I can't believe that anyone is willing to fight through the stupidity long enough to actually build an application with their API .
The whole thing is disjointed .
I 've had to sign up for at least 4 different thing kinds of credentials and accounts in order to make a simple REST call .
And that 's totally separate from the Affiliate program , which I also need if we expect to make any money from this exercise .
The documentation is poorly written and confusingly organized .
The API itself is badly over - complicated .
The site is confusing , ugly and uninformative .
And now , crucially , when I finally have my request working , I have to get " certified , " before I use it at any volume .
For this , a human must manually review each API request I want to make .
This certification process is supposed to take a week to ten days .
Or , at least it might if I can could actually access the system where I am supposed to make the certification request .
Unfortunately , that 's where I hit a wall .
Their support will not let me log in with any of the four types of credentials I 've had to get thus far , and there is no way to create a new account .
So I 'm locked out .
The Amazon API system is a joy to use , by comparison .
It 's simple , clear , reasonably well documented and easy to get started .
The affiliate program is nicely integrated with the API .
( eBay is still using Commission Junction ! )
The eBay Developer staff are either malicious , incompetent , and asleep at the wheel .
The whole process has been awful , and I am seriously considering punting it all and saying we 'll never have eBay data .
Or perhaps I should give up on the API and just screen - scrape the data that we need .
It would be far easier .
And that should tell you something .
By Scott Berkun , June 1 , 2006
In part one , I covered getting started , why managers are different and other essentials .
Here in part 2 we get into tactics you need for the first few weeks .
Getting acclimated
Survival training of any kind teaches you one thing : before you act , know where you are .
Say , for example , I dumped you , blindfolded and dehydrated , in the Swiss Alps .
Your first move would n’t be to run around , tripping over stones , yelling orders at sheep .
Instead you ’d be best be served by figuring out how to remove that blindfold and get your bearings .
Only then could you possibly find the direction most likely to provide you with shelter and drinking water ( or at least some Swiss chocolate .
Yum ) .
When you become a manager , even in an organization you ’ve worked in for years , the landscape changes because of your new managerial status .
Before you throw orders around and correct the mistakes of managers past , stop , look and listen .
Observe what is happening today , right now .
Talk to the people you ’re working with and ask them what they see happening that you should be working on in your first weeks , especially the most experienced and respected people on your team .
See what concerns or ideas they have that perhaps went unheard before .
If nothing else , start building relationships from day one with those that work with and for you .
Watch the clock in these meetings : make sure you spend more time listening to them than talking .
If they ramble , ask them for recommendations .
If they have nothing to say , invite them to follow up if they wish , but move on : there ’s a lot to do .
During week one , the best thing for everyone is to be predictable and straightforward , especially if the group has seen rough times before you were hired .
Being an honest , reasonable , and reliable manager for a few weeks will do more , 90 % of the time , than any kind of imagined management heroics could .
Even if there are serious problems , wait .
Like the blindfolded man in the Alps , just because you ’re in trouble does n’t mean making big moves will save you : running straight ahead might just send you off a cliff ( To the amusement of the sheep ) .
Trying to be a hero , especially when you do n’t have a clue , is about you and your ego , not the needs of the team .
So unless there ’s a fatal issue ( company going bankrupt , missing a ship date tomorrow , website is crashing ) do n’t assume things have to change right away .
Hold on until you understand what ’s going on , why , and what assets you have to do anything about it .
Focus on getting your bearings so that when you do take action within the next few weeks , you ’ll be making decisions with confidence .
Setting the pace , tone and routine
In competitive rowing , the dude in front with the megaphone is called a coxswain .
Besides having the strangest , most easily ridiculed name in the wide world of sports , his primary responsibility is keeping everyone in harmony .
The reason for the coxswain ’s dedicated role , a function so important that he does no other task such as , say , rowing , is pure physics .
When everyone rows in synchronicity their effect is amplified : the same effort results in more power if it ’s well managed .
The value of this harmony is greater than the value of another rower : an excellent metaphor for management .
The hard part is that there ’s more to setting the pace than owning a megaphone .
Pace is rhythm , something in short supply among the business crowd , and the first step to getting rhythm is realizing how off rhythm you are .
Any new music student learns about metronomes , devices that keep perfect rhythm , and uses them to keep time .
Playing with a metronome makes the gaps in rhythm obvious and helps correct it .
As a manager , the first move is to get a sense for the rhythm of the team .
It wo n’t be a metronome , but it will be a reference point .
Work :
How often do tasks take ?
Do people work in terms of days , hours , weeks ?
What are the size of most assignments ?
Do they actually get done ?
How is work tracked ?
How is work chosen ?
A wiki ?
A whiteboard ?
Looking at the website / build ?
How does this compare to other teams you ’ve worked on or managed ?
Other teams in the organization ?
Goals :
Do people know what to do ?
Why they ’re doing it ?
How it fits what others are doing ?
Do the goals match the business ?
Are the written well enough so people can both understand and apply them to daily work ?
Change :
What is the rate of new decisions and adjustments ?
Hourly ?
Daily ?
How easily / fast do people take in and use new information ?
Is change managed in hallways ?
E-mail ?
Wikis ?
The minds of a select few ?
Not managed at all ?
Have people given up making plans at all because of the tornado of chaos that circles the team ?
Meetings :
Do people meet informally ( hallways , coffeerooms , offices ) or formally ( is it hard to find free meeting rooms ) ?
How long do most meetings take ?
What is the pace of communication ?
Do meetings ever end early ?
Run long ?
What is the ratio of meetings to decisions ?
How many people are in most meetings ?
5 , 10 , 15 , 30 ?
Is the exchange of ideas at a high level ?
Tone :
Do people smile ?
Is their enough trust for intense debate with people crying ?
Do people joke with each other ?
Are things loose and easy ( MASH , the TV show ) or uptight and rigid ( Marines ) ?
Do people comfortably depend on each other ?
Or is there just pretense ?
People & Morale :
What motivates these people ?
Money ?
Perks ?
Interesting work ?
Creativity ?
Control ?
Helping people ?
Comradery ?
Who likes who ?
Who hates who ?
Who is having sex , wants to have sex , or had sex with who ?
( You think I ’m kidding , do n’t you )
Performance :
Is the quality of work high ?
Who is doing the best work relative to the goals ?
The worst ?
Do people have a sense for what they do well and do poorly ?
Are they motivated to do better work ?
Rewarded for it ?
Once you have an assessment , make a rough list of the strengths and weaknesses .
Put them in order of importance : now you know what you want to work to protect and work to change as a manager , when the opportunities arise .
Do n’t show this list to others , but expect to talk about your top 3 observations to others so you can compare notes , improve your understanding and improve your sense of what the tone and rhythm need to be .
Learning your team
Managers are only as good as their ability to put people in situations that take advantage of their strengths and grow their weaknesses .
If you ca n’t do that , you could have the most talented , high potential team in the world and quickly run them into the ground .
Great managers by definition get the most out of the people who work for them .
They manage with respect for the limitations of the people they have , but with insight into the potential they have n’t realized .
If you have a team of horses , let them run .
If you have a team of wolves , let them hunt .
If you ’re not sure what you have , see what happens when they run , hunt , shop , design , debate , negotiate , party , etc .
You ’ll always find you have a mixture of talents and attitudes that do n’t perfectly fit the jobs that need to be done : but that ’s why you have a salary .
It ’s your job to bring the team together , finding the best matches of people and jobs that need to be done .
Review , one person at a time , if the people on your team are in the right roles for the project , and the right roles for them .
The mismatches are often the best places to focus on .
Taking action
There are two things you do n’t want when it comes to decision making : to be a wimp or a tyrant .
If when you propose changes you cave in at the most reasonable questions , you ’re digging a hole for your management career : it will be harder to roll out your next decision .
At the same time a tyrant , even a smart tyrant , fails for lack of collaboration .
No one likes being told what to do , even if there are good reasons .
A tyrant eventually misses something , and their obsessive self - reliance turns small oversights into big problems .
The middle ground , a good place in this case , is to build your way to taking action , especially ones involving personnel ( changing roles , jobs , assignments ) .
The rough guide to action has 3 steps :
Clarify the problem you are trying to solve ( e.g . “ We need to respond faster to customer feedback ” ) .
Talk to the people involved about the problem and discuss with them , evolving the problem , and possible solutions , as you go .
It ’s a red flag if you ca n’t convince smart people it ’s an important problem .
Create a rough plan .
( “ Someone , possibly Sally , needs to drive customer feedback ” ) .
Discuss your options with your reports that are affected .
Based on # 1 you should know where they ’ll be sensitive and either modify the proposal or have a plan for convincing them in your back pocket .
Take action .
( “ Sally is now responsible for feedback . ” )
As people build trust in you , the need for consensus and hand holding decreases .
However , in actions that impact people ’s careers , you always want to err on the side of involving them early and often .
Strive to involve people in matters that define their fate .
If you ’re a middle manager or an executive you ca n’t do this for everyone , but by doing it for your directs , you ’ll send waves of involvement through the organization .
This kind of trust is rare and powerful : the points you score with your team pays off threefold down the line when you need to ask them to do something they do n’t want to do .
Did the Chinese discover America ?
New book asserts a different version of history
By Adam Dunn
Special to CNN
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
In his new book , " 1421 : The Year China Discovered America " ( William Morrow ) , Gavin Menzies claims that a massive Chinese fleet of huge junks and support ships made a two - year circumnavigation of the globe , with extensive exploration of the Americas , nearly a century before Magellan and Columbus .
Needless to say , his assertion has raised an international flurry of debate .
The book has already garnered mixed reviews from the British media , as well as skeptical articles from The New York Times Magazine and Salon.com .
Menzies is unfazed by the reviews .
Indeed , even he was surprised at the results of his research , he said in an interview in the New York offices of his American publisher , Morrow .
" It was a complete freak , " the author said .
Menzies , a former Royal Navy submarine commander , is a soft - spoken and diminutive presence , not at all the obsessive eccentric he 's been painted in the press .
While on an anniversary trip to China with his wife , Menzies recalled , he became fascinated with the history of the Great Wall and the Forbidden City , coincidentally completed in 1421 .
Delving further , Menzies found himself enmeshed in a 10 - year research project on the instigators of the two monumental constructions , the Chinese emperor Zhu Di and his nemesis , the Mongol Tamerlane .
Then , while vetting the manuscript ( which would have been titled " Two Emperors on Horseback " ) among historians , Menzies learned of a Portuguese chart , dating from 1424 , depicting islands in the Caribbean .
" So here was a Portuguese claim that the whole world had been charted 70 years before Columbus .
By whom ? "
Menzies said .
He matter - of - factly presents the answer .
" I looked at other charts , and found it was the Chinese .
So I abandoned my book , and started this one .
" At the time , " he added , " I was really brassed off ( angry ) about it . "
Challenging the consensus
The book draws on Menzie 's navigational experience , as well as the findings of a team of experts he assembled to collate and decipher an ever - growing body of multilingual , cartographic , and biological evidence .
As with any epic , " 1421 " begins with a history lesson .
In the year of the title , the emperor Zhu Di ordered the dispatch of a fleet of treasure ships to bring back tribute to his kingdom .
According to Menzies ' findings , an armada of 800 massive junks set sail in the spring to return delegates who had attended the Forbidden City 's inauguration to their nations , and to explore , map and bring tribute from the uncharted reaches beyond the horizons .
Menzies focuses on a fortuitous synchronicity : the presence of a Venetian trader named Niccolo da Conti , who met with the Chinese in the southwest Indian trading hub of Calicut .
Da Conti made detailed records of his contact .
By Menzies ' reckoning , it was da Conti who corroborated the thesis that Chinese junks rounded the Cape of Good Hope , westward bound for points unknown .
Such synchronicity followed Menzies as his research took him deeper along the Chinese trade routes .
He retraced the junks ' routes around the globe and found shoreside marker stones , carved in a host of Asian languages , all over the world .
Other discoveries convinced him he was on the right track : Sunken junks provided evidence of Chinese - speaking peoples in the pre-Columbian New World ( backed , the author claims , by anthropological evidence supported by carbon - dating and DNA analysis ) .
So did the presence of Chinese - introduced species .
" I started off with all sorts of peripheral information , " he recalled .
" The first Europeans who came to the Americas found Chinese chickens , rice , Chinese porcelain and jade , they found Chinese - speaking peoples .
I put all that information on a map , and then I decided to look at the accounts of the first European explorers .
...
Now , I put this team together , and they have been translating into English , for the first time , the complete accounts of these European explorers .
They found Chinese people everywhere .
California , Mexico , Arkansas , Florida and so on .
And they found not only Chinese people , but Chinese junks .
So I say , that 's it .
Game , set and match for me . "
( A complete collation of these accounts can be viewed on the book 's website , www.1421.tv.)
Questions
This map designed by famous Turkish admiral Piri Reis shows a mixture of several maps including the 1428 World Map and was drawn on a gazelle skin in 1513 .
Historians range from dismissive to troubled regarding Menzies ' determinations .
" He has not , unfortunately , discovered anything new , " Chinese historian Louise Levathes told Salon.com .
" What he 's done is to present it in a jumbled manner so you have no idea what 's going on and what the time frames are . "
Other experts were taking a wait - and - see attitude .
" There 's a definite logic to his analysis , " Phillip Sadler , a celestial navigation expert at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , told Space.com .
Menzies presented his findings in a talk at the Royal Geographical Society in London roughly 18 months ago ( which an article in Salon.com cites as an affair rented by the author himself ) .
By coincidence , Menzies said , a Chinese TV crew was in London and beamed the talk to China .
Reaction was then picked up by CBS and ABC , he said .
" So , by a complete freak of luck , I had a worldwide audience for my talk .
This resulted in a torrent of information which helped me enormously , " he said .
" I got literally thousands of letters asking , did I know about this or that .
For instance , a walnut farmer from around Sacramento [ California ] rang me up and said , ' I 've got a Chinese junk in my backyard which predated Columbus , and my family 's known about it for 50 years . '
It was subsequently investigated and it turns out it is a junk .
That 's happened all over the world . "
Gavin Menzies
Indeed , after giving lectures in China , he was shocked to have his findings corroborated by two Chinese professors who had had no prior contact with him , and whose research provided hard evidence supporting a Chinese - Brazil connection dating from 1511 and earlier .
One of the conferences sifted through the additional material .
" The conference was stumped , " Menzies said .
' The conference split into three groups , each taking a third of my evidence and trawled through it , and after three days they said , ' If only half of your evidence is true , it 's unarguable that China got to the Americas before the Europeans did . ' "
At the least , Menzies ' work will prompt new research of his findings , whether they 're corroborated or debunked .
And he's not finished yet , he said -- especially with the response he 's gotten to his book , already topping best - seller lists in the UK and U.S .
" I 've got a team that does nothing else but analyze this incoming stream , " he said .
I have a peculiar relationship to money .
I expect to have to earn it , and I try to keep hold of it when I do .
The sum of which makes me a perfect pill in Las Vegas .
Attention all Brits , who now constitute the largest group of foreign tourists in this baking town of gaudy casinos and strip - malls :
Do n't take me with you .
I 'm a drag .
So what am I doing here now ?
And how is it that in 2003 this cautious , skinflint killjoy got married in this berg ?
Is Shriver the tight , backslid Prod really capable of tying the knot in a rash moment of drunken , high - rolling abandon ?
Would that I were so interesting .
My in - laws live in Vegas , which is why I keep coming back to a city I will strongly advise all and sundry to visit once for the sheer spectacle , but only once .
My father - in - law might find that advice offensive .
He first determined that he wanted to live here in 1954 , and nine years ago fulfilled his dream to put down stakes - in every sense - full - time .
He routinely arises at 4 am and heads to the El Cortez , a seedy downtown casino far from the more internationally familiar glitz of the strip , where he plays $ 5 - a - hand blackjack until lunch , the while sipping tequila and Diet Mountain Dew .
( I 'm a drear , but you can't accuse my in - laws of not being colourful . )
Back home , he enters the day 's winnings or losses in a ledger with crimped , perfect printing in either black or red ink .
These records go back years .
This year he is up $ 147 , which given the odds is impressive .
The first time I visited the strip , I managed to control myself .
Although I am constitutionally incapable of slipping a single quarter into a slot machine ( but it might not come back !
We might need it for a parking meter ! ) , I did manage to keep the disapproving moralism to a minimum .
We gawped at the scaled - down Eiffel Tower in the Paris , checked out the awkward replica of the Parthenon in Caesars that sold Gucci chocolate .
In the Venetian ( whose murals of late afternoon sunlight are amazingly well rendered , although outside the real sky did a remarkably lifelike job as well ) I even allowed myself a scandalous mid-afternoon glass of wine .
By some miracle , during a single dabble that day I was able to take the place at face value - the only value it 's got - and keep a lid on my po-faced , party - pooping despair .
But I knew it would n't last .
Sure enough , on a second visit to the strip last week , my killjoy genes reasserted themselves .
For one thing , Las Vegas is impervious to jokes , because it already is one .
Vegas is mockery - proof .
The strip is so over the top , so jubilantly , unashamedly fake ( even the rocks are artificial ) , so ebulliently and confessedly crass , so contented with or even proud of its own trashiness that you can't make fun of the place .
How can you deride a wooden Trojan horse two storeys high that doubles as an FAO Schwarz toy store ?
It is pre-ridiculous .
This frustrates the likes of myself no end , because pejoratives like " tacky " , " tasteless " , and " garish " ping off a giant gold - painted sphinx like pennies off a curb .
Because one cannot parody parody and I do not gamble , I had nothing to do .
So it was inevitable that on a second swing through I 'd no longer be able to find Las Vegas a zany , kooky , harmless American one - off , but would disparage it as a ghastly monument to American vapidity .
Folks in the richest country in the world do not know what to do with their money in their leisure time save try to scrounge more of it , and do not truly embrace their own supposed work ethic .
Indeed , given that many of my countrymen 's concept of entertainment is heading for a line of casinos whose decor is so loud it makes your eyes hurt , whose patterned carpet and even air freshener has been carefully researched as encouraging you to lose your shirt , I am not convinced that most of the gamblers I spied on last week would have any idea on what to spend their winnings even if they improbably hit the jackpot .
All money is not created equal .
It means something different depending on what you did to get it .
Surely earning money - earning it - is an underrated joy .
I find being paid for my labours ceaselessly gratifying , and the harder I 've worked for any given cheque , the more sumptuous the texture of the paper .
By contrast , how satisfying is dosh that you came by not because you were smart or talented or diligent , but lucky ?
If this seems hopelessly humourless about a town that intends to be a laugh , the amount of cash involved is serious .
The bar at Wynne 's , the newest and most lavish casino on the block , boasts of a $ 75 martini , and you sense its designers grew frustrated at running out of nooks into which to cram polished Italian marble .
My father - in - law tells me that when his car got dusty last week he came upon a woman playing a slot machine who was going through $ 400 a minute .
That was $ 24,000 an hour , at a car wash .
I do admire the nerve and devil - may - care required to put thousands on the stumble of a roulette ball .
I concede that if you 're canny enough to follow a few simple rules in blackjack - always double aces and eights , always double - down on an 11 , do n't take a hit if you 're holding 12 or more and the dealer is showing a five or six - you can walk away with a few bills left in your wallet .
But a quick look round a casino and you start to wonder , who pays all these croupiers and cleaners , who ultimately finances the orchids in every room ?
Losers .
More losers than winners by a yard , and that rational calculation , aside from sheer wimpiness , explains why I do n't gamble .
Las Vegas and its ilk - coming soon to a town near you , if Tony Blair 's plans hold sway - dishearten me most because this is so many folks ' notion of a good time .
In fact , what most interests me about the United States is its posing of the ultimate existential dilemma : what is a good life ?
What , if you 've the money , do you buy ?
Americans , if Las Vegas is any indicator , have no idea .
Plasma astrophysicists at the University of Warwick have found that key information about the Sun ’s ' storm season ’ is being broadcast across the solar system in a fractal snapshot imprinted in the solar wind .
This research opens up new ways of looking at both space weather and the unstable behaviour that affects the operation of fusion powered power plants .
Fractals , mathematical shapes that retain a complex but similar patterns at different magnifications , are frequently found in nature from snowflakes to trees and coastlines .
Now Plasma Astrophysicists in the University of Warwick ’s Centre for Fusion , Space and Astrophysics have devised a new method to detect the same patterns in the solar wind .
The researchers , led by Professor Sandra Chapman , have also been able to directly tie these fractal patterns to the Sun ’s ‘ storm season ’ .
The Sun goes through a solar cycle roughly 11 years long .
The researchers found the fractal patterns in the solar wind occur when the Sun was at the peak of this cycle when the solar corona was at its most active , stormy and complex – sunspot activity , solar flares etc .
When the corona was quieter no fractal patterns were found in the solar wind only general turbulence .
This means that fractal signature is coming from the complex magnetic field of the sun .
This new information will help astrophysicists understand how the solar corona heats the solar wind and the nature of the turbulence of the Solar Wind with its implications for cosmic ray flux and space weather .
These techniques used to find and understand the fractal patterns in the Solar Wind are also being used to assist the quest for fusion power .
Researchers in the University of Warwick ’s Centre for Fusion , Space and Astrophysics ( CFSA ) are collaborating with scientists from the EURATOM / UKAEA fusion research programme to measure and understand fluctuations in the world leading fusion experiment MAST ( the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak ) at Culham .
Controlling plasma fluctuations in tokamaks is important for getting the best performance out of future fusion power plants .
The research by K. Kiyani , S. C. Chapman , B. Hnat , R. M. Nicol , is entitled " Self - similar signature of the active solar corona within the inertial range of solar wind turbulence " and was published on May 18th 2007 in Phys .
Rev. Lett .
The researchers received support and data from STFC ( previously PPARC ) , EPSRC , and the NASA WIND , ACE and ULYSSES teams .
Most of us share it and it seems a safe enough assumption : mathematical skills and performance develop and advance as students progress through their elementary school years .
However , a new study by University of Notre Dame psychologist Nicole M. McNeil suggests that for at least one type of math problem , 7 - year - old students are outperforming 9 - year - olds .
McNeil analyzed how 7 - to 11 - year - old children performed on “ equivalence ” problems .
An example of an equivalence problem is : “ 3+4+5 = 3+_ . ” Previous studies have shown that children have substantial difficulties with mathematical equivalence problems .
For example , many come up with solutions for the right side of the equation that range from “ 3+12 ” to “ 3+15 . ”
( For the numerically challenged , the answer is 9 . )
“ Mathematical equivalence is a fundamental concept in algebra and success in algebra is crucial to future educational and employment opportunities , ” McNeil said .
No previous study has specifically examined how equivalence performance develops over the course of elementary school years .
However , theories that have focused more generally on the development of students ’ quantitative skills assume that children ’s difficulties with mathematics are due to something the children lack , such as advanced logical structures , a mature working memory system or proficiency with basic arithmetic facts .
“ According to this view , children perform poorly on equivalence problems because they lack the cognitive structures or functions necessary for solving problems correctly , and performance should improve over childhood as those structures or functions develop , ” McNeil said .
By contrast , McNeil ’s study suggests that children ’s difficulties are due , at least in part , to something that they have — existing knowledge .
And this existing knowledge promotes “ change - resistance ” behaviors in students .
“ As children learn arithmetic between the ages of 7 and 9 , they pick up on at least three , recurrent arithmetic - specific patterns , ” McNeil said .
“ First , they learn that the equal sign and answer blank come together at the end of the problem ( 3+4=_ ) .
Second , children learn to interpret the equal sign as an operator ( like + or -) that means ‘ calculate the total . ’
And thirdly , children learn to solve math problems by performing all given operations on all given numbers . ”
Although these patterns likely help performance on traditional arithmetic problems ( 3+4=_ ) , they do not help , and most likely hinder , performance with equivalence problems , which do not adhere to the traditional form .
“ To solve an equivalence problem correctly , children must notice that the equal sign is not at the end of the problem , understand that the equal sign denotes an equivalence relation between the two sides of the equation , and manipulate the numbers and operations to arrive at an answer that makes both sides of an equation have the same value , ” McNeil said .
“ To satisfy these conditions , children must either ignore or override their long - term memory of the operational patterns . ”
McNeil conducted two separate studies of 7 - to 11 - year - olds in Pittsburgh and Raleigh , N.C. , schools , respectively , that confirmed that performance on equivalence problems declined between age 7 and 9 before improving between the ages of 9 and 11 .
“ These findings challenge our intuition and several prevailing theories , but they support change - resistance accounts , ” McNeil said .
McNeil points out that similar results have been found for Canadian children , but interestingly enough , not for those in China .
“ In the United States , children ’s early mathematics experience is heavily weighted toward arithmetic operations such as addition , subtraction , multiplication and division , ” McNeil said .
“ Children learn arithmetic in a very procedural fashion for many years before they learn to reason about equations as expressions of mathematical equivalence . ”
McNeil ’s research paper appears in the May edition of the American Psychological Association journal Developmental Psychology .

UPDATE : Looks like Ian Cooper had posted pretty much the same code in the comments to Scott ’s blog post .
I had n’t noticed it .
He did n’t have a chance to compile it , so consider this post a validation of your example Ian ! :)
Scott Hanselman recently wrote a post about how Ruby has tits or is the tits or something like that .
I agree with much of it .
Ruby is in many respects a nice language to use if you think in Ruby .
One of the comparisons of the syntactic sugar Scott showed was this :
Java :
new Date( new Date( ).getTime ( ) - 20 * 60 * 1000 ) ;
Ruby :
20.minutes.ago
That is indeed nice .
But I was on the phone with Rob Conery talking about this when it occurred to me that we ’ll be able to do this with C# 3.0 extension methods .
That link there is a blog post by Scott Guthrie talking about this feature .
Not having any time to install Orcas and try it out , I asked Rob Conery to be my code monkey and try this out .
So we fired up GoToMeeting and started pair programming .
Here is what we came up with :
public static class Extenders { public static DateTime Ago ( this TimeSpan val ) { return DateTime .
Now .
Subtract ( val ) ; } public static TimeSpan Minutes ( this int val ) { return new TimeSpan ( 0 , val , 0 ) ; } }
Now we can write a simple console program to test this out .
class Program { static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { Console .
WriteLine ( 20 . Minutes ( ) . Ago ( ) ) ; Console .
ReadLine ( ) ; } }
And it worked !
So that ’s very close to the Ruby syntax and not too shabby .
It would be even cleaner if we could create extension properties , but our first attempt did n’t seem to work and we ran out of time ( Rob actually thinks eating lunch is important ) .
Found out from ScottGu that Extension Properties are n’t part of the language yet , but are being considered as a possibility in the future .
So now add this to the comparison :
C# 3.0
20 . Minutes ( ) . Ago ( ) ;
Just one of the many cool new language features coming soon .
Group of prominent experts , including scientists and former high - level military personnel , call for release of basic 9/11 information .
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND�OF THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA :*
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT , �
On Behalf of the People of the United States of America , the Undersigned Scholars for 9/11 Truth Hereby Petitions for , and hereby demands , Release of the Following kinds of documents , video and films , and physical evidence to the public for study by experts and scholars investigating the events of 9/11 :
1. Immediate release of the full Pentagon surveillance tapes , of which five frames ( only ) have been released via the official ASCE report , as Judicial Watch has also requested .
We further demand release of the video tape seized by FBI agents minutes after the Pentagon hit , from the fuel service station near the Pentagon , as well as any other videotape which shows the 9/11 strike on the Pentagon . �

2. Immediate release of 6,899 photographs and 6,977 segments of video footage held by NIST , largely from private photographers , regarding the collapses of WTC buildings on 9/11/2001 ( NIST , 2005 , p. 81 ) .
In particular , all footage relating to the collapse of WTC 7 ( including shots before , during and after the collapse ) must be released immediately , without waiting for the NIST report on WTC 7 , which is long overdue and may be prolonged indefinitely . �
3 . An explanation from Vice President Richard Cheney regarding the " orders " described by Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta in his testimony before The 9/11 Commission .
Secretary Mineta stated that while in an underground bunker at the White House , he watched Vice President Cheney castigate a young officer for asking , as a plane drew closer and closer to the Pentagon , " Do the orders still stand ? "
The officer should be identified and allowed to testify at a deposition under oath . �
See http://www.911truthmovement.org/video/hamilton_win.wmv
4 . The documents generated by Vice President Cheney 's energy task force have been kept from the public .
A court case brought forth a few maps that display oil fields in the Middle East .
We hereby put Congress on notice that there is probable cause with regard to criminal activities by the Cheney Energy Task Force involving a criminal conspiracy to launch illegal wars and / or terrorist activities .
We therefore demand that Energy Task Force document that comprise , discuss , or refer to plans to invade the Middle East , including Iran , and Venezuela or other sovereign nations be released immediately .
See Cheney v. District Court 542 U.S. 367 ( 2004 ) and United States v. Nixon 418

5. Audio tapes of interviews with air traffic controllers on - duty on 9/11 were intentionally destroyed by crushing the cassette by hand , cutting the tape into little pieces , and then dropping the pieces in different trash cans around the building .
We demand an explanation for this destruction of evidence and ask that the possible existence of other copies of such tapes or perhaps of written transcripts of the interviews be pursued .
All air traffic controllers on - duty on 9/11 should be allowed to testify during a public forum under oath .

6 . The Secret Service , which is highly trained to protect the President from danger and to move him to a secure location in the event of a threat , breached its own standard procedures by allowing President Bush to remain at a public location for 25 minutes after it was known that the nation was under attack .
All Secret Service personnel who were at Booker Elementary School with President Bush on 9/11 should be required to testify in public and under oath about these events .

7 . On the morning of 9/11 , some five " war games " or " terror drills " were being conducted by U.S. defense agencies , including one " live fly " exercise employing aircraft .
These drills reportedly included the injection of false radar blips onto the screens of air traffic controllers .
In addition , the government was running a simulation of a plane crashing into a building the morning of 9/11 .
Who was in charge of coordinating these war games and terror drills ?
Who had the ability to issues orders in relation to their conduct ?
On which screens were " false radar blips " inserted ?
When did such false injects commence ?
When were they purged from the controllers ' screens ?
What was the effect of these activities on standard procedures for interdicting hijacked aircraft ?

8 . It has been reported that the FBI long ago found three of four " black boxes " from the two airplanes which hit the Twin Towers , yet has consistently denied that they were ever found .
Their data would be of the greatest importance to understanding the events of 9/11 .
This matter must be investigated and the data they provide released to the public .

For each of the four sites under investigation , the 9/11 Commission reported that two Boeing 757s , and two Boeing 767s ( FAA , Part 121 , airliners ) owned by United Airlines and American Airlines were hijacked by novice pilots and were subsequently crashed , resulting in an unimaginable loss of life .
Approximately 3,000 people died the morning of 9/11 as the direct result of these officially reported hijackings and subsequent crashes .
These four scheduled airliners were reported to have carried a total of 266 passengers and crew members , which , under FAA and NTSB regulations , demands a comprehensive investigation of the primary and contributing causes of each .
In the case of suspected criminal foul play , the NTSB would normally assign the lead investigative role to the FBI , with assistance of investigators from the NTSB and FAA .
A comprehensive investigation of each aircraft crash is not a regulatory option : they would have been mandatory .
Therefore , we demand public release of each comprehensive crash investigation report , including access to all physical evidence that was required to have been collected and secured at a suitable facility .
Such evidence should have included a large assortment of indestructible parts , including landing gears , surface actuators , engines , black boxes , and so on .
The serialized parts would be invaluable in identifying each aircraft and , contrary to some reports , could not have " vaporized " upon impact .
Considering the enormous loss of life and financial collateral damage , if no crash investigations were conducted , who made the decision to disregard the FAA , Part 121 , regulatory requirement ?
In the absence of the Part 121 investigation reports , the identity of the responsible authorities who made the decision not to investigate must be released , and they should be made immediately available for deposition under oath . �
9 . In the weeks before 9/11 , the US Stock market showed rather high levels of activity on companies that would subsequently be affected by the attacks .
The afternoon before the attack , alarm bells were sounding over trading patterns in stock options .
A jump in United Air Lines some 90 times ( not 90 percent ) above normal between September 6 and September 10 , for example , and 285 times higher than average the Thursday before the attack , have been reported .
A jump in American Airlines put options 60 times ( not 60 percent ) above normal the day before the attacks has also been reported .
No similar trading occurred on any other airlines appear to have occurred .
Between September 6 - 10 , 2001 , the Chicago Board Options Exchange saw suspicious trading on Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley , two of the largest WTC tenants .
An average of 3,053 put options in Merrill Lynch were bought between Sept. 6 - 10 , compared to an average of 252 in the previous week .
Merrill Lynch , another WTC tenant , saw 12,215 put options bought between Sept. 7 - 10 , whereas the previous days had seen averages of 212 contracts a day .
According to Dylan Ratigan of Bloomberg News : " This would be the most extraordinary coincidence in the history of mankind , if it was a coincidence .
This could very well be insider trading at the worst , most horrific , most evil use you�ve ever seen in your entire life .
It �s absolutely unprecedented . "
On September 18 , 2001 , the BBC reported : " American authorities are investigating unusually large numbers of shares in airlines , insurance companies and arms manufacturers that were sold off in the days and weeks before the attacks .
They believe that the sales were by people who knew about the impending disaster " .
According to the London Independent , October 10 , 2001 : " To the embarrassment of investigators , it has also emerged that the firm used to buy many of the ' put ' options �where a trader , in effect , bets on a share price fall �on United Airlines stock was headed until 1998 by ' Buzzy ' Krongard , now executive director of the CIA .

The 9/11 Commission , after looking into the pre-9/11 stock trades , never denied their unusual nature .
Instead , the Commission declared that al - Qaeda did not conduct the trades , and asked no further questions .

Who , if not al - Qaeda , performed the incriminating trades ?
This information exists , it can be easily obtained , and it needs to be made public .
Moreover , illegal money transfers may have been processed through computers housed at the World Trade Center shortly before planes crashed into the Twin Towers on 9/11 .
We demand a disclosure of the source of the put options and that this whole sordid affair receive a complete and public investigation .

10 . Eyewitness testimony and a substantiating photographic record suggest that a large sample of slag from the World Trade Center is being held at Hangar 17 of the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City .
Access to the slag sample should be made available to appropriate physicists in order to conduct non-destructive X - ray Fluorescence tests and other forms of examination , which should reveal evidence of the cause of the collapse of the Twin Towers .
Based on these tests , we further demand two small samples ( about the size of a fist ) be extracted from this large piece for further scientific analysis .
See http://911proof.com/resources/Slag+Sample.gif
11 . Release of a complete inventory of the plane wreckage and debris from flights 11 , 77 , 93 or 175 or any other aircraft that crashed or was destroyed on September 11 , 2001 , including , but not limited to : �
( a ) the location ( whether warehouses or otherwise ) of all such items ;
( b ) a catalog of photographs and videotapes taken of any and all such items ; and
( c ) a list of all tests and examinations concerning any and all such items , including reports of such tests or examinations . �
12 . Release of a complete inventory of any steel , other metal or other material from the World Trade Centers , including , but not limited to : �
( a ) the location ( whether warehouses or otherwise ) of all such items ;
( b ) a catalog of photographs and videotapes taken of any and all such items ; and
( c ) a list of all tests and examinations concerning any and all such items , including reports of such tests or examinations . �
On behalf of the People of the United States of America , we demand that the cover - up in this case end and that the kinds of documents , video and films , and physical evidence described above be provided to the public for experts and scholars to evaluate and assess in their efforts to expose falsehoods and reveal truths about events on 9/11 .

Colin Farrell : The Irishman Who Can Samba
Colin Farrell appeared onthis morning to promote his new film , .
Most male actors are really scared of going on :
You 've got to face a grilling by everyone from Barbara Walters ( who held her own in an intervew with Fidel Castro , as you recall ) and Joy Behar -- who loves to crack jokes at the actors ' expense .
But Colin had a dream time on
He was funny .
He was scruffily handsome .
He only said " foooking " a few times ( which was bleeped ) .
He was self - deprecating , alluding to the " 10 people or so who saw Alexander " then pretending to whip himself on the back with a cilice , like the albino killer in The Da Vinci Code .
He kissed each host .
He whispered with Monique .
But most importantly , after a discusson of his salsa dance scene in the movie , he then danced a cha-cha / salsa hybrid with Barbara Walters , joking that trying to get an Irishman to do a passionate Latin dance was nearly an impossibliity because in Irish dancing only the legs move .
Barbara was putty in his hands .

Gore responds to White House ' hypocrisy ' comments RAW STORY
Published : January 17 , 2006 Print This | Email This
In response to White House comments that Gore exhibited " hypocrisy " in calling for a Special Prosecutor , saying that the Clinton administration had wiretapped some Americans , Gore will make this statement shortly .
It was leaked to RAW STORY in advance .
Former Vice President Al Gore : " The Administration 's response to my speech illustrates perfectly the need for a special counsel to review the legality of the NSA wiretapping program .
The Attorney General is making a political defense of the President without even addressing the substantive legal questions that have so troubled millions of Americans in both political parties .

There are two problems with the Attorney General 's effort to focus attention on the past instead of the present Administration 's behavior .
First , as others have thoroughly documented , his charges are factually wrong .
Both before and after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was amended in 1995 , the Clinton / Gore Administration complied fully and completely with the terms of the law .
Second , the Attorney General 's attempt to cite a previous administration 's activity as precedent for theirs - even though factually wrong - ironically demonstrates another reason why we must be so vigilant about their brazen disregard for the law .
If unchecked , their behavior would serve as a precedent to encourage future presidents to claim these same powers , which many legal experts in both parties believe are clearly illegal .
The issue , simply put , is that for more than four years , the executive branch has been wiretapping many thousands of American citizens without warrants in direct contradiction of American law .
It is clearly wrong and disrespectful to the American people to allow a close political associate of the president to be in charge of reviewing serious charges against him .
The country needs a full and independent investigation into the facts and legality of the present Administration 's program . "
# Background from AP : The White House accused former Vice President Al Gore of hypocrisy Tuesday for his assertion that President Bush broke the law by eavesdropping on Americans without court approval .
" If Al Gore is going to be the voice of the Democrats on national security matters , we welcome it , " White House press secretary Scott McClellan said in a swipe at the Democrat , who lost the 2000 election to Bush only after the Supreme Court intervened .
Gore called the program , authorized by President Bush , " a threat to the very structure of our government " and charged that the administration acted without congressional authority and made a " direct assault " on a federal court set up to authorize requests to eavesdrop on Americans .
McClellan said the Clinton - Gore administration had engaged in warrantless physical searches , and he cited an FBI search of the home of CIA turncoat Aldrich Ames without permission from a judge .
He said Clinton 's deputy attorney general , Jamie Gorelick , had testified before Congress that the president had the inherent authority to engage in physical searches without warrants .
" I think his hypocrisy knows no bounds , " McClellan said of Gore .
Gary McKinnon could face a prison sentence of 45 years
Glasgow - born Gary McKinnon , of north London , is accused of gaining access to 97 US military and Nasa computers .
Home Secretary John Reid granted the US request to extradite him for trial .
At the High Court in London , his lawyers argued the 41 - year - old had been subjected to " improper threats " and the move would breach his human rights .
His lawyers had argued that , if extradited , he would face an unknown length of time in pre-trial detention , with no likelihood of bail .
He would also face a long prison sentence - " in the region of 45 years " - and may not be allowed to serve part of the sentence at home in the UK , his lawyers had said .
But , on Tuesday , Lord Justice Maurice Kay and Mr Justice Goldring dismissed his legal challenge , saying they could not find any grounds for appeal .
We will certainly be applying for this court to certify a point of law of public importance and to grant leave

Ben Cooper , for Mr McKinnon , said his client would now seek to make an appeal against his extradition at the House of Lords .
" We will certainly be applying for this court to certify a point of law of public importance and to grant leave , " he said .
Speaking later , solicitor Jeffrey Anderson said alleged threats by US authorities , including one from New Jersey prosecutors that Mr McKinnon " would fry " , would be among issues raised .
That had been a " chilling and intimidating " reference to capital punishment by the electric chair , he added .
It now looked as though the US would try to prosecute Mr McKinnon as a cyber- terrorist , Mr Anderson said .
" This could lead to him spending the rest of his life in prison in the US , with repatriation to serve his sentence in his home country denied as punishment for contesting his extradition . "
Mr McKinnon has never denied that he accessed the computer networks of a wide number of US military institutions between February 2001 and March 2002 .
Mr McKinnon , arrested in November 2002 , has always maintained that he was motivated by curiosity and that he only managed to get into the networks because of lax security .
If you have ever enjoyed frustration - free , satnav assisted drives or the hissing serenade that preceded an important fax , then you can thank the city with no street names - Tokyo .
A capital city without road names is a huge handicap .
Collectively , the Japanese ( especially trainee post workers ) and bewildered visitors have spent decades lost in Tokyo's labyrinthine arteries - most , literally , without a name .
But rather than just name the streets and number the buildings , the locals had a uniquely Japanese answer to the problem : improve an existing technology , in this case the fax , to send maps and directions to visitors .
In the 1980s Japan shrank fax machines , making them popular and affordable , and later repeated it with the satnav to ease the headache of getting from A to B .
Alas , Tokyo's complex subway still remains a challenge even to residents , something your correspondent pondered while making his uncertain way to a laboratory in western Tokyo .
The lab is home to the Tokyo Ubiquitous Network Project , where scientists are planning a computer infrastructure that they say will fill such information gaps for good and enable us to give our maps , guidebooks and A - Zs that longed - for heave - ho .
Heading the project is Tokyo University professor Ken Sakamura - who , with the aid of the Japanese government , is well on his way to building the world 's first truly public ubiquitous computer network .
It 's " an infrastructure for the 21st century " , he says , adding that it will see our everyday landscape guide us , inform us and generally hold our hand in an increasingly puzzling world .
Sakamura foresees scenarios resembling those in the film Minority Report , where the hero passes intelligent ad boards and shops in the mall which acknowledge him by name and try to flog him stuff .
However the real - life version , in Japan at least , will be less intrusive , Sakamura insists .
Complete control
" With this system the user is in complete control .
As a user of such a network we will see our enviros us , " Sakamura says .
" We seek only to chip or tag objects and the environment , never people .
With this system you can choose to read which you wish .
The ubiquitous communicator - the pocket device you use to read the information around you - can only read and write , which means your identity is protected . "
Japan 's government sees enormous benefits from making every object readable this way .
Improved guidance for the blind is one , painless interactive guidance for the tourists Japan desperately yearns for is another , and even salarymen and befuddled gaijin reporters trying to get around hostile cities will benefit from the scheme .
Working with Sakamura 's outfit and Japan 's top technology companies such as Hitachi , the country 's Information Ministry has just spent ¥ 1bn ( £ 4.2 m ) on a month - long field trial that covered several blocks of the famousGinza shopping district .
During the trial last month , PDA - style communicators were handed out to reporters and tourists , who were then free to wander around picking up information on their PDAs as they went .
Anyone emerging with a communicator at the Ginza metro station , for example , had a 3D , real - time image of the landscape above them beamed to their PDA , making it a cinch to see which exit you might want if you were headed , say , for the Mitsukoshi department store .
Head towards the store itself and RFID tags in the building sense your presence then zap to your PDA a woman 's image welcoming you to the store .
To learn more about this Tokyo landmark 's history , touch the screen .
In the future , commercial applications could include pushing you news of sales if you have registered interest , or even digital money - off coupons to tempt you inside .
Getting commerce involved is important , says Sakumura , as the cost of building the infrastructure will be gargantuan .
The pilot scheme used a variety of electronic tags that can transmit information ; some of which are tiny and cheap , such as Hitachi 's sand grain - sized passive RFID tags .
Other infrared tags , which can beam out signals at longer ranges , are more expensive .
Add this to the cost of installation and many trillions of yen will be needed to build , install and maintain a truly ubiquitous network , says Sakamura .
" Ginza used only a thousand tags and that cost ¥ 1bn . "
The Ginza trial also highlighted some of the technical and security issues that have yet to be dealt with .
Teething problems included cross-interference from illegal radio transmitters , as well as difficulties using the rather bulky prototype reader .
" In the future the job of the reader will be done by your mobile phone , using a remote server , " Sakamura says .
" There are also still some regulation issues and security issues to iron out - one prankster even managed to slip in his own tag on to a Ginza lamppost that led readers to a porn site . "
Double - edged sword
If ubiquitous networks are going to take off , Japan is surely the place to watch .
The nation has already primed itself by accepting RFID tags - tracing the provenance of food , or in " smart shops " that chip their clothes for ease of inventory and to satisfy customer queries instantly .
Even children are chipped " for their own safety " - raising , of course , questions of privacy .
Surely there will be more abuse of tagging in a ubiquitous computing world ?
" Yes , the technology is a double - edged sword , " says the professor .
" For example , ubiquitous networks will be great for teleworking , working from where you like with a small terminal linked to embedded computers or multiple tags linked to a big server , but it also means the boss knows exactly where you are .
But as long as you the user agrees to reveal such information or can choose to withhold it , we will be OK . "
Clearly , one benefit of the project is the embedding of tags in existing " tactile walkways " - such as bumps at the side of the road indicating a pedestrian crossing - for the blind .
Sakamura demonstrated in his lab how a white cane equipped as an RFID reader could become a directional sensor , interacting with information being beamed by the tags embedded in the street .
Adding extra details such as announcing the distance across the street at a road crossing and flagging up hazards such as stairways are also part of Sakamura 's project that the government hopes to have in place in Japan 's streets within the next five years .
With an extra 10,000 tags planned to be dotted around Kobe and Tokyo before the end of the year to kickstart the new information infrastructure , other fully functioning guidance and information systems will not be far away .
" Just as we built up roads , the next step in civilisation is to build a total information network that will form part of the fabric of things around us , " says Sakamura .
His vision is of all physical objects embedded with microcomputers with communication capabilities , sensors , actuators and so on , to supply us with location specific information .
" They will operate in a concerted manner , processing , exchanging information with each other within the ubiquitous computing architecture .
Making available location - specific information anytime , anywhere , to anyone . "
You might still find some things are lost in translation , but perhaps you would n't be lost in Tokyo ever again .

The second man , identified as Paul Cimino , who was being held on charges of abusing small animals in New Orleans when he apparently conspired with Boudreaux to make a break , choosing a life on the run over a $ 35 fine and court costs .
Relatives of Mr. Cimino insist that while he may not be totally innocent of the indecency with animals charge , and that going to extreme lengths to avoid paying for things due to an innate cheapness to make Scrooge blush is fairly typical , that he was an unwilling captive during the entire sordid affair .
Mr. Cimino claimed he was willing to come down , but eventually had to be rescued by the volunteer fire department , Hook and Ladder Company number 3 , from over by Three Legged Salamander Creek Lane .
The chase brought a tragic end , however , to the criminal career of one L'Enfant Boudreaux , of Dauphin Parrish , Louisiana .
After consulting with Louisiana officials of some note , Deputy Smith attempted to coax the habitual offender down by claiming that there was an all you could eat crawdad boil starting at the restaurant .
Suddenly , Deputy Smith recounted , the whiny little guy , started screaming " NO !
I wo n't ' suck the head ' one more time you bastard !' , and began running around the top of the peach .
As most live sex chat residents are aware , the top of the peach is somewhat slippery anyway , and there had been a recent spot of precipitation .
This led to a recipe for disaster not quite as tragic as when that Mexican painter fellow slipped on the peach two years ago .
Only because , as he plummeted to his death , L'Enfant Boudreaux did not deprive this community of a fine young man that offered streak free house painting at reasonable rates .
Two dangerous fugitives from Louisiana Justice were ' peached ' late yesterday afternoon , when Sheriff 's Deputy R.B. Smith spotted their getaway car parked outside Fat Jack 's restaurant near Exit 92 on I - 85 .
Judging that the situation was too fluid to wait for the back up officer , Deputy Smith entered the establishment , only to see the two fugitives bolt for the back door .
Deputy Smith 's fears of a high speed chase on I - 85 in a cloud of blue oil smoke were not realized , when to his amazement , the criminals scaled the big peach water tower seeking to elude detection .
" I might have lost 'em , but that little feller was just a screamin and cryin for his momma like a five year old by the candy rack at the check - out at the Winn Dixie .
And ya'll know how loud that can get . "
Emerging from the back of the restaurant , Boudreaux , desperate for a place to hide from the probing eyes of justice , somehow managed to scale the giant peach , with his object - du - amor in tow , not unlike Fay Wray .
I 'll let the published accounts of the local bird cage liner complete the tale - they got pretty close to what actually happened on that sultry afternoon
Upon entering the establishment , with his gun drawn because of the possibility of armed and dangerous fugitives being present , quite the commotion broke out when Boudreaux , recognizing that johnny law was closing in , grabbed his lil ' " meat - puppet " and made a break for freedom through the kitchen area .
After eluding police in four states , Boudreaux and his man - boy - love - slave - toy were finally cornered in Gaffney , South Carolina .
After pulling over the red primer 77 Torino for a quick bite to eat , ( and some roadside relaxation ) , the car was spotted by alert Sheriff 's Deputy and erstwhile harmonica virtuoso Ralph - Bob Smith just outside the Fatz restaurant .
Sort of like Michele , I grew up living in pretty much the same place .
For her , it was the same neighborhood on Long Island .
For me , it was in a couple of houses that were only about three blocks apart from each other .
Something more defining than that was that from practically everywhere I was on a daily basis until I left to join the service , I could look up and point out one single feature .
An old fire observation tower , perched at a high point on a ridgeline overlooking the eastern end of the city of Birmingham .
I can never recall , nor can anyone I 've ever known recall a time when the tower was manned on any sort of regular basis .
It just sat there , nothing special , similar to dozens of others built at about the same time using the same specs all over the country .
But it was THE fire tower .
It was a subject of expeditions for us as kids .
It was a fixture to prove one 's bravado ( hey , we got over the fence and climbed the fire tower ) .
Sometimes I wonder that any of us that tried that stunt are still alive , considering that one summer - the summer I actually worked up the nerve to climb the structure , with it 's clearly rotting wood stair treads - from one trip to the next the flooring up in the observation box disappeared between ' completely ' - ending up as rotted chunks of wood spread around the base of the tower .
Pretty sure no one was in it when it happened ; if someone had , it would have been the kid urban legend story of , well forever - " yeah , and this kid Paul was IN it when it let go !
He bounced all the way down ! "
But the sheer unrecognized ( to most outsiders ) iconographic status of this metal framed structure is it 's most enduring value .
The sight of it has always conjured one thought in my mind , when seeing it towards the end of a trip - " Home " .
I 've even had the good fortune of spotting it while riding in an aircraft passing the Birmingham area .
This time , I arrived in the city in the wee early hours of the morning .
Coming over the hill into the suburb of Irondale , a jasminlive place where the tower is first visible on that route , I was able to make out not much more than the red warning lights that let airplanes know it 's there .
But that was enough .
I took a 3 am tour of the city - probably as good a time as any , and better than most ; for the better part of the time mine was the only car on a given street .
After a half hour or so of crisscrossing the downtown area , I headed to the northeast .
Back towards the tower .
The area around the tower was made into a nature preserve / hiking trail area many years ago - in the infancy of the project , I actually served as the very first ' caretaker ' of the Nature Center just down from the tower .
At that point , it was little more than a converted dilapidated old house that had been donated for that use , and my friends and I used it as a party headquarters during the times the Center was n't open trying to attract hikers and nature enthusiasts .
And that is where I headed .
To the Nature Center .
It 's changed considerably since then , with purpose built buildings and exhibits , a rather large parking lot where there used to be a large vegetable garden ringed with perennial kudzu , and the old dilapidated house was torn down long ago and replaced with a pavilion with picnic tables and storyboards mapping the various trails that have been established on the mountain .
There was now a gate - And a sign .
Hours : 9 am to 5 pm .
Gates close promptly at 5 !
Unfortunate that I was outside the window of banker 's hours .
Unfortunate , that is , for whoever came up with those rules , that is , if it was expected that I would abide by them .
While I can completely understand that some sort of structure needs to be in place for something that is to be used as a public livejasmin facility , and I appreciate that steps have been taken to preserve this place from those that see it merely as a passing attraction - I 'm not one of those people .
Not that I 'm better , or worse , just that the area now used as the Nature preserve is an integral part of my life .
It has always been there .
It was my playground in childhood .
Most of the things that I did as a kid are now strictly prohibited - no campfires , no firearms , no camping , etc , etc .
Which is fine by me , because if more than a handful of kids doing those sorts of things on the mountain were the norm , it would trash the place in nothing flat .
I chose to ignore the sign , with a small grin .
I parked the car down the street from the service entrance , and began the walk to the tower .
3:30 or so in the morning may seem like an odd time for a walk in the woods , but at the time , it was the thing to do .
Better that than go over to my brother 's house at a horrific hour and wake him in the middle of the night , as he did have to work the next day .
No , it was the perfect time to go to the fire tower .
I 'd camped on the mountain before - but actually not more than a handful of times .
And those adventures were usually in the company of a group of no less than five , with all the flashlights and batteries we could carry , and a roaring campfire wherever we chose to set down and battle the mosquitoes .
No one usually slept on those expeditions , everyone constantly keeping vigil for the terrible creatures we were sure lurked in the dark woods , just waiting to make a tasty snack of foolish children presenting themselves in buffet fashion .
I walked , with those memories , around the barricade gate , and up the service road to the fire tower .
As an adult , I fully realize that there are no large predators on the mountain - no bears , no cougars , no purple shaggy things that live in the abandoned iron ore mines on the far side of the ridge .
I was also aware that there was probably no good reason for anyone else to be walking about on the mountain at night .
Yet still , on the darkened path , with the small trees and undergrowth straining to fill in the empty space above the narrow paving , I found myself stopping on more than one occasion , controlling my breathing , and listening as intently as possible to hear any sign of something , or someone close by .
The woods were dark , but it was n't pitch black , and it was not dark in the sense of inducing a foreboding of evil .
In fact , as I stopped , and listened , smelled , and extended out with all my senses to gather as much as I could , it came to me that what I was sensing touched on deep memories , memories usually unrealized because of the clutter of recollections of sight .
It was familiar , soothing , and very , very peaceful .
Somewhere along the way , I settled on the idea of sitting up by the tower to catch the sunrise .
This was partly due to my exceptional math skills , and forgetting that I was now in the Central Time zone , not Eastern , and would have basically an extra hour to sit there than what I thought .
I stood about for a bit , wondering why the sky was n't beginning to lighten .
Eventually I sat down .
Finally , I reclined , laying down and looking up through the trees at the light cloud cover and the way the moon played through it .
There were many fewer bugs and things than I remember , but that may simply have been because I was tired from the long trip , or had become used to the man-eating swarms of Tidewater Virginia .
Probably the former , as the ones I did notice were not bothersome in the least .
The ground was cool , and there was a slight breeze .
It was extremely peaceful .
I could hear , better than any high end audio equipment could ever reproduce , the sounds of the city , from the valley on the one side , and the train switching yard , in the valley on the other .
Mixed with the sounds of the crickets and occasional night singing bird , the experience was incredibly relaxing .
Eventually , I nodded off into a half - waking / half - dreaming state , only startled a few times by sudden noises such as branches falling ; not immediately recognized but quickly identified and welcomed as a part of what is .
All things must come to an end , I guess , and this idyllic interlude was interrupted quite completely by what I think was a grand daddy long legs scampering up my arm as I lay there .
Yep ! hooo - kay .
I 'm up .
By then , it was close to 5:30 , and the sky had lightened enough to try and take a few photos , but it was n't quite as light as the camera needed .
Also , nature was literally beginning to call , and the prospect of leaving a present then mistaking poison oak or ivy for Charmin was a particularly unappealing thought .
Since the tower has been pressed into modern day service as a support structure for a telephone cell , I had an excellent signal as I called my brother to make sure he was up and about .
I walked back down the service road , wondering if I would encounter any of the current Nature Center employees , who would doubtlessly have no idea who I was , and what kind of episode it might cause .
Sure enough , as I stepped through the inner gate to walk past the center , someone was there just opening it up , getting it ready for the day 's activities .
My plan was to simply walk right by , like I completely belonged there , and not stop unless challenged .
It never came to that , as even though I walked within a few yards of the man , and at one point I thought he looked over in my direction , he made absolutely no indication whatsoever he was aware of my presence .
I imagine it happened because he was just there , at his j o b , not in the midst of something that was a part of him , about which he was constantly aware , immediately noting anything out of the ordinary .
His loss .

So a religious idea will be interpreted by a person in a way that fits in best with their existing psychology ?
Robin : Yes , and it can therefore support them in functioning at the best level they ’re capable of , given their limitations .
…
Well , take people functioning at the least healthy level first .
They ’ll understand religion as a collection of rules , of rewards and punishments , of threats and promises , all enfoced by a powerful and frightening God .
John :
The extreme black - and - white thinking found in young children ?
Robin :
That ’s exactly what it is .
The thinking of such people has got stuck at that level , and though it ’s normal in a very young child , it ’s obviously unhealthy in an adult .
…
John :
And how is God experienced ?
Robin :
He ’s seen as a terrifying , domineering , bad - temprered dictator , who wants everyone to spend heir time admiring him and telling him how marvellous he is .
…
So naturally people holding this view feel they have to do lots of things to keep Him sweet , so that He wo n’t get into a bad mood and blast them with thunderbolts , or boils , or rivers of blood .
p. 287
John :
Well , everything that you ’ve been saying implies that [ Fundamentalism ] is a manifestation of a fairly low level of mental health , does n’t it ?
For a start , Fundamentalists call for a literal interpretation of scripture , and as we saw when we were discussing secular values , focusing in on the letter of the law is a characteristic of the less healthy .
In addition , wise people tend not to exhibit literal mindedness , so it seems singularly inappropriate to assume that this is the vein in which great spiritual teahers are speaking .
Then again , whether we ’re talking about Christianity , Islam , Judaism or Hinduism , the values of Fundamentalists seem aimed at making themselves feel better by placing all negative and destructive emotions in people with different beliefs , and enjoying the golden glow of self - justification that results .
…
You know that simile : ‘ As rare as a Fundamentalist who loves his enemy . ’ … the Inquisition did largely miss the point of ‘ Love Thy Neighbour ’ , did n’t they ?
Was n’t burning heretics ‘ worse ’ than being tolerant towards them ? …

GASTONIA , N.C. --
Eyebrows are being raised because of a new sign along Highway 74 and a pagan group 's promise to keep the road clean .
The Silvermoon Pagan Wicca Group , through the state ’s Adopt - A - Highway program , recently sponsored the stretch of road in Gastonia .
At the head of the group is Kym Miller , a self - proclaimed witch who owns the Witch ’s Brew Cafй in Lincolnton .
" We want to be community - minded and active in the area , and we wanted to do something to help keep the area clean , ” Miller said Thursday .
But many Gastonia residents have their objections .
“ I ’m not for it if it ’s got anything to do with witchcraft , ” resident Mildred Bumgardner said .
Resident Cody Sams said , “ They should change the name or something . ”
Miller insists that her group does nothing more than cast spells and experiment with herbal magic .
“ We do n’t worship the devil , we do n’t believe in the devil , ” she said .
“ We ’re not Satanists . ”
Miller said she has been receiving death threats since her cafй opened last summer , but she hopes the highway adoption can prove to people that her group wants to make a positive impact on the community .
She said it also intends to adopt another highway in the near future .
“ So that they realize that we 're not evil people doing evil things , " she said .
Bumgardner does n’t buy it .
“ They ’re just trying to get into our communities with that type of thing , ” she said .
The North Carolina Department of Transportation said it has not received any written complaints about the Silvermoon sign .
Officials said it ’s unfair to discriminate against any group that wants to adopt a highway .
It does n’t cost any money to adopt a highway , but whoever does must pledge to clean it up at least a couple of times a year .
The Transportation Department said the program saves taxpayers $ 4 million a year in cleanup costs .

Andrew Chamberlain & Gerald Prante have posted Who Pays Taxes and Who Receives Government Spending ?
An Analysis of Federal , State and Local Tax and Spending Distributions , 1991 - 2004 on the Tax Foundation web site .
Here is the abstract :
While the U.S. tax system is progressive , the distribution of government spending makes the overall fiscal system much more progressive than is apparent from tax distributions alone .
Using a microdata model we estimate the distribution of federal , state and local taxes and spending between 1991 and 2004 .
We find households in the lowest quintile of income received roughly $ 8.21 in federal , state and local government spending for every dollar of taxes paid in 2004 , while households in the middle quintile received $ 1.30 , and households in the top quintile received $ 0.41 .
Overall , tax payments exceeded government spending received for the top two quintiles of income , resulting in a net fiscal transfer of between $ 1.031 trillion and $ 1.527 trillion between quintiles .
Both taxes and spending appear to have large distributional effects on households , and these effects have grown since 1991 .
The results suggest tax distributions alone are an inadequate measure of progressivity , and policymakers should examine both tax and spending distributions when judging the overall fairness of policy toward income groups .
There also is a shorter version , with executive summary , for nontax specialists .
Here are three of the many interesting charts and tables in the 121 - page paper :

If it ’s too loud , you ’re too young
Dig this :
A Welsh inventor has created a device intended to shoo teenagers from hanging out near your house or store — by emitting an annoying sound so high - pitched that adults cannot hear it .
The inventor , Howard Stapleton , got the idea by recalling a time when he was 12 and visited a factory with his father ; the sound of high - frequency welding equipment totally annoyed him , but his father could n’t perceive it .
This , he later realized , is because of a physiological quirk of aging : Children can hear higher frequencies than adults .
Stapleton began experimenting , trying to find the acoustic sweet spot — the precise frequency that will annoy the heck outta the kidz yet remain undetected by the middle - aged .
There ’s a terrific story in today ’s New York Times about it :
Using his children as guinea pigs , he tried a number of different noise and frequency levels , testing a single - toned unit before settling on a pulsating tone which , he said , is more unbearable , and which can be broadcast at 75 decibels , within government auditory - safety limits .
“ I did n’t want to make it hurt , ” Mr. Stapleton said .
“ It just has to nag at them . ”
Apparently the noise sounds like “ pulsating chirp ” reminiscent of tinnitus .
The Mosquito has only been tested in one convenience store in South Wales , but hey presto , as soon as it was turned on the teenagers fled .
As for the science behind all this ?
It ’s certainly true that hearing sensitivity declines with aging — the technical term is presbycusis — but it ’s hardly a linear process .
The danger is that many older folks could hear the noise ( indeed , one 34 - year - old who visited the convenience store could ) .
But the overall concept is pretty hilarious .
That ’s a picture of Stapleton above , by the way , from the Times story .

When thinking about what happens to society during a difficult time of some kind , one of the sharpest delineators between pessimists and optimists is their belief about the role of innovation .
The optimists tend to assume that the can - do creative spirit of humanity will , always and everywhere , solve all problems , and thus the future will be ever brighter and brighter , with the possible exception of some brief and localized problems which will only serve to spur further innovation .
The pessimists tend to assume that human innovation either a ) does n't occur at all , or b ) generally makes things worse if it does .
I 'm not quite sure where I fall on this spectrum yet , but it seems to me that , one way or another , as a society we are about to have a hard time here .
Between the housing credit implosion , declines in Saudi oil production , the unknown but great damage that the Bush administration has done to the always fragile political arrangements in the economically critical Middle East , and monster hurricanes stomping on our cities , it 's hard not to feel that the next decade is going to be one of the less fun ones in the historical record .
I 'm not going to commit myself on exactly how low the fun quotient is going to get - I really have no idea - but I 'm sure not feeling good about the near to middle distance .
So it seems worth exploring further this question of the relationship between innovation and " hard times " of one kind and another .
I am by no means an expert on either the history of innovation , or the economics of innovation , and one of the things I am hoping is to get links to the right things to read by those people who are such experts .
However , I do have some perspective , as I have spent my working life in one way or another in " the innovation sector " ; I have done stints in university research , venture capital funded startups , and also have some experience consulting on patent litigation .
So I have a working knowledge of the way the US 's formal institutions for innovation operate ( and of course you could certainly argue that I have a vested interest in seeing them continue to operate ) .
Let me try to delineate the opposite ends of the spectrum on this question , starting with the pessimists .
One of the people who has been most effective in getting people to at least think about the various crises facing society is Jim Kunstler whose pithy writing I envy every Monday morning .
As far as I can tell , Kunstler does n't think that innovation can play a significant role in solving society 's problems , and is generally in favor of not doing further innovation on the technologies most important to society today , and instead wants to more - or - less roll back the various inventions of the 20th century , especially their impact on society , and roughly return to the 19th century :
We have to produce food differently .
The ADM / Monsanto / Cargill model of industrial agribusiness is heading toward its Waterloo .
As oil and gas deplete , we will be left with sterile soils and farming organized at an unworkable scale .
Many lives will depend on our ability to fix this .
Farming will soon return much closer to the center of American economic life .
It will necessarily have to be done more locally , at a smaller - and - finer scale , and will require more human labor .
The value - added activities associated with farming -- e.g. making products like cheese , wine , oils -- will also have to be done much more locally .
This situation presents excellent business and vocational opportunities for America 's young people ( if they can unplug their Ipods long enough to pay attention . )
It also presents huge problems in land - use reform .
Not to mention the fact that the knowledge and skill for doing these things has to be painstakingly retrieved from the dumpster of history .
Get busy .
We have to inhabit the terrain differently .
Virtually every place in our nation organized for car dependency is going to fail to some degree .
Quite a few places ( Phoenix , Las Vegas , Miami .... ) will support only a fraction of their current populations .
We 'll have to return to traditional human ecologies at a smaller scale : villages , towns , and cities ( along with a productive rural landscape ) .
Our small towns are waiting to be reinhabited .
Our cities will have to contract .
The cities that are composed proportionately more of suburban fabric ( e.g. Atlanta , Houston ) will pose especially tough problems .
Most of that stuff will not be fixed .
The loss of monetary value in suburban property will have far - reaching ramifications .
The stuff we build in the decades ahead will have to be made of regional materials found in nature -- as opposed to modular , snap - together , manufactured components -- at a more modest scale .
This whole process will entail enormous demographic shifts and is liable to be turbulent .
Like farming , it will require the retrieval of skill - sets and methodologies that have been forsaken .
The graduate schools of architecture are still tragically preoccupied with teaching Narcissism .
The faculties will have to be overthrown .
Our attitudes about land - use will have to change dramatically .
The building codes and zoning laws will eventually be abandoned and will have to be replaced with vernacular wisdom .
Get busy .
We have to move things and people differently .
This is the sunset of Happy Motoring ( including the entire US trucking system ) .
Get used to it .
Do n't waste your society 's remaining resources trying to prop up car - and - truck dependency .
Moving things and people by water and rail is vastly more energy - efficient .
Need something to do ?
Get involved in restoring public transit .
Let 's start with railroads , and let 's make sure we electrify them so they will run on things other than fossil fuel or , if we have to run them partly on coal - fired power plants , at least scrub the emissions and sequester the CO2 at as few source - points as possible .
We also have to prepare our society for moving people and things much more by water .
This implies the rebuilding of infrastructure for our harbors , and also for our inland river and canal systems -- including the towns associated with them .
The great harbor towns , like Baltimore , Boston , and New York , can no longer devote their waterfronts to condo sites and bikeways .
We actually have to put the piers and warehouses back in place ( not to mention the sleazy accommodations for sailors ) .
Right now , programs are underway to restore maritime shipping based on wind -- yes , sailing ships .
It 's for real .
Lots to do here .
Put down your Ipod and get busy .
Another contemporary pessimist is John Michael Greer , who operates under the title of " The Grand Archdruid of the Ancient Order of Druids in America " .
Many of you may wonder how on earth an Archdruid passed my initial credibility filters , but actually I read his blog avidly every week and consider him one of the most stimulating social critics I know of .
Even though I often do n't agree with him , I think he 's worth the weight of ten more conventional religious leaders .
And perhaps , like the Lorax , he speaks for an awful lot of trees , if not that many Druids .
Greer thinks that industrial society is pretty much fucked and there 's nothing any of us can do .
However , he believes we are likely to collapse back into a pre-industrial condition gradually over a period of a couple of centuries .
His argument is mainly historical :
Like modern industrial society , the Maya built their civilization on a nonrenewable resource base .
In their case it was the fertility of fragile tropical soils , which could n't support intensive corn farming forever .
On that shaky foundation they built an extraordinary civilization with fine art , architecture , astronomy , mathematics , and a calendar more accurate than the one we use today .
None of that counted when the crops began to fail .
Mayan civilization disintegrated , cities were abandoned to the jungle , and the population of the Mayan heartland dropped by 90 % .
The parallels go deeper , for the Maya had other options .
They could have switched from corn to more sustainable crops such as ramon nuts , or borrowed intensive wetland farming methods from their neighbors to the north .
Neither of these happened , because corn farming was central to Maya political ideology .
The power of the ahauob or " divine lords " who ruled Maya city - states depended on control of the corn crop , so switching crops or farming systems was unthinkable .
Instead , Maya elites responded to crisis by launching wars to seize fields and corn from other city - states , making their decline and fall far more brutal than it had to be .
Even so , the Maya decline was n't a fast process .
Maya cities were n't abandoned overnight , as archeologists of two generations ago mistakenly thought , but went under in a " rolling collapse " spread across a century and a half from 750 to 900 .
Outside the Maya heartland , the process took even longer .
Chichen Itza far to the north still flourished long after cities such as Tikal and Bonampak were overgrown ruins , and Mayan city - states on a small scale survived in corners of the Yucatan right up to the Spanish conquest .
Map the Maya collapse onto human lifespans and the real scale of the process comes through .
A Maya woman born around 730 would have seen the crisis dawn , but the ahauob and their cities still flourished when she died of old age seventy years later .
Her great - grandson , born around 800 , grew up amid a disintegrating society , and the wars and crop failures of his time would have seemed ordinary to him .
His great - granddaughter , born around 870 , never knew anything but ruins sinking back into the jungle .
When she and her family finally set out for a distant village , the last to leave their empty city , it would never have occurred to her that her quiet footsteps on a dirt path marked the end of a civilization .
This same pattern repeats over and over again in history .
Gradual disintegration , not sudden catastrophic collapse , is the way civilizations end .
It usually takes somewhere between 150 and 350 years for a civilization to decline and fall .
This casts a startling light on today 's crisis .
It took America two centuries of incremental change to transform itself from an agrarian society to its current status as an aging industrial behemoth .
Now , with its resource base failing , it faces the common fate of civilizations .
Yet if that fate follows its usual timeline , it could easily take two more centuries of incremental change to transform America to an agrarian society again .
And on technology , his view is that our main job now is to figure out which ones we can salvage :
One of the most widely cited apocalyptic writers of my teen years , Roberto Vacca , argued in his book The Coming Dark Age that this extreme interdependence would prove to be the Achilles ’ heel of industrial society .
His argument that too much interconnection among unstable systems would lead to cascading systems failures and the collapse of industrial civilization impressed the likes of Isaac Asimov , who contributed an introduction to the book .
In retrospect , it proved to be embarrassingly wrong .
Like so many others at that time , Vacca put the cart before the horse ; the rising tide of interdependence and interconnection he saw moving through the industrial world was a reaction to improvements in information processing , not a force in its own right , and further developments along the same lines – especially the explosive growth in computer technology – proved more than adequate to keep the process moving .
Still , Vacca was right to see the web of interconnections that unites today ’s industrial technology as a critical vulnerability .
It ’s just that the vulnerability comes into play further along the arc of catabolic collapse .
Many of today ’s technologies depend so completely on the support of an intact industrial system that they cannot operate without it .
Many more could operate without it , at least in theory , but have been designed in a way that maximizes their dependence on other technologies and will have to be reengineered in a hurry as the fabric of the industrial system comes apart .
A final set of technologies are largely or wholly independent of the system and can be expected to carry on without a hitch while industrial society comes apart around them .
These three classes have an uncomfortable similarity to the three categories used by battlefield medics in the process known as triage .
Triage — the word comes from French and means “ trying ” or “ testing ” – is a care - rationing process used when the number of wounded overwhelms the people and resources available to treat them .
Incoming wounded are sorted out into three classes .
The first consists of those who will die even if they get care .
The second consists of those who will survive even if they receive no care .
The third consists of those who will live if they get help but will die without it .
In a triage situation , all available resources go to the third category .
When the need for care outruns the available time and resources , this harsh but necessary logic maximizes the number of survivors .
The coming of deindustrial society will require us to approach technology in much the same way .
Technological triage requires more complex judgments than the battlefield variety , however .
Not all technologies are of equal value for human survival ; it wo n’t do us any good to preserve video game technology , let ’s say , if by doing so we lose the ability to grow food .
Some technologies necessarily depend on other technologies — firearms , for example , presuppose a certain level of metalworking ability .
Finally , technological triage involves four categories , not three .
Alongside technologies that ca n’t be saved no matter what we do , technologies that are certain to be saved even if we do nothing , and technologies that will be saved if we act and lost if we do not , there are technologies that have gone out of existence but could be brought back and put into use if action is taken now .
People have since antiquity worried about running out of natural resources -- flint , game animals , what - have - you .
Yet , amazingly , all the historical evidence shows that raw materials -- all of them -- have become less scarce rather than more .
It is beyond any doubt that natural resource scarcity -- as measured by the economically meaningful indicator of cost or price -- has been decreasing rather than increasing in the long run for all raw materials , with only temporary and local exceptions .
And there is no reason why this trend should not continue forever .
The trend toward greater availability includes the most counterintuitive case of all - - oil .
Food is an especially important resource .
The evidence is particularly strong that the trend in nutrition is benign despite rising population .
The long - run price of food is down sharply , even relative to consumer products , as a result of increased productivity .
And per person food consumption is up over the last 30 years .
The increase of height in the West is another mark of improved nutrition .
( Africa 's food production per person is down , but in the 1990s , few people any longer claim that Africa 's suffering has anything to do with a shortage of land or water or sun .
Hunger in Africa clearly stems from civil wars and government interference with agriculture , which periodic droughts have made more murderous . )
Only one important resource has shown a trend of increasing scarcity rather than increasing abundance .
It is the most important and valuable resource of all - - human beings .
Certainly , there are more people on earth now than ever before .
But if we measure the scarcity of people the same way that we measure the scarcity of other economic goods -- by how much we must pay to obtain their services -- we see that wages and salaries have been going up all over the world , in poor countries as well as in rich countries .
The amount that one must pay to obtain the services of a barber or a professor has risen in India , just as the price of a barber or professor has risen in the United States over the decades .
That increase in the price of people 's services is a clear indication that people are becoming more scarce even though there are more of us .
Moving now to the optimists , the quintissential cornucopian was the late Professor Julian Simon , an economist whose book The Ultimate Resource 2 is must reading for anyone wanting to understand both sides of the debate .
Essentially , Simon had the view that the condition of humanity had always improved everywhere , taken over any length of time , and that it always would in the future too .
( Strangely enough , he did n't look at the Mayan's :-)
To get a feeling for his thought , take this Cato institute essay
And he viewed innovation as the central fount from which this bounty sprouted :
How can it be that economic welfare grows over time along with population , instead of humanity 's being reduced to misery and poverty as population grows and we use more and more resources ?
We need some theory to explain this controversion of common sense .
The process operates as follows :
More people and increased income cause problems in the short run-- shortages and pollutions .
Short - run scarcity raises prices and pollution causes outcries .
Those problems present opportunity and prompt the search for solutions .
In a free society solutions are eventually found , though many people seek and fail to find solutions at cost to themselves .
In the long run the new developments leave us better off than if the problems had not arisen .
This theory fits the facts of history .
Technology exists now to produce in virtually inexhaustible quantities just about all the products made by nature -- foodstuffs , oil , even pearls and diamonds -- and make them cheaper in most cases than the cost of gathering them in their natural state .
And the standard of living of commoners is higher today than that of royalty only two centuries ago -- especially their health and life expectancy , and their mobility to all parts of the world .
The extent to which the political - social - economic system provides personal freedom from government coercion is a crucial element in the economics of resources and population .
Skilled persons require an appropriate social and economic framework that provides incentives for working hard and taking risks , enabling their talents to flower and come to fruition .
The key elements of such a framework are economic liberty , respect for property , and fair and sensible rules of the market that are enforced equally for all .
To prove that not all cornucopians are economists , we can look at the case of Ray Kurzweil , a well - known computer visionary who believes that the rate of technological progress , which he views essentially as an extension of biological evolution by other means , has been accelerating at ever greater rates since the Cambrian .
His book The Singularity is Near is also a must read for a well - rounded view of the subject .
But he lays out his basic thesis here .
Consider that the price - performance of computation has grown at a superexponential rate for over a century .
The doubling time ( of computes per dollar ) was three years in 1900 and two years in the middle of the 20th century ; and price - performance is now doubling each year .
This progression has been remarkably smooth and predictable through five paradigms of computing substrate : electromechanical calculators , relay - based computers , vacuum tubes , transistors , and now several decades of Moore ’s Law ( which is based on shrinking the size of key features on a flat integrated circuit ) .
The sixth paradigm — three - dimensional molecular computing — is already beginning to work and is waiting in the wings .
We see similar smooth exponential progressions in every other aspect of information technology , a phenomenon I call the law of accelerating returns .
Where is all this headed ?
It is leading inexorably to the intelligent universe that Jim Gardner envisions .
Consider the following :
As with all of the other manifestations of information technology , we are also making exponential gains in reverse - engineering the human brain .
The spatial resolution in 3D volume of in - vivo brain scanning is doubling each year , and the latest generation of scanners is capable of imaging individual interneuronal connections and seeing them interact in real time .
For the first time , we can see the brain create our thoughts , and also see our thoughts create our brain ( that is , we create new spines and synapses as we learn ) .
The amount of data we are gathering about the brain is doubling each year , and we are showing that we can turn this data into working models and simulations .
Already , about 20 regions of the human brain have been modeled and simulated .
We can then apply tests to the simulations and compare these results to the performance of the actual human brain regions .
These tests have had impressive results , including one of a simulation of the cerebellum , the region responsible for physical skill , and which comprises about half of the neurons in the brain .
I make the case in my book ( The Singularity is Near ) that we will have models and simulations of all several hundred regions , including the cerebral cortex , within 20 years .
Already , IBM is building a detailed simulation of a substantial portion of the cerebral cortex .
The result of this activity will be greater insight into ourselves , as well as a dramatic expansion of the AI tool kit to incorporate all of the methods of human intelligence .
By 2029 , sufficient computation to simulate the entire human brain , which I estimate at about 1016 ( 10 million billion ) calculations per second ( cps ) , will cost about a dollar .
By that time , intelligent machines will combine the subtle and supple skills that humans now excel in ( essentially our powers of pattern recognition ) with ways in which machines are already superior , such as remembering trillions of facts accurately , searching quickly through vast databases , and downloading skills and knowledge .
But this will not be an alien invasion of intelligent machines .
It will be an expression of our own civilization , as we have always used our technology to extend our physical and mental reach .
We will merge with this technology by sending intelligent nanobots ( blood - cell - sized computerized robots ) into our brains through the capillaries to intimately interact with our biological neurons .
If this scenario sounds very futuristic , I would point out that we already have blood - cell - sized devices that are performing sophisticated therapeutic functions in animals , such as curing Type I diabetes and identifying and destroying cancer cells .
We already have a pea-sized device approved for human use that can be placed in patients ’ brains to replace the biological neurons destroyed by Parkinson ’s disease , the latest generation of which allows you to download new software to your neural implant from outside the patient .
If you consider what machines are already capable of , and apply a billion - fold increase in price - performance and capacity of computational technology over the next quarter century ( while at the same time we shrink the key features of both electronic and mechanical technology by a factor of 100,000 ) , you will get some idea of what will be feasible in 25 years .
By the mid-2040s , the nonbiological portion of the intelligence of our humanmachine civilization will be about a billion times greater than the biological portion ( we have about 1026 cps among all human brains today ; nonbiological intelligence in 2045 will provide about 1035 cps ) .
Keep in mind that , as this happens , our civilization will be become capable of performing more ambitious engineering projects .
One of these projects will be to keep this exponential growth of computation going .
Another will be to continually redesign the source code of our own intelligence .
We cannot easily redesign human intelligence today , given that our biological intelligence is largely hard - wired .
But our future — largely nonbiological — intelligence will be able to apply its own intelligence to redesign its own algorithms .
So what are the limits of computation ?
I show in my book that the ultimate one - kilogram computer ( less than the weight of a typical notebook computer today ) could perform about 1042 cps if we want to keep the device cool , and about 1050 cps if we allow it to get hot .
By hot , I mean the temperature of a hydrogen bomb going off , so we are likely to asymptote to a figure just short of 1050 cps .
Consider , however , that by the time we get to 1042 cps per kilogram of matter , our civilization will possess a vast amount of intelligent engineering capability to figure out how to get to 1043 cps , and then 1044 cps , and so on .
So what happens then ?
Once we saturate the ability of matter and energy to support computation , continuing the ongoing expansion of human intelligence and knowledge ( which I see as the overall mission of our human - machine civilization ) , will require converting more and more matter into this ultimate computing substrate , sometimes referred to as “ computronium . ”
What is that limit ?
The overall solar system , which is dominated by the sun , has a mass of about 2 × 1030 kilograms .
If we apply our 1050 cps per kilogram limit to this figure , we get a crude estimate of 1080 cps for the computational capacity of our solar system .
There are some practical considerations here , in that we wo n’t want to convert the entire solar system into computronium , and some of it is not suitable for this purpose anyway .
If we devoted 1/20th of 1 percent ( .0005 ) of the matter of the solar system to computronium , we get capacities of 1069 cps for “ cold ” computing and 1077 cps for “ hot ” computing .
I show in my book how we will get to these levels using the resources in our solar system within about a century .
About now , you may be thinking that the Archdruid sounds like a sane and moderate individual .
And if I tell you that Kurzweil takes 250 different supplements daily because he 's trying to keep his 56 year old body around long enough to become immortal when the technology become available in a couple of decades , you might really start to wonder .
But there 's no question that he has an enviable track record as an inventor , and is a frequent headline speaker where computer scientists congregate .
So what to think ?
The truth lies in the middle somewhere ?
For myself , I try to go where the data lead , and follow them whether they go left , right , or up the center of the garden path .
As a first cut at looking at the question of how much innovation happens in crises , I started by looking at the number of patents on inventions issued by the US patent office .
Admittedly , this is a crude metric .
Patents vary in quality and significance , and those variations may have trends not captured by the sheer quantity .
Also , the things that the patents are about very likely vary over time , and those variations could be highly significant .
Still , it 's a place to start and reveals some interesting things , I think :
Utility Patents granted each year by the US Patent Office , with certain historical events added as annotations .
I think one could draw some support for both sides of the argument here .
On the one hand , it 's quite clear that the level of innovation goes down when society comes under stress .
I have pointed to a few of the more prominent drops in the curve .
So , presumably there is some level of societal stress so great that society 's innovative institutions would cease to function .
The worst case in the record was the combination of the depression in the 30s and WWII , which between them caused a roughly 60 % drop in the rate of patent applications .
The seventies oil shocks were around a 35 % reduction , and the US civil war about a 25 % reduction .
So far , the post 2000 tech crash is about a 15 % event , but one wonders what a housing crash and peak oil are going to add onto that in coming years ( possibly after some intervening rebound - the application rate started shooting up again in 2005 , but it often takes 2 - 4 years for an application to turn into a patent , if it is going to ) .
On the other hand , nothing in the last 200 years has been nearly enough to cause the patent application rate to drop to zero .
And it seems likely that particularly relevant technologies may be invented in those eras of low overall patent productivity - one thinks of radar , jet engines , and nuclear power during WWII .
I think there is also some support in the data for Professor Simon 's idea that following a crisis , the innovation rate increases .
Indeed , I have to say that the overall rate of patent applications looks somewhat super - exponential , as Kurzweil would argue it should be .
If we look just at the periods between crises , the interval from 1865 to 1932 had a combined annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 3.29 % / yr .
Then from 1947 to 1974 , the CAGR was 5.06 % / yr , but it increased further to 5.6 % between 1983 and 2003 .
That seems like evidence for a non -linear positive feedback loop .
But on the third hand , I am a lot less sanguine than Kurzweil that runaway positive feedback processes usually end well .
Anyone who 's been following the US housing market for the last few years , and especially the last few weeks , knows exactly what I mean .
On the fourth hand , I think those who want to argue that innovation will cease need to explain in far more detail why the institutions for it will stop operating .
The Mayans did n't have venture capitalists , or patent offices , or universities , as far as we know .
As we speak , those institutions are rapidly reorienting themselves towards our energy and climate problems :
Out of the ashes of the Internet bust , many technology veterans have regrouped and found a new mission in alternative energy : developing wind power , solar panels , ethanol plants and hydrogen - powered cars .
It is no secret that venture capitalists have begun pouring billions into energy - related start - ups with names like SunPower , Nanosolar and Lilliputian Systems .
But that interest is now spilling over to many others in Silicon Valley — lawyers , accountants , recruiters and publicists , all developing energy - oriented practices to cater to the cause .
The best and the brightest from leading business schools are pelting energy start - ups with résumés .
And , of course , there are entrepreneurs from all backgrounds — but especially former dot - commers — who express a sense of wonder and purpose at the thought of transforming the $ 1 trillion domestic energy market while saving the planet .
“ It ’s like 1996 , ” said Andrew Beebe , one of the remade Internet entrepreneurs .
In the boom , he ran Bigstep.com , which helped small businesses sell online .
Today , he is president of Energy Innovations , which makes low - cost solar panels .
“ The Valley has found a new hot spot . ”
I think a realistic argument that innovation will not be an enormous factor in our response to the crises we face needs to come to grips with the institutional differences between us and earlier societies .

I will come clean here : when I think of OO , I am not thinking of C++ or Java , especially as they are practised in business .
I ’m thinking of languages like Self , Actor , and Smalltalk .
It ’s interesting how the brain works : I wrote an essay that I thought was an explanation of what first class functions and closures are , and why some people would like to see them added to the Kitchen Sink of Languages
Then I read From Functional to Object - Oriented Programming , which suggests that my essay seems to be making a general statement about Functional Programming as an advance over Object Oriented Programming .
Nothing could be further from my intention or my opinion .
Smalltalk , for example , has a clean and powerful syntax for first - class functions .
And those first - class functions are objects , as is everything in Smalltalk .
I am tempted to rewrite my essay using Smalltalk : it seems that using Ruby , another language where everything is an object , is not making this point strongly enough .
In my mind , it is easy to use languages that provide the OO paradigm as well as the first - class function paradigm .
At the same time .
So what I actually said is : “ Here are these things called first - class functions .
This “ thing ” is where functions are exactly the same kind of thing as everything else in a language .
This is useful , here is why . ”
If functions are first class , functions are n’t magically more special , nor are they second - class citizens in a language ( like those brain - damaged primitives in crippled languages ) .
If a language is an OO language , this implies that first - class functions in such a language are objects and that programming with them is OO programming .
You ’ll notice that I am not using the words “ Functional Programming . ”
That ’s because .
I ’m talking about closures and first - class functions .
I imagine that these things are present in all contemporary Functional Programming Languages , but that has nothing to do with my essay about the value of having first - class functions in an OO language : Smalltalk has had them in an OO language for nearly thirty years , and while it was n’t the first OO language , it is the canonical definition of class - based OO .
That ’s all I said .
If you want to debate the merits of pure functional programming languages like Haskell against OO languages like Ruby , you have to take that up with someone like Tom or Eric I do n’t understand the author ’s objection to higher - order functional programming .
He ( ? ) says something about higher - order functions and type inference as being bad .
I do n’t get the argument .
It seems like he is saying that the constructs are somehow too deeply nested , that it is too easy to make mistakes .
I may not understand him correctly , for I have trouble seeing how this is different from having data structures with a thicket of HAS - A relationships .
Somehow we program just fine in business with complex data schema , and we manage to keep track of things just fine .
Strong typing and compiler support helps .
So does IDE support .
So does drawing diagrams .
How is “ a function taking an integer and a function taking two integers , returning a function taking a list of integers and returning an integer ” somehow more complex than “ a record containing an integer and that has many records containing an integer ” ?
The argument seems to be ( and I am open to correction , since what I think he ’s saying is so obvious that I worry I ’m misunderstanding it ) that naming things makes all the difference , as in “ a customer record with an ID has many Sales Records , each of which has an ID . ”
That does sound easier to understand .
But of course , nothing stops you from naming things if you have first - class functions in a type checked OO language , does it ?
I am not a practitioner , but I have been working my way through The Little MLer , and it is part of the ML programming paradigm to name first - class functional types for precisely the reasons the author seems to advocate .
So perhaps the objection is to having too many anonymous things , to having too many values without names .
There is certainly an appropriate balance to be sought .
One language designer seems to dislike anonymous functions , to the point where his language wo n’t let you have any that wo n’t fit on a single line .
He has an opinionated language .
I have seen similar arguments with non-functions .
That control flow branches should not be nested too deeply ( you know , andand the evil ternary operator ) .
I often use the “ extract variable ” refactoring to simplify expressions and make them more readable .
Naming a part of an expression provides a certain level of abstraction that improves comprehension .
Types and expressions involving functions are no different , and if that ’s what the author is saying I endorse his perspective .
That statement , however , is somewhat orthogonal to whether first - class functions should exist in a language .
As long as you can name them , you have the tool to write comprehensible code .
If your language has types , then you ought to be able to name types involving first - class functions .
As long as you can name functional values and types , you can apply all the same style guidelines to first - class functions that you apply to record types .
First - class functions are a natural fit with OO , as evidenced by their presence in OO languages that are n’t glorified PDP - 11 assemblers with some OO stuff bolted on the side by people with very little OO and / or GUI programming experience .
First - class functions can be used to write clean and legible code , using all of the same techniques we use for writing clean and legible code with records , objects , and other types .
From Functional to Object - Oriented Programming has some interesting points about FP and OOP and their historical context .
This has nothing to do with my original post , but I think those words are worth reading and considering .
The post raises some caveats about complex and anonymous first - class functions that are obviously sensible : we have noticed the same things with other forms of expression in programming .

In a cringe - inducing Orwellian moment , John Gibson conveniently rewrote history last night in a mere 180 seconds .
According to Gibson 's narrative , the motive behind the Plame outing was simple : Cheney and Libby were benignly trying to defend themselves against the factually inaccurate charge that they had initiated the CIA inquiry into Niger .
In " fact , " it was the all - powerful Valerie Plame who overrode senior CIA officials and demanded her husband be sent .
Furthermore , it was all a carefully crafted conspiracy by the " anti-war activist " Wilsons and CIA " cabal " that was hellbent on " sabotaging " President Bush 's carefully treaded march to war .

" So why would Cheney send an anti-war activist to investigate a key fact in the decision to go to war ?
Answer :
He would n't .
And the person who did was trying to sabotage the president .
Got that ?
Cheney & Libby = Exonerated .
CIA & The Wilsons = Guilty .
Case closed .
Note the hilarious on - screen graphics as the fairytale goes along .
As a smart man once said : Everyone is entitled to their own opinion .
They are not , however , entitled to their own facts .
FOXNews.com has the historically updated transcript in case you can't bear to watch John Gibson propagandize .
So let me get this straight : Scooter Libby is going to jail for not remembering who he told what .
He did n't lie , evidently .
He did n't remember right , and that is a federal crime , of course , if you happen to be speaking to a FBI agent when your memory fails .
But at the same time , the same Justice Department has taken the case of a high government official who lied , who stole classified documents , who destroyed those documents , and he 's walking around free as a bird .
They wo n't even ask him to take a lie detector test to determine if he lied more than they already know .
People are saying the Libby trial is the key to the kingdom , that it stands for the trial of the entire administration and the war in Iraq .
Here 's what it was about :
Does the vice president have the right to say , see that guy named Joe Wilson who is going around saying I sent him to Africa to investigate Saddam 's nuke bombs ?
I did n't send him .
His wife did .
Seems pretty simple to me .
Joe Wilson wrote a piece for The New York Times implying the vice president sent him on a mission to Africa and then ignored his advice .
In the vice president 's office the question was :
Who is this guy ?
Why is he saying we sent him , and as a matter of fact who did ?
Let me quote from an Associated Press report from the trial , dated January 24 , 2007 , when former CIA Iraq mission manager Robert L. Grenier appeared as a government witness in the trial of Libby .
The report reads : Grenier testified he told Libby that the idea of sending ex-Ambassador Joseph Wilson to Niger was the brainchild of Wilson 's wife , Valerie Plame , who worked in the CIA office that sent him in 2002 .
Now , Libby was informed who sent Wilson to Africa .
He certainly knew the vice president 's office did n't because , well , because he would know .
He was the V.P. 's chief of staff .
So the vice president and Libby wanted the press to know because they were getting pointed questions about why did you send this guy if you were n't going to pay attention to his report .
And they found out that his wife had sent him .
They wanted people to know .
Problem was , she was a covert spook , at least technically .
So if you are the vice president or his assistant , can you out the spook if the spook is pulling strings behind your back to make you look bad ?
Evidently not .
Personally , I 'm glad they did .
There was a cabal inside the CIA working against the president 's policy and they wanted to hide behind their secret status while they did what was essentially an anti-war political hitjob .
This is bad .
It is the bad thing at the bottom of this whole episode .
Valerie Plame knew what she was doing when she sent her husband .
She knew he would never come back with an endorsement for the war .
He says in his own book he did n't even believe in deposing Saddam back in the ' 91 war .
So why would Cheney send an anti-war activist to investigate a key fact in the decision to go to war ?
Answer :
He would n't .
And the person who did was trying to sabotage the president .
That is the real story behind this entire saga .
Programming Knowledge versus Programming Ability May 16 , 2007
Posted by Imran Ghory in Uncategorized
For some reason the single most common type of question on “ programming language ” exams seems to be of the form :
Which of the following are invalid variable names in Java ?
$ char 1MyNumber case _int ( paraphrased from SCJP Exam for J2SE )
Imagine what a similar question might be in a football test :
Which of the following would result in a direct free kick to the opposing team ?
attempts to kick an opponent
attempts to trip an opponent
attempts to jump at an opponent
attempts to spit at an opponent ( paraphrased from the FIFA rules )
While it might be slightly useful for someone playing football to be able to answer the above correctly , the entire concept of trying to measure someone ’s ability by measuring their knowledge is fundamentally flawed .
And that ’s the fundamental problem with question posed above , as well as with programming exams in general .
There seems to be a popular misconception that if a software developer knows a lot about programming then it follows that they ’re a good developer .
Returning to the football analogy imagine you were back at school picking players for your team .
Who gets picked first :
The kids who are athletic and good at football
The kids who are athletic and can make a good run down the pitch , even if they ’re football specific skills are n’t that great .
The kids who are n’t athletic but know how to play football
The kids who are n’t athletic and know nothing about football
If you had to pick a team now , made out of players you did n’t know anything about .
how would you pick – would you give them all an exam about football rules and theory or would you have them run around the pitch kicking a ball ?
Hopefully most people will pick the second option and end up with a team that can actually play football well .
However in the software profession there seems to be a sizable contingent of developers who hold the view that if someone knows a lot about programming then they ’re a good programmer .
But it ’s not just the pro-certification lobby who think like this , to take another example from a blog I read last month :
I do n’t do well in programming tasks during interviews , and I ’ve love someone to come into my comments and tell me I can’t program based on this event .
No , I ’ve only faked it while working for Nike , Intel , Boeing , John Hancock , Lawrence Livermore , and through 14 or so books –not to mention 6 years of online tech weblogging .
( from here , apologies to Shelley Powers for picking on her blog , but it ’s one of the more eloquent blog posts on this topic that stuck in my mind , hence me quoting it ) .
Note that everything in that paragraph was about knowledge rather than ability .
I ’ve seen the CV’s of some vastly incompetent programmers who I ’ve known and they ’ve had phrases on their CV along the lines of “ was involved in project X at big company Y ” , when in actuality they were relegated to writing test scripts .
Yet they could perfectly well talk about the project , what the development steps were , what the problems encountered were , how the team solved them , etc .
These are all knowledge questions , not ability questions .
Similarly writing a book speaks about your knowledge of a language , not your ability as a programmer .
Consider the following quote , would you want to work with this developer on a C++ project :
I have not written production software in over 20 years , and I have never written production software in C ++.
Nope , not ever .
Furthermore , I ’ve never even tried to write production software in C++ , so not only am I not a real C++ developer , I ’m not even a wannabe .
If you had n’t already guessed – that quote is from Scott Meyers ( one of the worlds most respected C++ authors ) .
Not that I doubt Scott ’s programming ability ; but hopefully it does show that knowledge does n’t necessarily mean experience .
So next time you ’re trying to work out if someone ’s a superstar coder , pause for a moment and make sure you ’re considering both their programming knowledge and their programming ability , and not letting one substitute for the other .
" The central approach of the class is simply to study the Bible as a foundation document of society , and that approach is altogether appropriate in a comprehensive program of secular education , " it says .
Elizabeth Ridenour , a commercial real estate broker who said she formed the nonprofit organization in 1993 after deciding that she had long been " duped " into believing the Bible could not be taught in public schools , said the course has stayed within legal limits .
" Our teachers are not to say , ' This is the truth , ' or that the Bible is infallible , " she said .
" They are to say , ' This is what the Bible says ; draw your own conclusions . " '
But in Odessa , where the school board has not decided on a curriculum , a parent said he found the course 's syllabus unacceptably sectarian .
He has been waging his own campaign for additional information on where it is being taught .
" Someone is being disingenuous ; I 'd like to know who , " said the parent , David Newman , an associate professor of English at Odessa College who has made a page - by - page analysis of the 270 - page syllabus and sent e-mail messages to nearly all 1,034 school districts in Texas .
The Texas Freedom Network , which commissioned its study after the vote in Odessa , is sharp in its criticism .
" As many as 52 Texas public school districts and 1,000 high schools across the country are using an aggressively marketed , blatantly sectarian Bible curriculum that interferes with the freedom of all families to pass on their own religious values to their children , " it said .
In one teaching unit , students are told , " Throughout most of the last 2,000 years , the majority of men living in the Western world have accepted the statements of the Scriptures as genuine . "
The words are taken from the Web site of Grant R. Jeffrey Ministries ' Prophecy on Line .
The national council 's efforts are endorsed by the Center for Reclaiming America , Phyllis Schlafly 's group the Eagle Forum , Concerned Women for America and the Family Research Council , among others .
A daily , somewhat irreverent and highly personal " conversation " with President George W. Bush about national and international news ; but also about issues of broad cultural interest .
When the blind man arrived in the city , he claimed that he had travelled across a desert of living sand .
First he had died , he said , and then — snap ! — the desert .
He told the story to everyone who would listen , bobbing his head to follow the sound of their footsteps .
Showers of red grit fell from his beard .
He said that the desert was bare and lonesome and that it had hissed at him like a snake .
He had walked for days and days , until the dunes broke apart beneath his feet , surging up around him to lash at his face , then everything went still and began to beat like a heart .
The sound was as clear as any he had ever heard .
It was only at that moment , he said , with a million arrow - points of sand striking his skin , that he had truly realized he was dead .
Jim Singer , who managed the sandwich shop in the monument district , said that he had felt a prickling sensation in his fingers and then stopped breathing .
“ It was my heart , ” he insisted , thumping on his chest .
“ Took me in my own bed . ”
He had closed his eyes , and when he opened them again he was on a train , the kind that trolleys small children around in circles at amusement parks .
The rails were leading him through a thick forest of gold - brown trees , but the trees were actually giraffes , and their long necks were reaching like branches into the sky .
A wind rose up and peeled the spots from their backs .
The spots floated down around him , swirling and dipping in the wake of the train .
It took him a long time to understand that the throbbing noise he heard was not the rattling of the wheels along the tracks .
The girl who liked to stand beneath the poplar tree in the park said that she had died into an ocean the color of dried cherries .
For a while , the water had carried her weight , she said , and she lay on her back turning in meaningless circles , singing the choruses of the pop songs she remembered .
But then there was a drum of thunder , and the clouds split open , and the ball bearings began to pelt down around her —tens of thousands of them .
She had swallowed as many as she could , she said , stroking the cracked trunk of the poplar tree .
She did n’t know why .
She filled like a lead sack and sank slowly through the layers of the ocean .
Shoals of fish brushed past her , their blue and yellow scales the brightest thing in the water .
And all around her she heard that sound , the one that everybody heard , the regular pulsing of a giant heart .
The stories people told about the crossing were as varied and elaborate as their ten billion lives , so much more particular than the other stories , the ones they told about their deaths .
After all , there were only so many ways a person could die : either your heart took you , or your head took you , or it was one of the new diseases .
But no one followed the same path over the crossing .
Lev
Paley said that he had watched his atoms break apart like marbles , roll across the universe , then gather themselves together again out of nothing at all .
Hanbing
Li said that he woke inside the body of an aphid and lived an entire life in the flesh of a single peach .
Graciella Cavazos would say only that she began to snow — four words — and smile bashfully whenever anyone pressed her for details .
No two reports were ever the same .
And yet always there was the drumlike thumping noise .
Some people insisted that it never went away , that if you concentrated and did not turn your ear from the sound , you could hear it faintly behind everything in the city — the brakes and the horns , the bells on the doors of restaurants , the clicking and slapping of different kinds of shoes on the pavement .
Groups of people came together in parks or on rooftops just to listen for it , sitting quietly with their backs turned to each other .
Ba-dum .
Ba-dum .
Ba-dum .
It was like trying to keep a bird in sight as it lifted , blurred , and faded to a dot in the sky .
Luka Sims had found an old mimeograph machine his very first week in the city and decided to use it to produce a newspaper .
He stood outside the River Road Coffee Shop every morning , handing out the circulars he had printed .
One particular issue of the L. Sims News & Speculation Sheet — the Sims Sheet , people called it — addressed the matter of this sound .
Fewer than twenty per cent of the people Luka interviewed claimed that they could still hear it after the crossing , but almost everyone agreed that it resembled nothing so much as — could be nothing other than — the pounding of a heart .
The question , then , was where did it come from ?
It could not be their own hearts , for their hearts no longer beat .
The old man Mahmoud Qassim believed that it was not the actual sound of his heart but the remembered sound , which , because he had both heard and failed to notice it for so long , still resounded in his ears .
The woman who sold bracelets by the river thought that it was the heartbeat at the center of the world , that bright , boiling place she had fallen through on her way to the city .
“ As for this reporter , ” the article concluded , “ I hold with the majority .
I have always suspected that the thumping sound we hear is the pulse of those who are still alive .
The living carry us inside them like pearls .
We survive only so long as they remember us . ”
It was an imperfect metaphor — Luka knew that — since the pearl lasts much longer than the oyster .
But rule one in the newspaper business was that you had to meet your deadlines .
He had long since given up the quest for perfection .
There were more people in the city every day , and yet the city never failed to accommodate them .
You might be walking down a street you had known for years , and all of a sudden you would come upon another building , another whole block .
Carson McCaughrean , who drove one of the sleek black taxis that roamed the streets , had to redraw his maps once a week .
Twenty , thirty , fifty times a day , he would pick up a fare who had only recently arrived in the city and have to deliver him somewhere he —Carson — had never heard of .
They came from Africa , Asia , Europe , and the Americas .
They came from churning metropolises and from small islands in the middle of the ocean .
That was what the living did : they died .
There was an ancient street musician who began playing in the red brick district as soon as he reached the city , making slow , sad breaths with his accordion .
There was a jeweller , a young man , who set up shop at the corner of Maple and Christopher Streets and sold diamonds that he mounted on silver pendants .
Jessica Auffert had operated her own jewelry shop on the same corner for more than thirty years , but she did not seem to resent the man , and in fact brought him a mug of fresh black coffee every morning , exchanging gossip as she drank with him in his front room .
What surprised her was how young he was — how young so many of the dead were these days .
Great numbers of them were no more than children , who clattered around on skateboards or went racing past her window on their way to the playground .
One , a boy with a strawberry discoloration on his cheek , liked to pretend that the rocking horses he tossed himself around on were real horses , the horses he had brushed and fed on his farm before they were killed in the bombing .
Another liked to swoop down the slide over and over again , hammering his feet into the gravel as he thought about his parents and his two older brothers , who were still alive .
He had watched them lift free of the same illness that had slowly sucked him under .
He did not like to talk about it .
Plantations for biofuels may threaten forests and wildlife
Produced by a cross-agency body , UN Energy , the report says that biofuels can bring real benefits .
But there can be serious consequences if forests are razed for plantations , if food prices rise and if communities are excluded from ownership , it says .
And it concludes that biofuels are more effective when used for heat and power rather than in transport .
" Current research concludes that using biomass for combined heat and power ( CHP ) , rather than for transport fuels or other uses , is the best option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade - and also one of the cheapest , " it says .
The European Union and the US have recently set major targets for the expansion of biofuels in road vehicles , for which ethanol and biodiesel are seen as the only currently viable alternative to petroleum fuels .
Forest clearance
The UN report , Sustainable Bioenergy : A Framework for Decision Makers , suggests that biofuels can be a force for good if they are planned well , but can bring adverse consequences if not .
" The development of new bioenergy industries could provide clean energy services to millions of people who currently lack them , " it concludes , " while generating income and creating jobs in poorer areas of the world . "
Intensive farming of energy crops demands water and resources
On the environmental side , it notes that demand for biofuels has accelerated the clearing of primary forest for palm plantations , particularly in southeast Asia .
This destruction of ecosystems which remove carbon from the atmosphere can lead to a net increase in emissions .
The report warns too of the impacts on nature : " Use of large - scale mono - cropping could lead to significant biodiversity loss , soil erosion and nutrient leaching . "
This has been avoided , the report says , in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo where sugar cane farmers are obliged to leave a percentage of their land as natural reserves .
Water is also a concern .
The expanding world population and the on - going switch towards consumption of meat and dairy produce as incomes rise are already putting pressure on freshwater supplies , which increased growing of biofuel crops could exacerbate .
In conclusion , UN Energy suggests policymakers should take a holistic look before embarking on drives to boost biofuel use .
" Only through a convergence of biodiversity , greenhouse gas emissions and water - use policies can bioenergy find its proper environmental context and agricultural scale , " the report concludes .

“ He ’s a very loyal Republican , and you wo n’t see him go against Bush , ” said a colleague of Mr. Baker , who asked not to be identified because the study group is keeping a low profile before it formally issues recommendations .
“ But he feels that the yearning for some responsible way out which would not damage American interests is palpable , and the frustration level is exceedingly high . ”
At 76 , Mr. Baker still enjoys a reputation as one of Washington ’s craftiest bureaucratic operators and as a trusted adviser of the Bush family , which has enlisted his help for some of its deepest crises , including the second President Bush ’s effort to win the vote recount in Florida after the 2000 presidential election .
Mr. Baker served as White House chief of staff , as well as secretary of state under the first President Bush .
Andrew H. Card Jr. , President Bush ’s former chief of staff , acknowledged recently that he had twice suggested that Mr. Baker would be a good replacement for Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld .
Mr. Bush rejected that advice , and some associates of Mr. Baker say they do not believe he is interested , at his age , in taking the job , which could put him in the position of having to carry out his group ’s advice .
Those proposals — which he has said must be both bipartisan and unanimous — could very well give Mr. Bush some political latitude , should he decide to adopt strategies that he had once rejected , like setting deadlines for a phased withdrawal of American forces .
Given his extraordinary loyalty to the Bush family — Mr. Baker was present on Saturday at the formal christening of a new aircraft carrier named for the first President Bush — it was notable on Sunday that Mr. Baker also joined the growing number of Republicans who are trying to create some space between themselves and the White House .
On Sunday , on “ This Week , ” Mr. Baker was shown a video of the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Senator John W. Warner of Virginia , who said last week that Iraq was “ drifting sideways ” and urged consideration of a “ change of course ” if the Iraqi government could not restore order in two or three months .
The American ambassador to Iraq , Zalmay Khalilzad , has offered a similar warning to the Iraqi government .
Most bank staff opposed Wolfowitz ’s presidency .
An observer says that there ’s a perception that “ his real agenda remains hidden . ”
OLIVIER DOULIERY / ABACA USA
The Selimiye Mosque , in Edirne , a city in northwest Turkey , is a magnificent stone edifice , with four minarets and an austere , octagonal - shaped body supporting a large dome .
Built for Sultan Selim II in the sixteenth century , it has withstood numerous earthquakes and can accommodate more than five thousand kneeling worshippers .
One evening at the end of January , I visited the mosque with Paul Wolfowitz , the president of the World Bank , and a half dozen of his aides and colleagues .
Two years have passed since President Bush nominated Wolfowitz , the former Deputy Secretary of Defense and one of the architects of the war in Iraq , to head the sprawling multinational lending institution that has as its official goal “ a world without poverty . ”
The World Bank employs thirteen thousand people in more than a hundred countries , and lends about twenty - five billion dollars a year to poor and middle - income nations .
When Wolfowitz inspects bank programs , he often visits religious sites and other monuments .
At the Selimiye Mosque , a stern - looking young man with a black beard who identified himself as the imam met us at the entrance and invited us inside .
After putting on slippers , Wolfowitz entered the mosque and listened as the imam , demonstrating its acoustics , raised the call to Allah .
Wolfowitz has an abiding interest in the Islamic world .
His father , Jacob , an eminent mathematician who taught at Columbia and Cornell , was a fervent Zionist , and Wolfowitz ’s elder sister , Laura , lives in Israel .
Wolfowitz ’s critics sometimes portray him as an unquestioning defender of the Israeli government , and yet he has publicly expressed sympathy for the plight of the Palestinians , and some Arab reformers regard him as a friend .
Since separating from his wife of more than thirty years , Clare Selgin Wolfowitz , in 2001 , he has dated a secular Muslim woman in her fifties , Shaha Ali Riza .
A British national from a Libyan family who grew up in Saudi Arabia , Riza is a longtime advocate of democracy in Arab countries .
On a wall of the mosque was some ornate writing in Arabic .
“ Is that the Fatiha ? ” Wolfowitz asked , referring to a passage in the Koran .
No , the imam replied , explaining that the writing was from another passage .
Wolfowitz taught himself Arabic in the nineteen - eighties , when he was working at the State Department .
( He also speaks French , German , Hebrew , and Indonesian . )
Last year , during a visit to a mosque in eastern China , he recited a prayer from the Koran in Arabic .
This time , as he was leaving the mosque , he encountered a dozen or so news photographers who had gathered to document his visit .
Bending down to change back into his shoes , Wolfowitz removed a slipper , revealing a large hole in the toe of one gray wool sock .
Then he removed the other slipper , exposing another hole .
Shigeo Katsu , the World Bank ’s vice - president for Europe and Central Asia , tried to step between Wolfowitz and the photographers , but it was too late .
The camera shutters clicked .
If Wolfowitz was perturbed , he did n’t show it .
He went next door to a covered market , where he examined the religious and cultural icons for sale .
One of the venders urged him to buy some jewelry , but Wolfowitz did n’t have enough cash .
His spokesman and senior adviser , Kevin Kellems , gave him what he had , about seventeen dollars in Turkish lira .
“ I ’m going to need more than that , ” Wolfowitz whispered .
A member of the bank ’s Turkish staff handed him a hundred lira ( about seventy dollars ) , and Wolfowitz bought two silver bracelets , for his daughters .
Wolfowitz , who is sixty - three , has jug ears , hazel eyes , a furrowed brow , and thinning gray hair that he combs to the right .
He is a rumpled but unflappable traveller , seemingly oblivious of bad weather , uncomfortable transportation , and lack of sleep , as well as of the antiwar protesters who tend to appear wherever he goes .
Since joining the World Bank , Wolfowitz has visited more than fifty countries , including remote parts of Africa and Asia .
He is often depicted in the media as a neoconservative zealot , but on the road he is unfailingly polite , demonstrating a scholarly interest in local culture .
In Istanbul that morning , Wolfowitz had visited a homeless shelter run by the Turkish government with financial assistance from the World Bank .
The shelter was in a nineteenth - century neighborhood , in a brick building on a cobbled street .
After greeting the shelter ’s director , Wolfowitz and an interpreter entered a small room , containing four narrow beds and some metal chairs .
Wolfowitz sat down next to a slight middle - aged man in a fraying denim jacket and a black wool cap , who said that his name was Bedir Yasa and that until recently he had been living on the streets .
Wolfowitz spoke softly to Yasa , who evidently had no idea who he was but responded with a puckish smile .
Yasa said that he came from Van , near Iran , and that he wanted to work but had no skills .
When Wolfowitz asked if he had any family , he said that his wife had been killed in the earthquake that struck western Turkey in 1999 and that her parents were bringing up his only child , a son , whom he rarely saw .
Wolfowitz , who has two daughters and a son , fell silent .
“ I ’m sorry you have had such a tough life , ” he said finally .
“ I hope you can do better soon . ”
The World Bank was established in 1944 , at a conference on postwar reconstruction in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire , where representatives of more than forty nations agreed to create two new institutions : the International Monetary Fund , which was charged with guaranteeing stability in global currency markets , and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , which was charged with raising money for the rebuilding of Europe .
In December of 1945 , twenty - nine countries signed the articles of agreement that formally incorporated the I.M.F. and the World Bank ( as the I.B.R.D. came to be called ) in Washington .
A year and a half later , the World Bank made its first loan , to France .
The United States government quickly became the main financer of European reconstruction , and the bank shifted its focus to developing countries .
In 1948 , it lent money to Chile .
Two years later , it lent to Ethiopia .
Before long , it was financing the construction of roads and dams throughout Africa , Asia , and Latin America .
From its inception , the World Bank , which occupies an imposing thirteen - story building off Pennsylvania Avenue , a few blocks west of the White House , has represented a peculiar blend of idealism and Realpolitik .
Harry White , a U.S. Treasury official who helped create the bank , said of its early borrowers , “ There is nothing that will serve to drive these countries into some kind of ism — Communism or something else — faster than having inadequate capital . ”
During the nineteen - sixties and seventies , the World Bank lent heavily to such countries as Indonesia and Zaire , which were considered bulwarks against Soviet encroachment .
In the eighties and nineties , it pressed developing countries to lower import tariffs and encourage foreign investment , leading to accusations that it was acting in the interest of Western corporations .
The U.S. government , as the World Bank ’s biggest shareholder , has always asserted the right to appoint its president , and for twenty years it chose mostly financial executives .
In the fall of 1967 , President Lyndon Johnson broke with this tradition by nominating Robert McNamara , his Secretary of Defense and the chief strategist of the war in Vietnam .
McNamara spent thirteen years at the bank , during which he increased its lending thirteen - fold , expanded its research department , and welcomed China as a member .
“ McNamara created the World Bank as it is known today , ” Ernest Stern , an American financier who was the bank ’s managing director from 1991 to 1995 , told me .
“ He took over what was a fairly sleepy institution , focussed on infrastructure development , and he had a lot of ideas about new areas it should expand into : poverty , education , health care , family planning .
None of these things had been on the bank ’s agenda before . ”
For Immediate Release
June 17 , 2006 No Pictures Please : Researchers Develop System to Thwart Unwanted Video and Still Photography Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have completed a prototype device that can block digital - camera function in a given area .
Commercial versions of the technology could be used to stymie unwanted use of video or still cameras .
A Georgia
Tech camera - neutralizing prototype could soon be used to stop movie piracy and other forms of unwanted digital - camera photography .
Shown here with the device are , left to right , Jay W. Summet , PhD student , and James R. Clawson , research technician .

The prototype device , produced by a team in the Interactive and Intelligent Computing division of the Georgia Tech College of Computing ( COC ) , uses off - the - shelf equipment -- camera - mounted sensors , lighting equipment , a projector and a computer -- to scan for , find and neutralize digital cameras .
The system works by looking for the reflectivity and shape of the image - producing sensors used in digital cameras .
Gregory Abowd , an associate professor leading the project , says the new camera - neutralizing technology shows commercial promise in two principal fields – protecting limited areas against clandestine photography or stopping video copying in larger areas such as theaters .
“ We 're at a point right now where the prototype we have developed could lead to products for markets that have a small , critical area to protect , ” Abowd said .
“ Then we ’re also looking to do additional research that could increase the protected area for one of our more interesting clients , the motion picture industry . ”
Abowd said the small - area product could prevent espionage photography in government buildings , industrial settings or trade shows .
It could also be used in business settings -- for instance , to stop amateur photography where shopping - mall - Santa pictures are being taken .
James Clawson , a research technician on Abowd ’s prototype team , said preventing movie copying could be a major application for camera - blocking technology .
“ Movie piracy is a $ 3 billion - a - year problem , ” Clawson maintains -- a problem said to be especially acute in Asia .
“ If someone videotapes a movie in a theater and then puts it up on the web that night or burns half a million copies to sell on the street – then the movie industry has lost a lot of in - theater revenue . ”

Moreover , movie theaters are likely to be a good setting for camera - blocking technology , said Jay Summet , a research assistant who is also working on the prototype .
A camera ’s image sensor -- called a CCD -- is “ retroreflective , ” which means it sends light back directly to its origin rather than scattering it .
Retroreflections would probably make it relatively easy to detect and identify video cameras in a darkened theater .
The current prototype uses visible light and two cameras to find CCDs , but a future commercial system might use invisible infrared lasers and photo - detecting transistors to scan for contraband cameras .
Once such a system found a suspicious spot , it would feed information on the reflection ’s properties to a computer for a determination .
“ The biggest problem is making sure we do n’t get false positives from , say , a large shiny earring , ” said Summet .
“ We need to make our system work well enough so that it can find a dot , then test to see if it 's reflective , then see if it 's retroreflective , and then test to see if it's the right shape . ”
Once a scanning laser and photodetector located a video camera , the system would flash a thin beam of visible white light directly at the CCD .
This beam – possibly a laser in a commercial version – would overwhelm the target camera with light , rendering recorded video unusable .
Researchers say that energy levels used to neutralize cameras would be low enough to preclude any health risks to the operator .
Still camera neutralization in small areas also shows near - term commercial promise , Abowd said .
Despite ambient light levels far higher than in a theater , still cameras at a trade show or a mall should be fairly easy to detect , he said .
That ’s because image sensors in most cell phones and digital cameras are placed close to the lens , making them easier to spot than the deeper - set sensors of video cameras .
Camera neutralization ’s potential has helped bring it under the wing of VentureLab , a Georgia Tech group that assists fledgling companies through the critical feasibility and first - funding phases .
Operating under the name DominINC , Abowd ’s company has already received a Phase 1 grant from the Georgia Research Alliance ( GRA ) with VentureLab assistance .
Abowd said that funding availability will likely decide which technology -- small - or large - area -- will be developed first .
DominINC will apply soon for GRA Phase 2 money , Abowd said .
Those funds would be used to aid anti-piracy product development , as would any funding coming from the film industry .
Other potential funding , from industry and elsewhere , would likely be used to develop anti-espionage small - area applications .
Stephen Fleming , Georgia
Tech ’s chief commercialization officer , said motion - picture groups are actively looking for technology to foil piracy .
Movie distributors might even promote camera - neutralizing systems by refusing to send films to theaters that do n’t install anti-piracy systems .
There are some caveats , according to Summet .
Current camera - neutralizing technology may never work against single - lens - reflex cameras , which use a folding - mirror viewing system that effectively masks its CCD except when a photo is actually being taken .
Moreover , anti-digital techniques do n’t work on conventional film cameras because they have no image sensor .
Good computer analysis will be the heart of effective camera blocking , Summet believes .
“ Most of the major work that we have left involves algorithmic development , ” he said .
“ False positives will eliminated by making a system with fast , efficient computing . ”
Also involved in the camera - neutralizing project are Shwetak Patel , a College of Computing PhD student ; Khai Truong , a former Georgia Tech PhD student who is now at the University of Toronto , and Kent Lyons , a College of Computing post - doctoral student .
A paper on this technology was published and presented at the Ubicomp 2005 conference in Tokyo , Japan , last September .

WASHINGTON , June 25 ( Reuters )  About 43.6 million people in the United States , or 14.8 percent of the population , had no health insurance in 2006 , according to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released Monday .
The finding , based on a survey of 100,000 people , is lower than previous federal estimates of 46 million .
The estimate is based on those who did not have insurance at the time of the interview .
About 54.5 million people in the country , or 18.6 percent of the population , had no insurance for at least part of 2006 .
The survey , by the National Center for Health Statistics , found that about 9.3 percent of children under 18 did not have health insurance , a decrease from 13.9 percent in 1997 .
Choose Your Own Adventure

This series set the standard for basic - level gamebooks .
The books in the series are very story - based ; there are no special rules and very few of the gimmicks many other series include , just text and choices .
Although the gameplay aspect of the books is n't very diverse , the series spans every imaginable genre and contains fairly high - quality writing for this sort of book .
The series started in 1979 and includes 184 books .
No new books have been released since July , 1998 , and the entire series is now out of print .
The last of the Choose Your Own Star Wars Adventure books was released a few months after the last book of this series .
This page is under construction ; reviews will be added as I read more of these books .

Oddly enough right before I went on vacation I ended up on Slashdot for my recent musing on crippling trial versions .
It being Slashdot , many people were shocked and amazed that someone would have the gumption to actually sell a program of the complexity of Bingo Card Creator .
There was also , shall we say , a weeeee bit of animosity .
Similarly , if you go to the Business of Software forums , every time the subject of OSS ( open source software — to sidestep a debate which is essentially religious , OSS can be most easily understood as “ software which you can use and modify for free ” ) comes up some folks have a weeeeee bit of animosity towards it .
And when I say a weeeeee bit of animosity , its like saying that Israelis and Arabs do n’t quite see eye - to - eye on that little land dispute they ’ve had running for a few years .
Now , personally , I do n’t understand quite why this is .
Open source coexists quite readily with uISVs ( micro independent software vendors = people , like me , who sell software without the backing of a “ really big company ” ) and will continue to do so indefinitely .
I say this as someone who both has contributed to OSS software ( namely , I did bugfixing and optimizations for the best online version of the classic Battletech boardgame in existence ) , use OSS constantly in both my day job and my uISV , and sell proprietary software .
So when I hear myths like the following I get a good chuckle .
OSS backers are crazy Commies .
Most people who have installed Firefox are , in fact , not Communists .
Most of the folks who , for lack of a better term , find themselves politically or spiritually fulfilled by the OSS movement ( as opposed to a particular piece of OSS software ) , are in fact not Communists .
Many of them do have irrational takes on the actual economics of software ( c.f. Richard Stallman ’s GNU Manifesto , which suggests at one point that all computer users be taxed to fund software development , an idea which would lead to overpriced computers , a crushing undersupply of new software , and a gigantic transnational boondoggle of a government agency to administer the tax , and thats just for starters ) .
However , the movement is too fractured , too corporatized ( see below ) , and too lacking in bullets - in - the - back - of - the - head - for - all - who - oppose - us to be fairly called Communist .
Of course , its entirely possible that some OSS developers are honest - to - badness Commies , but thats far from universal .
OSS software is written by tiny developers working in their spare time out of the goodness of their hearts .
This is every bit as much a lie as the Commie bit .
Here ’s a dirty little secret : most big - name OSS projects ( including Linux , Firefox , Eclipse , take your pick ) are produced primarily by programmers at large corporations working at the direction of their bosses in exchange for cash money .
“ Anyone can contribute to Linux ! ” is , if not a lie , a gross misstatement of the facts : getting a patch into the Linux kernel requires getting it past a series of gatekeepers who are getting paid for their time .
And thats probably a good thing .
Why IBM et al spend billions of dollars ( in money and donated labor ) on funding the Apache Software Foundation , Mozilla , et al are outside the scope of this post , but they do .
And they ’re hardly alone — more than half of the developers working on Sourceforge at the behest of the people signing their paychecks .
OSS will reach every niche in the software world and there will be no space for proprietary software .
O rly ?
Allow me to give a +5 insightful to guy on Slashdot who said “ If that was true , why has n’t OSS produced something of quality comparable to Bingo Card Creator ? ”
Oh , there are a lot of answers to that one .
Have you ever noticed that programmers seem to be able to find almost anything they need on Sourceforge and that everybody else really has to hunt for it ?
This is a reflection of the most fundamental truth of software development : you ca n’t program if you ’re not a programmer .
Programmers are very good at producing software for their own needs … and a lot less good at producing software for other ’s needs .
But the rest of the world keeps needing software to run their chimney sweep operations , make bingo cards , plan their weddings , and write their aquisition forms for a new laptop to replace the one that just exploded .
And so there is a market for software development expertise , where people who do n’t have it pay people who do money so that they can get back to doing the things they do best .
Like sweeping chimneys , teaching children , looking at overly expensive wedding dresses , and blogging .
Open source means all bugs are get fixed and all features get implemented … in some dreamworld where all open source projects are under active development .
Back in the real world , the overwhelming majority of open source projects are inactive .
Development has ceased , the original maintainer ( and the only person who knows how the code works ) cannot be contacted , and mails / forum posts go unanswered .
Take a look at the closest OSS competitor to my program , bingo - cards : it has n’t seen a patch since 2004 .
( And its more active than 75 % of the projects on SourceForge . )
This is despite some minor usability niggles such as the fact that if you try to install it on a Windows PC it will crash .
Here ’s another myth held by many in the uISV community : OSS developers will instantly clone any successful application because they ’re crazy zealots .
I ’m sure any competent C developer could take the bingo - cards codebase and make it the equal of Bingo Card Creator in less than a man -week .
I ’m equally sure that they wo n’t .
Sure , lots of the folks on Slashdot said variations of “ Oh , I ’d clone your program just to spite you ” , but I have the strong suspicion that , as the Texas saying has it , they have a lot of hat but no cattle .
And most uISVs produce programs with vastly higher barriers to entry than Bingo Card Creator — I shudder to think at how much I ’d have to learn about chimney sweeping to outdo ChimneySoft , and there ’s probably an order of magnitude more code to write there .
IBM is no more interested in bankrolling bingo - cards than they are interested in rolling out their own Proprietary Bingo Solution ( TM ) because the niche is just too tiny .
Most teachers are incapable of coding and do n’t have a week to spend doing it at any rate .
Most one - man OSS teams do n’t exactly have their intrinsic motivation fire lit by doing the unchallenging , boring coding tasks like making sure that bingo cards are printed correctly .
Enter the uISV , who has the skills and the motivation ( $ $ $ ) to solve this task , and everyone profits .
Little kids learn to read , teachers spend more time teaching and less time preparing , I earn money to fund my cocoa habit , OSS developers write software they ’ll actually enjoy writing .
Oh , while we ’re at it , here ’s another myth both OSS backers and many uISVs suffer under :
Most of the work done in producing a quality piece of software happens in an IDE .
If a tree falls in a forest , does it make any sound ?
If the perfect solution to the problem facing you ca n’t be found on a Google search , does it matter that it exists ?
Most successful uISVs have long since learned the lesson that writing the program is about 10 % of the battle : you ’ve then got to get it in front of prospective users , write documentation , help them with their problems , market market and market some more , etc .
These take time and money , and most OSS developers hate them .
With a burning passion .
Intrinsic motivation only takes the typical OSS developer as far as closing the IDE .
bingo - cards , for example , gets about 5 % of my downloads primarily because I spent time making a website which attracts teachers who have a problem like “ I need to play sight word bingo with my first graders tomorrow but do n’t want to spend hours making cards ” and gives me the opportunity to tell them “ Yep , install my software and you ’ll be done in five minutes ” .
One way of several is I just got charged $ 90 by Goooogle for clicks on contextual advertising .
Probably 99.9999 % of OSS has an advertising budget of nothing .
The developers also do n’t typically take even rudimentary , free steps such as writing a description of their software which explains to real , honest - to - God users what their program actually allows them to accomplish .
Not to pick on bingo - cards , but let me quote literally the entirety of what you can learn about their software without downloading it :
GPL bingo card printing program ( numeric , letter bingo and picture bingo ) .
Also prints a calling sequence ( equivalent to the output from a barrel full of balls ) .
XML output for later linking to multimedia engine .
Thats full of scary acronyms , irrelevant information , and about three words which are actually of use to an elementary school teacher .
You ca n’t tell from that description that bingo - cards will even allow you to print Dolch sight word bingo cards ( it will , incidentally , although you ’ll have to supply the list yourself ) .
Compare this to a random three sentence snippet from a page on my website about Dolch sight word bingo :
This is a page of free resources for teaching how to read Dolch sight words which we put together as a resource to educators .
You ’ll probably want to have a set of sight words bingo cards ready to go to use these activities .
If you do n’t have one , you can make one in under five minutes if you download the free trial of Bingo Card Creator , which comes complete with all five Dolch sight word lists ( pre-primer , primer , first grade , second grade , and third grade ) .
Only one of these two pages is responsive to the needs of our busy first grade teacher , and only one of them gets hit by Google searchers about 200 times per week .
[ Edit : “ Boondoggle ” is a very hard word to spell .
I have no clue where “ misunderstatement ” came from , but I do love the charming Dubyaesque quality of that coinage .
Sadly , I was forced to rectify it to avoid enraging my readers who are English teachers . ]

Das ausgelagerte Archiv
Die Website youtube.com präsentiert hunderttausende von kleinen Videos .
Fernsehsendungen , Musikclips , Unfug jeder Art : ein einmaliges Portal in die Weiten der popkulturellen Erinnerung
VON DETLEF KUHLBRODT
Es muss irgendwann vor den Filmfestspielen gewesen sein , als ich youtube.com entdeckte .
Das ist eine amerikanische Website , auf der mittlerweile ungefähr 25 Millionen Videos herumliegen .
Selten sind sie länger als fünf Minuten .
Jeden Tag kommen 20.000 hinzu .
Im Juli letzten Jahres startete die Seite .
Youtube funktioniert zunächst einmal so ähnlich wie die diversen halblegalen Internettauschbörsen – das heißt , man gibt einen Namen oder Begriff ein und bekommt Ergebnisse .
Im Unterschied zu den üblichen Tauschbörsen lädt man sich die Sachen , die es dort gibt , aber nicht herunter , sondern guckt sie im Netz .
Eigentlich ist die Seite so etwas wie das ausgelagerte kollektive Archiv einer vor allem popkulturellen Erinnerung .
Mit ihr hat man unter anderem die Möglichkeit , das , was einen als Kind und Jugendlichen geprägt hat , noch einmal zu sehen .
Das klingt vielleicht banal , ist es aber nicht .
Denn bis vor wenigen Jahren waren die Bilder von früher ja verschlossen .
Sie waren da , aber man kam nicht an sie heran .
Manchmal wünschte man sich vielleicht , irgendetwas noch einmal zu sehen – dieses Interview mit Leonard Cohen zum Beispiel , dass man damals so toll gefunden hatte – : aber das ging nicht .
Hatte keiner .
Gab ’s nicht .
Bei Musik ist das seit Napster ja einfacher .
Nur ohne Bild .
Doch das gibt es nun bei youtube .
Und nicht nur professionelle Filmchen , sondern auch Millionen von selbstgedrehten Videos , die Leute dahin gestellt haben .
Youtube sieht eher unspektakulär aus : Grau , Blau , ein paar Bilder zum Anklicken , eine Leiste mit irgendwas und eine Suchfunktion .
Ich tippte „ Marc Bolan “ ein .
Es gab 34 Resultate .
Jeweils drei Bilder nebeneinander und darunter eine kurze Inhaltsangabe .
T. Rex , wie sie ihre Hits Anfang der Siebziger in „ Top of the Pops “ oder im Bremer „ Musikladen “ aufführen .
Ich guckte „ 20th Century Boy “ und versank in komischen Déjà-vus .
Ich hatte das Video zuletzt vor mehr als dreißig Jahren gesehen .
Ein einziges Mal .
Damals hatte in diesem Video ein wunderbares Versprechen auf eine geheimnisvolle , schöne Zukunft gelegen , der ich mittlerweile schon entwachsen bin .
Jetzt guckte ich es noch mal .
Ganz seltsam .
Wie Marc Bolan so aussieht und was er anhat und die anderen ja auch .
Dies postpsychedelische , prä-punkige Video sah kulissenhafter aus , als ich es in Erinnerung hatte .
Das Bild war etwas undeutlicher und kleiner als damals im Fernseher .
Vor allem hinkten die Bilder den Tönen hinterher und manchmal hinkten auch die Töne ein bisschen .
Die Tonspur war jedenfalls schon fertig , als man die Band immer noch spielen sah .
Während das Licht im echten Leben viel schneller ist als der Ton , ist es im Computer andersrum .
Als Marc Bolan den
Mund für seinen berühmten „ Wow “ - Schrei öffnete , war der schon längst verklungen .
Diese technische Unzulänglichkeit hatte aber einen ihr entsprechenden melancholischen Mehrwert , erzeugte ein ähnliches Gefühl zwischen Intimität und Vergeblichkeit , wie es alte Super - 8 - Filme , verblichene oder verschmutzte Bilder tun .
Es geht darum , nicht die Melancholie zu genießen , sondern sie zu verstehen .
Die Verschmutzung , das Undeutliche verweisen auf die vergehende Zeit , die die perfekte Reproduktion zu negieren versucht , die nichts anderes wäre als ein eingefrorener Klon des Augenblicks .
So ist es denn auch viel humaner , wenn die angestrebte Echtzeitübertragung eben noch nicht ganz funktioniert .
Andererseits nervt es .
Nicht die Qualität der Bilder – für meine Erinnerungszwecke , mein geschichtliches Interesse reichte das völlig , aber das Warten nervt .
Bis das alles richtig geladen ist .
Irgendwie macht einen das immer so nervös , wenn man wartet , während der Computer rechnet , damit man sich das angucken kann , und das Irre dabei : Die Rechengeräusche meines Computers sind ja nicht mal echt , sondern wurden von irgendwelchen Schlauköpfen da reingebaut , wie mir kürzlich jemand erzählte :
Sie sollen der Aktivität der Maschine eine akustische Repräsentation geben .
Suchend geht man seiner Wege .
Geschichtlich interessiert .
Begleitet von einem Gefühl seltsamer Gleich - und Ungleichzeitigkeiten .
Viele Freunde hatten ja in letzter Zeit damit angefangen , über Früher nachzudenken .
Edi , den ich Anfang der Achtziger den „ Chemiker “ nannte , als er in einer Band spielte , hatte zum Beispiel vor einigen Monaten damit angefangen , in einer Kneipe Popmusikvideos aus den letzten 40 Jahren zu zeigen .
Das waren eigentlich Geschichtsstunden .
Und ich guckte mir meine alten Helden zu Haus in meinem Computer an .
Leonard Cohen , David Bowie , Marc Almond .
Tausend Filmchen , die ich als Teenager so gerne gesehen hätte .
David Bowie , wie er 1968
„ When I ’m five “ singt – Wahnsinn !
Einmal machte ich auch einen drogenorientierten Videoabend ; guckte mir also noch einmal die Beatlesfilmchen aus ihrer psychedelischen Phase an ( „ Strawberry fields forever “ etc. ) und Sly Stone , wie er da so völlig dicht in der Dick Cavett Show zu sein scheint , irgendwann Anfang der Siebzigerjahre .
Als eher prinzipieller denn konkreter Ex -Grateful - Dead - Fan kontrollierte ich einen diesbezüglichen Bericht von 1967 .
Die Grateful Deads ( die passenderweise über ihren Texter John Perry Barlow an der Gründung der Electronic Frontier Foundation beteiligt waren , einer Organisation , die für die Bürgerrechte im Netz kämpft ) erzählten in diesem popmusikgeschichtlich interessanten Bericht davon , wie durch LSD also eine neue Sensibilität entstände , die die Menschheit nach vorne brächte und den Einzelnen irgendwie befreie .
Ein Kommentator im Anzug kritisierte das sehr bestimmt , aber geistesgeschichtlich viel gebildeter , als es die heutigen Kommentatoren zu tun pflegen , und ich dachte dann , dass es in der taz ursprünglich ja auch einen Redakteur für Drogen gegeben hatte .
Irgendwo fand ich ein Interview mit Jerry Garcia und Ken Kesey .
Sie unterhielten sich in irgendeiner großen amerikanischen TV - Show .
Kichernd und leicht schenkelklopferisch sprachen sie über diese teils vom Militär , teils von neugierigen Psychologen veranstalteten Acid-Tests .
Komisch , wie selbstverständlich dieser Drogendiskurs einmal war !
Zumindest in den USA .
Dann gab ’s noch eine sehr psychedelische Pink - Panther - Folge von 1968 und vor dem Zubettgehen noch schnell ein zeitgenössisches 6 - Sekunden - Amateur - Video mit einer jungen Frau .
Sie wirkte leicht weggeschossen und sagte : „ I ’m now tripping . “
Oder „ not “ ?
Egal !
Man kann sich natürlich auch tausend andere Themenabende gestalten .
Mit tollen Kunststücken , die in irgendwelchen Fernsehshows anderer Länder gezeigt wurden : einer phänomenalen japanischen Pingpong - Performance , einem großartigen japanischen Jojo - Künstler usw .
Oder auch mit buddhistischen Dingen : einem Reisereklamevideo für den Giant Buddha of Kamakura ( Japan ) , zu dem die „ Who “ ihr „ See me – feel me “ singen , oder einem „ I am not Buddha “ betitelten mehrteiligen Fernsehbericht aus Indien über einen 15 - Jährigen , der seit einem halben Jahr ohne etwas zu essen oder zu trinken an einem Bodhibaum sitzt und von einigen als Buddha verehrt wird .
Das Video heißt „ I am not Buddha “ , man versteht überhaupt nichts .
Genau deshalb gefällt es einem vermutlich so sehr .
So vergingen die Tage und es kommen immer mehr .
Das Motto von youtube ist „ broadcast yourself “ .
Viel zahlreicher als die professionellen Videos sind denn auch die kleinen Filmchen , die irgendwelche Leute selbst gemacht haben .
Vor allem , so kommt es mir vor , sind es Karaoke - Videos .
Leute , meist junge Frauen , tanzen zu irgendeiner Pop - Musik .
Oder „ oops - Videos “ , also solche , wo Leute lustig umfallen .
Menschen singen mit ihrer Gitarre .
Oder auch : „ This is my friend Gan ’s video .
Gan is a student of Tongji University in Shanghai , China .
He is one of the best cubers in China .
Now , enjoy the video . “
( Er ist wirklich gut und braucht 27 Sekunden . )
Manchmal gibt es Geister , die man nicht richtig erkennt , man hört nur den Schreckensschrei dessen , dem der Geist begegnete .
Oft sind Leute gerade sehr albern und lachen viel .
Manchmal kotzt jemand .
Eine Frau macht sich in die Windeln beim Telefonieren .
Es gibt viele Haustiere .
Eine junge Japanerin gibt ihrer Katze die Brust in einer völlig durchgedrehten japanischen Fernsehshow .
Ein Hund trinkt Cola aus dem Nabel eines fetten Mannes .
Unter „ Snow “ kann man sich den Schneefall in tausend Weltgegenden anschauen .
In Seoul schneit es in den Straßen .
Aus irgendwelchen Gründen wurde dies Video 24.750 - mal in zwei Tagen angeguckt .
Man kann auch „ Sun “ reintippen oder verschiedene Weltgegenden .
Man fliegt in acht Folgen mit einem Drachen über Helsinki , fährt sechs Minuten im Taxi durch Paris , guckt sich die U - Bahn in Moskau an .
Teenager skaten .
Jemand duscht angezogen 10 Minuten lang .
Es gibt Fußballtore oder Bilder von der Loveparade in Chile .
Jungs oder Mädchen schlagen sich .
Muslimische Demonstrationen in diversen Städten sind vertreten .
Ein „ Hassprediger “ vielleicht ( man versteht ja nicht , was er sagt ) , der heilige Geist hat ihn ergriffen , und er rappt spirituell weggeschossen , aber durchaus rhythmisch .
Ich sah Kitzelfolter für Erwachsene , Vergewaltiger , die im tschetschenischen Grosny erschossen wurden , Kriegsbilder aus dem Irak .
Brandbomben in Nordirland .
Man schaut in unendlich viele andere Leben .
Es ist sicher die Verwirklichung eines emanzipatorischen Medientraums .
Die Sender sind Empfänger , die Empfänger sind Sender , auch wenn es nur die 26ste Folge ihres „ daily shaves “ ist , die sie ins Netz stellen .
Sie setzen eindeutige Zeichen : hey , das bin ich , und nehmen die Posen derer ein , die sie darstellen wollen .
Im Abbild ihrer selbst versuchen sie sich zu verwirklichen .
Sie üben vielleicht für die nächste Lesebühnenlesung , wie der Berliner Performer Toni Mahoni , der wirklich lustig ist .
Viele haben auch ihre je eigenen Liebesgeschichten über Jahre , mit diversen Highlights , romantisch vervideoclipisiert .
Manche Clips dauern nur so lange , wie jemand sagen kann : „ Vagina “ , oder oft auch : „ Are you taping this ? “
Die Videos sind zum einen Videos .
Und zum anderen sind die , die sie hineingestellt haben , ja auch präsent .
Man klickt meinetwegen auf ein Video , unter dem steht , dass es vor einer Sekunde hier reingestellt wurde , von irgendjemandem mit irgendeinem mehr oder weniger vielsagendem Nickname .
Das Video heißt meinetwegen „ me “ ( unter dem Titel gibt es 115.557 Videos )
Dann sieht man dreißig Sekunden lang jemand , der zumeist recht belanglose , alberne , performative Dinge sagt .
Man kann sich total an diese Dinge verlieren .
Schnell wird man süchtig .
Unter dem Stichwort „ bored “ gab es gestern Mittag 14.482 Videos .
Caracas , May 28 , 2007 ( venezuelanalysis.com ) —
The case of the private Venezuelan television channel RCTV going off the air due to the non-renewal of its broadcast license this Sunday provoked large protests in Caracas both in favor and against the station .
Opposition marchers rallied in front of the National Telecommunications Commission ( Conatel ) , where conflicts with the police produced several injuries .
Pro-government protesters , on the other hand , marched through the center of Caracas to celebrate the end of RCTV and the opening in its place of the new public service channel TVes .
The controversy surrounding the case reached its highest point this weekend as the nation 's oldest television channel came to the end of its on - air broadcast license .
Supporters of the decision see the measure as a democratization of the nation 's media system , which in their view has been dominated by the minority economic elite .
Opponents to the decision , however , claim that it is a form of muzzling opposition to the Chavez government given that RCTV was one of the strongest critics of the government .
The pro-government march started at midday Sunday from the Caracas sector of Catia and made its way toward the city center .
The march had the purpose of not only supporting the government decision to end the broadcast of RCTV on public airwaves , but also to celebrate the opening of the new public service channel Tves .
Supporters rallied in the city center until the early morning hours to celebrate the transition from RCTV to the new public service channel .
Opposition protests reached a climax yesterday afternoon with a brief outbreak of violence between police officers and protesters who reportedly began throwing stones at the police .
Initial reports indicate that several officers were wounded , to which the police responded with spraying water cannons at the crowd .
Protests continued into the day today with university students rallying at the Central University in Caracas as well as the Simon Bolivar University .
Students at the private Metropolitan University also held protests provoking a response from police and the National Guard who reportedly shot tear gas at protesters .
" You have to accept dissidence , there can't be just one line of thought , " said the dean of the Central University Antonio Paris in support of the protests today .
" We ca n't let Venezuela be converted into Cuba or ally itself to terrorist states , " said RCTV president Marcel Granier .
" We have to find a way to reconnect ourselves to the television screens so that people can express their opinions . "
But those who support the decision see it as an opening to more diversity , and not a restriction of thought .
" We support the government 's decision to not renew the broadcast license of the channel that supported the coup , and to open new roads of communication with the new channel Tves , " said one of the pro-government protesters .
" I have been a supporter of this revolution for many years and it depends on us being able to change the things that damage the society , like RCTV , " said another marcher .
" We are going to try to make a better country for our children and adults . "
Those who support the decision celebrated the transition to the new channel , Tves , at midnight Sunday night .
At 12:00 p.m. the transmission of RCTV went off the air amid wild cheers from the pro-government supporters .
Minutes later , from inside the Caracas auditorium Teresa Carreño , the crew from the new public service channel began their broadcast with a musical gala in the presence of a live audience .
The new channel will have a variety of programming including educational , entertainment , children 's programs , sports , news , and more .
The idea of the project is to offer a wide diversity of nationally produced programming on Venezuela ’s airwaves .
Definitely a full house , people are tense .
" Are they going to fight ? "
Oh c'mon , they 're old pals .
Kind of .
Here we go !
Lights are dim , it 's super dramatic .
They 're showing a video of a 1983 Apple event featuring Fred Gibbons , Mitch Kapor , and , of course Bill Gates .
" During 1984 Microsoft expects to get half of its revenues from Macintosh software .
" 1991 Jobs and Gates , photographed together .
1997 , Jobsnote in which Gates appears on - screen via satellite .
Jobs : " Relationships that are destructive do n't help anybody . "
Gates gets cheers and jeers .
" The era of setting Apple and Microsoft up in competition is over . "
Not quite Steve , but close !
2007 - TOGETHER HERE NOW .
They 're on stage !
And shaking hands !
They 're recognizing notable technologists ...
Mitch Kapor , etc .
And here they go .
What do you think each has contributed to the tech industry ?
Steve : Bill built the first software company .
That was huge .
Bill 's been able to stay with it for all these years .
Bill : First , I want to clarify , I'm NOT Fake Steve Jobs .
What Steve 's done is quite phenomenal .
Bill : Steve said once , we build the products we want to use ourselves , and he 's done that with incredible taste and elegance .
Apple literally was failing before Steve went back .
Steve :
We 've also both been incredibly lucky to have great partners that we started the companies with .
Great people , he says .
They look totally comfortable up there together !
But no I'm a PC / I 'm a Mac thing though .
Ah well .
Walt mentions an old print ad : " Thousands of people have discovered the Apple computer . "
Steve :
We had some very strange ads back then ...
Walt :
Most people do n't know that there was some MS software in that first Apple computer !
Gates is sooo reminiscing , talking about Altairs and Woz and floating point -- Jobs interrupts .
Jobs :
Let me tell the story !
[ Huge laughter . ]
Chatting about
Woz not authoring floating - point BASIC -- Microsoft sold Apple their floating - point BASIC app for $ 31,000 .
The trip , apparently , was fun !
Walt wants to know what was the most fun , though .
Talking about the original Mac ...
Bill : What Steve had planned was intended to be a LOT more money .
Steve kind of gave the eh - whatchagonna do look .
Much laughter .
22 k for the screenbuffer , 14 k for the OS .
Hot damn that 's an advanced machine .
Talking about Mac apps and the like ...
Kara :
What 'd you think was going to happen to Apple after Steve left ?
Bill : Apple 's fate hung in the balance !
Bill :
The debate was n't Mac vs. Windows , it was CLI vs GUI .
We were looking to invest ... with Gil Amelio . laughter .
Steve has a big big grin .
" Do n't worry about that negotiation with Gil Amelio anymore . " laughter .
Steve : Gil had a saying , " Apple is like a ship with holes in the bottom leaking water .
My job is to get that ship pointed in the right direction . "
Huge laughter .
Bill is talking about the virtues of Windows 95 , Steve is looking on biting his lip -- not grumpily though , if you can picture it .
Steve : Apple was in very serious trouble .... a zero sum game .
Apple invented a lot of this stuff but Microsoft was very successful .
There was a lot of jealousy .
It was crazy , Apple was very weak , so I called Bill and tried to patch things up .
Bill talking about developing Mac apps .
Steve : Microsoft is one of our best developer partners .
Kara :
Are you competitors ?
I have to admit , I really like PC guy .
Steve :
The art of those commercials is n't to be mean , it 's for those guys to like each other .
PC guy is great .
PC guy is what makes it work !
Big laughs .
Walt :
How often is MS on your radar in a business sense ?
Bill : Look at Zune ... they love that Apple created this market , and they 're going to contribute ... something ... to that ....
Steve is SO known for his restraint .
Huge laughs .
It 's almost heartwarming ...
Walt is mentioning that Apple is known for its vertical integration methods .
Steve recites the Alan Kay quote about those wanting to do great software needing to make hardware .
Bill : I can resist that .
Ha !
Laughs .
Walt to Steve : is there something you would have done differently to get a larger Mac market share ?
Steve 's diverted to talk about the CE space , hardware v. software .
Bill mentions PCs to Macs are n't too different than iPods to Zunes .
Steve : I cleared the cobwebs .
It 's not about today or yesterday , let 's go invent tomorrow .
Steve on competition : I think it 's really healthy , there are some really exciting companies out there right now .
Bill agrees .
Man , these two are peas in an iPod , we says .
Walt :
You 're the guys that represent the rich client , the PC .
In five years will the PC still be the linchpin when apps move into the cloud ?
Bill :
The mainstream is always under attack .
You 're always going to have rich local functionality .
It 's about using that together with rich functionality in the cloud , and that 's a hell of a good way to put it .
Steve : Concrete example .
I love Gmaps .
We thought , would n't it be great to have one on the iPhone ? ... So Apple develops the app and Steve says " BLOWS AWAY " every other Gmaps app ever .
There 's still a lot you can do with a rich client -- and rich clients run on lower and lower cost / power devices .
They 're chatting up the Palm Foolio , er , Folio now ... but what 's the device in 5 years ?
Bill :
You wo n't have one .
I believe in the tablet form factor ...
Steve :
The personal computer has been very resilient .
The internet changed all that .
The notion of the PC as the digital hub started to take off .
There 's something starting again ... there 's an explosion in post - PC devices ( like the iPod ) .
Devices focused on functions -- that 's the category where the innovation is .
[ Well no joke , and that 's why Engadget 's here , yeah ? ]
Walt wants them to estimate the core functions of the cellphone - like user device in five years .
Gates believes ultimately you wo n't ever want to edit things on your small device ... talking about flexible and rollable displays .
Steve : the art of devices is the editing function , what 's on it and what 's not on it .
But it will primarily be a communications device .
Kara asks Steve and Bill what they 're looking at for next gen communications and collaboration tools , like Wikis etc. Steve and Bill stare blankly for a number of awkward moments ...
Steve :
There used to be saying at Apple , " Is n't it funny ?
A ship that leaks from the top . "
That 's what they used to say about me in my 20s .
Walt : .
Mac ... you guys did n't really develop it .
Steve : I could n't agree more , and we 'll make up for lost time in the near future .
Walt :
Do you worry about not being as nimble as some of these companies ?
Bill is talking about the ecosystem and using cool new stuff to drive demand for both their businesses .
Steve thinks Apple takes a different approach .
We do n't know how to do maps , search , some of this new stuff ... so we partner with those companies that do .
It 's really hard for one company to do everything .
They 're talking about becoming enablers of digital content .
Steve :
The industry is still trying to make the transition while they 're under attack from piracy ... learned some things to do , some things not to do .
There 's a tremendous amount of experimentation and thought going on that 's gonna be good ... really good .
Walt : is there a new paradigm coming for the PC ?
Bill is digging on the idea of 3D computing and natural input , and how it is going to change the way we interact with technology .
They 're still discussing interfaces .
Bill : touch , ink , speech , vision -- you 're underestimating the degree of evolution .
Ha !
Kara and Walt are totally making fun of Steve .
" Yeah , we know your 'e working on something ... it 's going to be beautiful and BLOW US AWAY . "
Hilarious .
Steve looks perplexed but you can totally tell he wants to dish .
Steve :
There 's a real revolution in these post - PC devices .
But it really has to be tempered .
In some cases you have to augment what exists , but in some cases you have to replace things .
But the radical rethinking comes with post - PC devices .
Kara : what 's the greatest misunderstanding about your relationship with each other ?
Steve :
We 've kept our marriage secret for over a decade .
Nice Steve , Nice .
Bill : Neither of us have anything to complain about .
People come and go in this industry , it 's nice when someone sticks around !
[ People , we 're telling you , these guys really respect each other .
There 's no doubt about it .
There 's a certain , sombre reverence , and profound respect .
It just comes through . ]
Steve :
When Bill and I started we were the youngest guys in the room .
Now I 'm the oldest guy in the room .
That 's why I love being here .
Steve quotes the Beatles .
" You and I have memories longer than the road ahead . "
Everyone awwwws ... and now there 's a standing ovation .Q:
What will you two find ground on in terms of policy in the 2008 elections ?
Steve :
We 've got some pretty big problems .
Most are bigger than anything Silicon Valley can contribute .
Steve 's talking about alternative energy and our dependency on foreign oil .
Kara : are you investing in energy ?
Bill : Some .
Kara :
So that could be a lot .
[ Laughs ] Q about standards and convergence devices .
Steve : Bill and I can agree we can get it down to two !
Bill :
The marketplace is great at allowing diversity when it should , and allowing it to go away when it should .
Steve :
And allowing it back sometimes !
Harrrrr .
Laughs .Q about their legacies .
Applause for Bills charity work , huge huge applause .
Does Steve envy Bill 's second act ?
Steve : Bill 's goal is n't to be the richest guy in the cemetary .
... I look at us as two of the luckiest guys on the planet ... we 've found what we loved to do at the right place at the right time .
Your family and that , what more can you ask for ?
Q asking about a single piece of advice for a new entrepreneur .
Bill is talking about economies of scale , and wanting to do great things , no worry about growth and money so much .
Love of the game !
Steve :
It 's really hard .
If you do n't love it you 're gonna give up .
It 's a lot of hard work , it 's a lot of worrying .
Love it , have passion .
You 've got to be a really good talent scout .
Build and organization that can build itself .
Q about what they 've learned and what they could have learned from the other guy .
Bill : I 'd give a lot to have Steve 's taste .
Laughter .
Intuitive taste and products .
The way he does things is just different .
Just ... wow .
Steve :
We were n't so good with partnering with people .
Bill and Microsoft were really good at it .
...
Steve :
We 're up to a million personal training sessions a year , a lot of them are seniors .
Last question !
About ... the metaverse ?
Oook .
Asking about the next 5 - 10 years .
Bill : I do n't think Steve 's going to announce his transporter .
Laughter .
Steve : I do n't know , and that 's what makes it exciting to go into work every day .
They 're wrapping up ... shall we recap ?
Steve , calculating , articulate , very guarded , playing his hand very close to the chest .
Bill , very friendly , very open , surprisingly accessible .
Both so clearly in love with what they do .
These two guys are one in a million , and it 's totally clear they 've never respected anyone else quite like they respect each other .
The Beatles play them off , another standing ovation .
We 're out folks , g'night !
Parsing floating point numbers
The first task is extending the LispVal type to grok floats .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
type LispInt = Integer type LispFloat = Float -- numeric data types data LispNum = Integer LispInt | Float LispFloat -- data types data LispVal = Atom String | List [ LispVal ] | DottedList [ LispVal ] LispVal | Number LispNum | Char Char | String String | ...
The reason for using the new LispNum type and not just throwing a new Float Float constructor in there is so that functions can accept and operate on parameters of any supported numeric type .
First the floating point numbers need to be parsed .
For now I only parse floating point numbers in decimal because the effort to parse other bases is too great for the benefits gained ( none , for me ) .
ElSchemo now parses negative numbers so I 'll start with 2 helper functions that are used when parsing both integers and floats :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
parseSign :: Parser Char parseSign = do try ( char ' - ' ) < | > do optional ( char '+ ' ) return '+ '
applySign :: Char -> LispNum ->
LispNum applySign sign n = if sign == ' -' then negate n else n
parseSign
is straightforward as it follows the convention that a literal number is positive unless explicitly marked as negative with a leading minus sign .
A leading plus sign is allowed but not required .
applySign
takes a sign character and a LispNum and negates it if necessary , returning a LispNum .
Armed with these 2 functions we can now parse floating point numbers in decimal .
Conforming to R5RS an optional #d prefix is allowed .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
parseFloat :: Parser LispVal parseFloat = do optional ( string " #d " ) sign <- parseSign whole <- many1 digit char '. ' fract <- many1 digit return .
Number $ applySign sign ( make Float whole fract ) where make Float whole fract =
Float .
fst . head .
readFloat $ whole ++ " . " ++ fract
The first 6 lines should be clear .
Line 7 simply applies the parsed sign to the parsed number and returns it , delegating most of the work to make Float .
makeFloat in turn delegates the work to the readFloat library function , extracts the result and constructs a LispNum for it .
The last step for parsing is to modify parseExpr to try and parse floats .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14
-- Integers , floats , characters and atoms can all start with a # so wrap those with try .
-- ( Left factor the grammar in the future ) parseExpr :: Parser LispVal parseExpr = ( try parseFloat ) < |> ( try parseInteger ) < |> ( try parseChar ) < |> parseAtom < |> parseString < |> parseQuoted < |> do char '(' x <- ( try parseList ) < |> parseDottedList char ' ) ' return x < | > parseComment
Displaying the floats
That 's it for parsing , now let 's provide a way to display these suckers .
LispVal is an instance of show , where show = showVal so showVal is our first stop .
Remembering that LispVal now has a single Number constructor we modify it accordingly :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
showVal ( Number n ) = showNum n showNum :: LispNum ->
String showNum ( Integer contents ) = show contents showNum ( Float contents ) = show contents instance Show LispNum where show = showNum
One last , and certainly not least , step is to modify eval so that numbers evaluate to themselves .
eval env val@( Number _ ) = return val
There 's a little more housekeeping to be done such as fixing integer ? , number ? , implementing float ?
but I will leave those as an exercise to the reader , or just wait until I share the full code .
As it stands now floating point numbers can be parsed and displayed .
If you fire up the interpreter and type 2.5 or - 10.88 they will be understood .
Now try adding them :
(+ 2.5 1.1 ) Invalid type : expected integer , found 2.5
Oops , we do n't know how to operate on floats yet !
Operating on floats
Parsing was the easy part .
Operating on the new floats is not necessarily difficult , but it was more work than I realized it would be .
I do n't claim that this is the best or the only way to operate on any LispNum , it 's just the way I did it and it seems to work .
There 's a bunch of boilerplate necessary to make LispNum an instance of the required classes , Eq , Num , Real , and Ord .
I do n't think I have done this properly but for now it works .
What is clearly necessary is the code that operates on different types of numbers .
I think I 've specified sane semantics for coercion .
This will be very handy shortly .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70
lispNumEq :: LispNum -> LispNum ->
Bool lispNumEq ( Integer arg1 ) ( Integer arg2 ) = arg1 == arg2 lispNumEq ( Integer arg1 ) ( Float arg2 ) = ( fromInteger arg1 ) == arg2 lispNumEq ( Float arg1 ) ( Float arg2 ) = arg1 == arg2 lispNumEq ( Float arg1 ) ( Integer arg2 ) = arg1 == ( fromInteger arg2 ) instance Eq LispNum where ( == ) = lispNumEq lispNumPlus :: LispNum -> LispNum -> LispNum lispNumPlus ( Integer x ) ( Integer y ) = Integer $ x + y lispNumPlus ( Integer x ) ( Float y ) = Float $ ( fromInteger x ) + y lispNumPlus ( Float x ) ( Float y ) = Float $ x + y lispNumPlus ( Float x ) ( Integer y ) = Float $ x + ( fromInteger y ) lispNumMinus :: LispNum -> LispNum -> LispNum lispNumMinus ( Integer x ) ( Integer y ) = Integer $ x - y lispNumMinus ( Integer x ) ( Float y ) = Float $ ( fromInteger x ) - y lispNumMinus ( Float x ) ( Float y ) = Float $ x - y lispNumMinus ( Float x ) ( Integer y ) = Float $ x - ( fromInteger y ) lispNumMult :: LispNum -> LispNum -> LispNum lispNumMult ( Integer x ) ( Integer y ) = Integer $ x * y lispNumMult ( Integer x ) ( Float y ) = Float $ ( fromInteger x ) * y lispNumMult ( Float x ) ( Float y ) = Float $ x * y lispNumMult ( Float x ) ( Integer y ) = Float $ x * ( fromInteger y ) lispNumDiv :: LispNum -> LispNum -> LispNum lispNumDiv ( Integer x ) ( Integer y ) = Integer $ x `div` y lispNumDiv ( Integer x ) ( Float y ) = Float $ ( fromInteger x ) / y lispNumDiv ( Float x ) ( Float y ) = Float $ x / y lispNumDiv ( Float x ) ( Integer y ) = Float $ x / ( fromInteger y ) lispNumAbs :: LispNum -> LispNum lispNumAbs ( Integer x ) = Integer ( abs x ) lispNumAbs ( Float x ) = Float ( abs x ) lispNumSignum :: LispNum -> LispNum lispNumSignum ( Integer x ) = Integer ( signum x ) lispNumSignum ( Float x ) = Float ( signum x ) instance Num LispNum where (+ ) = lispNumPlus ( -) = lispNumMinus (*) = lispNumMult abs = lispNumAbs signum = lispNumSignum fromInteger x = Integer x lispNumToRational :: LispNum ->
Rational lispNumToRational ( Integer x ) = toRational x lispNumToRational ( Float x ) = toRational x instance Real LispNum where toRational = lispNumToRational lispIntQuotRem :: LispInt ->
LispInt -> ( LispInt , LispInt ) lispIntQuotRem n d = quotRem n d lispIntToInteger :: LispInt ->
Integer lispIntToInteger x = x lispNumLessThanEq :: LispNum -> LispNum ->
Bool lispNumLessThanEq
( Integer x ) ( Integer y ) = x <= y lispNumLessThanEq
( Integer x ) ( Float y ) = ( fromInteger x ) <= y lispNumLessThanEq ( Float x ) ( Integer y ) = x <= ( fromInteger y ) lispNumLessThanEq ( Float x ) ( Float y ) = x <= y instance Ord LispNum where ( <= ) = lispNumLessThanEq
Phew , ok with that out of the way now we can actually extend our operators to work with any type of LispNum .
Our Scheme operators are defined using the functions numericBinop and numBoolBinop .
First we 'll slightly modify our definition of primitives :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
primitives :: [ ( String , [ LispVal ] -> ThrowsError LispVal ) ] primitives = [ ( " + " , numericBinop (+ ) ) , ( " - " , subtract Op ) , ( " * " , numericBinop ( * ) ) , ( " / " , floatBinop ( / ) ) , ( " mod " , integralBinop mod ) , ( " quotient " , integralBinop quot ) , ( " remainder " , integralBinop rem ) , ( " = " , numBoolBinop ( == ) ) , ( " < " , numBoolBinop ( < ) ) , ( " > " , numBoolBinop ( > ) ) , ( " /= " , numBoolBinop ( / = ) ) , ( " >= " , numBoolBinop ( > = ) ) , ( " <= " , numBoolBinop ( < = ) ) , ...]
Note that mod , quotient , and remainder are only defined for integers and as such use integralBinop , while division ( / ) is only defined for floating point numbers using floatBinop .
subtract
Op is different to support unary usage , e.g. (- 4 ) => - 4 , but it uses numericBinop internally when more than 1 argument is given .
On to the implementation !
First extend unpackNum to work with any LispNum , and provide separate unpackInt and unpack Float functions to handle both kinds of LispNum .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
unpackNum :: LispVal -> ThrowsError LispNum unpackNum ( Number ( Integer n ) ) = return $ Integer n unpackNum ( Number ( Float n ) ) = return $ Float n unpackNum notNum = throwError $ TypeMismatch " number " notNum unpackInt :: LispVal -> ThrowsError Integer unpackInt ( Number ( Integer n ) ) = return n unpackInt ( List [ n ] ) = unpackInt n unpackInt notInt = throwError $ TypeMismatch " integer " not Int unpackFloat :: LispVal -> ThrowsError Float unpackFloat ( Number ( Float f ) ) = return f unpack Float ( Number ( Integer f ) ) = return $ fromInteger f unpack Float ( List [ f ] ) = unpack Float f unpackFloat not Float = throwError $ TypeMismatch " float " notFloat
The initial work of separating integers and floats into the LispNum abstraction , and the code I said would be handy shortly , are going to be really handy here .
There 's relatively no change in numericBinop except for the type signature .
integralBinop and floatBinop are just specific versions of the same function .
I 'm sure there 's a nice Haskelly way of doing this with less repetition , and I welcome such corrections .
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
numericBinop :: ( LispNum -> LispNum -> LispNum ) -> [ LispVal ] -> ThrowsError LispVal numericBinop op singleVal@[_ ] = throwError $ NumArgs 2 singleVal numericBinop op params = mapM unpackNum params >>= return .
Number .

Number .
negate subtract
Op params = numericBinop ( -) params numBoolBinop :: ( LispNum -> LispNum -> Bool ) -> [ LispVal ] ->
ThrowsError LispVal numBoolBinop op params = boolBinop unpackNum op params
That was a bit of work but now ElSchemo supports floating point numbers , and if you 're following along then your Scheme might too if I have n't missed any important details !
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Many Americans fear they can do nothing to protect themselves from cancer , and they may be creating a self - fulfilling prophecy , U.S. researchers said on Thursday .

Many Americans fear they can do nothing to protect themselves from cancer , and they may be creating a self - fulfilling prophecy , U.S. researchers said on Thursday .
REUTERS / File
Their survey of more than 6,000 people found that nearly half -- 47 percent -- agreed that “ nearly everything causes cancer ” and that more than a quarter felt there was little they could do about it .
Yet an estimated two - thirds of cancer cases can be prevented with common - sense measures , such as not smoking , eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and avoiding too much sun , according to the American Association of Cancer Research and the National Cancer Institute .
“ They say , ‘ Well , there is nothing much you can do about it , ’ and , as our survey shows , they indeed do nothing about it , ” said Jeff Niederdeppe of the University of Wisconsin , who helped lead the study .
“ Yet we know that approximately 30 percent of cancer deaths are attributed to smoking , while 15 to 20 percent are linked to overweight and obesity .
Clearly , there are very specific things we can do to reduce our personal risk for getting cancer . ”
Niederdeppe and colleagues analyzed a National Cancer Institute survey that asked people whether they agreed with three statements about cancer .
About 47 percent of those surveyed agreed that “ it seems like almost everything causes cancer , ” while 27 percent agreed that “ there ’s not much people can do to lower their chances of getting cancer . ”
Most of all , Americans are confused , with 71.5 percent agreeing that “ there are so many recommendations about preventing cancer , it ’s hard to know which ones to follow , ” researchers wrote in their report , published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology , Biomarkers & Prevention .
People who agreed with at least one of the three statements were less likely than others to exercise weekly and eat five daily servings of fruits and vegetables , said Niederdeppe and colleagues .
Those who said there were too many recommendations were the most likely to smoke , and overall , less - educated people were more likely to hold one or more of the three beliefs .
Part of the problem could be the way medical research is reported , with one discovery at a time dribbling out and some findings contradicting others .
Cancer is the second - leading killer of people in the United States and most developed countries , after heart disease .
Half of all men and one third of all women will develop some type of cancer in their lifetime .

Solar panels and miniature wind turbines could soon become an officially - promoted part of the urban landscape .
Soaring energy bills , fears about insecure fuel supplies and concerns about climate change have already encouraged a growth in green energy schemes .
This week MPs will vote on proposals which would make it significantly easier for householders across the UK to generate their own power .
Tory moderniser , David Cameron , already has plans for a wind turbine on his London home while Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks also wants to install his own mini-windmill .
And the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Bill , which is facing its final parliamentary hurdles when it comes before the Commons on Friday , has got all - party support to promote " micro- generation " , such as solar and wind power .
Selling power
The bill would introduce official targets for the growth of micro-generation - and there would be a " buy - back " regulation in which householders who produce a surplus of power would be paid a fair price by energy suppliers .
A south London school with solar panels on its roof
Planning obstacles for small - scale renewable energy schemes would be reduced - and to meet targets , it 's been suggested local authorities could provide financial incentives for using renewable energy .
Labour backbencher Mark Lazarowicz , who is sponsoring the bill , says the " whole political atmosphere has changed " in the debate over energy and climate change .
" The argument is n't any more about whether we should use more renewable energy , but how we do it , " says Mr Lazarowicz .
Adding to the political pressure will be the government 's own strategy on micro-generation , due to be published before the end of the month .
Solar flair
One problem for householders wanting to erect wind turbines and solar panels is getting planning permission , and the energy minister is expected to make this easier .
The solar - powered roof of a sports centre in Chesterfield
" Before the advent of large - scale power stations , self - sufficiency in energy generation was the norm - water mills used to grind corn , coal - fired boilers providing heat .
Advances in technology mean that products are now available that allow the individual to regain this self - sufficiency , " Mr Wicks has argued .
So how would any of these energy schemes work in practice ?
Rowan Langley , who lives in north - west London , is ahead of the micro-generation game .
He set up a solar power generation system in his back garden , which produces between a third and a half of his electricity .
The panels cost about £ 400 to £ 500 each , he says .
Panellist 's blog
This provides enough power for his basic needs , such as lighting and running appliances , like the fridge and television .
If he wants to run something that needs more power , such as a washing machine , he switches to the mains supply .
Rowan Langley gets much of his electricity from solar panels
" It cost me the same as a big plasma TV would have done , but it is saving rather than costing me electricity , " he says .
To share his experiences and to help others , Mr Langley has his own solar power blog [ see Internet Links , above , right ] , recording how his DIY power system still functions on dark days in winter .
As well as cutting his fuel bills , Mr Langley sees this as a way of putting his environmental principles into practice .
And he enjoys the independence of being able to generate his own power .
" When it comes to decommissioning - think of the problems of a nuclear power station .
Decommissioning my power station will mean packing it away - and maybe selling parts of it on eBay , " he says .
The nuclear industry , for its part , supports renewable energy - but says it cannot alone provide for all the country 's energy needs .
Urban slip - streaming
The type of wind turbine that Mr Cameron is reported to be seeking is the D400 StealthGen , produced by the Nottingham - based Eclectic Energy , and costing £ 2,200 plus another £ 400 for installation .
The StealthGen wind turbine designed for residential areas
The company 's managing director , Peter Anderson , says there has been a huge surge in interest in these turbines , which have been designed specifically for unobtrusive , residential use .
The translucent rotor blades are 1.1 m in length and Mr Anderson says they are very quiet when operating .
An individual turbine should provide about a fifth of electricity needs - and it operates seamlessly with the mains supply .
Fashion might be part of the rising interest , as he says that for some people it's a " lifestyle statement " .
For others , it 's an expression of their environmental belief and for some it's a way of getting themselves a self - sufficient power supply .
Place in the sun
But we should n't be complacent .
Keith Barnham , professor of physics at Imperial College London , says that the UK has already been " crazily " slow in its development of solar power - and that so far we have had a poor record on serious sustained investment .
Solar power needs more investment , says Professor Barnham
Research investment is seven times greater in nuclear power - and he says that Germany , with similar sunlight levels , already has 30 times more solar panels on its roofs .
If the Germans continue to expand solar power at the same rate , in another six years they will be getting more electricity from solar power than the UK gets from its nuclear power stations , says Professor Barnham .
Increased investment in solar power would make the technology more efficient and cheaper , he says , in the way that mobile phone and computer technology has accelerated .
" We 've already fallen badly behind , " says Professor Barnham .
We 've had solar panels for our hot water for a couple of years , we 've yet to dabble in the power cells for elecricity - but we 're not wealthy , by any means .
Soon , they 'll pay for themselves , and that was our incentive .
We like saving money , and we do n't like destroying the world we live in .
If there needs to be a bigger incentive than that , then we really do have a problem .

About time too .
I have wanted more people to use renewables since 1991 when I first became aware of long - term sustainability .
There should be grants available - it'll cost a lot less in the long term !
Scott Ainslie , London
We have a solar heating system on our roof that generates all our hot water in summer and contributes significantly on bright winter days .
I 'd have thought it should be complusory on all public building .
Just think of the savings if you heated swimming pools this way !
Along with solar powered street lights , wind - powered motorway warning signs .
Val , Stamford , Lincs
The easier these things are to buy and install , the more people will buy them ... they 're a sound investment as all the time they 're running , they are saving money and not polluting the atmosphere .
When B&Q starts stocking them they will have arrived .
Angela Young , London
About time too !
There is so much potential for micro-generation , add some extensive energy efficiency and we can seriously cut our energy use with no pain .
Anyone want to start a campaign to get rid of standby on televisions ?
Angela Pingram , Nottingham
All electricity here in British Columbia is generated bu hydro- electric generators : consequently , we have some of the cheapest electricity in North America .
Investment in green and renewable energy sources is the right thing to do : the question is why it 's taken so long to do it .
Brian , Vancouver , Canada
I think it 's a great idea , and should be adopted nationwide - at first the technology should be subsidised to promote take - up , but eventually the cost of manufacture would go down as demand rises .
The other fundamental concept I would promote is solar panel roof tiles - instead of solar panels being placed on top of roofs , they should be built in as the roof on new build houses .
At the moment , a possible reason why planning applications fail is because they are sometimes unsightly - which can easily be remedied .
Dan , Northampton
I would love to use solar / wind generation but I live in a listed building in a conservation area , so I have no chance !
Jeff Tutton , Northiam / Rye
Cost is the major factor .
If a wind turbine could save me a fifth to half of my electricity usage , and cost only £ 300 , I would seriously consider them .
But at the moment at £ 2,000 + the cost is totally out of most people 's league .
Alex Moon , Reading
Why has n't the government made it compulsory for all new build houses to have some sort of solar system fitted ?
With the number of houses John Prescott is inflicting on us this could make a vast difference to our energy and environmental problems .

William Haynes II , the Pentagon ’s general counsel , has been closely involved in shaping some of the Bush administration ’s most legally and morally objectionable policies , notably on the use of torture .
The last thing he is suited to be is a federal judge , but that is just what President Bush wants to make him .
The Senate has been far too willing to rubber - stamp the president ’s extreme judicial nominees .
But there is reason to hope that strong opposition to Mr. Haynes , including from the military , may block this thoroughly inappropriate choice .
Mr. Haynes has been nominated for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit , based in Richmond , Va. , a court that has heard some of the most important cases about the constitutional limits on the war on terror .
This is a subject on which Mr. Haynes has no business posing as an impartial jurist .
He has for years been part of a small group of insiders who have mapped out the Bush administration ’s policies on questioning detainees and declaring American citizens to be “ enemy combatants . ”
The administration ’s policies in this area have been indecent and lawless , and the Supreme Court has repeatedly had to step in to rein them in .
Mr. Haynes was by many accounts a key player in the administration ’s development of its shamefully narrow definition of “ torture , ” which gave the green light for a wide array of abuses .
The decisions made in Washington cleared the way for abusive treatment of the detainees being held in Guantánamo Bay , and created the environment necessary for the Abu Ghraib torture scandal to occur .
It is disturbing that while low - level soldiers have been convicted for their actions at the Iraqi prison , Mr. Haynes has been rewarded with a coveted judicial nomination .
The administration likes to blame opposition to its judicial nominees on “ liberal activists , ” but Mr. Haynes ’s most high - profile opposition comes from the military itself .
Twenty retired military officers , including a retired Army colonel who served as chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell , wrote to the Senate to express their concern that the policies Mr. Haynes helped develop “ compromised military values , ignored federal and international law and damaged America ’s reputation and world leadership . ”
The officers expressed their “ deep concern ” about his fitness for the court .
A Japanese naval officer unwittingly leaked top - secret data on an advanced US military system when swapping porn files at work , a newspaper said today .
The Yomiuri Shimbun said the data was leaked when the petty officer second class had copied pornographic images -- accompanied by the sensitive files -- from a colleague 's computer and circulated them to a third officer .
The data found on the officer 's computer included formulas for the Aegis interceptor system and data on its radar 's capacity to track several targets at once , the Yomiuri said .
This is such a part of their culture , that even rap groups have videos on 419 , and on both sides of the argument .
One one side they rap about how much money they make & how stupid Americans are .
There ’s also groups singing about how not everyone from African countries are scammers .
I ’m not going to post them here .
You guys are all ‘ ethical ’ hackers .
You can find them .
Another way to find out more is to watch McAfee ’s Stop H*Commerce site with a documentary and other info on this very subject .

US moves to seize the gold
Someone pointed out that the indictment unsealed last week against e-gold , etc includes this clause :
78 .
As a result of the offenses alleged in Counts One and Three of this indictment , the defendants E - GOLD , LTD . , GOLD & SILVER RESERVE , INC . , DOUGLAS JACKSON , REID JACKSON , and BARRY DOWNEY shall forfeit to the United States any property , real or personal , involved in , or traceable to such property involved in money laundering , in violation of Title 18 , United States Code , Section 1956 , and in operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business , in violation of Title 18 , United States Code , Section 1960 ; including , but not limited to the following : ( a ) The sum of money equal to the total amount of property involved in , or traceable to property involved in those violations .
Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2 ( b ) ( 1 ) . ( b )
All the assets , including without limitation , equipment , inventory , accounts receivable and bank accounts , of E - GOLD , LTD . , and GOLD & SILVER RESERVE , INC . , whether titled in those names or not , including , but not limited to all precious metals , including gold , silver , platinum , and palladium , that " back " the e-metal electronic currency of the E - GOLD operation , wherever located .
If more than one defendant is convicted of an offense , the defendants so convicted are jointly and severally liable for the amount derived from such offense .
By virtue of the commission of the felony charged in Counts One and Three of this indictment , and and all interest that the defendant has in the property involved in , or traceable to property involved in money laundering is vested in the United States and hereby forfeited to the United States pursuant to Title 18 , United States Code , Section 982( a ) ( 1 ) .
( My emphasis .
I included the whole clause , intending to allow each to form their own opinions .
Of course , you and I should read the whole thing ... )
A little background .
In the gold community , it is dictum that the US is no respecter of property rights .
Twice in the 20th century , the financial rebels will point out , the US seized the gold of its private citizens , generally as a result of its own bad management of the currency , and trying to stop people from fleeing the over - inflated dollar .
In this case , the US government is seeking to seize all of the gold held within the system as reserves to the currency , without due regard to the operation of property rights for the rest of the user base .
It would seem an over - broad reaching by the government , but sadly , expected and unsurprising to the digital currency community .
Whatever one thinks of e-gold , its operators and their actions , this is likely to reinforce the reputation of complete and utter disrespect that the US has for property rights around the world .
Unfortunately , this is no isolated case , but is in fact a concerted and long - lived programme by the US government to undermine property rights the world around .
The US - invented Anti Money Laundering ( AML ) regime stretches back 20 years or more to Ronald Reagan 's war on drugs , and is now sufficiently strong to destroy the effect of property laws , which latter are nothing if not strong .
AML takes implementing countries backwards in time and history .
Although England and its former colonies inherited strong property rights from the days of the Magna Carta , it is as well to realise that the English experiment may have been more an exception than the rule .
Consider Russia as counterpoint :
Since only the Tsar or the Party had property , no individual Russian could be sure of long - term usage of anything upon which to create wealth .
And it is the poor to whom the property right matters most of all because property is the poor man 's ticket into the game of wealth creation .
The rich , after all , have their money and their friends to protect their holdings , while the poor must rely upon the law alone .
" The Rape of Russia " was not ancient history according to Williamson 's 1999 testimony before the US House of Representatives , but living times : during the decade of the 1990s , the same group conspired with Russians to launder much of the residual value of the Russian people .
One would hope that the court is a little wise to the fact that if e-gold Ltd 's system was used for crimes , then there was also use for good purposes ; that is , it was the operators and some users that were responsible .
Normally we would expect the system to be placed under administration , and then a wholesale cleanout of any " bad " accounts to occur , under court supervision .
If not , the author above warned the US Congress what will happen to those who dismantle what property rights there are :
Connections
In the absence of property , it was access - the opportunity to seek opportunity - and favor in which the Russians began to traffic .
The connections one achieved , in turn , became the most essential tools a human being could grasp , employ and , over time , in which he might trade .
Where relationships , not laws , are used to define society 's boundaries , tribute must be paid .
Bribery , extortion and subterfuge have been the inevitable result .
What marks the Russian condition in particular is the scale of these activities , which is colossal .
Russia , then , is a negotiated culture , the opposite of the openly competitive culture productive markets require .
It is fairly clear that the e-gold operation was presented to the world and operated as a property rights operation .
Although not without shenanigans , the very basis of the digital gold community has been a joyful expression of the right of property , and what good it can do when it is left to run free .
Unfortunately , the US government may have learnt too much from the Russian experience .
The substantial crime in the indictment is " property rights without a licence " and the fine for that is " seizing all the property . "
Welcome to the world of tribute ; bribery , extortion and subterfuge to follow .
Story Highlights • Vice President Dick Cheney accused Pelosi , Dems of validating al Qaeda
• Pelosi shot back that Cheney 's comment insulted troops
• America 's first female House Speaker called Cheney " out of touch "
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that she believes President Bush 's judgment on the Iraq war " is a little impaired . "
She also said his approach to Iraq is based on personal conviction , rather than political judgment .
" What I do n't think is that it is a political decision on the part of the president .
This is what he firmly believes , " Pelosi said in an interview with CNN's " Larry King Live . "
( Watch more of Pelosi 's interview )
" I just would hope that whatever he thinks about the war that he would also value the fact that the American people have lost confidence in him . "
( Watch how the Iraq war has changed public perception of Bush )
" I think his judgment is a little impaired on this war , with all due respect to the president and his good intentions , " she told King .
Pelosi also blasted a comment made last week by Vice President Dick Cheney that legislative moves by Pelosi and other House Democrats to oppose Bush 's war policy would " validate " al Qaeda 's strategy .
" What the vice president said is beneath the dignity of his office and beneath the dignity of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform , " Pelosi said .
" The vice president is in a place that is out of touch with the American people , out of touch with what so many generals are saying and out of touch with even a bipartisan majority in the Congress . "
The speaker confirmed she called Bush to complain about Cheney 's comments .
" The president had said to me ... that he would not tolerate any undermining of anybody 's patriotism or our intention to protect the national security , " she said .
" He said , ' Could you let me know if this happens ? '
So I wanted to let him know that it happened . "
Pelosi , a California Democrat , became the first female speaker in American history in January .
Asked by King what about the job has most surprised her , she replied " the overwhelming show of enthusiasm across the country from women of all ages -- young girls to women my age -- who say they never thought that they 'd see the day . "
President Bush issued a formal national security directive Wednesday ordering agencies to prepare contingency plans for a surprise , “ decapitating ” attack on the federal government , and assigned responsibility for coordinating such plans to the White House .
The prospect of a nuclear bomb being detonated in Washington without warning , whether smuggled in by terrorists or a foreign government , has been cited by many security analysts as a rising concern since the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
The order makes explicit that the focus of federal worst - case planning involves a covert nuclear attack against the capital , in contrast with Cold War beliefs that a long - range strike would be preceded by a notice of minutes or hours as missiles were fueled and launched .
“ As a result of the asymmetric threat environment , adequate warning of potential emergencies that could pose a significant risk to the homeland might not be available , and therefore all continuity planning shall be based on the assumption that no such warning will be received , ” states the 72 - paragraph order .

The statement added , “ Emphasis will be placed upon geographic dispersion of leadership , staff , and infrastructure in order to increase survivability and maintain uninterrupted Government Functions . ”
After the 2001 attacks , Bush assigned about 100 senior civilian managers to secretly rotate to locations outside of Washington for weeks or months at a time to ensure the nation ’s survival , a shadow government that evolved based on long - standing “ continuity of operations plans . ”
Since then , other agencies including the Pentagon , the office of the Director of National Intelligence and CIA have taken steps to relocate facilities or key functions outside of Washington , citing factors such as economics or the importance of avoiding Beltway “ group - think . ”

Who needs crude oil when you ’ve got cheap coconuts ?

An Australian entrepreneur based in the Solomons Islands is producing fuel and profits from the fruit he sells locally for 70 U.S. cents a liter , slightly less than the price of regular fuel .
John Wolrath , who owns Solomon Tropical Products , moved to the tropical islands 12 years ago and opened six saw mills .
But political instability forced him to shut up shop and search for other opportunities .
“ There were all these coconuts not being utilized , there was no coconuts being picked up at all , ” he said .
“ They were just going to rot under the tree .
And then I heard about coconut oil .
So I decided to buy a small coconut mill that would do about a thousand liters of oil in a 24 - hour period .
And I ’m going to make my fortune out of this small mill . ”
Wolrath ’s coconut fuel pumps are always busy with customers attracted by cheaper prices and the environmental plus .
The Solomons , once a British protectorate , has about 500,000 people scattered across a string of 992 small islands in the Pacific .
Most Solomon Islanders live on agriculture and fishing .
The Solomons spends millions of dollars a year importing diesel and other fuels .
The 20 - member South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission ( SOPAC ) says Pacific island states spend more than $ 800 million a year on fuel imports .
A SOPAC report said if these countries were to replace 50 percent of diesel imports with coconut oil then the region ’s average import bill would be cut by 10 percent .
Coconut oil can directly substitute diesel or be blended with it to create a less polluting biofuel .
The Philippines , the world ’s largest coconut oil exporter , this week introduced a one percent coconut blend diesel .
Governments around the world are mandating biofuel use to improve domestic energy security and cut greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels , though most biofuels come from other sources such as sugar cane , corn or palm oil .
Lacking capital to expand his business , Wolrath has appealed to aid organizations to help .
So far , he has not received any , but aims to continue producing his environmentally - friendly fuel .
“ If the aid donors get behind it , we could be producing 10 tonnes a day of eco-friendly coconut , or coco bio - diesel , which is 100 percent green , ” he said .
Australia is spending about $ 700 million to maintain peace in the Solomons after the nation came close to collapse due to violence and mismanagement .
A tsunami hit the islands in April .

Lesbians may have more motivation , say the researchers
The figures are derived from the official Labour Force Survey , which since 1996 has collected information on gay individuals who live together .
But the researchers who conducted the analysis say there is no clear cut explanations for the startling pay premium enjoyed by lesbians .
" Everybody speculates about that , " says co-author Alan Marin of the London School of Economics .
" There are various possibilities , the most likely relates to child bearing .
" When employers consider recruiting for high - paying jobs they are less likely to hire women who tend to go off and have babies at inopportune moments . "
More motivation ?
The pay gap could also highlight the economic cost of childbirth in another way , he believes .
They might want to prove themselves as good as men , by working hard and being enthusiastic
Report co-author Dr Reza Arabsheibani
" It 's known that women suffer a big fall off in pay , once they have children .
" This is to do with women who go into part time work , once they return , and they also tend to drop into less favourable occupations . "
Another intriguing possibility is that homosexual women are more motivated to succeed in the work place .
Report co-author Dr Reza Arabsheibani , of Swansea University , speculates that lesbian women might even have a particular personality type .
" They might want to prove themselves as good as men , by working hard and being enthusiastic , " he argues .
Greater control
Dr Arabsheibani also singles out another disadvantage for straight women who take time off for child - rearing - they miss out on update training , and their skills fall behind colleagues who stay at work .
" We know pay is positively related to formal education and learning on the job , " he says .
" The discontinuity in their working life could have negative effect on the pay of women . "
A more speculative explanation , advanced by one gay activist , related to the way gay women have children through IVF .
He felt this might give lesbians greater control over when they had children , and they could time childbirth to fit in with a lull in their , or their partner 's , career .
More educated
But whatever the reasons , the effect is not just evident in the UK .
A similar pay premium is enjoyed by lesbians in the States , according to the authors , but not to the same extent .
In related work , they report that homosexual women in the USA also earn more than comparable straight women , although the gap is around 14 % .
However the message for gay men is less encouraging , as the " gay pay effect " works in reverse , and they earn less than comparable straight men .
In the UK the pay gap is 1 % , in the States researchers say the penalty is around 9 % .
The research also highlights other differences in gay employment patterns .
In both the USA and UK same sex couples are on average younger and more highly educated than heterosexual couples .
And they tend to concentrate in selected areas , with a high share of same - sex couples in California , and London .

It was a gloomy April for nation 's retailers / Gap sales off 16 % for month compared with last year , when Easter was later 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
Retailers reaped the rewards in March of an early Easter but paid the price for it in April .
Sales at stores open at least a year , known as same - store sales , fell by a record 2.4 percent in April , the worst since the International Council of Shopping Centers started tallying the monthly numbers in 1970 .
Shoppers had flocked to stores in March in preparation for Easter on April 8 , which bumped up same - store sales by 5.9 percent
Many chains had warned that April would be bad because Easter came later in the month last year , but even they were surprised by the results .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
Gap , which enjoyed a same - store sales gain of 6 percent in March , suffered a 16 percent drop in same - store sales in April .
Sabrina Simmons , senior vice president of corporate finance for the San Francisco retailer , said merchandise margins were significantly below last year because of markdowns at Gap stores .
The division posted a same - store sales decrease of 14 percent compared with a 2 percent decline the previous year .
Same - store sales at Old Navy fell by 20 percent compared with a 6 percent decline a year ago .
And same - store sales at Banana Republic , the company 's only brand that has been performing well , fell by 13 percent compared with a 1 percent increase last year .
Christine Chen , an analyst for Needham and Co. , said the importance of Easter -- and all the spending that comes with it -- cannot be understated .
The National Retail Federation estimates that the holiday generates about $ 12.6 billion in sales , behind Christmas , Mother 's Day and Valentine 's Day .
" When that week moves around in the month , it causes huge issues with traffic , " Chen said .
Strong performers like American Eagle and Abercrombie & Fitch , which some analysts believed would come out on top , were not immune to the Easter shift .
April same - store sales at American Eagle dropped by 10 percent and at Abercrombie & Fitch by 15 percent .
Sectors like luxury stores , wholesale clubs and department stores posted positive numbers in April , although Federated 's same - store sales slipped by 2.2 percent and J.C. Penney 's by 4.7 percent .
Wal - Mart 's same - store sales tumbled by 4.6 percent while Target 's dropped by 6.1 percent .
Michael Niemira , chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers , said that even when taking the Easter shift into consideration , this year has been particularly bad compared with last year .
The average for same - stores sales in March and April combined works out to a 1.8 percent increase versus a 4.3 percent increase last year for the same period .
" That 's a significant difference , " Niemira said .
" It just reflects the real weakness in the numbers . "
This year 's combined average for the two months is the lowest it has been since 2003 .
Niemira said that while weather plays a factor -- with March being unseasonably warm and April unseasonably cold this year -- the bigger culprit is the economy .
" I think it 's the housing ripple effect impacting the retail sector , " he said , pointing to falling home prices as the reason for weaknesses in furniture and consumer electronics sales .
" There 's less demand . "
Gas prices might also have a hand in the retail sector 's slowing sales , but Niemira expects them to be more of a factor in May and June , when they are expected to climb even higher .

The Gimli Glider Incident
from an article published in Soaring Magazine by Wade H.Nelson
If a Boeing 767 runs out of fuel at 41,000 feet what do you have ?
Answer : A 132 ton glider with a sink rate of over 2000 feet - per-minute and marginally enough hydraulic pressure to control the ailerons , elevator , and rudder .
Put veteran pilots Bob Pearson and cool - as - a- cucumber Maurice Quintal in the in the cockpit and you 've got the unbelievable but true story of Air Canada Flight 143 , known ever since as the Gimli Glider .
Flight 143's problems began on the ground in Montreal .
A computer known as the Fuel Quantity Information System Processor manages the entire 767 fuel loading process .
The FQIS controls all of the fuel pumps and drives all the 767's fuel gauges .
Little is left for crew and refuelers to do but hook up the hoses and dial in the desired fuel load .
But the FQIS was not working properly on Flight 143 .
The fault was later discovered to be a poorly soldered sensor .
A highly improbable , one - in - a- million sequence of mistakes by Air Canada technicians investigating the problem defeated several layers of redundancy built into the system .
This left Aircraft # 604 without working fuel gauges .
In order to make their flight from Montreal to Ottawa and on to Edmonton , Flight 143 's maintenance crew resorted to calculating the 767's fuel load by hand .
This was done using a procedure known as dripping the tanks .
" Dripping " could be compared to calculating the amount of oil in a car based on the dipstick reading .
Among other things , the specific gravity of jet fuel is needed to make the proper drip calculations .
The flight crew had never been trained how to perform the drip calculations .
To be safe they re-ran the numbers three times to be absolutely , positively sure the refuelers had n't made any mistakes ; each time using 1.77 pounds / liter as the specific gravity factor .
This was the factor written on the refueler 's slip and used on all of the other planes in Air Canada 's fleet .
The factor the refuelers and the crew should have used on the brand new , all - metric 767 was .8 kg / liter of kerosene .
After a brief hop Flight 143 landed in Ottawa .
To be completely safe , Pearson insisted on having the 767 re-dripped .
The refuelers reporting the plane as having 11,430 liters of fuel contained in the two wing tanks .
Pearson and Quintal , again using the same incorrect factor used in Montreal , calculated they had 20,400 kilos of fuel on board .
In fact , they left for Ottawa with only 9144 kilos , roughly half what would be needed to reach Edmonton .
Lacking real fuel gauges Quintal and Pearson manually keyed 20,400 into the 767's flight management computer .
The flight management computer kept rough track of the amount of fuel remaining by subtracting the amount of fuel burned from the amount ( they believed ) they had started with .
Their fate was now sealed .
According to Pearson , the crew and passengers had just finished dinner when the first warning light came on .
Flight 143 was outbound over Red Lake Ontario at 41,000 feet and 469 knots at the time .
The 767's Engine Indicator and Crew Alerting System beeped four times in quick succession , alerting them to a fuel pressure problem .
" At that point " Pearson says " We believed we had a failed fuel pump in the left wing , and switched it off .
We also considered the possibility we were having some kind of a computer problem .
Our flight management computer showed more than adequate fuel remaining for the duration of the flight .
We 'd made fuel checks at two waypoints and had no other indications of a fuel shortage . "
When a second fuel pressure warning light came on , Pearson felt it was too much of a coincidence and made a decision to divert to Winnipeg .
Flight 143 requested an emergency clearance and began a gradual descent to 28,000 .
Says Pearson , " Circumstances then began to build fairly rapidly .
"
The other left wing pressure gauge lit up , and the 767's left engine quickly flamed out .
The crew tried crossfeeding the tanks , initially suspecting a pump failure .
Pearson and Quintal immediately began making preparations for a one engine landing .
Then another fuel light lit up .
Two minutes later , just as preparations were being completed , the EICAS issued a sharp bong -- indicating the complete and total loss of both engines .
Says Quintal
" It 's a sound that Bob and I had never heard before .
It 's not in the simulator . "
After the " bong , " things got quiet .
Real quite .
Starved of fuel , both Pratt & Whitney engines had flamed out .
Pearson 's response , recorded on the cockpit voice recorder was " Oh F___ . "
At 1:21 GMT , the forty million dollar , state - of - the - art Boeing 767 had become a glider .
The APU , designed to supply electrical and pneumatic power under emergency conditions was no help because it drank from the same fuel tanks as the main engines .
Approaching 28,000 feet the 767's glass cockpit went dark .
Pilot Bob Pearson was left with a radio and standby instruments , noticeably lacking a vertical speed indicator - the glider pilot 's instrument of choice .
Hydraulic pressure was falling fast and the plane 's controls were quickly becoming inoperative .
But the engineers at Boeing had foreseen even this most unlikely of scenarios and provided one last failsafe&emdash ; the RAT .
The RAT is the Ram Air Turbine , a propeller driven hydraulic pump tucked under the belly of the 767 .
The RAT can supply just enough hydraulic pressure to move the control surfaces and enable a dead - stick landing .
The loss of both engines caused the RAT to automatically drop into the airstream and begin supplying hydraulic pressure .
As Pearson began gliding the big bird , Quintal " got busy " in the manuals looking for procedures for dealing with the loss of both engines .
There were none ..
Neither he nor Pearson nor any other 767 pilot had ever been trained on this contingency .
Pearson reports he was thinking " I wonder how it 's all going to turn out . "
Controllers in Winnipeg began suggesting alternate landing spots , but none of the airports suggested , including Gimli , had the emergency equipment Flight 143 would need for a crash landing .
The 767's radar transponder had gone dark leaving controllers in Winnipeg using a cardboard ruler on the radar screen to try and determine the 767's location and rate of descent .
Pearson glided the 767 at 220 knots , his best guess as to the optimum airspeed .
There was nothing in the manual about minimum sink - Boeing never expected anyone to try and glide one of their jet airliners .
The windmilling engine fans were creating enormous drag , giving the 767 a sink rate of somewhere between 2000 and 2500 fpm .
Copilot Quintal began making glide - slope calculations to see if they 'd make Winnipeg .
The 767 had lost 5000 feet of altitude over the prior ten nautical ( 11 statute ) miles , giving a glide ratio of approximately 11:1 .
ATC controllers and Quintal both calculated that Winnipeg was going to be too far a glide ; the 767 was sinking too fast .
" We 're not going to make Winnipeg " he told Pearson .
Pearson trusted Quintal , and immediately turned north .
Only Gimli , the site of an abandoned Royal Canadian Air Force Base remained as a possible landing spot .
It was 12 miles away .
It was n't in Air Canada 's equivalent of Jeppensen manuals , but Quintal was familiar with it because he'd been stationed there in the service .
Unknown to him and the controllers in Winnipeg , Runway 32L ( left ) of Gimli's twin 6800 foot runways had become inactive and was now used for auto racing .
A steel guard rail had been installed down most of the southeastern portion of 32L , dividing it into a two lane dragstrip .
This was the runway Pearson would ultimately try and land on , courting tragedy of epic proportions .
To say that runway 32L was being used for auto racing is perhaps an understatement .
Gimli's inactive runway had been " carved up " into a variety of racing courses , including the aforementioned dragstrip .
Drag races were perhaps the only auto racing event not taking place on July 23rd , 1983 since this was " Family Day " for the Winnipeg Sports Car Club .
Go-cart races were being held on one portion of runway 32L and just past the dragstrip another portion of the runway served as the final straightaway for a road course .
Around the edges of the straightaway were cars , campers , kids , and families in abundance .
To land an airplane in the midst of all of this activity was certain disaster .
Pearson and Copilot Quintal turned toward Gimli and continued their steep glide .
Flight 143 disappeared below Winnipeg 's radar screens , the controllers frantically radioing for information about the number of " souls " on board .
Approaching Gimli Pearson and Quintal made their next unpleasant discovery :
The RAT did n't supply hydraulic pressure to the 767's landing gear .
Pearson ordered a " gravity drop " as Pearson thumbed frantically through the Quick Reference Handbook , or QRH .
Quintal soon tossed the QRH aside and hit the button to release the gear door pins .
They heard the main gear fall and lock in place .
But Quintal only got two green lights , not three .
The nose gear , which fell forward against the wind , had n't gone over center .
Six miles out Pearson began his final approach onto what was formerly RCAFB Gimli .
Pearson says his attention was totally concentrated on the airspeed indicator from this point on .
Approaching runway 32 L he realized he was too high and too fast , and slowed to 180 knots .
Lacking divebrakes , he did what any sailplane pilot would do :
He crossed the controls and threw the 767 into a vicious sideslip .
Slips are normally avoided on commercial flights because of the the tremendous buffeting it creates , unnerving passengers .
As he put the plane into a slip some of Flight 143 's passengers ended up looking at nothing but blue sky , the others straight down at a golf course .
Says Quintal , " It was an odd feeling .
The left wing was down , so I was up compared to Bob .
I sort of looked down at him , not sideways anymore .
The only problem was that the slip further slowed the RAT , costing Pearson precious hydraulic pressure .
Would he be able to wrestle the 767's dipped wing back up before the plane struck the ground ?
Trees and golfers were visible out the starboard side passengers ' windows as the 767 hurtled toward the threshold at 180 knots , 30 - 50 knots faster than normal .
The RAT did n't supply " juice " to the 767's flaps or slats so the landing was going to be hot .
Pearson did n't recover from the slip until the very last moment .
A passenger reportedly said " Christ , I can almost see what clubs they are using . "
Copilot Quintal suspected Pearson had n't seen the guardrail and the multitude of people and cars down the runway .
But at this point it was too late to say anything .
A glider only gets one chance at a landing , and they were committed .
Quintal bit his lip and remained silent .
Why did Pearson select 32L instead of 32 R ?
Gimli was uncontrolled so Pearson had to rely on visual cues .
It was approaching dusk .
Runway 32L was a bit wider , having been the primary runway at Gimli in prior year .
Light stantions still led up to 32L .
And the " X " painted on 32L , indicating its inactive status , was reportedly quite faded or non-existent .
Having made an initial decision to go for 32L the wide separation of the runways would have made it impossible for Pearson to divert to 32 R at the last moment .
Pearson says he : " Never even saw 32 R , focusing instead on airspeed , attitude , and his plane 's relationship to the threshold of 32L . "
The 767 silently leveled off and the main gear touched down as spectators , racers , and kids on bicycles fled the runway .
The gigantic Boeing was about to become a 132 ton , silver bulldozer .
One member of the Winnipeg Sports Car Club reportedly was walking down the dragstrip , five gallon can full of hi-octane racing fuel in hand , when he looked up and saw the 767 headed right for him .
Pearson stood on the brakes the instant the main gear touched down .
An explosion rocked through the 767's cabin as two tires blew out .
The nose gear , which had n't locked down , collapsed with a loud bang ..
The nose of the 767 slammed against the tarmac , bounced , then began throwing a three hundred foot shower of sparks .
The right engine nacelle struck the ground .
The 767 reached the tail end of the dragstrip and the nose grazed a few of the guardrail 's wooden support poles .
( The dragstrip began in the middle of the runway with the guardrail extending towards 32L 's threshold )
Pearson applied extra right brake so the main gear would straddle the guardrail .
Would all the sports car fans all be able to get out of the way , or would Pearson have to veer the big jet off the runway to avoid hitting stragglers ?
The 767 came to a stop on it's nose , mains , and right engine nacelle less than a hundred feet from spectators , barbecues and campers .
All of the race fans had managed to flee the path of the silver bulldozer .
The 767's fuselage was intact .
For an instant , there was silence in the cabin .
Then cheers and applause broke out among Flight 143 's passengers .
They 'd made it ; they were all still alive .
But it was n't over yet .
A small fire had broken out in the nose of the aircraft .
Oily black smoke began to pour into the cockpit .
The fiery deaths of passengers in an Air Canada DC - 9 that had made an emergency landing in Cincinnati a month before was on the flight attendants ' minds and an emergency evacuation was ordered .
The unusual nose - down angle the plane was resting at made the rear emergency slides nearly vertical .
Descending them was going to be treacherous .
The only injuries that resulted from Pearson 's dead - stick landing of Flight 143 came from passengers exiting the rear emergency slide hitting the asphalt .
None of the injuries were life - threatening .
The fire in the aircraft 's nose area was battled by members of the Winnipeg Sports Car Club who converged on the plane with dozens of hand - held fire extinguishers .
Pearson had touched down 800 feet from the threshold and used a mere 3000 feet of runway to stop .
A general aviation pilot who viewed the landing from a Cessna on the apron of 32R described it as " Impeccable . "
The 767 was relatively undamaged .
Air Canada Aircraft # 604 was repaired sufficiently to be flown out of Gimli two days later .
After approximately $ 1 M in repairs , consisting primarily of nose gear replacement , skin repairs and replacement of a wiring harness it re-entered the Air Canada fleet .
To this day Aircraft # 604 is known to insiders as " The Gimli Glider . "
The avoidance of disaster was credited to Capt .
Pearson 's " Knowledge of gliding which he applied in an emergency situation to the landing of one of the most sophisticated aircraft ever built . "
Captain Pearson strongly credits Quintal for his cockpit management of " Everything but the actual flight controls , " including his recommendation of Gimli as an landing spot .
Captains Pearson and Quintal spoke at the 1991 SSA Convention in Albuquerque about their experiences .
Pearson was , at the time , still employed and flying for Air Canada , and occasionally flying his Blanik L - 13 sailplane on the weekends ; he has since retired to raise horses .
Maurice Quintal is now an A - 320 Pilot for Air Canada , and will soon be captaining 767's ; including Aircraft # 604 .

An amusing side - note to the Gimli story is that after Flight 143 had landed safely , a group of Air Canada mechanics were dispatched to drive down and begin effecting repair .
They piled into a van with all their tools .
They reportedly ran out of fuel en-route , finding themselves stranded somewhere in the backwoods of Manitoba

FCC plans relaxation of media ownership rules , watchdogs say John Byrne
Published : Wednesday May 31 , 2006 Print This | Email
This Move to allow more consolidation could come as soon as June 15 The Federal Communications Commission is poised to propose new media ownership rules that will allow media companies to own newspapers , television and radio stations in the same city , according to media watchdog groups .
The proposed rule would dissolve a longstanding policy that prohibited corporations from owning a television station and a daily newspaper in the same market .
The " cross ownership " rule , promulgated in 1975 , was enacted to ensure media diversity .
Individuals close to the Commission say the FCC will propose relaxing media ownership rules , possibly as soon as June 15 when the Commission next meets , the media watchdog Free Press says .
" All indications are that the next time the FCC meets  now that they have a full commission  we expect to see media ownership come up , and we think it will be the cross ownership rule as well as rules on how many TV stations companies can own in a single market , " Free Press spokesman Craig Aaron said .
A third Republican joined the FCC after Senate confirmation Friday .
The Commission was deadlocked 2 - 2 along party lines in recent months and the new commissioner gives Republicans a 3 - 2 majority .
FCC commissioners and the Commission 's media office did not respond to repeated requests for comment .
Common Cause , another political watchdog , believes cross - ownership will be a key focus when the commission meets .
" We 've have n't heard anything official from the FCC yet [ but ] we had expected that media ownership would come up as soon as they had a fifth commisioner on board , " said Common Cause director of media research Dawn Holian .
" Chairman Martin has indicated that newspaper broadcast cross ownership would be one of the first issues he wanted to deal with . "
FCC Chairman Kevin Martin told publishers at the Newspaper Association of America 's meeting in April that he was committed to overturning the ban on same - market cross ownership .
He argued that the ban is unfair to newspaper publishers in light of other communications ownership rules which allow businesses to own two TV stations and up to six radio stations in the same market .
" A lot has changed since those days of disco and leisure suits , " he said .
" Newspapers are the only medium specifically prohibited from owning a single broadcast station in its own market . "
The FCC overturned the cross -ownership ban in 2003 but its implementation was blocked by an appellate court .
At the time , both the House and Senate also criticized the decision to overturn the rule .
Watchdogs praise rule , conservatives split Aaron painted a scenario in which he envisioned " media company towns . "
Large media companies could " trade " newspapers and television stations in key markets , allowing companies to consolidate their newspaper and television operations and cut staff .
A recent example in the alternative press  which is not bound by ownership rules  occurred when the Village Voice shut down a paper in Cleveland in exchange for another company killing their paper in L.A. , giving both companies a monopoly in their respective markets .
" You 're seeing it happen somewhat on the alternative side but it's a lot more threatening when you see a company owning your major newspaper , a major broadcast outlet , two or three channels and eight radio stations , " Aaron said .
" That could be Sinclair , that could be News Corp. , that could be the New York Times . "
" That might be good for the bottom line of these big corporations but its obviously bad for local voices , bad for the quality of news and information and its bad for an informed democracy , " he added .
A Pew Research poll conducted in 2003 when the FCC last debated cross-ownership showed that Americans who knew about the rule were roughly ten to one against diluting it .
57 percent who had heard " little " about the proposal opposed it , and of those who heard nothing of the rule , 40 percent were against .
" Last time three million people contacted Congress and the FCC to oppose these rule changes , " Aaron said , " and of the comments received , 97 out of 100 were against letting big media get even bigger . "
Conservative organizations are divided .
In 2003 , the National Rifle Association came out in opposition to relaxing the rules ; in a " Media Monopoly Alert " letter to members , NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre dubbed the companies pushing for the change " gun-hating media giants . "
Others disagreed .
" Rather than media monopolies , consumers face a bewildering and unprecedented amount of choice , " the pro-business Heritage Foundation 's James Gattsuso wrote in 2003 .
" Instead , the real danger to Americans is that outdated and unnecessary FCC restrictions will limit improvements in media markets and technologies , limiting the benefits that they can provide . "
Both Common Cause and the Free Press say the FCC should listen to " public voices " when considering any change .
" I think that its important to remember that in 2003 two million Americans wrote into the FCC and objected to the rules that would have allowed for more consolidation , " Common Cause 's Holian remarked .
" The FCC I hope will this time listen to the public 's voices and [ hold ] more hearings than in 2003 when the public was really left out of the debate . "
Correction : Because of a communication error , Aaron 's organization was listed incorrectly in the first edition of this article .
Aaron speaks for Free Press , not the Center for Media and Democracy .
The two groups recently coordinated to put out a study showing that US TV networks routinely used " prepackaged news " segments without identifying their source .
Carnivores are some of the widest ranging terrestrial mammals for their size , and this affects their energy intake and needs .
This difference is also played out in the different hunting strategies of small and large carnivores .
Smaller species less than 15 - 20 kg in weight specialize on very small vertebrates and invertebrates , which weigh a small fraction of their own weight , whereas larger species ( > 15 - 20 kg ) specialize on large vertebrate prey near their own mass .
While carnivores around the size of a lynx or larger can obtain higher net energy intake by switching to relatively large prey , the difficulty of catching and subduing these animals means that a large - prey specialist would expend twice as much energy as a small - prey specialist of equivalent body size .
In a new article published by PLoS Biology , Dr. Chris Carbone and colleagues from the Institute of Zoology , Zoological Society of London reveal how this relationship might have led to the extinction of large carnivores in the past and why our largest modern mammalian carnivores are so threatened .
The authors provide a model of carnivore energetics in relation to predator and prey size , and compare the model predictions with observed estimates of metabolic rates and intake rates taken from animals in the wild .
By analyzing the balance between energy intake and expenditure across a range of species , the authors reveal that mammalian carnivores would not be able to exceed a body mass of one ton .
Their model predictions are consistent with the data we have .
Most mammalian carnivores are relatively small compared with the largest extinct terrestrial herbivorous mammals , such as the Indricothere , which weighed around 15 tons .
The largest existing carnivore , the polar bear , is only around half a ton , while the largest known extinct carnivores , such as the short - faced bear , weighed around one ton .
The authors also note that the largest terrestrial non-mammalian predators , such as Giganotosaurus and Tyrannosaurs , may have achieved their massive size by having a lower metabolic rate .
Indeed , previous estimates of total metabolic rate for these species are similar to those of a mammal weighing about a ton .
We know that the largest carnivores that exist today are particularly vulnerable to threats imposed by humans and have been shown to have higher rates of extinction in the fossil record than smaller species even prior to the evolution of man .
Carnivores at the upper limits of body mass would have been heavily reliant on abundant large prey to both minimize energy expenditure and maintain high rates of energy intake .
Slight environmental perturbations , anthropogenic or otherwise , leading to lower prey availability , could readily upset this energy balance .
It may have also contributed to the extinction of the largest carnivores and explain why the largest modern mammalian carnivores are so rare and vulnerable today .

LSD  The Problem - Solving Psychedelic
P.G. Stafford and B.H. Golightly
Chapter I. The LSD Crisis
The disease is striking in beachside beatnik pads and in the dormitories of expensive prep schools - it has grown into an alarming problem at U.C.L.A. and on the U.C. campus at Berkeley .
And everywhere the diagnosis is the same : psychotic illness resulting from unauthorized , nonmedical use of the drug LSD - 25 ...
By best estimates , 10,000 students in the University of California system have tried LSD ( though not all have suffered detectable ill effects ) .
No one can even guess how many more self - styled " acid heads " there are among oddball cult groups ....
What LSD actually has done ... is to produce " florid psychoses with terrifying visual and auditory hallucinations , marked depression , often with serious suicide attempts , and anxiety bordering on panic ....
The symptoms may recur in their original intensity long after the last dose of the drug .... "
Even junior acid heads boast of taking walloping overdoses .
" I 've taken as much as 500 micrograms , " says one youthful user .
" At least that 's what I paid for . "
Happily , addiction is not a problem .
Although repeat users need bigger doses to get an effect , they can " kick it cold " and suffer no withdrawal symptoms .
It has no physiologic effect .... ( Italics added . )
The spate of publicity regarding LSD was by no means limited to the popular media or to technical journals .
Over 2500 books and articles were already in existence when the controversy was at its height .
The majority of these were serious inquiries into the effects of the drugs , though few were impartial , however " scientific . "
This material constitutes a vast literature on the subject , to be sure .
It should be the source of enlightenment .
The reasons why it is not are somewhat bewildering .
In the first place , although the body of literature is large , it is at the same time narrow in scope , and upon initial examination this flaw is not apparent Initially one is overwhelmed by the prolific writing and its vitality , and inundated by the diversity of the reports .
But these reports themselves tend to be of only two types ( which primarily accounts for their narrowness ) : first - person narratives of LSD experiences , and clinical findings .
Neither offers completely satisfactory explanations for the drug 's action .
LSD easily lends itself to misinterpretation .
Even if the extremely difficult problem of communication frustrating to every experimenter were overcome , clear and plausible explanations of the drug 's action still would not result .
The phenomenon is too complex and too foreign to our culture to be handled in simplistic fashion .
Curiously , however , running like a small strain of precious ore through this deposit of prose are specific and impressive proofs for LSD 's revolutionary powers .
Unfortunately , most of this information seems to have been put down almost incidentally , sometimes almost apologetically , or even as an afterthought .
In the present work the primary interest is in mining the existing material and trying to locate a mother lode .
Thus , rather than just another comprehensive examination of LSD , this book is unique in its limited aims .
To date , no other book or article has concentrated its explorations in this area .
No LSD investigator , whether from the establishment or the underground , will deny that this chemical can , has and does solve some problems .
But what are these problems ?
They are to be found in all areas of human activity : business , pleasure , sickness , health , birth , death , ad infinitum .
Somewhere you will find in the vast body of LSD literature specific reference to the drug 's ability to aid in the alleviation of those countless problems by which man is beset .
But before undertaking a rigorous presentation of the evidence for LSD 's problem - solving capabilities , some basic principles of the drug 's action must be understood .

The government insists it is protecting children
The MPs fear a rise in the number of young children being taken into care in England and Wales is linked to pressure on councils to increase adoption rates .
Lib Dem MP John Hemming , who has tabled a Commons motion on the issue , said it was a " national scandal " .
The government said the courts decided on care cases but there had to be evidence a child was being harmed .
A spokesman for the Department for Education said there were " no targets relating to the numbers of children coming into care " .
But Mr Hemming argued that social services departments are under pressure to meet targets set by government on children in care being adopted .
The decision to bring a child into care must be made on the basis of their best interests
Department for Education
In an Early Day Motion , with cross-party support from 12 MPs , he warns of " increasing numbers of babies being taken into care , not for the safety of the infant , but because they are easy to get adopted " .
In 2000 , ministers set a target of a 50 % increase in the number of children in local authority being adopted by March 2006 .
According to the latest available figures , the number of " looked after " children being adopted had gone up from 2,700 in 2000 to 3,700 in 2004 , an increase of 37.7 % .
The biggest rise was in the one to four - year - old age range .
' Scandal '
These figures would be " laudable " if it meant children were being rescued from a life in care , said Mr Hemming .
But he said he had evidence from people who had contacted him , prevented from publication by contempt of court laws , that children were being separated from parents without proper grounds .
And he called on the government to reveal " how many of the children that are adopted would otherwise have remained with their birth parents " .
Mr Hemming pointed to figures showing an increase in the number of children aged under one being taken into care .
" A thousand kids a year are being taken off their birth parents just to satisfy targets .
It is a national scandal , " said the Lib Dem MP .
Transparency
He said children were increasingly placed under " care orders " - where they remain with their birth parents but are kept under supervision by social workers - rather than with foster parents .
And this supervision meant some social workers were " gradually taking them away from the parents , step by step , and giving them to someone else , " the Birmingham Yardley MP said .
He called for more transparency in the proceedings of Family Courts and an independent watchdog to scrutinise the work of social services departments .
In a statement , the Department for Education said : " The law is clear - children should live with their parents wherever possible and , when necessary , families should be given extra support to help keep them together .
" The decision to take a child into care is never an easy one , and it is a decision that is taken by the courts . "
' Best interests '
The statement went on : " In every case where a child is taken into care on a care order , the courts will have considered the evidence and taken the view that the child has been significantly harmed , or would be if they were not taken into care .
" The final decision on adoption rests with the courts and before a court makes such an important decision it must be convinced on the basis of the evidence that this is the best way to meet the child 's needs on a long - term basis .
" There are no government targets relating to the numbers of children coming into care .
The decision to bring a child into care must be made on the basis of their best interests . "
The British Association for Adoption and Fostering ( BAAF ) said it was " dangerous " to suggest children were being taken into care unnecessarily .
Chief executive David Holmes said : " Children come into care for many reasons including parental abuse and neglect .
The rise in the numbers of young children coming into care may be explained by a variety of factors including a rise in parental substance misuse . "
He pointed out that the decision to take a child into care was scrutinised by an independent children 's guardian and the courts .
Adoption is scrutinised by the guardian , the courts and an adoption panel .
Mr Holmes added : " If birth parents believe they have had their child taken into care unfairly , they should lodge a formal complaint with their local authority .
I believe that this is rare .
I certainly do not believe children are systematically being taken into care to meet adoption targets . "
Adoption targets were brought in to prevent children in care from waiting months or even years before finding an adoptive family .

You keep using " semantic " .
However , I do not think that that word means what you think it means .

There are all three of them different things .

No , sir .
You can not use the S word for that .
Here are the * SEMANTICS * of pattern matching in Perl :
When there 's more than one match , the first match found ( that is , the leftmost ) is the winner , with ties being resolved in favor of the longer string for maximal matches and the shorter string for minimal matches .
This is * not* an " implementational detail " .
These * are* the semantics .
You are asking for * different * semantics .
What you are doing is simply an attempt to impose a sloppy English - language description on the behavior of the code .
Just because you should happen to understand the English does not mean that this describes the code .
It 's like people thinking /<.*?>/ will find a tag because they are thinking in English , not Perl .
Of course it wo n't .
> I believe it it more intuitive , at the highest level .
" Intuitive " is another one of those words frequently bandied about that is nearly always misapplied .
WRONG : The frobnitz interface is more intuitive .
RIGHT : The nipple is the only intuitive human interface .
CORRECTION : From my own historical experiences and resulting biases , the frobnitz interface would have been more what I personally without regard to anyone else would have been expecting .
>>
From a different ( more implementation - oriented ) perspective , the current No , this is not " implementation - oriented " .
It is merely the semantics .
> Hopefully , we can have a rational discussion about whether this semantic > anomaly is real or imagined , what impact " fixing " it would have on the > implementation ( if it 's deemed real ) , and whether it 's worth " fixing " .
I do not expect you to be rational , because I do not think we can agree to your terms .
There is no semantic anomaly , anymore than thinking that <.*> or <.*?> finds an HTML tag is some sort of " semantic anomaly " .
It is the result of your mistranslating between English and code .
> Here 's where I see the disconnect happening .
I 'm approaching this from a > semantic perspective , asking myself " what should this match ( ideally ) ? "
No , you 're not .
Please stop abusing the S word .
It places you on no moral high ground whatsoever .

How Could Rove Not Know Emails Deleted ?
Okay , this is just a question , and it's based on an assumption or two , so take it for what it 's worth : Does Karl Rove 's claim that he thought the RNC was archiving all his e-mails make sense , given the fact that Rove was investigated in the Valerie Plame affair ?
His [ Rove 's ] understanding starting very , very early in the Administration was that those e-mails were being archived .
Responding to the recent news that many White House staffers -- including Rove and many of his underlings -- have used RNC e-mail accounts for official government business , and that e-mails on the RNC system prior to 2005 were routinely deleted after 40 days , Rove 's lawyer today said I construe that to mean that Rove thought until the last few days that the RNC e-mails were being archived .
If that construction is correct , my question is :
How come Rove did n't discover the fact that RNC e-mails were routinely deleted when he was being investigated by Patrick Fitzgerald regarding the Valerie Plame affair ?
For Rove not to have learned of the RNC deletions during the Fitzgerald investigation , it seems to me that at least one of the following would have to be true : Fitzgerald 's investigation somehow did not give Rove cause to go over his e-mails from the relevant portion of 2003 .
If he did go over his RNC e-mails for 2003 , Rove simply did n't notice that they had all been deleted .
Neither of those seems likely to me .
Am I missing something ?
Neither of those seems likely to me .
Am I missing something ?
Perhaps this is why the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics ( CREW ) in Washington sent a letter to Fitzgerald today asking him to reopen his investigation into the role that Rove may have played in the Plame affair .
I see your point , Lee. Did Fitz just ask for all the emails and Rove let lackeys handle it ?
If so , then he really might not have known .
Either way , I think that his underlings would n't have wanted to tell him even when they found out , if they did indeed find out , because facts are not rewarded in this administration at any level .
I just do n't think it matters .
The emails are a pronounced gap at an important historical moment in the integrity of this administration , so whether Rove knew about them not being archived or not , unless he had something directly to do with their deletion , seems irrelevant .
~A ! Hey !
I 've been looking for some journalist willing to discuss the Plame fiasco !
Is this " email " affair similar , in that no law was broken , but Democratics investigate anyway ?
As everyone ( with the exception of ignorant partisans ) now knows , Plame was not in a status which qualified her , or the CIA , to claim that she was " covert , " within the last 5 years .
Indeed , as even the purposefully ignorant radicals now know , no one in the White House ( including Rove ) was responsible for revealing her name and position with the CIA to the press !
It was Richard Armitage . . .
All the same , and knowing these basic facts , you as a " journalist " are here telling a literal lie ; leading the inference that some crime was done vis a vis Plame and that Rove was involved in no-crime !!!
I 'd be embarrassed . . . but for some , lying is part of being a member of a party that lies ; their gang . . .
" I 'd be embarrassed . . . "
As well you should be .
" ... but for some , lying is part of being a member of a party that lies "
Proving again that any basic propaganda machine begins with the principle that it must accuse its opponents of behaving the way the propagandists do ; that both muddies the issue and makes it seem that later accusations against the propagandists are merely retaliatory attacks .
My only question is , do you do this trolling voluntarily , or do they actually pay you ?

Well , if he did know and publicly said he did n't , that 's telling in itself , and leads immediately to a question of why he would deny knowing .
Anyway , something seems off here to me , but there is n't enough information to know what , or why .
It could be as simple as the media reports not being thorough about the explanation from Rove 's lawyer , though I find that hard to believe given the interest in this .
Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , specifically addresed Fitzgerald 's investigation while talking to the media about the missing e-mails .
According to news reports :
The prosecutor probing the Valerie Plame spy case saw and copied all of Rove 's e-mails from his various accounts after searching Rove 's laptop , his home computer , and the handheld computer devices he used for both the White House and Republican National Committee , Luskin said .
The prosecutor , Patrick Fitzgerald , subpoenaed the e-mails from the White House , the RNC and Bush 's re-election campaign , he added .
" There 's never been any suggestion that Fitzgerald had anything less than a complete record , " Luskin said .
That really does n't clarify anything .
Fitzgerald may have subpoenaed the RNC e-mails , but as we know , they were deleted .
Luskin 's comment simply does not tell us whether Fitzgerald knew there were deleted e-mails and , if he did know , whether he managed to obtain the missing e-mails from other sources .
Add in the mysterious references to RNC staff instituting a no-deletion rule specifically directed at Rove , and I have lots of questions .
Now let the trolls begin the insults & distortion .
Lee says , " Proving again that any basic propaganda machine begins with the principle that it must accuse its opponents of behaving the way the propagandists do ; that both muddies the issue and makes it seem that later accusations against the propagandists are merely retaliatory attacks . "
Who are you addressing ?
Certainly not me !
You provide your ' journalistic ' credentials by taking what I said out - of - context , in order to mock me with that invented criticism .
Then , turn around and lecture me with some completely senseless bs ???
You make yourself appear very callow .
" My only question is , do you do this trolling voluntarily , or do they actually pay you ? "
My comments are about politics and the various appearances and utterances made to advance that agenda of power .
My criticisms are also generalized , and are in reference to the political ' you , ' and any insult must thereby be assumed by the individual ' you , ' who might do so .
However , for the most part , replies in response are generally of a direct and personal nature , and as you do in this response .
That is so because your party has generated a policy of divisiveness from way before the year 2000 and Bush 's win .
It comes from years of resentment that your party no longer maintained the majority ' rule ' of Congress and the Whitehouse . . . circa 1953 and Eisenhower 's presidency .
. . .
It was n't Republicans he meant when he talked about the military / industrial complex . . .
It gained spiteful ' greatness ' when Nixon took office , and the Vietnam war was magically morphed into being a Republican war , and with Republicans now the war criminals , fascists and warmongers .
. .
Consequently now , any mention of the negative aspects of being a Democratic , constantly muckraking and partisan tool of the tactic of personal destruction . . . well of course they are the proverbial internet bte noire : the ' evil ' troll .
I notice one of your sychophantic partisan posters is already repeating your * label * as you pat yourself on the back for dismissing another commentator with your magical reasoning and two - pronged tactic : take them out of context and call them names !
Bravo !
What a mensch , and what a despicable troll am I . . .
If you 're not familiar with the term " troll " as it relates to internet discussion , here you go :
From the fishing term .
As a noun , synonymous with flamebait .
As a verb , to post controversial or provocative messages in a deliberate attempt to provoke flames .
So yes , calling you a " troll " is probably not quite accurate .
A " trollist " or " troller " , possibly , but since " troll " in this sense is not a noun but a verb , you are correct .
Do you in fact deny that your only intent on this site is to comment to get attention and derail any reasonable discussion ?
I call out Limbaugh , Hannity , and Coulter as racists , you say I want them led to death in gas chambers and to make soap from their skin .
I 'll completely leave alone the total and complete trivialization of 6 million deaths in your inane commentary on that one .
And then , of course , like all bullies , cowards , and liars , you retreat back into " it was hyperbole " or " I was joking , just making a point " .
You 've effectively drawn away any sensible debate with comments like these , and now when your comments come across , you would have us reasonably evaluate such statements ?
You would somehow expect us to ignore all the blatant trolling for attention why ?
~A! ~A ! makes excuses , " If you 're not familiar with the term " troll " as it relates to internet discussion , here you go : "
I 'm always amazed at the intellectual Georgie Porgys that populate the Democratic party .
This response is an attempt to run away from responsiblilty for your own speech in dehumanizing your correspondent , rather than even try to rebut the facts , observations and opinion on point of the subject at hand .
From the publisher , to the editor , to the dupes , like you , it is the same !
You ban dissent , redact it , besmirch it and dehumanize the messenger (s . )
Then , turn around and brag about being bloggers , journalists , sensitive , honest partisans , and all for nation and its security ; real patriots . . . even if censors and political muckrakers .
You all are actually a bunch whose faith is in the - end - justifies - the - means philosophy of life , and as practiced by every single socialist state / regime in the history ; China , USSR , NAZI Germany , North Korea , ad nauseam .
Even now , you are trying to think of some way you can further attack me , personally . . . is n't that right ?

Senate report shows intelligence community predicted post - war chaos in Iraq Nick Juliano
Published : Friday May 25 , 2007 Print This Email
This Prior to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 , the nation 's intelligence services warned the president that a military invasion of Iraq would fuel Islamist extremism and provide an opportunity for al Qaeda and Iran to exploit post- invasion disorder there , according to a new report released Friday .
The report undercuts several of President Bush 's key justifications for invading Iraq and exposes the extent to which the chaos the US currently finds itself in was predicted with often chilling accuracy .
" Today 's report shows that the intelligence community gave the administration plenty of warning about the difficulites we would face if the decision was made to go to war , " said Sen . John D. Rockefeller IV , chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , which released the report .
In a prepared statement , Rockefeller continued , " These dire warnings were widely distributed at the highest levels of government , and it's clear that the administration did n't plan for any of them . "
The 229 - page report , which includes declassified pre-war intelligence estimates , was posted Friday on the Intelligence Committee 's Web site .
Sen. Chuck Hagel , R - Neb. , one of his party 's leading war critics , said the committee 's report shows the intelligence committee " accurately predicted many aspects of the chaotic landscape that we see in Iraq today . "
He called for the US to work with all nations in the Middle East , including Iran and Syria , to succeed in Iraq .
The report says most pre-war intelligence focused on Saddam Hussein 's connection to terrorists , weapons of mass destruction and Iraqi military capabilities .
Although estimates of Saddam 's weapons capabilities were later revealed to be vastly overstated , the Senate committee says the intelligence community more accurately predicted the chaos that ensured in Iraq following Saddam 's ouster .
The intelligence community 's estimate -- outlined in the report -- that post - war transitioning to a free Iraq would be a lengthy , difficult and probably turbulent process clearly runs counter to rosy pictures the administration attempted to paint in the run-up to the war .
In addition to myriad pre-war predictions that US troops would be " greeted as liberators , " administration officials said that an overthrow of Saddam would lead to more peace and stability in the Middle East at large .
But a declassified National Intelligence Council report prepared in 2003 undercuts that assertion .
" The exemplar of a more politically liberal Iraq probably would not , by itself , be a catalyst for more wide - ranging political and economic change throughout the region , " the report reads .
Not only would Iraq 's liberation not lead to spreading Middle East democracy , but prolonged military involvment in Iraq would provide al Qaeda with increased opportunities to attack American interests , " increase popular sympathy for some terrorist objectives , " and " increase Tehran 's perception that the US is a threat , " according to the pre-war estimate .
" Sadly , the administration 's refusal to heed these dire warnings , and worse , to plan for them , has led to tragic consequences for which our nation is paying a terrible price , " Rockefeller said .
" Finally , the report shows that the administration was not forthcoming with the American people about the potential costs of going to war . "
The report released Friday joins at least a half - dozen other declassified pre-war intelligence estimates that have revealed gaps between what was being said within the administration and what the war 's architects were telling the American people .
 The wars devastating impact on the fight against al Qaeda and on our national security has been apparent for some time , " Sen .
Russ Feingold , D - Wisc. , an intelligence committee member and war opponent said in a prepared statement .
" That the Administration was warned of the negative consequences before the war shows just how reckless it was . 

「 最近の若者はダメだ」は昔から言われているが、特に今の若者はひどい。まず、当事者意識が完全に欠如している。さらに、独り立ちをしようとせず、常に何かに依存し、消費し、批判するだけの「お客さま」でいつづけようとしている。これはゆゆしき事態であり、日本社会のありかたにかかわる重大な問題である。
最近の若者は、定職に就きたがらない。あるいは、会社に入っても一定のポジションで身を立てようとしない。なぜなら、社会的なかかわりを、全て暫定的・一時的なものと見なしているからだ。
彼らに言わせると、本当の自分は別のところにあり、現実の自分は仮の姿に過ぎないんだそうだ。本当の自分は棚上げしておいて、いつまでも立場を替え、考えを変え、自分自身をも変身させる余地を残しておく。一貫した主義主張をもたないか、もたないふりをする。特定の党派、集団に全てを賭けることを避けようとする。
その結果、今の若者は、全ての価値観から離れた「自分という価値観」に従って生きようとする。これは、ヒッピー・スタイルに代表されるジーンズや長髪などの外見や、四無主義・「しらけ」といった態度に如実に表れている。若者は、いつまでたっても「まじめ」に取り組むことができず、目前の事象に刹那的で遊び的なかかわり方でしか関与することができない。
消費文化がそれを後押しする。何も生産していない一方で、受け取り、消費することに専念してよい社会的な猶予そのものが、情報化・消費社会の特性と期せずして一致したわけであるが、まさにこの動向によってモラトリアム心理は大規模に商業化され、若者は社会の大切な「お客さま」となったのである。
―――――― という評論を読んだ 。 「 モラトリアム人間の時代」（小此木啓吾）というやつ。途中で気づいた方もいるだろうが、本書は今から30年前、つまり1977年に書かれたものだ。欠けてる言葉は「ひきこもり」と「NEET」ぐらいで、あと「ネット」を足せば今でも立派に通用する。
もともと 、 「
昔も今と似たようなことを言っているんだろうなー」というつもりで読んだのだが、ここまで同じとは予想していなかった。30年前は「ジーンズ＋長髪」で、今なら「だらしな系＋茶髪」だろうが、「眉をひそめる」程度は似たようなもの。
仮に、 「 ひきこもり 」 や「 NEET 」が問題であるとしよう。そして、現代の若者の無気力・無関心が原因なのであれば、それを「是」として実践してきたのは、まさしく若者を叩いているオヤジ連中だ。そんな連中には、いささか使い古されたが次の言葉を贈る。
（ ´∀｀） ｵﾏｴﾓﾅ ｰ
オヤジ向けの雑誌などに「大人の…」という惹句ががある。わざわざ大人だと断っているということは、本当の大人ではないという証左だ。あるいは「大人の…」が魅力的に見えるぐらい成熟していないということ。まさに、「大人になること」を猶予してもらい、結局オトナになることなく年だけ取った人向けの宣伝文句。
これからは、オトナになれなかった年寄がじゃんじゃん出張ってくるだろう。かつて彼らが何と呼ばれていたかを知るために有用な一冊
…ただし論としてはgdgdなので要注意。記述の重複、無根拠の主張、非論理的展開、無意味な提案内容と、およそ論文としては大学入試小論文を下回るが、当時の知的レベルをうかがい知ることができて、二度おいしい。
おまけ。なかなか面白い一節があったので、引用する。

One Ring to Rule Them
The wholesale destruction of all of Lebanon by Israel and the US Pentagon does not make any sense .
Why bomb roads , bridges , ports , fuel depots in Sunni and Christian areas that have nothing to do with Shiite Hizbullah in the deep south ?
And , why was Hizbullah ’s rocket capability so crucial that it provoked Israel to this orgy of destruction ?
Most of the rockets were small katyushas with limited range and were highly inaccurate .
They were an annoyance in the Occupied Golan Heights , especially the Lebanese - owned Shebaa Farms area .
Hizbullah had killed 6 Israeli civilians since 2000 .
For this you would destroy a whole country ?
It does n’t make any sense .
Moreover , the Lebanese government elected last year was pro-American !
Why risk causing it to fall by hitting the whole country so hard ?
And , why was Condi Rice ’s reaction to the capture of two Israeli soldiers and Israel ’s wholesale destruction of little Lebanon that these were the “ birth pangs ” of the “ New Middle East ” ?
How did she know so early on that this war would be so wideranging ?
And , how could a little border dispute in the Levant signal such an elephantine baby ’s advent ?
Is n’t it because she had , like Tony Blair , been briefed about the likelihood of a war by the Israelis , or maybe collaborated with them in the plans , and also conceived of it in much larger strategic terms ?
I ’ve had a message from a European reader that leads me to consider a Peak Oil Theory of the US - Israeli war on Lebanon ( and by proxy on Iran ) .
I say , “ consider ” the “ theory ” because this is a thought experiment .
I put it on the table to see if it can be knocked down , the way you would preliminary hypotheses in a science experiment .
The European reader writes :
‘ When I was in Portugal I also watched a presentation by a guy who works for the ministry of energy in that country , a certain [ JFR ] .
He started his presentation with the growing need for oil in China and India .
He stressed that China wants to become the ‘ workshop ’ of the world and India the ‘ office ’ of the world .
both economies contributed combined some 44 % to world economy growth during 2001 - 2004 .
He compared the USA , Japan , India and China to giant whales constantly eating fish .
They had no fish near them so they started to move .
He explained that the Persian Gulf is the ‘ fish ground ’ , the ‘ gas station ’ of the world .
Later on he explained the . . . hypothesis . . . that says demand for oil will continue to grow .
also for natural gas , which is even better than oil .
Sadly the existing production is getting smaller , these fields are getting emptied .
[ One oil major ] seems to believe that the gap between demand and existing production will become so large by 2015 that economic growth cannot continue .
Yet there is hope on the horizon .
JFR strongly denied that there is going to be an oil peak .
He says , and the oil multis seem to agree with him [- my link , JRC ] , that there is more than enough untouched oil and natural gas .
The stupid thing : it is further to the east .
Partly in Russia , but most of all , in Iran .
JFR explained to the astonished audience that Iran was the most valuable country on the planet .
They have one of the biggest holdings of gas and oil reserves in the world .
second in gas , second in oil .
On top of that they have direct access to the Persian Gulf , the Arabian Sea and the Caspian Sea what makes them a potential platform for the distribution of oil and gas to South Asia , Europe and East Asia .
JRF called Iran ‘ the prize ’ . . .
The disaster in Lebanon actually was also part of JFR ’s presentation .
He explained that the US government is 100 % convinced , fanatically and completely convinced , that both , Hamas and Hizballah are creatures of Iran and that Iran uses them to undermine US goals in the region . . .
The presentation got kind of freaky then .
He said the US government wanted to stop state - controlled Iranian or Chinese ( or Indian ) companies from controlling the oil .
JFR says the US Government is convinced that this battle will decide the future of the world .
It sounded like he was talking about ‘ the one ring ’ in lord of the rings .
he who controls Iran controls them all . ‘
It is very important that some EU analysts see things this way .
They are in contact with their American counterparts , and may be reflecting a wider North Atlantic view and speaking more openly than is common in Washington .
It is true that Iran ’s regime is hostile to US corporate and investment interests .
Iran itself has substantial energy resources , many of them undeveloped , but they are locked up by state - owned Iranian companies .
Iran is astride the Oil Gulf , which has the majority of the world ’s proven gas and petroleum reserves .
Iran has a silkworm missile capability that could interfere with oil tankers in the Straits of Hormuz .
It also has emerged as the most influential country in oil - rich South Iraq , which is , like Iran , Shiite Muslim .
Iran is no credible military threat to the United States , though US warmongers are always depicting it as such , rather as they manufactured ramshackle 4th - world Iraq into a dire military menace to the US , allowing for a war of choice to be fought against it .
The regime in Iran has not gone away despite decades of hostility toward it by Washington , and despite the latter ’s policy of “ containment . ”
As a result , US petroleum corporations are denied significant opportunities for investment in the Iranian petroleum sector .
Worse , Iran has made a big energy deal with China and is negotiating with India .
As those two countries emerge as the superpowers of the 21st century , they will attempt to lock up Gulf petroleum and gas in proprietary contracts .
( Since it is already coming up in the comments , I should note that the “ fungibility ” ( easy exchange ) of oil is less important in the new environment than it used to be .
US petroleum companies would like to go back to actually owning fields in the Middle East , since there are big profits to be made if you get to decide when you take it out of the ground .
As Chinese and Indian competition for the increasingly scarce resource heats up , exclusive contracts will be struck .
When I floated the fungibility of petroleum as a reason for which the Iraq War could not be only about oil , at a talk at Columbia ’s Earth Institute last year , Jeffrey Sachs surprised me by disagreeing with me .
In our new environment , oil is becoming a commodity over which it really does make sense to fight for control .
See below . *)
In a worst case scenario , Washington would like to retain the option of military action against Iran , so as to gain access to its resources and deny them to rivals .
If Iran gets a nuclear weapon , however , that option will be foreclosed .
Iran may not be trying for a weapon , and if it is , it could not get one before about 2016 .
But if it had a nuclear weapon , it would be off limits to US attack , and its anti-American regime could not only lock up Iranian gas and oil for the rest of the century by making sweetheart deals with China .
It also might begin to exercise a sway over the small energy - producing countries of the Middle East .
( The oil interest would explain the mystery of why Washington just does not care that Pakistan has the Bomb ; Pakistan has nothing Washington wants and so there was no need to preserve the military option in its regard . )
Even an Iranian nuke , of course , would not be an immediate threat to the US , in the absence of ICBMs .
But the major US ally in the Middle East , Israel , would be vulnerable to a retaliatory Iranian strike if the US took military action against Iran in order to overthrow the regime and gain the proprietary deals for themselves .
In the short term , Iran was protected by another ace in the hole .
It had a client in the Levant , Lebanon ’s Hizbullah , and had given it a few silkworm rockets , which could theoretically hit Israeli nuclear and chemical facilities .
Hizbullah increasingly organizes the Lebanese Shiites , and the Lebanese Shiites will in the next ten to twenty years emerge as a majority in Lebanon , giving Iran a commercial hub on the Mediterranean .
China and India could get Iran , and Iran could get Lebanon , and as non-OPEC energy production decreases , the US and Israel could find themselves out in the cold on the energy front .
As for Iran , the DOE says this :
‘ Iran ’s largest non-associated natural gas field is South Pars , geologically an extension of Qatar ’s North Field .
Current estimates are that South Pars contains 280 Tcf or more ( some estimates go as high as 500 Tcf ) of natural gas , of which a large fraction will be recoverable , and over 17 billion barrels of liquids .
Development of South Pars is Iran ’s largest energy project , already having attracted around $ 15 billion in investment .
Natural gas from South Pars largely is slated to be shipped north via the planned 56 - inch , 300 - mile , $ 500 million , IGAT - 3 pipeline , as well as planned IGAT - 4 and IGAT - 5 lines .
Gas also will be reinjected to boost oil output at the mature Agha Jari oil field , and possibly the Ahwaz and Mansouri fields .
Besides condensate production and reinjection / enhanced oil recovery , South Pars natural gas also is intended for export , by pipeline and also possibly by liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) tanker .
Sales from South Pars could earn Iran as much as $ 11 billion per year over 30 years , according to Iran ’s Oil Ministry . ‘
Persian Gulf Fields
and this is why Iran ’s reserves are even more important :
‘ The Persian Gulf contains 715 billion barrels of proven oil reserves , representing over half ( 57 % ) of the world ’s oil reserves , and 2,462 Tcf of natural gas reserves ( 45 % of the world total ) .
Also , at the end of 2003 , Persian Gulf countries maintained about 22.9 million bbl/d of oil production capacity , or 32 % of the world total .
Perhaps even more significantly , the Persian Gulf countries normally maintains almost all of the world ’s excess oil production capacity .
As of early September 2004 , excess world oil production capacity was only about 0.5 - 1.0 million bbl/d , all of which was located in Saudi Arabia . ’
Non-OPEC production will decline sharply in coming years , increasing the importance of the Persian Gulf region .
The point about excess capacity is this :
The US in 2005 produced over 7 million barrels of petroleum a day , but consumes all of it , and then imports two times that from abroad ( using nearly 22 million barrels a day in 2005 ) .
So US petroleum is essentially off the market .
But Saudi Arabia produces 9.5 million barrels a day and exports over 7 million of that .
It does n’t use it all up at home .
Even now , the excess production is in the Gulf , and that excess production will become more important over time .
It may be that that hawks are thinking this way : Destroy Lebanon , and destroy Hizbullah , and you reduce Iran ’s strategic depth .
Destroy the Iranian nuclear program and you leave it helpless and vulnerable to having done to it what the Israelis did to Lebanon .
You leave it vulnerable to regime change , and a dragooning of Iran back into the US sphere of influence , denying it to China and assuring its 500 tcf of natural gas to US corporations .
You also politically reorient the entire Gulf , with both Saddam and Khamenei gone , toward the United States .
Voila , you avoid peak oil problems in the US until a technological fix can be found , and you avoid a situation where China and India have special access to Iran and the Gulf .
The second American Century ensues .
The “ New Middle East ” means the “ American Middle East . ”
And it all starts with the destruction of Lebanon .
More wars to come , in this scenario , since hitting Lebanon was like hitting a politician ’s bodyguard .
You do n’t kill a bodyguard just to kill the bodyguard .
It is phase I of a bigger operation .
If the theory is even remotely correct , then global warming is not the only danger in continuing to rely so heavily on hydrocarbons for energy .
Green energy–wind , sun , geothermal– is all around us and does not require any wars to obtain it .
Indeed , if we had spent as much on alternative energy research as we have already spent on the Iraq War , we ’d be much closer to affordable solar .
A choice lies ahead : hydrocarbons , a 20 foot rise in sea level , and a praetorian state .
Or we could go green and maybe keep our republic and tame militarism .

The human costs of four years of war
The US invasion has caused nearly three - quarter million Iraqi deaths
the Editorial Board
20 March 2007
On the fourth anniversary of Washington ’s unprovoked invasion of Iraq , President Bush delivered a five - minute midday televised speech pleading with the American people to give his latest escalation of the war more time to suppress Iraq resistance to the US occupation .
In a subdued and defensive tone , Bush recycled the same lies used to promote and justify the war since well before the launching of the “ shock and awe ” bombing of Baghdad in March of 2003 .
He claimed once again that the US had intervened because of the “ threat ” Iraq posed to the world , without mentioning the supposed substance of that threat , weapons of mass destruction and ties to terrorist groups , both of which were fabricated by the White House .
He made the absurd claim that the US - backed Iraqi regime is “ working to build a free society that upholds the rule of law , that respects the rights of its people , that provides them security . . . ”
This is under conditions in which death squads and terrorist attacks claim scores if not hundreds of lives daily , and disappearances and torture are rampant .
Finally , he once again invoked September 11 , echoing the innumerable attempts of his administration to perform the political sleight of hand of blaming Iraq for the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington and selling the war of aggression as vengeance for those killed in the Twin Towers and at the Pentagon .
The “ consequences for American security would be devastating , ” if US troops were withdrawn from Iraq , Bush declared .
He continued , “ The terrorists could emerge from the chaos with a safe haven in Iraq to replace the one they had in Afghanistan , which they used to plan the attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
For the safety of the American people , we cannot allow this to happen . ”
The reality is that Iraq had nothing to do with September 11 , which was utilized as a pretext for launching a long - planned war to conquer Iraq and its oil wealth .
And the US invasion is the cause of , not the solution to , the chaos in Iraq .
The claim that the US troops must remain in the country because otherwise terrorists could set up training camps there could be used to justify the invasion and occupation of any country in the world that Washington perceives as insufficiently stable or repressive .
Bush ’s speech provoked predictable rebuttals from his ostensible political opposition , the Democratic leadership in Congress .
Senate majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada charged that the last four years have amounted to “ a series of failures by the Bush administration : failure to plan for the occupation , failure to anticipate an insurgency , failure to provide for our troops , and a failure to level with the American people . ”
Others condemned Bush for allowing Iraq to divert military resources from the “ real ” war on terror .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Bush ’s handling of the war , referring , like many others , to the more than 3,200 soldiers killed in Iraq and the tens of thousands wounded , while adding that the invasion and occupation had brought “ our military ’s readiness to the lowest levels since the Vietnam war . ”
Meanwhile , the House Democrats are moving ahead with plans to approve over $ 100 billion in “ emergency ” funding to pay for the war and its escalation , while attaching non-enforceable language suggesting a timeline for the withdrawal of some — though by no means all — US troops from Iraq .
What is ignored entirely in this phony debate and largely obscured by the mass media is the staggering level of death and destruction that the four - year - old US war has inflicted upon the Iraqi people .
Press reports marking the fourth anniversary of the war largely glossed over this question , or presented figures that wildly underestimated the death toll .
Thus , for example , the Los Angeles Times reported Monday , “ an estimated 60,000 Iraqis have been killed since the US - led invasion on March 20 , 2003 . ”
CNN similarly stated , “ Iraqi civilian deaths are estimated at more than 54,000 , possibly much higher . ”
The figure of 60,000 Iraqi deaths was given by both NBC and ABC in their early morning newscasts .
For its part , the cable news network MSNBC declared simply that the number of Iraqis killed was “ almost impossible to estimate . ”
The source of these estimates — or why any estimate is next to impossible — is not explained by these media organizations .
It is as if the fate of the Iraqi people — whose “ freedom ” is constantly invoked as the supposed purpose of the war — is a minor question , of no real interest to anyone .
Even if the unattributed estimates of 60,000 dead were true , it would represent a horrifying slaughter , representing 20 dead Iraqis for every US soldier killed .
The reality , however , is that the ratio is at least 200 to 1 .
In October of last year , the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health published the results of a meticulous epidemiological study finding that an estimated 655,000 Iraqis had lost their lives as a result of the US war and occupation between March of 2003 and June of 2006 .
The public health experts who directed the study — the only scientific investigation of Iraqi casualties — cautioned that the real death toll could be significantly higher and attributed nearly one third of it directly to US military operations .
Given the marked escalation of the violence in the past several months , it is entirely likely that three - quarters of a million Iraqis have died as a result of the US invasion and occupation of their country .
In addition to those who have lost their lives , one must assume that more than a million Iraqis have suffered some form of physical injury as a consequence of the bloodshed unleashed by the US invasion .
This still does not encompass the full scale of the human tragedy for which the United States is responsible .
An estimated two million refugees have fled Iraq , creating one of the most severe refugee crises anywhere on the planet .
At least another 1.7 million are internal refugees , driven from their homes by the war and the uncontrolled and savage ethnic cleansing operations taking place throughout the country .
Given these figures , it is likely that a quarter of the Iraqi population has been killed , wounded or turned into refugees .
This is the real context in which the working class in the US and around the world must view Bush ’s calls for “ more time ” to implement his “ new strategy ” of escalation , Condoleezza Rice ’s statement Monday that the Iraq war is “ worth the sacrifice , ” or the Democrats claims that the only way to end the war is to give the White House another $ 100 billion to wage it .
What has taken place in Iraq and what is continuing and escalating is a crime of blood - curdling proportions .
The so - called “ surge ” of some 30,000 additional troops into Baghdad and Anbar province will only mean an escalation of this mass killing , maiming and uprooting of Iraqis .
In the end , the US intervention in Iraq has amounted to an exercise in sociocide , the unleashing of violence , death and destruction on such as a scale as to traumatize , deform and even destroy Iraqi society .
This finds its expression in every area of life in occupied Iraq .
The country ’s economy remains devastated , with between 50 and 75 percent of the population unemployed .
Poverty has soared , and with it child malnutrition and infant mortality .
According to the Catholic relief agency Caritas , nearly one third of Iraqi children are going hungry .
Press reports from Iraq indicate that legions of war orphans and impoverished children have taken to the streets of Baghdad and other cities to beg for food .
Essential services such as clean water and electricity are less available to the average Iraqi now than they were before the US invaded the country four years ago , when conditions were already vastly deteriorated as a result of a decade of international sanctions and the widespread destruction inflicted during the first Persian Gulf War and subsequent US missile attacks .
Meanwhile , the national health care system , once considered one of the best in the region , has largely collapsed , leading to countless more unnecessary deaths .
In an open letter published earlier this year , Iraqi doctors and foreign aid professionals wrote : “. . . children are dying in Iraq for want of medical treatment . . .
Sick or injured children , who could otherwise be treated by simple means , are left to die in their hundreds because they do not have access to basic medicines or other resources .
Children who have lost hands , feet , and limbs are left without prostheses .
Children with grave psychological distress are left untreated . ”
The desperate conditions created by the US intervention in Iraq found fresh expression in a poll released Monday by a group of major US and European news organizations , showing that fully 53 percent of Iraqis report having had family member or close friends killed or wounded .
Close to 90 percent say that they live in fear of someone in their own family becoming a victim .
Moreover , in virtually every area of life , the poll pointed to a dramatic deterioration in the past two years .
Thus , while in a poll taken in 2005 , 54 percent said that their electricity supply was inadequate or non-existent , now the figure is 88 percent .
Similar changes were recorded in relation to jobs , water supply and hopes for the future .
Not surprisingly , the attitude towards US occupation forces also registered a sharp shift , with 51 percent expressing the view that it was “ acceptable ” to attack them , triple the rate recorded three years ago .
Nearly 80 percent opposed their presence on Iraqi soil .
The desperate social and economic conditions prevailing in Iraq , as well as the killing and maiming of Iraqi civilians , constitute war crimes committed by Washington .
They are a blatant violation of the Geneva Accords , which imposes upon an occupying power the “ duty of ensuring the food and medical supplies of the population , ” and a special responsibility to ensure the maintenance , care and education of its children .
Far from reconstructing Iraq , the US occupation has unleashed upon the ravaged country all that is corrupt , sick and criminal within American society itself .
This has included the sadism and perversity of Abu Ghraib , the psychotic massacres and rapes for which some lower - ranking enlisted personnel are now being tried and , on a far more massive scale , the outright theft and embezzlement carried out by a host of politically connected contractors , foremost among them Halliburton , whose former bagman is now vice president of the United States .
These are the crimes not just of an administration in the White House , but of the entire political establishment and the social order as a whole .
Every significant institution in American society bears responsibility for this criminal enterprise , from the right - wing leadership that conspired to launch the war , to the Democratic Party , which voted the administration unlimited war powers and hundreds of billions of dollars in war funding , to the mass media , which transformed itself into a conduit for lies and war propaganda , both before the invasion and after .
Behind these political institutions stand the major economic forces within US society — the banks , corporations and , most immediately , the giant energy conglomerates — all of which saw in the Iraq war a means of reversing the relative decline of US capitalism on the world market by means of military aggression and plunder .
As both the Bush administration and leading Democratic politicians like Senator Hillary Clinton of New York issue demands and threats to compel the Iraqi regime to speedily enact a new petroleum law opening up the country ’s vast reserves to exploitation by ExxonMobil , ChevronTexaco and ConocoPhillips , , etc , the already transparent motives underlying the US invasion four years ago are becoming ever more explicit .
These companies are just as guilty in relation to the pillaging and mass slaughter in Iraq as the German firms IG Farben , Krupp and Flick were in the atrocities of Hitler ’s Third Reich , crimes for which their directors were convicted — if less than adequately punished — at Nuremberg .
These are the real issues confronting American society on this fourth anniversary of a war characterized by unspeakable criminality and filth .
The so - called debate between the Bush White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress over how best to salvage US interests from the debacle in Iraq does not begin to confront these questions .
Both Bush ’s escalation and Democratic proposals for reducing US forces , while continuing the occupation , are based on a continued strategy of conquest and on the conception that , eventually , the mass killing and repression will force the Iraqi people to submit .
Both parties express the interests and methods of an American capitalist class that has enriched itself through parasitism and methods of violence and criminality , employed both at home and abroad to effect the transfer of vast amounts of wealth from the working population of the world to a tiny financial aristocracy .
An end to the immense and tragic crisis that now exists in Iraq is unthinkable outside of the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all US troops .
Moreover , no real settlement can be contemplated outside of those who conspired to carry out this illegal war being held politically and legally responsible , including through prosecution for war crimes .
Such a solution cannot be achieved through the existing political institutions and the two major parties in the US , all of which have Iraq blood on their hands .
It requires the independent political mobilization of working people , both in the US and internationally , in a class - conscious socialist movement .
On this , the fourth anniversary of the war in Iraq , the Socialist Equality Party and the World Socialist Web Site pledges to intensify the struggle to build such a movement to put an end to war and the profit system that creates it .
We call on all those who agree with this perspective to make preparations to attend the Emergency Conference Against War sponsored by the World Socialist Web Site , the Socialist Equality Party and the International Students for Social Equality on the weekend of March 31 - April 1 , 2007 .
OO programmers fall into two categories : Smalltalkers and those who do n’t get it 6 February , 2007
As we previously mentioned Vassili Bykov recently left VisualWorks to join Eliot Miranda and Gilad Bracha at Cadence .
Vassili was “ the tools guy ” at VisualWorks and contributed a huge amount to the current Smalltalk platform , from core frameworks such as Announcements to new or updated tools such as Trippy , a much enhanced inspector , and Parcel Browser–a wonderful tool for finding and browsing contributed packages .
He also did much work on improving the appearance of the VisualWorks UI .
Previously Vassili worked for The Object People as an instructor and as a TOPLink developer .
TOPLink is an object / RDBMS mapping software that significantly simplifies object persistence .
It is similar to Glorp which is an Open Source project written by some of the same people .
I spoke with Vassili about Smalltalk .
Ron : Vassili I love your comment , “ OO programmers fall into two categories : Smalltalkers and those who do n’t get it . ”
It ’s easy for me being on the inside looking out .
Can you share with us your feelings about the benefits of Smalltalk and OO Programming in general ?
Vassili : I ’m sure my feelings are very similar to those of most others “ on the inside ” , so to make it more interesting here is a less common angle .
User interfaces are not only the things we see on the screen .
A programming language is also a user interface .
It presents us with an imaginary world of entities , and the ability to act in that world , that we use to build solutions to our problems .
In About Face 2.0 : The Essentials of Interaction Design , Alan Cooper talks about UI “ excise ” .
Excise are those actions required by the UI that have nothing to do with achieving the user ’s goal and only support the UI itself .
For example , rearranging , resizing and closing windows in a UI that opens a new one for nearly everything you do .
In an OO language , messages are the useful actions , and most things that are n’t about what one object tells another object is excise .
Smalltalk has virtually no excise , which makes it a clean and efficient UI .
As for the benefits of OO in general , I think they lie in the fact that programming is all about building and maintaining a model of the problem and its solution .
Objects are a very good construction material , pliable enough that the model is easy to build and change as our understanding of the requirements changes .
Which brings us back to the benefits of Smalltalk–as experience shows , objects in languages with higher excise are not quite as pliable .
Ron :
The death of Smalltalk has been predicted many times .
Some would argue that Smalltalk is already dead .
What do you think is missing from Smalltalk , if anything , which is limiting its broader appreciation , or do you believe like some that Smalltalk is the professional developers best kept secret ?
Vassili : A rich corporation pouring hundreds of millions into marketing and open - source development would be a very welcome addition indeed .
Failing that , it ’s the same thing as for everything else at the software bazaar : Smalltalk needs to offer something of value to get attention .
We on the inside know how great and liberating the language is , but it takes time and effort to get to the point where one can appreciate that .
On the other hand , there are quite a few roadblocks .
One has to accept things such as the weakness–or the outright ugliness–on the UI side , or the lack of a simple deployment story , or the relative isolation from the underlying OS facilities .
This is essentially a credibility issue , since for many developers it is unthinkable that a serious tool would not provide these .
( What I just said is not entirely true of Dolphin , Ambrai , S# and a few others , but I am speaking of the implementations that are closer to me .
After all , it ’s Squeak that is the lead Smalltalk representative in the Open Source universe ) .
In the case of Squeak nothing can fix these but the community .
Which makes growing the community and advancing such projects –not blue - plane stuff , just things that matter for the developers–very important .
In fact , I want to say a few words in defense of the pink plane .
Yes , Smalltalk is this great thing that is much more than just a programming language .
It ’s an almost organic malleable “ stem cell ” that can grow into virtually anything .
Alan Kay is famously disappointed by people not recognizing this .
Matz of Ruby fame quotes him say that Smalltalk is a dead language he does n’t like anymore , that Smalltalk - 76 was closer to his ideas than Smalltalk - 80 which was strongly influenced by Lisp .
No matter how true that is , I think such a viewpoint lacks appreciation of how important it is to popularize Smalltalk philosophy by making it attractive to “ the masses ” and by growing the community of active users .
It is thanks to the success of Smalltalk - 80 and its descendents that many Smalltalkers , myself included , had discovered the better way .
A professional photographer may shoot a hundred photos and select one to keep .
There should be no shame about a hundred people writing boring mundane stuff in Smalltalk as if it were plain old Java .
If that makes Smalltalk visible enough to attract one person with a spark who will get a bright idea and for once use Smalltalk “ right ” , those hundred mundane apps will also have made their blue plane contribution .
Smalltalk is indeed more than a language .
It is a cultural phenomenon , and it needs a community for that culture to live on .
If the community disappears , that ’s when Smalltalk will truly die .
But as there does n’t seem to be anything quite like Smalltalk around , I do n’t think there is any danger of it happening anytime soon .
Ron :
You have been working on the commercial Smalltalk product .
Now that the chains have been lifted and you get to work with Squeak , will you be contributing your skills to building some of those tools you are known for ?
Vassili : I hope it ’s OK for me to reveal that Squeak development tools are not the market Cadence has plans for , so building tools in Squeak will not be my first priority .
On the other hand , I have n’t seriously looked at Squeak for many years , and now I very much enjoy studying what has changed and what is new .
I do n’t think I ’ll be able to resist the old habits .
Though I also must say that while the chains have been lifted , attached to them was a not yet perfect but overall quite nice and usable widget library …
Ron : I know that Gilad said he can’t talk about it , but nobody reads these articles , what are you guys up to over at Cadence ?
Vassili : Cadence stock is up 15 % after your interview with Gilad .
It looks like someone is reading .
But seriously , I think Gilad did say quite a lot about the important things .
I mean , who of the readers really cares what business stuff Cadence is up to ?
As for what we do , clearly it involves a dynamic OO approach , at the moment it involves Squeak , and it ’s a clean slate project that allows us to take a fresh look at many things .
This is cool–what else could possibly matter ?
Ron : I know the guys over at VW and the entire community will miss you .
Did you want to take this opportunity to say goodbye , or did you have any final thoughts or suggestions for your successors ?
Vassili : I will miss them too .
Cincom Smalltalk team includes some of the nicest and brightest people I ’ve worked with .
My biggest regret is that I did n’t get a chance to work long enough with Travis Griggs whom we hired in September to work with me on tools–but I very much enjoyed even that short time .
I am sure Tools are in good hands now .
In fact , I hope to not have to say goodbye at all .
I am a Smalltalker and a member of the same community , and I am staying in touch with many of my former teammates .
We might not be looking at the same bugs together anymore , but the friendship remains , and that ’s what counts .
Vassili Bykov is a Senior Member of Consulting Staff at Cadence Design Systems .
Previously , he was a Tools Technical Lead working on VisualWorks at Cincom Systems , and an instructor and engineer at The Object People prior to that .
Vassili ’s interests lie in user interface design , taken in a broader than usual sense and including programming language semantics and APIs .
He holds a Master ’s degree in Computer Science from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and a Certified Usability Analyst ( CUA ) certification from Human Factors International , Inc .

Since launching its legal campaign against those it suspects of file - sharing , the RIAA has been called any number of nasty things .
Some commentators have gone so far as to call its onslaught of lawsuits an exercise in extortion .
Others have likened the RIAA to a criminal organization and raised the issue of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ( RICO )
Act and whether it would apply to the RIAA .
We 've received a few e-mails from our readers wondering about RICO and the RIAA , so we decided to dig into the topic ourselves .
If you 've watched The Sopranos for any length of time , you 're probably at least passingly familiar with RICO .
Enacted in 1970 , RICO allows for additional jail time in the case of criminal prosecutions — and heavier civil penalties for lawsuits — if the person or entities involved are found to be part of an ongoing criminal enterprise .
When first enacted , it was used exclusively for fighting organized crime , but by the 1980s its reach had been extended to cover accounting firms assisting criminal enterprises and to target pro-life groups engaged in anti-abortion protests .
Can it be extended to a music cartel ?
One RICO allegation so far
Although the questions about RICO have been asked on numerous occasions , only two file - sharing case that we are aware of have raised the issue of RICO so far : Atlantic v. Andersen , where the record labels accused a disabled Oregon mother of copyright infringement , and Sony v. Scimeca from 2004 .
In her Answer and Counterclaim filed in September 2005 , Andersen accused the record companies suing her of violating the Oregon ( not federal ) Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act .
" As fully set forth above , the record companies hired MediaSentry to break into private computers to spy , view files , remove information , and copy images , " reads Andersen 's answer .
" The record companies received and transmitted the information and images to Settlement Support Center .
As the record companies ' agent , Settlement Support Center then falsely claimed that the stolen information and images showed Ms. Andersen 's downloading and distributing over 1,000 audio files .
The record companies falsely claimed that Ms. Anderson owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in an attempt to coerce and extort payment from her . "
She concludes that the " unlawful activities " were not isolated events :
" The record companies have repeated these unlawful and deceptive actions with many other victims throughout the United States . "
She 's right : the RIAA has operated in the same manner in just about every case it has filed .
But do the RIAA 's legal practices , including the alleged extortion , bring the music industry under the RICO umbrella ?
Does RICO apply to the RIAA ?
Ars spoke with Rich Vasquez , a partner in the business and technology group at Morgan Miller Blair .
In addition to his experience in technology - related litigation , he has a long history with RICO , having represented former Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos in a RICO action back in the 1980s .
Vasquez told
Ars that in civil litigation , RICO charges are often made to score points in the arena of public relations .
" People take a strategic shot at a RICO claim to try to up the timbre of debate , " said Vasquez .
He 's not optimistic that Andersen 's — or any other — RICO charges will bear fruit .
" Right off the bat there are some problems with the predicate claims for RICO , " explained Vazquez .
" You have to have a pattern of racketeering activity : either criminal acts where there is a one - year jail penalty , or mail or wire fraud . "
Any RICO action brought against the RIAA would have to focus on the wire fraud component , likely accusing the record labels of poking around someone 's PC without permission .
That 's the angle Andersen took , accusing the RIAA of directing " its agents to unlawfully break into private computers . "
The weakness with that argument comes from Kazaa itself .
For those defendants who actually have been engaged in file - sharing , their shared folders are open for anyone using the service to see — including the RIAA 's investigative arm , MediaSentry .
" There 's no reasonable expectation of privacy , given [ Kazaa 's ] settings , " notes Vasquez .
As a result , the wire fraud claims are unlikely to hold weight .
Vasquez believes that the RIAA could be vulnerable to charges of malicious prosecution , but even that would be difficult .
" It would likely take someone on the inside testifying that the RIAA pursued people that it knew were innocent , " Vasquez explained .
" Then there would be a serious risk of malicious prosecution .
But you 've got to have them cold . "
If there were cases of serial malicious prosecution , a group of prevailing file - sharing defendants could potentially band together for a class - action suit .
" You 'd have to have a lot of winners , " said Vasquez .
" If you have enough people bringing charges of malicious prosecution , you could then show a pattern of practices on the part of the RIAA .
But the testimony from a former RIAA or label employee — if it exists — would be key . "
At the end of the day , the RIAA may be a lot of things , but a criminal enterprise engaged in racketeering is not one of them .
Federal law gives copyright holders the ability to seek recompense via the court system via civil cases , and that 's what the RIAA is doing .
Atlantic v. Andersen is still making its way through the courts , and the judge has yet to rule on Andersen 's counterclaim , including the RICO allegations .
The question of whether the RIAA has taken a wise course of action is another matter entirely , and few people outside of record label boardrooms and RIAA offices would argue that they have .
The group has hundreds of settlements at a few thousand dollars apiece under its belt , a Himalaya - sized mountain of negative press , and the prospect of writing some rather sizable checks for the attorneys of the wrongfully accused ( which is why the RIAA does n't want defendants exonerated ) .
But until the laws are changed or the RIAA tires of its legal campaign , it will be business as usual ... without any threat from RICO .

BBC News , Baghdad
Iraqi police said the helicopter had been shot at from the ground
The attack took place in Diyala province north - east of Baghdad , the sources say .
A spokesman for the US military said there had been helicopter activity in the area but he was not able to confirm any other details .
The school is in the village of al - Nedawat close to the Iranian border .
Investigation
One police officer said the helicopter was shot at from the ground during the morning .
The school was said to have been hit when the aircraft returned fire .
The officer said police had spoken to eyewitnesses and that six children had been killed and six injured but the figures have not been independently confirmed .
A spokesman for the US forces in Iraq , Lt - Col Chris Garver , said the US tried to do everything possible to avoid civilian casualties , which was why it was taking the reports seriously and conducting an investigation .
There has been an escalation of violence in Diyala in recent weeks .
On Sunday , a convoy of US armoured vehicles was hit by a bomb which killed six soldiers and a Russian journalist who was travelling with them .
BMW ' CLEVER ' concept
Apr 23 , 2006 , 12:10 pm ET
For the last few years , BMW and University of Bath have been hard at work on the CLEVER -- a compact fuel - efficient vehicle for city driving .
Somewhat overshadowed this week by the launch of the 2007 3 - Series Coupe , BMW on Friday released the first images of the completed CLEVER .
As the name -- Compact Low Emission Vehicle for Urban Transport -- suggests , the aim of the project was to create a vehicle that was practical , safe , and environmentally - friendly .
Unlike the Volkswagen GX3 Concept -- with one rear wheel and two front wheels -- the CLEVER has two rear wheels and one front .
If it ever makes it to production , the vehicle is expected to cost around $ 10,000 and would have a top speed of 50 mph .
One fascinating aspect of the vehicle is its unique tilting design for stable , motorcycle - like cornering .
See a full photo gallery , more details , and some crash test videos after the jump ...

Kent Police has cut the cost of running its major criminal investigations system by 90 % using Novell Open Enterprise Server , the company 's version of SuSE Linux .
The migration to Novell enabled Kent to scale up the Holmes II system to investigate this February 's raid on the Securitas depot in Tonbridge - one of the biggest criminal investigations in the force 's history .
Kent Police migrated Holmes II to the Novell operating system after systems integrator Unisys adapted it to run on the open source operating system .
The force 's IT department then searched for the cheapest hardware to support the system .
Kent Police IT director Andy Barker said , " We had come to the replacement time for Holmes II .
We got a quote from our existing supplier and a quote from Dell .
The Dell quote was one - tenth of the cost of the other . "
The force moved Holmes II from legacy non-Intel - based servers to two Dell Poweredge devices .
Barker said , " With our old supplier , we could have bought scalability for the Tonbridge robbery , but we could never have afforded to do so . "
The savings have helped make the case for migrating Kent 's other core applications , SAP and its operational policing system , to Novell .
The SAP system , which supports 6,500 users for the force 's finance , human resources , payroll and duty planning functions , will be moved before the end of September .
The policing system - named Genesis - is being tested for scalability on Linux servers .
It needs to be scalable to 1,000 concurrent users when it goes live with a peak capacity of 3,000 users .
Mitt Romney says Guantanamo Bay is great June 23 , 2007 Washington , D.C. - Mitt Romney , a Republican presidential candidate , said the Bush administration is wrong for looking at ways to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , calling the idea " the wrong course to take " .
Romney told reporters in Helena , Montana , " Guantanamo Bay plays an important role in protecting our nation from violent , heinous terrorists . "
The former Massachusetts governor said , " I hope the administration does not take the course which is being contemplated . "
And singling out John McCain supporting shutting down the facility , Romney said , " I think Guantanamo is great a symbol of our resolve . "
Romney said detainees should not have access to lawyers or to U.S. constitutional rights , saying " they are terrorists . "
" I do not want to see those prisoners transferred to United States soil , " he said .
" I do not want to see the legal system in this country potentially opened up to terrorists and feel we 're better keeping Guantanamo in place .
And if we need additional space , why , we should be expanding Guantanamo . "
At a presidential debate in May , Romney said , " My view is , we ought to double Guantanamo . "
At Friday 's White House briefing , spokeswoman Dana Perino said no resolution on closing Guantanamo Bay was imminent , saying " that while the president has said that we want to make sure that we close this facility as quickly as possible , he 's not put a deadline on it because there are complex issues .
We have to make sure that we handle it appropriately . "
She said a meeting scheduled on Guantanamo Bay was canceled after an Associated Press report said a deal was close , but Perino said , " the meeting was going to be focusing on doing what the president has asked them to do for the past few years , which is work to get the facility closed .
I think that report was overblown .
There was not an imminent decision made .
There 's no deadline .
It was just a regular meeting . "
While stopping short of promising a resolution , Perino said the administration 's goal for Guantanamo 's ultimate future is clear .
" It has been a firm decision " , she said , " The president gave a firm decision two years ago , in which he said " I want this place closed " ; that the United States should not be the world 's jailers .
Those are his words . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday began drawing up a sweeping law that would put mandatory caps on greenhouse gas emissions after a key Republican endorsed the idea .
Sen. Barbara Boxer , California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Environment Committee , wants Congress to pass legislation that would for the first time place caps on emissions of heat - trapping gases from power plants , cars and factories .
Those efforts moved forward after Sen. John Warner , a Virginia Republican and one of the most senior committee members , agreed to work with Democrats “ to craft a comprehensive climate bill . ”
The United States is the world ’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases .
Boxer called the accord “ a groundbreaking moment , ” saying Warner was the first Republican on her committee to back the idea of economy - wide reductions .
“ This will be the first time that any committee or subcommittee of Congress has attempted to pass comprehensive climate change legislation , ” said Eileen Claussen , president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change .
A “ cap- and - trade ” approach -- backed by Warner and Sen. Joe Lieberman , a Connecticut independent , would set industry - specific reduction targets and require those that exceed them to buy permits to pollute .
Coal - burning power plants emit the most U.S. carbon dioxide , about 40 percent of the total , and cars emit about a third of the total .
Boxer said her committee could vote on the plan -- which was still under negotiation -- after Congress returns from its August recess , and the full Senate could vote on it this year .
Boxer ’s efforts jibe with those of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who wants to halve U.S. emissions by 2050 through a cap - and - trade system .
Rep. John Dingell , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and a key climate - change negotiator , said on Wednesday the issue would be addressed in “ comprehensive climate change legislation ” the House will weigh in the fall .
Stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at a safe level will require a reduction of between 60 percent and 80 percent by 2050 , Dingell said .
Dingell ’s views are key because he is a long - time ally of Detroit automobile makers , who have resisted attempts in California and other states to regulate vehicle emissions of carbon dioxide .
In a landmark decision , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled this year that the Environmental Protection Administration has the authority under the federal Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles .
President George W. Bush opposes mandatory limits on emissions , saying they would harm the economy .
Instead , Bush has set a goal of reducing the intensity of emissions -- as measured against economic growth -- by 18 percent by 2012 .
The way light is extracted from the butterfly 's system is more than an analogy - it's all but identical in design to the LED
Pete Vukusic , University of Exeter
Fluorescent patches on the wings of African swallowtail butterflies work in a very similar way to high emission light emitting diodes ( LEDs ) .
These high emission LEDs are an efficient variation on the diodes used in electronic equipment and displays .
The University of Exeter , UK , research appears in the journal Science .
In 2001 , Alexei Erchak and colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) demonstrated a method for building a more efficient LED .
Most light emitted from standard LEDs cannot escape , resulting in what scientists call a low extraction efficiency of light .
Ingenious design
The LED developed at MIT used a two - dimensional ( 2D ) photonic crystal - a triangular lattice of holes etched into the LED 's upper cladding layer - to enhance the extraction of light .
The butterflies use the fluorescent patches to signal each other
Pete Vukusic and Ian Hooper at Exeter have now shown that swallowtail butterflies evolved an identical method for signalling to each other in the wild .
Swallowtails belonging to the Princeps nireus species live in eastern and central Africa .
They have dark wings with bright blue or blue - green patches .
The wing scales on these swallowtails act as 2D photonic crystals , infused with pigment and structured in such a way that they produce intense fluorescence .
Pigment on the butterflies ' wings absorbs ultra-violet light which is then re-emitted , using fluorescence , as brilliant blue - green light .
Performance - enhancing bugs
Most of this light would be lost were it not for the pigment being located in a region of the wing which has evenly spaced micro-holes through it .
Two components of the scales enhance light emission
Like its counterpart in a high emission LED , it prevents the fluorescent colour from being trapped inside the structure and from being emitted sideways .
The scales also have a type of mirror underneath them to upwardly reflect all the fluorescent light that gets emitted down towards it .
Again , this is very similar to the Bragg reflectors in high emission LEDs .
" Unlike the diodes , the butterfly 's system clearly does n't have semiconductor in it and it does n't produce its own radiative energy , " Dr Vukusic told the BBC News website " That makes it doubly efficient in a way .
" But the way light is extracted from the butterfly 's system is more than an analogy - it 's all but identical in design to the LED . "
Dr Vukusic agreed that studying natural designs such as this could help scientists improve upon manmade devices .
" When you study these things and get a feel for the photonic architecture available , you really start to appreciate the elegance with which nature put some of these things together , " he said .
Social media is one of the most important tools available to charitable organizations to increase engagement with their followers .
Unfortunately , many of them are not aware of how they can use these tools to ...
It 's got to be difficult for guys like Senators Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) and Tom Harkin ( D - IA ) , two men who truly seem to grasp the power of government to make a positive difference in peoples ' lives , to deal with a White House and Republican colleagues who have no problem wasting $ 400 billion on a pointless war , but who go pale at the notion of spending a fraction of that to care for the sick or to educate children .
Harkin talked about that earlier this week at a meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee 's Labor , Health and Human Services , and Education Subcommittee when he addressed the chronic neglect of George W. Bush 's very own No Child Left Behind ( NCLB ) plan .
“ When I voted for the No Child Left Behind Act five years ago , I did so with the understanding that President Bush would work with Congress to provide schools with the resources they need to implement the law , " said Harkin .
" The administration had negotiated closely with Members of Congress on the authorization levels , and I took the President at his word that he would take those levels seriously . "
“ Unfortunately , that has n’t happened .
Year after year , the President sends us a budget that comes nowhere close to funding No Child Left Behind at an adequate level . "
Harkin then went on to spell out exactly how NCLB was clearly meant as a façade for Bush 's " compassionate conservatism " and , based on the incredible way it 's been shortchanged , how it was obviously never meant to succeed .
“ The numbers have gotten almost laughable , " said Harkin .
" The President ’s FY08 budget underfunds NCLB by $ 14.8 billion , for a cumulative shortfall of $ 70.9 billion since enactment of the law .
Funding for Title I alone – the cornerstone of the law – would be shortchanged by $ 11.1 billion , for a cumulative shortfall of $ 54.7 billion . "
Almost $ 55 billion short .
Amazing .
It would be nice if the corporate media would spent just a tiny bit more time reporting on something like this -- though Bush 's low polling numbers in education indicate that Americans understand he is a fake in that area too -- and less time talking about Anna Nicole Smith or Britney Spears .
Harkin said that placing greater demand on the states to have their schools perform better is fine but that the federal government has not " … given them the resources they need to meet those demands . "
" We should not be requiring the majority of school districts to make huge improvements in student achievement at the same time we ’re cutting their funding , " concluded the Iowa Senator .
" I assure you : Before I vote to reauthorize No Child Left Behind , I will insist that it ’s adequately funded . "

THE students at West Virginia University do n't want you to think they take life too seriously .
It is the third - best “ party school ” in America , according to the Princeton Review 's annual ranking of such things , and comes a creditable fifth in the “ lots of beer ” category .
Booze sometimes causes students ' clothes to fall off .
Those who wake up garmentless after a hook - up endure the “ walk of shame ” , trudging back to their own dormitories in an obviously borrowed football shirt , stirring up gossip with every step .
And yet , for all their protestations of wildness , the students are a serious - minded bunch .
Yes , they have pre-marital sex .
“ I do n't see how it 's a bad thing , ” says Ashley , an 18 - year - old studying criminology .
But they are careful not to fall pregnant .
It would be “ a major disaster , ” says Ashley .
She has plans .
She wants to finish her degree , go to the FBI academy in Virginia and then start a career as a “ profiler ” helping to catch dangerous criminals .
She wants to get married when she is about 24 , and have children perhaps at 26 .
She thinks having children out of wedlock is not wrong , but unwise .
A few blocks away , in a soup kitchen attached to a church , another 18 - year - old balances a baby on her knee .
Laura has a less planned approach to parenthood .
“ It just happened , ” she says .
The father and she were “ never really together ” , merely “ friends with benefits , I guess ” .
He is now gone .
“ I did n't want to put up with his stuff , ” she says .
“ Drugs and stuff , ” she adds , by way of explanation .
There is a widening gulf between how the best - and least - educated Americans approach marriage and child - rearing .
Among the elite ( excluding film stars ) , the nuclear family is holding up quite well .
Only 4 % of the children of mothers with college degrees are born out of wedlock .
And the divorce rate among college - educated women has plummeted .
Of those who first tied the knot between 1975 and 1979 , 29 % were divorced within ten years .
Among those who first married between 1990 and 1994 , only 16.5 % were .
At the bottom of the education scale , the picture is reversed .
Among high - school dropouts , the divorce rate rose from 38 % for those who first married in 1975 - 79 to 46 % for those who first married in 1990 - 94 .
Among those with a high school diploma but no college , it rose from 35 % to 38 % .
And these figures are only part of the story .
Many mothers avoid divorce by never marrying in the first place .
The out - of - wedlock birth rate among women who drop out of high school is 15 % .
Among African - Americans , it is a staggering 67 % .
Does this matter ?
Kay Hymowitz of the Manhattan Institute , a conservative think - tank , says it does .
In her book “ Marriage and Caste in America ” , she argues that the “ marriage gap ” is the chief source of the country 's notorious and widening inequality .
Middle - class kids growing up with two biological parents are “ socialised for success ” .
They do better in school , get better jobs and go on to create intact families of their own .
Children of single parents or broken families do worse in school , get worse jobs and go on to have children out of wedlock .
This makes it more likely that those born near the top or the bottom will stay where they started .
America , argues Ms Hymowitz , is turning into “ a nation of separate and unequal families ” .
A large majority — 92 % — of children whose families make more than $ 75,000 a year live with two parents ( including step - parents ) .
At the bottom of the income scale — families earning less than $ 15,000 — only 20 % of children live with two parents .
One might imagine that this gap arises simply because two breadwinners earn more than one .
A single mother would have to be unusually talented and diligent to make as much as $ 75,000 while also raising children on her own .
And it is impossible in America for two full - time , year - round workers to earn less than $ 15,000 between them , unless they are ( illegally ) paid less than the minimum wage .
But there is more to it than this .
Marriage itself is “ a wealth - generating institution ” , according to Barbara Dafoe Whitehead and David Popenoe , who run the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University .
Those who marry “ till death do us part ” end up , on average , four times richer than those who never marry .
This is partly because marriage provides economies of scale — two can live more cheaply than one — and because the kind of people who make more money — those who work hard , plan for the future and have good interpersonal skills — are more likely to marry and stay married .
But it is also because marriage affects the way people behave .
American men , once married , tend to take their responsibilities seriously .
Avner Ahituv of the University of Haifa and Robert Lerman of the Urban Institute found that “ entering marriage raises hours worked quickly and substantially . ”
Married men drink less , take fewer drugs and work harder , earning between 10 % and 40 % more than single men with similar schooling and job histories .
And marriage encourages both spouses to save and invest more for the future .
Each partner provides the other with a form of insurance against falling sick or losing a job .
Marriage also encourages the division of labour .
Ms Dafoe Whitehead and Mr Popenoe put it like this : “ Working as a couple , individuals can develop those skills in which they excel , leaving others to their partner . ”
Mum handles the tax returns while Dad fixes the car .
Or vice versa .
As Adam Smith observed two centuries ago , when you specialise , you get better at what you do , and you produce more .
Perhaps the most convincing work showing that marriage is more than just a piece of paper was done by Mr Lerman of the Urban Institute .
In “ Married and Unmarried Parenthood and Economic Wellbeing ” , he addressed the “ selection effect ” — the question of whether married - couple families do better because of the kind of people who marry , or because of something about marriage itself .
Using data from a big annual survey , he looked at all the women who had become pregnant outside marriage .
He estimated the likelihood that they would marry , using dozens of variables known to predict this , such as race , income and family background .
He then found out whether they did in fact marry , and what followed .
His results were striking .
Mothers who married ended up much better off than mothers with the same disadvantages who did not .
So did their children .
Among those in the bottom quartile of “ propensity to marry ” , those who married before the baby was six months old were only half as likely to be raising their children in poverty five years later as those who did not ( 33 % to 60 % ) .
Changes in family structure thus have a large impact on the economy .
One of the most - cited measures of prosperity , household income , is misleading over time because household sizes have changed .
In 1947 , the average household contained 3.6 people .
By 2006 , that number had dwindled to 2.6 .
This partly reflects two happy facts : more young singles can afford to flee the nest and their parents are living longer after they go .
But it also reflects the dismal trend towards family break - up .
A study by Adam Thomas and Isabel Sawhill concluded that if the black family had not collapsed between 1960 and 1998 , the black child - poverty rate would have been 28.4 % rather than 45.6 % .
And if white families had stayed like they were in 1960 , the white child poverty rate would have been 11.4 % rather than 15.4 % .
Children of the sexual revolution
Since the 1960s , the easy availability of reliable contraception has helped to spur a revolution in sexual mores .
As opportunities for women opened up in the workplace , giving them an incentive to delay child - bearing , a little pill let them do just that without sacrificing sex .
At the same time , better job opportunities for women changed the balance of power within marriage .
Wives became less economically dependent on their husbands , so they found it easier to walk out of unhappy or abusive relationships .
As the sexual revolution gathered steam , the idea that a nuclear family was the only acceptable environment in which to raise a child crumbled .
The social stigma around single motherhood , which was intense before the 1960s , has faded .
But attitudes still vary by class .
College - educated women typically see single motherhood as a distant second - best to marriage .
If they have babies out of wedlock , it is usually because they have not yet got round to marrying the man they are living with .
Or because , finding themselves single and nearly 40 , they decide they cannot wait for Mr Right and so seek a sperm donor .
By contrast , many of America 's least - educated women live in neighbourhoods where single motherhood is the norm .
And when they have babies outside marriage , they are typically younger than their middle - class counterparts , in less stable relationships and less prepared for what will follow .
Consider the home life of Lisa Ballard , a 26 - year - old single mother in Morgantown .
She strains every nerve to give her children the best upbringing she can , while also looking for a job .
Her four - year - old son Alex loves the Dr Seuss book “ Green Eggs and Ham ” , so she reads it to him , and once put green food colouring in his breakfast eggs , which delighted him .
But the sheer complexity of her domestic arrangements makes life “ very challenging ” , she says .
She has four children by three different men .
Two were planned , two were not .
Two live with her ; she has shared custody of one and no custody of another .
One of the fathers was “ a butthole ” who hit her , she says , and is no longer around .
The other two are “ good fathers ” , in that they have steady jobs , pay maintenance , make their children laugh and do not spank them .
But none of them still lives with her .
Miss Ballard now thinks that having children before getting married was “ not a good idea ” .
She says she would like to get married some day , though she finds the idea of long - term commitment scary .
“ You 've got to definitely make sure it 's the person you want to grow old with .
You know , sitting on rocking chairs giggling at the comics .
I want to find the right one .
I ask God : ‘ What does he look like ?
Can you give me a little hint ? ' ”
If she does find and wed the man of her dreams , Miss Ballard will encounter a problem .
She has never seen her own father .
Having never observed a stable marriage close - up , she will have to guess how to make one work .
By contrast , Ashley , the criminology student at the nearby university , has never seen a divorce in her family .
This makes it much more likely that , when the time is right , she will get married and stay that way .
And that , in turn , makes it more likely that her children will follow her to college .
Most children in single - parent homes “ grow up without serious problems ” , writes Mary Parke of the Centre for Law and Social Policy , a think - tank in Washington , DC .
But they are more than five times as likely to be poor as those who live with two biological parents ( 26 % against 5 % ) .
Children who do not live with both biological parents are also roughly twice as likely to drop out of high school and to have behavioural or psychological problems .
Even after controlling for race , family background and IQ , children of single mothers do worse in school than children of married parents , says Ms Hymowitz .
Children whose father was never around face the toughest problems .
For those whose parents split up , the picture is more nuanced .
If parents detest each other and quarrel bitterly , their kids may actually benefit from a divorce .
Paul Amato of Penn State University has found that 40 % of American divorces leave the children better ( or at least , no worse ) off than the turbulent marriages that preceded them .
In other cases , however , what is good for the parents may well harm the children .
And two parents are likely to be better at child - rearing because they can devote more time and energy to it than one can .
Research also suggests that middle - and working - class parents approach child - rearing in different ways .
Professional parents shuttle their kids from choir practice to baseball camp and check that they are doing their homework .
They also talk to them more .
One study found that a college professor 's kids hear an average of 2,150 words per hour in the first years of life .
Working - class children hear 1,250 and those in welfare families only 620 .
Co-habiting couples have the same number of hands as married couples , so they ought to make equally good parents .
Many do , but on average the children of co-habiting couples do worse by nearly every measure .
One reason is that such relationships are less stable than marriages .
In America , they last about two years on average .
About half end in marriage .
But those who live together before marriage are more likely to divorce .
Many people will find this surprising .
A survey of teenagers by the University of Michigan found that 64 % of boys and 57 % of girls agreed that “ it is usually a good idea for a couple to live together before getting married in order to find out whether they really get along . ”
Research suggests otherwise .
Two - thirds of American children born to co-habiting parents who later marry will see their parents split up by the time they are ten .
Those born within wedlock face only half that risk .
The likeliest explanation is inertia , says Scott Stanley of the Centre for Marital and Family Studies at the University of Denver , Colorado .
Couples start living together because it is more fun ( and cheaper ) than living apart .
One partner may see this as a prelude to marriage .
The other — usually the man — may see it as something more temporary .
Since no explicit commitment is made , it is easier to drift into living together than it is to drift into a marriage .
But once a couple is living together , it is harder to split up than if they were merely dating .
So “ many of these men end up married to women they would not have married if they had n't been living together , ” says Mr Stanley , co-author of a paper called “ Sliding versus deciding ” .
A little help from the government
Most American politicians say they support marriage , but few do much about it , except perhaps to sound off about the illusory threat to it from gays .
The public are divided .
Few want to go back to the attitudes or divorce laws of the 1950s .
But many at both ends of the political spectrum lament the fragility of American families and would change , at least , the way the tax code penalises many couples who marry .
And some politicians want the state to draw attention to benefits of marriage , as it does to the perils of smoking .
George Bush is one .
Since last year , his administration has been handing out grants to promote healthy marriages .
This is a less preachy enterprise than you might expect .
Sidonie Squier , the bureaucrat in charge , does not argue that divorce is wrong : “ If you 're being abused , you should get out . ”
Nor does she think the government should take a view on whether people should have pre-marital sex .
Her budget for boosting marriage is tiny : $ 100 m a year , or about what the Defence Department spends every two hours .
Some of it funds research into what makes a relationship work well and whether outsiders can help .
Most of the rest goes to groups that try to help couples get along better , some of which are religiously - inspired .
The first 124 grants were disbursed only last September , so it is too early to say whether any of this will work .
But certain approaches look hopeful .
One is “ marriage education ” .
This is not the same as marriage therapy or counselling .
Rather than waiting till a couple is in trouble and then having them sit down with a specialist to catalogue each other 's faults , the administration favours offering relationship tips to large classes .
The army already does this .
About 35,000 soldiers this year will get a 12 - hour course on how to communicate better with their partners , and how to resolve disputes without throwing plates .
It costs about $ 300 per family .
Given that it costs $ 50,000 to recruit and train a rifleman , and that marital problems are a big reason why soldiers quit , you do n't have to save many marriages for this to be cost - effective , says Peter Frederich , the chaplain in charge .
Several studies have shown that such courses do indeed help couples communicate better and quarrel less bitterly .
As to whether they prevent divorce , a meta - analysis by Jason Carroll and William Doherty concluded that the jury was still out .
The National Institutes of Health is paying for a five - year study of Mr Frederich 's soldiers to shed further light on the issue .
Americans expect a lot from marriage .
Whereas most Italians say the main purpose of marriage is to have children , 70 % of Americans think it is something else .
They want their spouse to make them happy .
Some go further and assume that if they are not happy , it must be because they picked the wrong person .
Sometimes that is true , sometimes not .
There is no such thing as a perfectly compatible couple , argues Diane Sollee , director of smartmarriages.com , a pro-marriage group .
Every couple has disputes , she says .
What matters most is how they resolve them .
At the end of the day , says Ms Squier , the government 's influence over the culture of marriage will be marginal .
Messages from movies , peers and parents matter far more .
But she does not see why , for example , the government 's only contact with an unmarried father should be to demand that he pay child support .
By not even mentioning marriage , the state is implying that no one expects him to stick around .
Is that a helpful message ?
In the months following Steve Jobs ’ dramatic return to Apple on 1996.12.20 , the press lost interest in the end of Apple ’s eleven year interregnum .
Instead , they were interested in Apple ’s brand new build to order online store , a first for a major computer industry player , and ( to Apple ’s embarrassment )
Umax ’s updated S900 Mac clone that was cheaper than a Power Mac and much faster , since it was designed to accept a 250 MHz NewerTech G3 processor upgrade .
The Apple brand was tarnished , no longer attracting the glowing press attention that once required a TV studio ( named Apple TV ) on Apple ’s Cupertino campus so John Sculley , Steve Jobs , and Jean - Louis Gassée could pontificate on the tech issues on the day .
Under Michael Spindler , Sculley ’s successor , Apple ’s brand was further diluted .
New brands proliferated : Peformas , Power Macs , and LCs for consumers .
Power Macs , Quadras , Centrises , and PowerBooks for professionals .
Few of the models were inspiring , merely solid .
Apple continued to win design awards , but more for refined beige than the Macintosh , a breakthrough information appliance , or the Apple II , a computer for consumers and professionals .
These changes did not suit Steve Jobs .
As Steve Jobs slowly consolidated control of the company , one of his top priorities was a rejuvenation of Apple ’s image .
This ultimately took the form of the immensely successful ( and long lived ) Think Different campaign .
Apple ’s PR Problem
After Jobs ’ departure from Apple on 1985.09.13 , Sculley made many changes at the company .
One of the first was a realignment of Apple ’s marketing strategy .
He , and the rest of the Apple board of directors were not particularly fond of the 1984 ad that had introduced the Macintosh during the 1984 Superbowl .
Luckily , they were overruled by Jobs , Bill Campbell , Steve Wozniak , and Lee Clow ( the creative director at Chiat / Day ) – and 1984 became one of the most popular TV commercials in history .
Apple was not so lucky in 1985 .
The Lemmings ad was unpopular amongst the board of directors and Sculley , but Jobs and his coterie overruled the board again .
The ad ran – and it was a flop .
It was worse than mediocre ( where people would simply fail to notice ) ; it was bad .
It offended many of the business people Apple was trying to court with the Macintosh Office and resurgent Macintosh .
Sculley fired Chiat / Day , which had handled Apple ’s PR for its entire history , and refocused Apple ’s marketing strategy on more conventional ads .
The abstract ads were still there , but they were augmented by ads that trumpeted features and price more than brand image .
Perhaps because of the less inspiring image , Apple ’s fortunes slumped in the mid-90s .
It invested more than a billion dollars into the Newton , a project that was unprofitable and unpopular .
It lost hundreds of millions of dollars between 1995 and 1997 , cutting thousands of jobs and was eulogized in the press .
Apple might have been a lost cause , but Gil Amelio , the second CEO after Sculley , decided to raise cash , cut costs , and buy NeXT .
He installed many of NeXT ’s former executives in high positions at Apple , supplanting many of his handpicked subordinates ( including Ellen Hancock ) .
Jobs was given a seat on the board and on the executive board , which reported directly to Amelio .
Jobs was disgusted by the malaise at Apple , especially amongst its product development and marketing staff .
He had courted the idea of taking the top job at Apple before ( he even tried to convince Amelio , who was then a new board member at Apple , to back his coup against Michael Spindler ) , but now he thought Apple needed him ,
On 1997.06.14 , Jobs launched a palace coup against Amelio .
He gave a damning speech to the Apple board of directors and successfully had Amelio sacked , although he did n’t get the top job himself .
Instead , he acted as de facto CEO .
Jobs occupied the board room and a small neighboring office in City Center 3 , then Apple ’s headquarters building , and began making deep cuts to Apple ’s research and development division .
Amelio had reduced 350 projects to 50 , and Jobs cut that number down to 10 .
He turned Apple ’s convoluted ( and often overlapping ) product line into a simple product matrix .
He also “ green lighted ” a radical research project at Apple , the Mac NC ( for Networked Computer ) , which eventually evolved into the iMac .
All the structural changes in the world would not save Apple , however .
The company ’s image had been sullied by its hard times , and it had shed the image of David to IBM ’s ( or Microsoft ’s ) Goliath .
Apple was a tired company with tired products and boring leaders .
The real clout was in new startups like Real and Yahoo !
Jobs , in what was by now typical behavior , took on the problem personally instead of delegating it to one of his subordinates .
New Marketing Strategy
Jobs invited three ad agency reps to present new ideas .
Lee Clow , now the creative director for Chiat / Day , was one of them .
On 1997.08.03 , he presented a new slogan and aesthetic for Apple ’s ads : Think Different ( perhaps a reference to IBM ’s famous THINK slogan ) and montages of artists and creative professionals using the Mac .
In an interview with Electric Escape , Clow said that he wanted to feature filmmakers at Dreamworks SKG working on their Macs .
Jobs was enamored with the concept , * though now using anonymous figures .
And instead of Dreamworks filmmakers , he wanted to use celebrities and thinkers .
Jobs had long been a fan of black and white portraits and prints .
NeXT ’s offices were decorated ( expensively ) with poster - sized prints from Ansel Adams , and Jobs ’ manse in Los Gatos was decorated with black and white portraits of his heroes , including Albert Einstein .
He began brainstorming on the spot .
Chiat / Day was reinstated as the chief advertising agency , and Lee Clow became a regular presence on the Apple campus .
Although the ad was produced entirely by Chiat / Day staff ( on Macs , of course ) , Jobs ( sometimes with marketing staffers ) reviewed revisions at every step of the process .
He used a satellite uplink between City Center 3 and Chiat / Day ’s Venice offices to review the clips in full video instead of relying on the mail or compressed files .
The Creative Process
Chiat / Day used a totally computer based creative environment .
Jobs gave the group 17 days after approval to complete the entire campaign .
That included the television commercial and billboards for major markets such as Los Angeles and New York .
An ordinary campaign for a more obscure client ( or even Apple under Amelio ) would have taken much longer just to get rights to the images .
Jobs was particularly useful when Clow and his team needed to get usage rights from celebrities including Joan Baez ( Jobs ’ ex- girlfriend ) and Yoko Ono ( once a neighbor near Central Park when Jobs lived in the San Remo and Yoko in the Dakota ) .
If Clow had approached these people ’s publicists , he would be another adman .
When Jobs called , he was a friend and a cult - figure in computer history .
The television commercial was produced using an Avid 4000 system on a Macintosh with Adobe AfterEffects .
Jennifer Gulab , who worked on the television commercial , worked very closely with Jobs via satellite link .
The two were in contact daily , working out which images would be used ( a choice largely based on the availability of images and permissions ) , the music , and the narration , which was done by Richard Dreyfus .
Dreyfus read a free - verse poem , “ Here ’s to the Crazy Ones ” , written by a Chiat / Day copywriter Craig Tanimoto .
This was used extensively throughout the entire campaign .
The first rule of the campaign was that there would be no products in the ads .
Clow and the rest of the creative team were very concerned with appearing to exploit the artists who ’s images they used .
Instead of being paid , all of the participants ( or their estates ) were given money and computer equipment to be donated to the charities or non-profits of their choice .
The print and billboard ads were also unique .
Instead of sticking to Mac and general computing magazines , Apple bought space in popular magazines and fashion magazines .
Outside advertisements were practically unheard of in the computer industry , but Chiat / Day rented hundreds of major spaces in New York and Los Angeles – and still does .
Since they had little time , instead of making full scale replicas of posters for bus stations or billboards in major cities , Jessica Schulman just imposed her mockups onto street scenes to give her colleagues an idea how her designs would look .
She also collaborated with Jobs , exchanging images on the Internet and making constant revisions .
Reaction
The campaign debuted on 1997.09.28 and was remarkably popular .
Unlike some of Apple ’s earlier major campaigns ( such as the “ Power to be your best ” ) , it received glowing press writeups .
The new campaign was a turning point for Apple .
On September 30 , two days after the debut , Jobs threw a party for Apple employees at his Palo Alto home where he talked about the campaign and Apple ’s future in general .
It began as a critique of Think Different but eventually turned into a rousing pep rally for Apple ’s image : “ our brand is the most – or at least one of the most – valuable things we have going for us now ” ( DaveNet ) and the company ’s future in general .
It “ only took 15 . . . 30 . . . maybe 60 seconds ” to reestablish Apple ’s counter - culture image that it had lost during the 90s ( DaveNet ) .
The ads won a slew of awards and developed a cult - following .
After the first campaign , Apple started sending complimentary posters to public schools across the nation featuring different celebrities ( including Pablo Picasso , Jane Goodall , and Ron Howard ) to hang in classrooms .
The complete packets now sell for hundreds of dollars on some websites .
Apple maintained the campaign until 2002 , and some of the early Apple retail stores featured Think Different tableaus and “ Here ’s to the Crazy Ones ” on the walls before Apple moved to Switch .
This article was first published 2007.04.09 .
* Rob Siltanen , the creative director and managing partner at TBWA / Chiat / Day at this time , was intimately involved in developing the “ Think Different ” ads and tells a very different story in December 2011 .
siltanen says Jabs was “ blatantly harsh ” at first , but eventually warmed to the idea .

Funny , but that has nothing to do with the commanders on the ground having the control they need .
Remember , that was why he vetoed the bill before .
Apparently now we have another reason .
What a surprise .
Now Bush is just being a whiny baby .
He wants all of the money NOW .
He does n’t want Congress to give him half now and half later , which would enable the American people to ensure that Bush is spending their money wisely .
Would it endanger the troops to get half the money now ?
No .
Does it hamper the commanders on the ground to get half the money now ?
No .
Bush is simply a whiny , incompetent child who has n’t proposed any kind of compromise whatsoever .
Sure , it might inconvenience Halliburton and Dick Cheney ’s other filthy rich war - profiteering buddies if they have to wait two months before being assured of their autumn windfall profits , but Halliburton ’s profits should n’t be the primary concern here .
Bush simply proposes vetoes because that ’s all he knows how to do , say no .
He wants all the money , no strings attached , so he can waste it all again and again and again on his corporate buddies while our troops continue to die for a lost cause .
The Democrats in Congress are trying to find a way to hold the president accountable to the people , to make this war work , and to ultimately get us the hell out of Iraq – Bush is more interested in playing a game of chicken , with no intent of compromising on anything .
To him it ’s all a game where winning the political battle is far more important than winning the real battle on the ground in Iraq .
It ’s time to take away the spoiled child ’s car keys .
la France qui se lève tôt

Nicolas Sarkozy - Conseil national de l'UMP le 6 mars 2005
C'est pourquoi l'Union pour un Mouvement Populaire souhaite que l'on fasse davantage pour la France qui se lève tôt le matin et qui pour autant peine à boucler ses fins de mois .
La France qui travaille .
La France qui ne demande rien , mais qui se lasse qu'on exige tant d'elle .
La France qui est généreuse et solidaire , mais qui est en droit d'attendre de ceux de ses enfants qu'elle aide qu'ils fassent un minimum d'efforts personnels pour s'en sortir .
La France qui n'en peut plus du nivellement , de l'égalitarisme et de l'assistanat , doit être entendue , écoutée et récompensée .
Nicolas Sarkozy - Réunion des cadres de l'UMP le 11 juin 2005
Et c'est un comble : bien souvent la reprise d'une activité est financièrement pénalisante pour celui ou celle qui a le courage de se lever tôt le matin .
Nous ne pouvons et ne devons pas l'accepter .
Nous devons changer cette réalité .
La vision socialiste est celle du nivellement , la nôtre est celle qui reconnaît comme naturel que celui qui travaille plus que les autres , gagne davantage que les autres .
Cessons de culpabiliser la France qui se lève tôt le matin .
Cessons d'imaginer que la France qui travaille n'a pas d'aspirations sociales .
On peut avoir un emploi , une famille , un logement et trouver que la vie est dure .
On peut avoir tout ceci et rêver de promotion sociale .
Notre politique sociale ne peut se résumer à la seule question des exclus .
Notre politique sociale doit s'adresser à la France qui travaille aussi .
L'UMP doit faire des classes moyennes , du monde des salariés , des Français du milieu , un sujet de préoccupation constant .
C'est le message premier de l'orientation politique de notre parti .
Récompenser le travail , c'est avoir le courage de reconnaître qu'après une vie de labeur , on a le droit de transmettre à ses enfants , en franchise d'impôts sur les successions , le patrimoine difficilement constitué .
La France qui se lève tôt
travaille dur
Nicolas Sarkozy - Pour une France plus juste - Douai - lundi 27 mars 2006
Il faut revoir les règles d'indemnisation du chômage qui doivent être à la fois plus justes et plus incitatives à la reprise du travail .
40 % des chômeurs n'ont aucune indemnité et ces dernières sont insuffisantes pour les salariés des catégories modestes ou même intermédiaires !
En contrepartie , car il n'y a pas de droits sans devoirs , il faut exiger des demandeurs d'emploi qu'ils recherchent véritablement une activité , et en reprennent une quand ils le peuvent , sous peine de voir leurs droits à indemnisation réduits voire supprimés .
C'est en luttant contre les abus de la générosité qu'on protège la générosité .
La France qui se lève tôt et travaille dur , veut bien être au rendez - vous de la solidarité , mais elle attend en retour que ceux qui sont aidés soient au rendez - vous de leur responsabilité .
Nicolas Sarkozy - Réunion des cadres de l'UMP - Samedi 13 mai 2006
Au service de cette grande ambition , l'UMP doit être le parti de tous les Français .
Que chaque Français , d'où qu'il vienne et quel qu'il soit , le sache : nous avons quelque chose à lui dire .
Nous voulons l'écouter , le comprendre , lui parler .
La France qui s'entasse dans le métro à 18 heures , la France qui se lève tôt pour rejoindre l'usine ou le bureau , la France des fonctionnaires qui aiment leur métier , la France des parents qui se serrent la ceinture pour leurs enfants , la France des campagnes qui ne veut pas renoncer à son avenir , la France des cités qui rêve de réussite sociale , la France qui a du mal à finir les fins de mois , bref la France qui est à la peine et qui mérite sa réussite , c'est la France que nous voulons représenter , incarner , entraîner .
L'électeur du Front National que nous avons perdu en chemin parce que sa souffrance n'a pas été entendue , comme l'électeur du parti communiste qui ne sait plus à quel idéal se vouer , n'appartient à personne !
Rien ni personne ne pourra m'interdire d'aller lui parler et le convaincre de nous rejoindre !
Nicolas Sarkozy - Réunion publique Agen - 22 juin 2006
Je veux parler d'une autre souffrance , bien réelle , qui ne doit pas être sous - estimée : celle de la France qui n'est pas dans la précarité , qui se lève tôt , qui travaille dur , qui se donne du mal pour nourrir sa famille et élever ses enfants , qui elle aussi je l'affirme est à la peine , et qui entend qu'on le sache et qu'on réponde à son appel .
Sur fond de chômage de masse , de mondialisation , d'efforts acharnés de productivité et de prélèvements sur le travail sans cesse accrus pour régler la facture toujours plus lourde de la fracture sociale , depuis 25 ans la vérité est qu'on demande à cette France qui travaille toujours plus de sacrifices .
Je veux m'adresser à cette France qui n'en peut plus de faire des efforts et dont on ne parle que pour la culpabiliser .
2 . Les fainéants et les tricheurs
Nicolas Sarkozy - Nicolas Sarkozy , Discours à Périgueux - 12 octobre 2006
Je veux un Etat qui ne soit pas fragilisé par le laxisme et par la fraude .
Je ne veux pas que ceux qui ne veulent rien faire , que ceux qui ne veulent pas travailler vivent sur le dos de ceux qui se lèvent tôt et qui travaillent dur .
Je ne veux pas que ceux qui fraudent l’assurance chômage , l ’assurance maladie , les allocations familiales , ceux qui escroquent le fisc ou les ASSEDIC , ceux qui détournent de l’argent public par copinage ou par favoritisme , continuent à mettre en péril la solidarité nationale .
Parce que cela renforce la crise morale et la défiance vis -à - vis de ceux qui sont vraiment dans le besoin .
Nicolas Sarkozy - Discours à la Réunion – 15 février 2007
Il faut que chaque citoyen sente qu'il doit donner à la France autant qu'il reçoit d'elle !
Il faut que celui qui se lève tôt pour aller travailler soit mieux récompensé que celui qui a décidé de ne plus se lever !
Il faut que celui qui prend des risques soit mieux considéré que celui qui n'en prend aucun !
I l faut que le jeune qui " bosse " dur pour s'acheter sa voiture ne soit pas ridiculisé par le dealer du coin qui gagne en un jour ce que certains gagnent en un mois !
Nicolas Sarkozy - Discours à Meaux – 13 avril 2007
Que doivent penser ceux qui se lèvent à 5 heures du matin pour prendre un bus et aller travailler quand leurs impôts financent les vacances et la carte orange de ceux qui ne travaillent pas ?
3 . Les accidentés de la vie
accidentés de la vie
Nicolas Sarkozy - Discours à Marseille – 1er décembre 2006
J'ajoute que le Président de la République de 2007 devra aussi s'attacher à rassembler les Français autour d'une vision nouvelle de la solidarité et du mérite .
La fracture sociale , si elle existe , se situe désormais nettement entre la France qui travaille , se lève tôt et élève ses enfants sans bénéficier d'aucune aide spécifique , et ceux qui , par faiblesse , par accident ou par facilité , se sont laissés enfermer dans l'assistanat .
L'absurdité est à son comble quand il arrive que l'accumulation des aides nationales et locales place les personnes inactives en situation de percevoir , sans aucun travail , des revenus identiques à ceux que procurent des métiers rémunérés au SMIC .
Déjà ébranlée par chaque livraison de la presse qui apporte son lot de fraudes , d'abus et d'escroqueries en tout genre , affectant tantôt l'un , tantôt l'autre des pans de notre protection sociale , c'est l'idée de solidarité qui est menacée de ne pas survivre à la perpétuation de telles injustices .
accident ( é ) de la vie
Nicolas Sarkozy - Discours à Saint - Quentin - 25 janvier 2007
Je souhaite que les intérêts des emprunts pour acheter son logement soient déductibles en totalité du revenu imposable , que le crédit hypothécaire soit réformé , que l’accès à la propriété pour les locataires de logements sociaux soit facilité parce que la propriété c’est la meilleure assurance contre les accidents de la vie , contre la précarité .
[…]
Je veux être le Président d’une France dans laquelle l’Etat aide ceux qui en ont besoin , ceux que les accidents de la vie ont abîmés au point qu’ils n’arrivent plus à se tenir debout tout seuls .
Ma France , c’est celle où l’Etat ne laisse personne dans la détresse , où l’Etat tend la main à l’enfant pauvre , au malade , au handicapé , à la personne âgée qui est dépendante , où l’Etat accompagne ceux qui veulent s’en sortir , ceux qui sont prêts à faire un effort sur eux-mêmes , où l’Etat donne à ceux qui n’ont plus la force de vouloir , l’énergie de vouloir de nouveau .
Nicolas Sarkozy - Discours au soir du premier tour - 22 avril 2007
Je veux parler à tous ceux que la vie a brisés , aux accidentés de la vie , à ceux qu’elle a usés , à ceux qui sont dans la détresse .
Je veux parler aux malades , aux handicapés , aux personnes âgées , à ceux qu’une pression trop forte a épuisés , à ceux qui ont trop souffert
accident
4 . Une erreur d’analyse
Jean - Marie Le Pen - Discours du Bourget - 12 novembre 2006
Cette politique dite « libérale » produisant chômage de masse , pauvreté , assistanat , travail clandestin et stagnation des salaires …
Jean - Marie Le Pen - Discours à Nice - 19 avril 2007
Nos soutiens à nous , c’est cette immense cohorte des victimes de la mondialisation , des délocalisations , fruits vénéneux et mortels de votre politique ,
Ce sont ces 14 millions de travailleurs pauvres dont vous venez d’apprendre l’existence ,
Ce sont ces humiliés du chômage , des retraites misérables ,
C’est ce long cortège de nos derniers paysans devenus assistés ,
C’est ce peuple entier des rmistes privés de dignité à qui vous ne concédez même plus les miettes des immenses profits que réalisent ceux qui vous dirigent !
*
Daniel Scheidermann m'a demandé de réfléchir à quelques expressions clés de la campagne , pour Arrêt sur images de dimanche ( ce sera d'ailleurs plutôt Arrêt sur paroles , puisqu'on va y décortiquer les mots ... ) .
Parmi les expressions qui ont émaillé cette campagne , il en est une qui m'a frappé : « » .
Elle apparaît dans le discours de Nicolas Sarkozy début mars 2005 au Conseil national de l’UMP .
Elle va devenir pour lui une expression clé , qui sera martelée tout au long de la campagne .
Elle se durcit au fil des mois , entrant progressivement dans la rhétorique sarkozienne qui consiste à opposer des classes de Français entre eux .
Il y aura donc « ceux qui se lèvent tôt » et les autres , dont on va voir qu’ils peuvent regrouper des catégories assez différentes , dans un flou savamment entretenu .
L’évolution de l’expression au fil des discours constitue pratiquement un cas d’école , qui illustre le fonctionnement et la mise en place du discours sarkozien .
On va voir que l’expression change progressivement de signification , partant du presque consensuel ( le travail doit rapporter plus que les aides publiques ) jusqu’à un discours qui rejoint ( et , comme on le verra , paradoxalement dépasse ) celui de l’extrême - droite .
Dans une première phase , l’expression est un peu pléonastique ( « se lève tôt le matin » ) , et illustre l ’idée que le travail doit être récompensé et être plus payant que l’ « assistanat ».
L’opposition avec d’autres groupes n’est pas encore explicitement marquée dans le discours , bien qu’on sente déjà poindre la France « qui n’en peut plus de l’assistanat » : On peut encore imaginer dans l’extrait précédent que la France qui se lève tôt inclut la très grande masse des travailleurs pauvres et précaires , à travers l’expression « qui pour autant peine à boucler ses fins de mois » .
En juin 2005 , le discours se précise .
Les travailleurs pauvres passent au second plan : « Notre politique sociale ne peut se résumer à la seule question des exclus » , et l’on voit que dans la question des droits de successions , qu’il s’agit de ceux qui ont tout de même au moins un peu à transmettre et ne sont donc pas dans la plus grande pauvreté .
Le discours est d’ailleurs explicite : « L'UMP doit faire des classes moyennes , du monde des salariés , des Français du milieu , un sujet de préoccupation constant .
».
En mars 2006 , l ’expression se transforme : le pléonasme disparaît , et elle se complète :et .
On voit exprimée pour la première fois l ’idée qu’à côté de cette France des travailleurs , il y a une France paresseuse , celle des chômeurs qui ne recherchent pas véritablement un emploi .
Mais le mot paresse n’est pas prononcé , et l’opposition n’est pas explicite .
Elle est laissée , comme souvent chez Sarkozy , à la reconstruction subliminale de l’auditeur .
Les expressions sont mises côte à côte , mais rien n’est vraiment dit .
On fait simplement appel à la responsabilité .
Qui peut être contre ?
La stratégie devient claire en mai 2006 .
Il s’agit de récupérer l’électorat du Front national .
Elle sera constante jusqu’à l’élection , et l’on verra qu’elle aura été payante : La première phase se conclut par le discours d’Agen en juin 2006 .
C’est dit explicitement : la France qui se lève tôt et travaille dur n’inclut pas la masse des travailleurs précaires , comme on aurait pu le penser au départ .
La deuxième phase débute avec le discours de Périgueux en octobre 2006 .
Elle consiste en un durcissement radical : jusqu’ici l’autre France , qui ne se lève pas tôt , était laissée en filigrane .
Elle est maintenant clairement désignée .
Ce sont les fainéants et fraudeurs : Les expressions sont dures , et l’opposition est désormais en place : il y a ceux qui se lèvent tôt et ceux qui vivent sur le dos des autres .
Un cran supplémentaire va être franchi mi-février , à la Réunion .
L’autre France , c’est non seulement celle des petits tricheurs , mais celle des véritables délinquants : Ce discours marque le point de départ de la phase finale intensive de droitisation du discours sarkozien : appel à l’autorité ( mot prononcé 75 fois à Perpignan le 23 février ) , condamnation de « l’esprit de mai 68 » , proposition d’un ministère de l’Immigration et de l’identité nationale , etc .
La rhétorique d’opposition des catégories entre elles prendra parfois des accents très durs , comme à Meaux : Dans ce binarisme , il n’y a pas de place pour trois catégories de citoyens , qui sont pourtant probablement bien plus nombreuses que les paresseux et tricheurs qui sont mis en avant dans la rhétorique de la France qui se lève tôt : ( 1 ) ceux qui ont perdu leur emploi , mais souhaitent désespérément en retrouver un ; ( 2 ) les jeunes , qui n’ont jamais réussi à entrer dans le marché du travail et connaissent une précarité considérable , qui avait été mise en évidence par les émeutes des banlieues et la crise du CPE ; ( 3 ) la quantité importante de travailleurs précaires , dont on a vu qu’ils avaient déjà disparu du discours plusieurs mois auparavant .
La première catégorie va être progressivement réintégrée dans le discours , sous la dénomination d’ .
L’expression apparaît au détour d’une phrase en décembre 2006 : Les accidentés de la vie sont enserrés entre les tricheurs ( la faiblesse ) et les paresseux ( la facilité ) .
L’expressionva apparaître fin janvier et sera martelée jusqu’à la fin de la campagne .
Elle réfère habilement autant à la perte d’emploi qu’au handicap et à la maladie , dont elle récupère la charge émotionnelle : Elle apparaîtra en particulier , et c’est très symbolique , au soir du premier tour : C’est la seule catégorie de la « France qui ne se lève pas tôt » qui trouve donc grâce aux yeux du candidat .
Le motmarque clairement l ’idée que ce n’est pas de leur faute .
Ce n’est pas dit , mais l’implicite est forcément que les autres catégories , même si elles ne sont pas des tricheurs et des paresseux , sont responsables de leur situation .
Les jeunes n’ont qu’à se prendre en main , et les travailleurs précaires n’ont sans doute qu’à travailler plus pour gagner plus .
Cette opposition des catégories de Français et cet appel à la méritocratie a été jugé comme une dérive d’extrême - droite , visant à chasser sur les terres de Jean - Marie Le Pen .
Il est vrai que dans le même temps l’appel à l’autorité et les propos musclés sur l’immigration incitaient à cette analyse .
En fait , c’est peut - être le discours que les électeurs de Jean - Marie Le Pen voulaient entendre , mais personne ne semble avoir noté dans la presse et les médias , que , curieusement , celui- ci ne tenait justement plus exactement le même discours .
Les « travailleurs pauvres » par exemple sont un mot clé récurrent de son discours , et contrairement à Nicolas Sarkozy , Jean - Marie Le Pen ne culpabilise ni les chômeurs ni les assistés .
Il fait porter la responsabilité de leurs difficultés sur la politique libérale , dans un discours que l’on pourrait confondre , si l’on n’était pas prévenu , avec celui d’Arlette Laguiller : Étrangement , la presse et les médias ne semblent pas avoir aperçu ce paradoxe .
Les électeurs l’ont vu , eux , et ils ont cette fois considéré que la copie était meilleure que l’original .
Je vous donne rendez - vous pour d'autres décryptages dans Arrêt sur images , ce dimanche ( France 5 , 12h35 ) .

Home » forums » LtU Forum Total Functional Programming Abstract :
The driving idea of functional programming is to make programming more closely related to mathematics .
A program in a functional language such as Haskell or Miranda consists of equations which are both computation rules and a basis for simple algebraic reasoning about the functions and data structures they define .
The existing model of functional programming , although elegant and powerful , is compromised to a greater extent than is commonly recognized by the presence of partial functions .
We consider a simple discipline of total functional programming designed to exclude the possibility of non-termination .
Among other things this requires a type distinction between data , which is finite , and codata , which is potentially infinite .
I presume that the bogus definiton of " fib " is a subtle reminder of the importance of eliminating bottom .
Here 's an interesting paper recently mention in another thread : Total Functional Programming ... I presume that the bogus definiton of " " is a subtle reminder of the importance of eliminating bottom .

Andrew Feldmar , a well - known Vancouver psychotherapist , rolled up to the Blaine border crossing last summer as he had hundreds of times in his career .
At 66 , his gray hair , neat beard , and rimless glasses give him the look of a seasoned intellectual .
He handed his passport to the U.S. border guard and relaxed , thinking he would soon be with an old friend in Seattle .
The border guard turned to his computer and googled " Andrew Feldmar . "
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
The psychotherapist 's world was about to turn upside down .
Born in Hungary to Jewish parents as the Nazis were rising to power , Feldmar was hidden from the Nazis during the Holocaust when he was three years old , after his parents were condemned to Auschwitz .
Miraculously , his parents both returned alive and in 1945 Hungary was liberated by the Russian army .
Feldmar escaped from communist Hungary in 1956 when he was 16 and immigrated to Canada .
He has been married to Meredith Feldmar , an artist , for 37 years , and they live in Vancouver 's Kitsilano neighbourhood .
They have two children , Soma , 33 , who lives in Denver , and Marcel , 36 , a resident of L.A.
Highly respected in his field , Feldmar has been travelling to the U.S. for work and to see his family five or six times a year .
He has worked for the UN , in Sarajevo and in Minsk with Chernobyl victims .
The Blaine border guard explained that Feldmar had been pulled out of the line as part of a random search .
He seemed friendly , even as he took away Feldmar 's passport and car keys .
While the contents of his car were being searched , Feldmar and the officer talked .
He asked Feldmar what profession he was in .
When Feldmar said he was psychologist , the official typed his name into his Internet search engine .
Before long the customs guard was engrossed in an article Feldmar had published in the spring 2001 issue of the journal Janus Head .
The article concerned an acid trip Feldmar had taken in London , Ontario , and another in London , England , almost forty years ago .
It also alluded to the fact that he had used hallucinogenics as a " path " to understanding self and that in certain cases , he reflected , it could " be preferable to psychiatry . "
Everything seemed to collapse around him , as a quiet day crossing the border began to turn into a nightmare .
Fingerprints for FBI
He was told to sit down on a folding chair and for hours he wondered where this was going .
He checked his watch and thought hopelessly of his friend who was about to land at the Seattle airport .
Three hours later , the official motioned him into a small , barren room with an American flag .
He was sitting on one side and Feldmar was on the other .
The official said that under the Homeland Security Act , Feldmar was being denied entry due to " narcotics " use .
LSD is not a narcotic substance , Feldmar tried to explain , but an entheogen .
The guard was n't interested in technicalities .
He asked for a statement from Feldmar admitting to having used LSD and he fingerprinted Feldmar for an FBI file .
Then Feldmar disbelievingly listened as he learned that he was being barred from ever entering the United States again .
The officer told him he could apply to the Department of Homeland Security for a waiver , if he wished , and gave him a package , with the forms .
The border guard then escorted him to his car and made sure he did a U - turn and went back to Canada .
' Curious .
Very curious '
Feldmar attended the University of Toronto where he graduated with honours in mathematics , physics and chemistry .
He received his M.A. in psychology from the University of Western Ontario .
At University of Western Ontario , he was under supervision with Zenon Pylyshyn , who was from Saskatchewan and had participated , along with Abram Hoffer and Duncan Blewett , in the first experiments with LSD - 25 .
" Zenon told me he had had enough strange experiences , that he had gone about as far with LSD as he wished to go .
He still had what was once legal ....
Looking back 33 years , I do n't quite recall why I decided to accept his tentative offer .
I was 27 years old and thought of myself as a rational scientist , and had no experience with delirium , hallucination , or altered mind states .
I was curious .
Very curious .
I thought that , like Faust , I might make a pact with the devil in return for esoteric knowledge . "
Zenon gave him 900 micrograms of acid and the surprise of his life , he wrote in the Janus Head article .
" Following this initiation , I traveled to many regions many times with the help of many different substances .
I took peyote , psilocybin mushrooms , cannabis , MDMA , DMT , ketamine , nitrous oxide 5 - MEO - DMT , but I kept coming back to LSD .
Acid seemed my most spacious , most helpful ally .
While on it , I explored my past , regressed to the womb , to my conception .
I remembered , grieved , and mourned many painful events .
I saw how my parents would have liked to love me , and how they did n't because they did n't know how .
I learned , on acid , to endure troubling and frightening states of mind .
This enabled me , as meditation has done , to identify with being the witness of the workings of my mind , observing whatever was going on , while knowing that I was simply captivated by the forms produced by my own psyche . "
After receiving his MA , Feldmar spent a semester in the U.S. at the Johns Hopkins University 's Ph.D. program in theoretical statistics .
In 1969 , he began Ph.D. work with Dr. Charles Osgood in psycholinguistics at the University of Illinois at Champagne Urbana .
He did further Ph.D. studies at Simon Fraser University .
Legal options expensive
Feldmar was determined , in the months after the aborted border crossing , to turn things around .
He was particularly determined because the idea of not being able to visit his children at their homes was unthinkable .
He contacted the U.S. Consul in Vancouver to protest and was again told to apply for a waiver .
When he consulted Seattle attorney Bob Free at MacDonald , Hoague and Bayless about going through this process , he learned that for $ 3,500 ( U.S. ) plus incidentals , he'd have a 90 per cent chance to get the waiver , but it would probably be just for a year , and the procedure would have to be initiated again , any time he wished to cross the border .
Each time , he would have to produce a statement saying that he had been " rehabilitated . "
He looked into filing suit against the U.S. government for wrongdoing but gave up the idea when he learned that a legal battle with U.S. Customs would cost his life 's savings and , with the balance of power tipped so extremely in the government 's favor , he would almost surely lose .
Again , he appealed to the U.S. Consulate .
The consulate would n't return his phone calls , but in this e-mail message to Feldmar , the consulate explained its position .
" Both our countries have very similar regulations regarding issuance of visas for citizens who have violated the law .
The issue here is not the writing of an article , but the taking of controlled substances .
I hear from American citizens all the time who have decades - old DUI convictions who are barred from entry into Canada and who must apply for waivers .
Same thing here .
Waiver is the only way . "
Ensnared by Section IV
" Admitted drug use is admitted drug use , " says Mike Milne , spokesman for U.S. border and protection , based in Seattle .
Milne said he could not comment specifically on the Feldmar case , due to privacy issues , but he quoted from the U.S. Immigration Law Handbook section which refers to " general classes of aliens ineligible to receive visas and ineligible for admissions " to help shed light on the clauses that may have ensnared the Vancouver psychotherapist .
" Persons with AIDS , tuberculosis , infectious diseases are inadmissible , " Milne said .
And then there is Section IV .
" Anyone who is determined to be a drug abuser or user is inadmissible .
A crime involving moral turpitude is inadmissible and one of those areas is a violation of controlled substances . "
If there 's no criminal record , as in Feldmar 's case ?
Not necessarily the criterion , Milne said .
You can still be considered dangerous .
' More diligent and vigilant '
" The level of scrutiny at our nation 's borders have definitely gone up since the 9 - 11 disaster and we are more diligent and vigilant in checking people 's identities and criminal histories at our nation 's borders . "
Milne goes on , " There are three main areas that we have employed since 9 - 11 to better secure our borders .
First is the number of officers we have working at our borders .
We 've doubled the numbers at the border .
We 've combined officers from Homeland Security and border protection .
We brought in the officers from immigration and naturalization service , the department of agriculture and U.S. border patrol .
By combining the expertise of those disparate border agencies into a single agency under a single management with the single purpose of protecting the U.S. against terrorism and other related offences , it created a more effective border agency .
It created a more secure border .
" The second thing would be our information systems , our watch list systems are better shared within the U.S. government and between governments , between information sharing agreements , through Interpol , through terrorist watch list sharing internationally , we have better access for our front line officers to query information systems up to and including public based systems , including the Internet .
Third , we have better infrastructure at our entries .
We have cameras in some of our more remote points of entry , gates , lighting , to make them more secure .
We do more checks at the borders .
It depends on what level of alert we 're at .
At certain alert levels we do 100 per cent identity checks . "
War on drugs meets war on terror
Eugene Oscapella is an Ottawa lawyer , who lectures on drug policy issues in the department of criminology at the University of Ottawa .
He also works as a policy advisor to a range of government agencies and departments , including the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada .
Oscapella sees the American security system upgrades and the potential uses alarming .
" This is about the marriage of the war on drugs and the war on terror , and the blind , bureaucratic mindset it encourages .
Government surveillance in the name of the war on drugs and the war on terror is in danger of making us all open books to zealous governments .
As someone mentioned at a privacy conference I attended in London , U.K. , several months ago , all the tools for an authoritarian state are now in place ; it 's just that we have n't yet adopted authoritarian methods .
But in the area of drugs , maybe we have . "
' Ominous omen '
Feldmar was in the process of considering whether to apply for a waiver when he sought help from Ethan Nadlemann , director of the Drug Policy Alliance in New York , whose financial backer is another Hungarian , George Soros .
Nadlemann was outraged .
" Nobel Peace prize winners , some of the great scientists and writers in the world have experimented with LSD in their time .
We know people are being pulled out of lines and racially profiled as part of the war against terrorism .
But this is a different kind of travesty , banning someone because they used a substance in another country thirty years ago , " he said .
In February he wrote Feldmar , " Not that it helps much , but I just want you to know that I have not forgotten you or your situation .
I feel frustrated vis a vis the media , and on other avenues , but I am not forgetting .
I really think this situation is absurd , and an ominous omen of things to come . "
When Feldmar was barred from entering the U.S. , he joined the ranks of other intellectuals and artists .
Pop singer Cat Stevens was turned back from the U.S. in 2004 , after being detained .
Bolivian human rights leader and lawyer , Leonida Zurita Vargas was prevented from entering in February of 2006 .
She was planning to be in the U.S. as part of a three week speaking tour on Bolivian social movements and human rights .
The tour would have taken her to Vermont , Harvard , Stanford and Washington D.C. , but she never got beyond the airport check - in at Santa Cruz , Bolivia where she was informed her ten - year visa had been revoked because of alleged links to terrorist activity .
' Ideological exclusion provision '
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security denied Professor John Milios entry into the country upon his arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport last June .
Milios , a faculty member at the National Technical University of Athens , had planned to present a paper at a conference titled " How Class Works " at the State University of New York at Stony Brook .
Milios told Academe Online that U.S. officials questioned him at the airport about his political ideas and affiliations and that the American consul in Athens later queried him about the same subjects .
Milios , a member of a left - wing political party , is active in Greek national politics and has twice been a candidate for the Greek parliament .
Milios 's visa , issued in 1996 , was set to expire in November .
The professor had previously been allowed entry into the United States on five separate occasions to participate in academic meetings .
The American Civil Liberties Union , on behalf of the American Academy of Religion , the American Association of University Professors and PEN American Center , filed a lawsuit this year challenging a provision of the Patriot Act that is being used to deny visas to foreign scholars .
They did this after Professor Tariq Ramadan , a Swiss intellectual , had his visa revoked under " the ideological exclusion provision " of the Patriot Act , preventing him from assuming a tenured teaching position at the University of Notre Dame .
It 's a suit that attempts to prevent the practice of ideological exclusion more generally , a practice that led to the recent exclusions of Dora Maria Tellez , a Nicaraguan scholar who had been offered a position at Harvard University , as well as numerous scholars from Cuba .
In March 2005 , the ACLU filed a Freedom of Information Act request to learn more about the government 's use of the Patriot Act ideological exclusion provision .
Cuban Grammy nominee Ibrahim Ferrer , 77 , who came to fame in the 1999 film Buena Vista Social Club , was blocked by the U.S. government from attending the Grammy Awards , where he was nominated for the Best Latin album award in 2004 .
So were his fellow musicians Guillermo Rubalcaba , Amadito Valdes , Barbarito Torres and the group Septeto Nacional with Ignacio Pineiro .
The list goes on .
Cut off from friends
Nine months after being turned back at the border , Feldmar has concluded that his banishment is permanent .
The waiver process is exhausting , costly and demeaning .
The David and Goliath aspect of the situation is too daunting .
This is devastating to his family and friends .
" My father was doing nothing wrong , illegal , suspicious , or at all deviant in any way , when he was trying to visit the U.S. , " his daughter , Soma , an instructor at a Denver college , says .
" In terms of family it really sucks . "
It 's hard for his friend , Alphonso Lingis , a professor of philosophy at Pennsylvania State University .
" I 'm deeply pained by the prospect of no longer being able to welcome him in the United States , " Lingis said .
" The notion that he and his work could harm anyone is preposterous .
He 's a victim of scandalous bureaucratic incompetence by the United States officials involved in this matter . "
' Alchemist 's dictum '
When Feldmar looks back on what has happened , he concludes that he was operating out of a sense of safety that has become dated in the last six years , since 9 - 11 .
His real mistake was to write about his drug experiences and post this on the web , even in a respected journal like Janus Head .
He acknowledges that he had not considered posting on the Internet the risk that it turned out to be .
So many of his generation share his experience in experimenting with drugs , after all .
He believed it was safe to communicate about the past from the depth of retrospection and that this would be a useful grain of personal wisdom to share with others .
He now warns his friends to think twice before they post anything about their personal lives on the web .
" I did n't heed the ancient Alchemists ' dictum , ' Do , dare , and be silent , ' " Feldmar says .
" And yet , the experience of being treated as undesirable was shocking .
The helplessness , the utter uselessness of trying to be seen as I know myself and as I am known generally by those I care about and who care about me , the reduction of me to an undesirable offender , was truly frightening .
I became aware of the fragility of my identity , the brittleness of a way of life .
" Memories of having been the object of the objectifying gaze crowd into my mind .
I have been seen and labeled as a Jew , as a Communist , as a D. P. ( Displaced Person ) , as a student , as a patient , a man , a Hungarian , a refugee , an émigré , an immigrant ....
Now I am being seen as one of those drug users , perhaps an addict , perhaps a dealer , one can't be sure .
In the matter of a second , I became powerless , whatever I said was n't going to be taken seriously .
I was labeled , sorted and disposed of .
Dismissed . "
