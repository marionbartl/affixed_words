— Bernd Debusmann is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own –
As far as illicit businesses with low risk and high rewards go , it does n’t get much better than piracy on the high seas .
The profit margins can easily surpass those of the cocaine trade .
The risks ?
“ There is no reason not to be a pirate , ” according to U.S. Vice Admiral William Gortney , who commands the U.S. navy ’s Fifth Fleet .
“ The vessel I ’m trying to pirate , they wo n’t shoot at me .
I ’m going to get my money . ”
Even pirates who are intercepted have little to fear .
“ They wo n’t arrest me because there ’s no place to try me . ”
Gortney ’s assessment of piracy ’s low risk came in a radio interview that focused on the Gulf of Aden , where Somali pirates this month capped a string of increasingly brazen hijackings by seizing a Saudi supertanker carrying $ 100 million worth of U.S. - bound crude .
But although attention is focused on the Horn of Africa , piracy is a global phenomenon ( see map ) , relative impunity applies in many places , and a thick legal fog hangs over effective action .
Among questions to keep lawyers busy : Can a naval vessel fire on a suspected pirate ship ?
It depends .
Who would be held accountable for someone killed in an exchange of fire between pirates and private security personnel traveling aboard a merchant ship ?
Which country ’s jurisdiction applies , for example , to a Somali arrested on the high seas and taken aboard a Danish vessel ?
“ One of the challenges that we have …in piracy clearly is if you are intervening and you capture pirates , is there a path to prosecute them ? ”
Admiral Mike Mullen , the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , explained at a recent Pentagon briefing .
A rough back - of - the - envelope calculation shows that the operation to hijack the Saudi tanker , the Sirius Star , cost no more than $ 25,000 assuming that the pirates bought new equipment and weapons ( $ 450 apiece for an AK - 47 Kalashnikov , $ 5,000 for an RPG 7 grenade launcher , $ 15,000 for a speedboat ) .
That contrasts with an initial ransom demand from the tanker ’s owner , Saudi Aramco , of $ 25 million .
“ Piracy is an excellent business model if you operate from an impoverished , lawless place like Somalia , ” says Patrick Cullen , a security expert at the London School of Economics who has been researching piracy .
“ The risk - reward ratio is just huge . ”
One way to shrink that ratio would be to place private security guards on vessels that ply shipping routes prone to pirate attack , from the waters off Nigeria to the Molucca Straits and the Horn of Africa .
That ’s the solution recommended by the commander of the U.S. Fifth Fleet , whose area of responsibility covers 7.5 million square miles , including the waters off Somalia .
Its warships ca n’t be everywhere .
Even with the additional deployment of warships from France , Britain , Denmark , Russia , India , Japan , Korea , and Malaysia , the navies are looking for needles in a haystack .
The pirates launch speedboats from mother ships hundreds of miles off the coast .
BLOW THEM OUT OF THE WATER
Carrying armed guards aboard ships sounds a simple , straightforward solution .
They stand watch ; they fire warnings flares at an approaching speedboat manned by what looks like pirates .
If the vessel does n’t turn away , they blow it out of the water .
End of story .
Except if the incident somehow turned into a court case and the ship ’s crew and guards had to prove that the men in the approaching speedboat were driven by criminal intent .
By some definitions , an act of piracy does n’t begin until the grappling hooks are thrown over the side and the pirates start clambering up .
In the past , shipping companies , by and large , have been reluctant to add armed personnel to their crews , partly for reasons of cost – a security team can add $ 30,000 to $ 60,000 and more to a voyage – and partly because the statistical chance of having their ships hijacked or attacked are relatively small .
The International Maritime Organization puts the world trading fleet at 50,525 ships .
In the first nine months of this year , the International Maritime Bureau ’s piracy reporting center in Kuala Lumpur recorded 199 attacks on ships , including 36 hijackings .
In percentage terms , this is not much .
But the targets , and the ransom demands , have been getting bigger .
The Sirius Star was taken less than two months after the hijacking of a Ukrainian freighter , the Fainu , which carried some 30 T - 72 tanks , crates of rocket - propelled grenades , anti-aircraft guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition .
That capture made world headlines and raised fresh questions over existing anti-piracy tactics .
Private security firms see new markets and new opportunities .
Several British firms have begun teaming up with insurance companies that offer lower rates for ships carrying security teams .
Anti-pirate devices now coming into use range from razor wire strung along the side of ships to sound cannon – a weapon that beams ear - splitting noise at suspected attackers .
One U.S. company , Blackwater Worldwide , is offering maritime escort services with a 183 - foot vessel that carries two helicopters , a crew of 15 and 35 guards .
Blackwater says 13 shipping companies have expressed interest .
To make pirates think twice about the risk - reward ratio , nothing is likely to be as effective as brute force .
But those who warn that 18th century methods can be problematic in the 21st can now point to the example set by the Indian frigate Tabar on November 18 .
According to the Indian navy , the Tabar had come under fire from a suspected pirate mother ship that had failed to obey a command to stop .
The Indian frigate returned fire , “ in self defense . ”
The ship blew up in a ball of fire and sank .
A week later , it turned out that the suspected mothership was a Thai freighter that was being taken over by pirates when the frigate approached .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other senior U.S. officials share much of the blame for detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , and Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , according to portions of a report released on Thursday by the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld testifies during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on what military leaders knew about the combat death in Afghanistan of U.S. Army Ranger and former football star Pat Tillman , in Washington , August 1 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Yuri Gripas / Files
The report ’s executive summary , made public by the committee ’s Democratic chairman Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan and its top Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona , said Rumsfeld contributed to the abuse by authorizing aggressive interrogation techniques at Guantanamo Bay on December 2 , 2002 .
He rescinded the authorization six weeks later .
But the report said word of his approval continued to spread within U.S. military circles and encouraged the use of harsh techniques as far away as Iraq and Afghanistan .
The report concluded that Rumsfeld ’s actions were “ a direct cause of detainee abuse ” at Guantanamo and “ influenced and contributed to the use of abusive techniques ... in Afghanistan and Iraq . ”
“ The abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib in late 2003 was not simply the result of a few soldiers acting on their own , ” the executive summary said .
“ Interrogation techniques such as stripping detainees of their clothes , placing them in stress positions and using military working dogs to intimidate them appeared in Iraq only after they had been approved for use in Afghanistan and at ( Guantanamo ) . ”
The detainee scandal at Abu Ghraib and later revelations of aggressive U.S. interrogations such as “ waterboarding ” led to an international outcry and charges that the United States allowed prisoners to be tortured , a claim denied by the Bush administration .
The Bush administration has since recanted the policies under pressure from Congress , while President - elect Barack Obama has vowed to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay .
The report found that the military derived the techniques from a Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape program , or SERE , which trains U.S. soldiers to resist enemy interrogation that does not conform to the Geneva Conventions or international law .
“ These policies are wrong and must never be repeated , ” McCain , who last month ended an unsuccessful bid for the White House , said in a statement released with the executive summary .
McCain said the report revealed an “ inexcusable link between abusive interrogation techniques used by our enemies who ignored the Geneva Conventions and interrogation policy for detainees in U.S. custody . ”
The full report , billed as the most thorough examination of U.S. military detainee policy by Congress , remains classified .
Committee staff said the full report was approved on November 20 in a unanimous voice vote by 17 of the panel ’s 25 members .
The panel consists of 13 Democrats and 12 Republicans .
The executive summary also traces the erosion of detainee treatment standards to a Feb , . 7 , 2002 , memorandum signed by President George W. Bush stating that the Geneva Convention did not apply to the U.S. war with al Qaeda and that Taliban detainees were not entitled to prisoner of war status or legal protections .
“ The president ’s order closed off application of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions , which would have afforded minimum standards for humane treatment , ” the summary said .
Members of Bush ’s Cabinet and other senior officials participated in meetings inside the White House in 2002 and 2003 where specific interrogation techniques were discussed , according to the report .
The committee also blamed former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Richard Myers for undermining the military ’s review of interrogation methods .
Known as the Wall Street Journal opinion pages ,
The treatment President Bush has received from this country is nothing less than a disgrace .
The attacks launched against him have been cruel and slanderous , proving to the world what little character and resolve we have .
The president is not to blame for all these problems .
He never lost faith in America or her people , and has tried his hardest to continue leading our nation during a very difficult time .
Our failure to stand by the one person who continued to stand by us has not gone unnoticed by our enemies .
It has shown to the world how disloyal we can be when our president needed loyalty — a shameful display of arrogance and weakness that will haunt this nation long after Mr. Bush has left the White House .
The educational value of games has been hotly debated .
Most of us accept that the likes of Sim City and Civilization are quietly didactic experiences , while " brain - training " titles explicitly sell themselves as learning toys .
But could it be that all games are about education ?
On a basic level , good game designers are more like good teachers than good movie directors .
At the GameCity festival in Nottingham , Jonathan Smith , head of production at UK publisher TT Games , spoke about how he sees games as supportive learning environments .
As the creators of the hugely successful Lego Star Wars , the team has conducted focus tests with children and gauged their reactions to new levels .
The key lesson has been that sometimes , games are too hard .
Even those for children often take the wrong approach , presenting a steep learning curve with puzzles that try to trip up the player , rather than providing an environment in which creative thinking and curiosity are rewarded .
Smith quoted from a report , Children and Their Primary Schools , published by the Primary Review , which set out to gauge children 's responses to education .
In it , children describe what makes a good teacher , saying that one " explains things clearly " , " turns teaching into problem - solving rather than just giving information " and " makes sure it 's not too big steps " .
Smith realises that every point applies to good game design as much as good teaching .
The best developers create worlds in which players are supported and treated as individuals .
Portal , Valve 's sci- fi puzzler , is a good example .
Players are seamlessly introduced to the complex physical laws of the game world through a series of lesson - like opening levels .
It 's then possible to progress through experimentation , rather than being flattened every five minutes for not doing it properly .
LittleBigPlanet , Sony 's creative platforming game , takes a similar approach .
Neither resorts to a fenced - off tutorial section , a crap invention that usually manages to patronise and bore players .
Videogaming is a child - like experience , whether you 're playing the latest Disney tie - in or Manhunt 2 .
In a new virtual environment , we 're all children , and the emotions connected with being bullied , or punished or frustrated by seemingly simple tasks are quick to surface .
Smith 's point is that this should never happen ; that all games , like schools , can teach us about our place in the world , but only by providing a supportive framework to creativity and fun .
So the next time you get hopelessly stuck in a game , remember - it 's not your fault .
You 've simply been badly taught by the designer .

THE OBAMA CHIP : Can “ Hope ” Mean the End of Copyrights ?
Written by : Moses Avalon on November 18 , 2008 .
Share with your network .
By Moses Avalon
As the left - leaning entertainment world parties like drunken sailors for the coming Obama administration they will simultaneously need to keep a close eye on the new guy ; Obama may be dismantling copyrights under the banner of “ change . ”
With the trade imbalance in the hundreds of billions can we afford to weaken Intellectual Property , ( IP ) one of the US ’s largest exports ?
Obama ’s administration will see the creation of a new job , the CTO , Chief Technology Officer .
The President Elect has created this new role to aid him in making decisions that will effect economic policy in what Obama perceives to be one of the most important industries in the US — technology .
The tech world is lit up about the new CTO czar in their corner .
Is there a danger to the music space ?
Yes .
As many of my readers know , the music ( and indeed the content world in general ) is at war with ISPs .
As Google digitizes every book in existence for free public viewing and tech - sponsored special interest groups like the EFF ( Electronic Frontier Foundation ) lobby for more relaxed copyright laws , music is gradually , day by day becoming the free toy at the bottom of the tech - world ’s cereal box .
Movies are next , as well as books , and who knows , maybe even sensitive blueprints .
What will the CTO do ?
There will be a live feed of government meetings over the net and YOU will be able to respond to new policy as they are debated .
Cool .
The CTO will make sure everything is plugged in and working correctly .
( Remember the A/V geeks from high school ? )
There will also be chips in cable boxes ( the Obama Chip , I guess we ’ll call it ) that allows parents ( as well as the Fed ) to monitor viewing habits .
The CTO will over see that .
But there ’s far more to Obama ’s tech polices that are worth knowing about if you plan , as an author on navigating the digital landscape of tomorrow .
And also worth noting is that Obama is not just looking for some ex-hippy college professor for CTO , he ’s trolling in the upper echelon of IT heaven .
He ’s already asked Google CEO Eric Schmidt , Microsoft ’s CEO Steve Ballmer and Amazon President and CEO Jeff Bezos .
They turned him down– for now .
All this would be fine if our new President had an IP specialist by his side supplying balance to ensure copyrights do n’t erode .
Right now the likely candidate for IP advisor is Law Professor , Lawrence Lessig , who has been advising the President Elect during his campaign .
For those who do not know Mr. Lessig ’s work , if you ’re a songwriter or artist now is the time to become familiar with it .
He ’s not exactly a fan of copyrights , at least not the way many artists think of them and he could , beginning in January have the ear of the new President ; a President who has put at his other side , a powerful CTO farmed from and connected to the tech elite .
If you derive your living from IP , and you ’re not worried , then you ’re not paying attention .
From Wikipedia : “ Lessig is a founding board member of Creative Commons , a board member of the Software Freedom Law Center and a former board member of the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
He is best known as a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on copyright , trademark and radio frequency spectrum , particularly in technology applications . ”
Great .
Adding to this is the fact that IP issues will , starting next January , be elevated from the subcommittee level in the House of Representatives to that of the full Judiciary Committee .
Although tech - friendly trades have spun this as a minor victory for IP , in fact all this does is raise the stakes .
Decisions made at the Congressional level are very hard to reverse and those decisions will now have a tech - bias to bolster that industry ’s already formidable lobbying efforts against music and entertainment rights holders .
LESSIG OF TWO EVILS
Whether Lessig is a copyright reformer or destroyer depends on your point of view .
Thus we enter the world “ copyrightists ” and copyleftists , ” as these terms have evolved .
“ Rightists ” like things the way they are : authors get to control completely how their copyrights work .
They own a monopoly on its distribution .
“ Leftists ” believe that the internet requires we re-examine the need and authority of copyrights ; maybe authors should n’t have absolute say , and in the extreme , no say at all .
This is not unprecedented .
In fact , the concept of ownership in a creative work is relatively new to civilization .
Troubadours in the middle ages had no ownership over the songs they authored .
Bach and Mozart also had no copyrights , yet their work survives –leftists assuage –because there were no restrictions .
One thing leftists leave out of this argument is that all the above left little to nothing to their families because there was no legal infrastructure for them to exploit and protect their work .
But , leftists feel that the common good should outweigh the individual rights of the author .
How does this manifest in the music space : leftists ( like the EFF and blobger Bob Lefsetz ) take the position that illegal P2P is fine , and that artists , labels and publishers should just grow up , chill and go with the flow .
Naturally , those that derive their living from copyrights disagree .
INFORMATION ( R) AGE
Obama ’s new policies call for a “ full and free exchange of information .
” There is little room for interpretation in his wording : a free and open net is what the next president feels is best for the Nation .
I wonder what acts of anger will be inspired if indeed , as this hints , IP is demoted to mere “ information . ”
I have a great deal of passion about wanting the Obama Nation to succeed .
Does that mean that my contribution to the new and better world of “ hope ” must be the erosion of the laws that allow my industry to prosper ?
This is tough stuff for those of us with a conscience .
Mr. President Elect , if these words somehow find your eyes , I implore you , I beg you to consider your moves in this space carefully .
Bill Clinton was the socially liberal / fiscal conservative poster - child , yet he signed into law one of the worst ( and most right - wing ) pieces of legislation in entertainment history ; one that allowed radio stations to consolidate and thus contribute to the decline of a great American tradition and industry .
He meant well , but he sold out an important principal of commerce , growth through competition , not consolidation .
It was mistake that I ’m sure he now regrets .
Please do n’t make the same one .
Entertainment and copyrights are n’t just a cool thing ; they represent about one - quarter of the US exports .
Before you make a move Mr. President , please think hard and perhaps , read this piece called the “ DRM Manifesto , ” for balance .

President Bush ’s future neighborhood , the wealthy Dallas area called Preston Hollow , has some unfortunate secrets :
Until 2000 , the neighborhood association ’s covenant said only white people were allowed to live there , though an exception was made for servants .
Enacted in 1956 , part of the original document reads : “ Said property shall be used and occupied by white persons except those shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of different race or nationality in the employ of a tenant . ”
I ’ll add this thought .
The president bought his ranch in Crawford just before running for president and will move to a swanky suburban neighborhood just after leaving office .
It ’s almost like his cowboy image was an affect cultivated for maximum political gain .
Imagine that .

Timeline of the Islamic Crusades
The Truth about Islamic Imperialism
James M. Arlandson
Historical facts say that Islam has been imperialistic and would still like to be , if only for religious reasons .
Muslim propagandists , for example , would like to impose Islamic law around the world .
Historical facts say that Islam , including Muhammad , launched their own Crusades against Christianity long before the European Crusades .
Today , Muslim polemicists and missionaries , who believe that Islam is the best religion in the world , claim that the West has stolen Islamic lands and that the West ( alone ) is imperialistic ; they seem to imply that these lands have existed in the hands of Muslims since time immemorial , perhaps all the way back to Adam and Eve .
One hardline Muslim emailer to me said about the developed West and the undeveloped Islamic countries : " You stole our lands " and then he held his finger on the exclamation key to produce a long string of them .
Thus , imperialism , a word that has reached metaphysical levels and that is supposed to stop all debates and answer all questions , explains why Islamic countries have not kept up with the West .
The emailer did not look inwardly , as if his own culture and religion may play a role .
Instead , it is always the Wests fault .
Westernerseven academics accept the notion that the West alone was aggressive .
It seems that Islam is always innocent and passive .
It is difficult to uncover the source of this western self - loathing .
It is , however , a pathology that seems to strike Westerners more than other people around the globe .
This anti-West pathology shows up in Westerners hatred for the European Crusades in the Medieval Age .
It must be admitted that there is much to dislike about the European Crusades .
If it is contrasted with the mission and ministry of Jesus and the first generations of Christians , then the Crusades do not look so good .
But did the Europeans launch the first Crusade in a mindless and bloodthirsty and irrational way , or were there more pressing reasons ?
Were they the only ones to be militant ?
The purpose of this article is not to justify or defend European Crusades , but to explain them , in part though scholarship can go a long way to defend and justify them .
In this article , the word " crusade " ( derived from the Latin word for " cross " ) in an Islamic context means a holy war or jihad .
It is used as a counterweight to the Muslim accusation that only the Europeans launched crusades .
Muslims seem to forget that they had their own , for several centuries before the Europeans launched theirs as a defense against the Islamic expansion .
This partial timeline spans up to the first European response to Islamic imperialism , when Pope Urban II launches his own Crusade in 1095 .
The timeline mostly stays within the parameters of the Greater Middle East .
The data in bold print are of special interest for revealing early Islamic atrocities , their belief in heroism in warfare , or politics today .
The Islamic Crusades were very successful .
The Byzantines and Persian Empires had worn themselves out with fighting , so they created a power vacuum .
Into this vacuum stormed Islam .
After the timeline , two questions are posed , which are answered at length .
The Timeline
630 Two years before Muhammads death of a fever , he launches the Tabuk Crusades , in which he led 30,000 jihadists against the Byzantine Christians .
He had heard a report that a huge army had amassed to attack Arabia , but the report turned out to be a false rumor .
The Byzantine army never materialized .
He turned around and went home , but not before extracting " agreements " from northern tribes .
They could enjoy the " privilege " of living under Islamic " protection " ( read : not be attacked by Islam ) , if they paid a tax .
This tax sets the stage for Muhammads and the later Caliphs policies .
If the attacked city or region did not want to convert to Islam , then they paid a jizya tax .
If they converted , then they paid a zakat tax .
Either way , money flowed back to the Islamic treasury in Arabia or to the local Muslim governor .
632-634 Under the Caliphate of Abu Bakr the Muslim Crusaders reconquer and sometimes conquer for the first time the polytheists of Arabia .
These Arab polytheists had to convert to Islam or die .
They did not have the choice of remaining in their faith and paying a tax .
Islam does not allow for religious freedom .
633 The Muslim Crusaders , led by Khalid al - Walid , a superior but bloodthirsty military commander , whom Muhammad nicknamed the Sword of Allah for his ferocity in battle ( Tabari , 8:158 / 1616 - 17 ) , conquer the city of Ullays along the Euphrates River ( in todays Iraq ) .
Khalid captures and beheads so many that a nearby canal , into which the blood flowed , was called Blood Canal ( Tabari 11:24 / 2034-35 ) .
634 At the Battle of Yarmuk in Syria the Muslim Crusaders defeat the Byzantines .
Today Osama bin Laden draws inspiration from the defeat , and especially from an anecdote about Khalid al - Walid .
In Khalids day an unnamed Muslim remarks : " The Romans are so numerous and the Muslims so few . "
To this Khalid retorts : " How few are the Romans , and how many the Muslims !
Armies become numerous only with victory and few only with defeat , not by the number of men .
By God , I would love it . . . if the enemy were twice as many " ( Tabari , 11:94 / 2095 ) .
Osama bin Laden quotes Khalid and says that his fighters love death more than we in the West love life .
This philosophy of death probably comes from a verse like Sura 2:96 .
Muhammad assesses the Jews : " [ Prophet ] , you are sure to find them [ the Jews ] clinging to life more eagerly than any other people , even polytheists " ( MAS Abdel Haleem , The Quran , Oxford UP , 2004 ; first insertion in brackets is Haleems ; the second mine ) .
634-644 The Caliphate of Umar ibn al - Khattab , who is regarded as particularly brutal .
635 Muslim Crusaders besiege and conquer of Damascus .
636 Muslim Crusaders defeat Byzantines decisively at Battle of Yarmuk .
637 Muslim Crusaders conquer Iraq at the Battle of al - Qadisiyyah ( some date it in 635 or 636 ) .
638 Muslim Crusaders conquer and annex Jerusalem , taking it from the Byzantines .
638-650 Muslim Crusaders conquer Iran , except along Caspian Sea .
639-642 Muslim Crusaders conquer Egypt .
641 Muslim Crusaders control Syria and Palestine .
643-707 Muslim Crusaders conquer North Africa .
644 Caliph Umar is assassinated by a Persian prisoner of war ; Uthman ibn Affan is elected third Caliph , who is regarded by many Muslims as gentler than Umar .
644-650 Muslim Crusaders conquer Cyprus , Tripoli in North Africa , and establish Islamic rule in Iran , Afghanistan , and Sind .
656 Caliph Uthman is assassinated by disgruntled Muslim soldiers ; Ali ibn Abi Talib , son - in - law and cousin to Muhammad , who married the prophets daughter Fatima through his first wife Khadija , is set up as Caliph .
656 Battle of the Camel , in which Aisha , Muhammads wife , leads a rebellion against Ali for not avenging Uthmans assassination .
Alis partisans win .
657 Battle of Siffin between Ali and Muslim governor of Jerusalem , arbitration goes against Ali
661 Murder of Ali by an extremist ; Alis supporters acclaim his son Hasan as next Caliph , but he comes to an agreement with Muawiyyah I and retires to Medina .
661-680 the Caliphate of Muawiyyah I .
He founds Umayyid dynasty and moves capital from Medina to Damascus
673-678 Arabs besiege Constantinople , capital of Byzantine Empire
680 Massacre of Hussein ( Muhammads grandson ) , his family , and his supporters in Karbala , Iraq .
691 Dome of the Rock is completed in Jerusalem , only six decades after Muhammads death .
705 Abd al - Malik restores Umayyad rule .
710 -713 Muslim Crusaders conquer the lower Indus Valley .
711-713 Muslim Crusaders conquer Spain and impose the kingdom of Andalus .
This article recounts how Muslims today still grieve over their expulsion 700 years later .
They seem to believe that the land belonged to them in the first place .
719 Cordova , Spain , becomes seat of Arab governorship .
732 The Muslim Crusaders are stopped at the Battle of Poitiers ; that is , Franks ( France ) halt Arab advance .
749 The Abbasids conquer Kufah and overthrow Umayyids .
756 Foundation of Umayyid emirate in Cordova , Spain , setting up an independent kingdom from Abbasids .

I asks western Christendom for help against Seljuk invasions of his territory ; Seljuks are Muslim Turkish family of eastern origins ; see 970 .
1095 Pope Urban II preaches first Crusade ; they capture Jerusalem in 1099
So it is only after all of the Islamic aggressive invasions that western Christendom launches its first Crusades .
It could be argued that sometimes the Byzantine and western European leaders did not behave exemplarily , so a timeline on that subject could be developed .
And sometimes the Muslims behaved exemplarily .
Both are true .
However , the goal of this timeline is to balance out the picture more clearly .
Many people regard Islam as an innocent victim , and the Byzantines and Europeans as bullies .
This hardly reflects historical reality as the multitude of aggressive Muslim military campaigns listed above show .
Moreover , we should take a step back and look at the big picture .
If Islam had stayed in Arabia and had not waged wars of conquest , then no troubles would have erupted .
But the truth is this : Islam moved aggressively during the Caliphates of Abu Bakr and Umar in the seventh century , with other Caliphs continuing well beyond that ; only then did the western Europeans react substantively ( see 1094 ) .
Finally , it must be noted that Islamic expansion continues until well into the seventeenth century .
For example , the Muslims Crusaders conquer Constantinople in 1453 and unsuccessfully besiege Vienna for the second time in 1683 ( earlier in 1529 ) .
By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , the Islamic Crusades receded , due to western resistance .
Since that time until the present , Islamic civilization has not advanced very far .
Two questions are posed and then answered at length .
Besides following Muhammad , why else did the Muslims launch their Crusades out of Arabia in the first place ?
It is only natural to ask why Islam launched its own Crusades long before Christendom did .
In the complicated Muslim Crusades that lasted several centuries before the European Crusades , it is difficult to come up with a grand single theory as to what launched these Crusades .
Because of this difficulty , we let three scholars and two eyewitness participants analyze the motives of the early Islamic Crusades .
1. World religious conquest
Muslim polemicists like Sayyid Qutb assert that Islams mission is to correct the injustices of the world .
What he has in mind is that if Islam does not control a society , then injustice dominates it , ipso facto .
But if Islam dominates it , then justice rules it ( In the Shade of the Quran , vol. 7 , pp. 8 -15 ) .
Islam is expansionist and must conquer the whole world to express Allahs perfect will on this planet , so Qutb and millions of other Muslims believe .
For more information on Islamic world domination in the Quran , see this article .
2. " Unruly " energies in Arabia ?
Karen Armstrong , a former nun and well - spoken , prolific author and apologist for Islam , comes up short of a satisfactory justification for the Muslim Crusades :
Once [ Abu Bakr ] crushed the rebellion [ against Islamic rule within Arabia ] , Abu Bakr may well have decided to alleviate internal tensions by employing the unruly energies within the ummah [ Muslim community ] against external foes .
Whatever the case , in 633 Muslim armies began a new series of campaigns in Persia , Syria and Iraq .
( Jerusalem : One City , Three Faiths , New York : Ballantine , 1997 , p. 226 ) .
Armstrong also notes that the " external foes " to Islam in Arabia in 633 are the Persians and the Byzantines , but they are too exhausted after years of fighting each other to pose a serious threat to Islam .
Therefore , it moved into a " power vacuum , " unprovoked ( Armstrong , p. 227 ) .
She simply does not know with certainty why Muslims marched northward out of Arabia .
3. Religion , economy , and political control
Fred M. Donner , the dean of historians specializing in the early Islamic conquests , cites three large factors for the Islamic Crusades .
First , the ideological message of Islam itself triggered the Muslim ruling elite simply to follow Muhammad and his conquests ; Islam had a divinely ordained mission to conquer in the name of Allah .
( The Early Islamic Conquests , Princeton UP , 1981 , p. 270 ) .
The second factor is economic .
The ruling elite " wanted to expand the political boundaries of the new state in order to secure even more fully than before the trans - Arab commerce they had plied for a century or more " ( p. 270 ) .
The final factor is political control .
The rulers wanted to maintain their top place in the new political hierarchy by having aggressive Arab tribes migrate into newly conquered territories ( p. 271 ) .
This notion of " aggressive Arab tribes " supports Armstrongs observation ( no. 1 , above ) .
Thus , these reasons have nothing to do with just wars of self - defense .
Early Islam was merely being aggressive without sufficient provocation from the surrounding Byzantine and Persian Empires .
4 . Sheer thrill of conquest and martyrdom
Khalid al - Walid ( d. 642 ) , a bloodthirsty but superior commander of the Muslim armies at the time , also answers the question as to why the Muslims stormed out of Arabia , in his terms of surrender set down to the governor of al - Hirah , a city along the Euphrates River in Iraq .
He is sent to call people to Islam or pay a " protection " tax for the " privilege " of living under Islamic rule ( read : not to be attacked again ) as dhimmis or second - class citizens .
Says Khalid :
" I call you to God and to Islam .
If you respond to the call , you are Muslims :
You obtain the benefits they enjoy and take up the responsibilities they bear .
If you refuse , then [ you must pay ] the jizyah .
If you refuse the jizyah , I will bring against you tribes of people who are more eager for death than you are for life .
We will fight you until God decides between us and you . "
( Tabari , The Challenge to the Empires , trans .
Khalid Yahya Blankinship , NY : SUNYP , 1993 , vol. 11 , p. 4 ; Arabic page 2017 )
Thus , according to Khalid , religion is early Islams primary motive ( though not the only one ) of conquering people .
In a short sermon , Abu Bakr says :
. . .
Indeed , the reward in Gods book for jihad in Gods path is something for which a Muslim should love to be singled out , by which God saved [ people ] from humiliation , and through which He has bestowed nobility in this world and the next .
( Tabari 11:80 / 2083 - 84 )
Thus , the Caliph repeats the Qurans trade of this life for the next , in an economic bargain and in the context of jihad ( cf. Suras 4:74 ; 9:111 and 61:10 - 13 ) .
This offer of martyrdom , agreeing with Donners first factor , religious motivation , is enough to get young Muslims to sign up for and to launch their Crusades out of Arabia in the seventh century .
Khalid also says that if some do not convert or pay the tax , then they must fight an army that loves death as other people love life ( see 634 ) .
5 . Improvement of life over that in Arabia
But improvement of life materially must be included in this not - so - holy call .
When Khalid perceived that his Muslim Crusaders desired to return to Arabia , he pointed out how luscious the land of the Persians was :
" Do you not regard [ your ] food like a dusty gulch ?
By God , if struggle for Gods sake and calling [ people ] to God were not required of us , and there were no consideration except our livelihood , the wise opinion would [ still ] have been to strike this countryside until we possess it " .
. . . ( Tabari 11:20 / 2031 )
Khalid was from Mecca .
At the time of this " motivational " speech , the Empire of Persia included Iraq , and this is where Khalid is warring .
Besides his religious goal of Islamizing its inhabitants by warfare , Khalids goal is to " possess " the land .
Like Pope Urban II in 1095 exhorting the Medieval Crusaders to war against the Muslim " infidels " for the first time , in response to Muslim aggression that had been going on for centuries .
Abu
Bakr gives his own speech in 634 , exhorting Muslims to war against the " infidels , " though he is not as long - winded as the Pope .
Muslim polemicists believe that Islam spread militarily by a miracle from Allah .
However , these five earth - bound reasons explain things more clearly .
Did the Islamic Crusades force conversions by the sword ?
Historical facts demonstrate that most of the conquered cities and regions accepted the last of three options that were enforced by the later Muslim Crusaders : ( 1 ) fight and die , ( 2 ) convert and pay the zakat tax ; ( 3 ) keep their Biblical faith and pay the jizya tax .
Most preferred to remain in their own religion .
However , people eventually converted .
After all , Islamic lands are called such for a reasonor many reasons .
Why ?
Four Muslim polemicists whitewash the reasons people converted , so their scholarship is suspect .
1 . The polemical answer
First , Malise Ruthven and Azim Nanji use the Quran to explain later historical facts : " Islam expanded by conquest and conversion .
Although it was sometimes said that the faith of Islam was spread by the sword , the two are not the same .
The Koran states unequivocally ,  There is no compulsion in religion  ( Sura 2:256 ) . "
( Historical Atlas of Islam , Cambridge , Mass : Harvard , 2004 , 30 ) .
According to them , the Quran says there should be no compulsion , so the historical facts conform to a sacred text .
This shaky reasoning is analyzed , below , under " historical facts . "
Next , David Dakake also references Sura 2:256 , and defines compulsion very narrowly .
Jihad has been misrepresented as forcing Jews , Christians , and other peoples of the Middle East , Asia and Africa to convert to Islam " on pain of death . "
( " The Myth of Militant Islam , " Islam , Fundamentalism , and the Betrayal of Tradition , ed. J.E.B. Lumbard , Bloomington : World Wisdom , 2004 , p. 13 ) .
This is too narrow a definition of compulsion , as we shall see , below under " historical facts . "
Finally , Qutb , also citing Sura 2:256 , is even more categorical : " Never in its history did Islam compel a single human being to change his faith " ( In the Shade of the Quran , vol. 8 , p. 307 ) .
This is absurd on its face , and it only demonstrates the tendentiousness of Islamic scholarship , which must be challenged at every turn here in the West .
It is a sad fact that this sort of " reasoning " and " critical thinking " permeates polemical Muslim " scholarship . "
For more information and thorough logic , see this article .
2 . The historical facts
But history does not follow Scriptures because people do not .
Did the vast majority of conquered peoples make such fine distinctions , even if a general amnesty were granted to People of the Book ?
Maybe a few diehards did , but the majority ?
Most people at this time did not know how to read or could barely read , so when they saw a Muslim army outside their gates , why would they not convert , even if eventually ?
To Ruthvens and Nanjis credit , they come up with other reasons to convert besides the sword , such as peoples fatigue with church squabbles , a few doctrinal similarities , simplicity of the conversion process , a desire to enter the ranks of the new ruling elite , and so on .
But using the Quran to interpret later facts paints the history of Islam into a corner of an unrealistically high standard .
This misguided connection between Scripture and later historical facts does not hold together .
Revelations or ideals should not run roughshod over later historical facts , as if all followers obey their Scriptures perfectly .
To his credit , Ibn Khaldun ( 1332-1406 ) , late Medieval statesman , jurist , historian , and scholar , has enough integrity and candor to balance out these four Muslim apologists , writing a history that is still admired by historians today .
He states the obvious :
In the Muslim community , the holy war is a religious duty , because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and ( the obligation to ) convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force .
( The Muqaddimah : an Introduction to History ( abridged ) , trans .
Franz Rosenthal , Princeton UP , 1967 , p.183 )
When the Islamic Crusaders go out to conquer , carrying an Islamic banner inscribed in Arabic of the glory and the truth of their prophet , Ibn Khaldun would not deny that the armys mission , besides the material reasons of conquest , is to convert the inhabitants .
Islam is a " universalizing " religion , and if its converts enter its fold either by persuasion or force , then that is the nature of Islam .
Moreover , Ibn Khaldun explains why a dynasty rarely establishes itself firmly in lands of many different tribes and groups .
But it can be done after a long time and employing the following tactics , as seen in the Maghrib ( N and NW Africa ) from the beginning of Islam to Ibn Khalduns own time :
The first ( Muslim ) victory over them and the European Christians ( in the Maghrib ) was of no avail .
They continued to rebel and apostatized time after time .
The Muslims massacred many of them .
After the Muslim religion had been established among them , they went on revolting and seceding , and they adopted dissident religious opinions many times .
They remained disobedient and unmanageable . . . .
Therefore , it has taken the Arabs a long time to establish their dynasty in the . . .
Maghrib . ( p. 131 )
Conclusion
Though European Crusaders may have been sincere , they wandered off from the origins of Christianity when they slashed and burned and forced conversions .
Jesus never used violence ; neither did he call his disciples to use it .
Given this historical fact , it is only natural that the New Testament would never endorse violence to spread the word of the true God.
Textual reality matches historical reality .
In contrast , Muslims who slashed and burned and forced conversions did not wander off from the origins of Islam , but followed it closely .
It is a plain and unpleasant historical fact that in the ten years that Muhammad lived in Medina ( 622-632 ) , he either sent out or went out on seventy - four raids , expeditions , or full - scale wars , which range from small assassination hit squads to the Tabuk Crusade , described above ( see 630 ) .
Sometimes the expeditions did not result in violence , but a Muslim army always lurked in the background .
Later on , Muhammad could exact a terrible vengeance on an individual or tribe that double - crossed him .
These ten years did not know long stretches of peace .
Therefore , it is only natural that the Quran would be filled with references to jihad and qital , the latter word meaning only fighting , killing , warring , and slaughtering .
Textual reality matches historical reality .
But this means that the Church had to fight back or be swallowed up by an aggressive religion over the centuries .
Thus , the Church did not go out and conquer in a mindless , bloodthirsty , and irrational way though the Christian Crusades were far from perfect .
Islam was the aggressor in its own Crusades , long before the Europeans responded with their own .

Determination of oxidized lysophospholipids in extracellular vesicles as promotors of sterile inflammation in arthritis and other inflammatory diseases
Prepare yourself for a sight tonight — not to mention some wild behavior , if the legends are true .
The biggest full moon in 15 years is set to grace the Northern Hemisphere tonight .
Because the moon orbits along an egg - shaped ellipse , not a circle , its distance from us changes .
Today , the moon is approaching its nearest point to Earth , so it should look about 14 percent bigger and 30 percent brighter than this year 's other full moons , according to NASA .
Since the moon takes about 28 days to orbit Earth , it reaches its point of closest approach , called perigee , about once a month .
But since the moon 's orbit is n't a perfect oval — rather , it wobbles — some perigees are closer than others .
Tomorrow 's approach will be the closest the moon has come to Earth since 1993 .
On top of that , tonight 's moon will become full just four hours after perigee .
The next time these two events will coincide will be in 2016 .
The full moon is n't the only boost we get from this special alignment :
Tides should be especially big , too .
Lunar gravity at perigee pulls tide waters about an inch higher than usual .

The Incredible Shrinking Woman
A family member recently told me that when she gets into her car after working eight hours as a software engineer she finds herself lowering the rear view mirror as if she had somehow become shorter over the course of the day .
I was delighted to hear such a graphic demonstration of the effect sitting at a computer can have on one ’s posture , and it made me want to know more about how such a thing could happen .
Motion is the Potion
Working diligently for hours on end with eyes focused intently on the screen , seated computer users are largely unaware of the forces acting upon their body , that is , until they stand up .
At that point , the body gets its message through to the brain with stiff , achy muscles , creaky joints , limited neck and lower back mobility , sore eyes , jaws and shoulders .
It ’s a two - fold problem : even though you may start out in a neutral posture , your body gradually drifts out of it until you realize you ’ve “ locked ” into a position far from where you started .
Holding your body in one place , even if it is the least straining , neutral posture , is detrimental .
The obvious remedy to static posture is to move on a regular basis ; getting your brain to pay attention to the rest of your body when it ’s so absorbed in visual activity with the computer screen is the greater challenge .
The Eyes Lead the Body
According to Dr. Jeffery Anshel , an expert in the field of visual ergonomics , “ Nature has designed our visual system to be so dominant that we will alter our body posture to accommodate any deficiency in the way we see .
In many office situations the vision of a worker is compromised and they must adapt their posture to ease the strain on the visual system . ”
Breathe – Blink – Break
Based on the logic that the body follows the eyes , Dr. Anshel suggests that protecting the body from the hazards of computer use should begin with protection of the eyes .
Toward that end , he recommends an approach called the “ 3 Bs ” : Blink more often , take frequent deep Breaths and take a short Break every hour .
Introducing these simple activities into your work routine requires nothing more than a commitment from you to yourself .

Trump Privately Mocked the Christian Voters He Needs in 2020
The president reportedly does n’t think much of the devout , even as white evangelicals helped put him over the top in 2016 .
He does , however , respect the religious “ scam . ”
In a stunning verdict that imperils the tenure of the Senate ’s longest - serving Republican , a federal jury Monday found Sen .
Ted Stevens of Alaska guilty of concealing tens of thousands of dollars in gifts and improvements to his home .
Stevens , 84 , reacted pugnaciously , attacking the Justice Department and vowing to continue campaigning for reelection to his seventh term next Tuesday .
“ I am obviously disappointed in the verdict but not surprised given the repeated instances of prosecutorial misconduct in this case , ” he said in a prepared statement .
“ I will fight this unjust verdict with every ounce of energy I have . ”
He asked Alaskans and his Senate colleagues to “ stand with me as I pursue my rights . ”
Stevens has managed to remain neck and neck with Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich since the trial began , despite being unable to campaign in person .
But political analysts have said from the beginning that all bets would be off were Stevens to be convicted .

The conviction boosts Democrats ’ hopes of reaching a filibuster - proof majority in the Senate .
Democrats control the Senate 51 to 49 with the help of two independents but need 60 seats to overcome Republican - led filibusters that have stymied Democratic initiatives .
Senate rules do not bar convicted felons from serving , and it would take a two - thirds vote to expel Stevens if he were reelected .
The chamber has not expelled anyone in more than a century .
If Stevens is forced to step down , a special election would be held to determine his replacement .
Some Republicans already appeared to discount the chances that he would be returning to Washington .
“ Ted Stevens served his constituents for over 40 years , and I am disappointed to see his career end in disgrace , ” said Sen. John Ensign of Nevada , who heads the Senate Republicans ’ campaign committee .
“ Sen . Stevens had his day in court and the jury found he violated the public ’s trust -- as a result he is properly being held accountable .
This is a reminder that no one is above the law . ”

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee , also appeared to distance herself from her home - state lawmaker , using the conviction as an opportunity to trumpet her own anti-corruption credentials .
Palin , who has clashed with Washington ’s Republican congressional delegation in the past , said in a statement that the verdict “ shines a light on the corrupting influence of the big oil service company that was allowed to control too much of our state .
It was part of the culture of corruption that I was elected to fight .
And that fight must always move forward , regardless of party or seniority or even past service . ”
Palin concluded : “ I ’m confident Sen .
Stevens will do what ’s right for the people of Alaska . ”
The verdict was a swift and devastating fall from grace for Stevens , one of the most powerful men in Washington , who once stood third in line to the presidency .

The four - week trial shone a light on Stevens ’ relationship with a millionaire oilman , Bill J. Allen , who once owned the state ’s onetime largest private employer and who with others plied Stevens with more than $ 250,000 in gifts and improvements to his Alaska home .
Allen , who pleaded guilty to federal bribery charges last year , was the star witness for the prosecution against Stevens .
Stevens took the stand in his own defense in an attempt to rebut the charges .
He took the position that he did not consider the things he got from Allen , including a high - end gas barbecue grill and an elaborate outdoor lighting display , to be gifts , but rather unwanted indulgences .
As for the home improvement bills , he said that his wife was in charge of that and that she paid every bill she ever received .
But he came across as sour and argumentative on cross-examination , and the verdict indicates the jury did not find him to be a credible witness .
“ The last piece of proof that the jurors were left with was a pretty withering cross-examination of Sen .
Stevens by the government , ” said Joshua Berman , a Washington lawyer who once worked in the Justice Department public integrity unit that prosecuted Stevens .
The jury also heard telephone conversations , secretly recorded by the FBI , including one in which Stevens openly discussed the possibility that he and Allen “ might have to serve a little time in jail . ”

Stevens was convicted on seven counts of making false statements under federal law by failing to disclose the gifts and improvements on his annual Senate financial disclosure form .
Each count carries a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison , although he is not expected to get anywhere near that term .
Some experts said there was a chance he could get probation , given his age , years of public service and other factors .
He remains free until sentencing , which is expected to occur early next year .
The verdict was reached the same day that a reconstituted jury began deliberations anew after one of the 12 panelists was replaced over the weekend because of a family emergency .

Stevens sought “ to hide from the public , from his constituents , that he received hundreds of thousands of dollars in freebies , ” Matthew Friedrich , acting head of the Justice Department criminal division , said on the courthouse steps after the verdict .
He said an investigation into political corruption in Alaska was continuing ; among those still believed to be under investigation are Stevens ’ son , Ben , a former Alaska lawmaker .
The prosecutors in the case also face an internal Justice Department investigation after being sanctioned by U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan for withholding documents from the defense .
Stevens indicated in his statement Monday that prosecutorial misconduct would be part of his appeal .
Democratic Party leaders in the state immediately called on the veteran senator to resign .
“ He knew what he was doing was wrong , but he did it anyway and lied to Alaskans about it , ” Alaska party chairwoman Patti Higgins said in a statement .
Advertisement
Party leaders also said any decision by Stevens to appeal the verdict could “ put himself and Alaska under a cloud of uncertainty for another 18 months , ” while the state ’s needs “ will go unmet in Washington . ”
State Republican Party officials said they would urge Stevens to stay the course and attempt to win reelection .
“ The majority of Alaskans are conservative , they have strong family values and very strong faith in their convictions , ” said Alaska GOP spokesman McHugh Pierre , “ and if those voters want a like - minded person representing them in the U.S. Senate , they need to vote for Sen.
Ted Stevens . ”

Times staff writers Kim Murphy contributed from Seattle and Richard Simon from Washington .
President - elect Barack Obama will soon be one of the most heavily guarded men in the world , if he is not already .
For the next four years and beyond , Obama will be followed everywhere he goes by the secret service , a crack team of security agents known for their large physiques , stony countenances , dark suits and radio earpieces .
As the first African American to be elected president , Obama is likely to face unprecedented threats on his life .
Indeed , police and federal officials have already broken up at least two assassination plots , although it is unclear how serious either was .
The secret service began guarding Obama in May 2007 , the earliest ever in an election season .
" Changes in the administration certainly necessitate a large operational planning and implementation in terms of our protective mission , " said secret service spokesman Ed Donovan , who declined to give any more detail about the security regime .
In an indication of the level of protection Obama can expect , the stage on which he gave his victory speech in Chicago last night was shielded by a canopy of bullet - proof glass .
" Presidents have full - time protection 24 - 7 , everywhere they go , " Donovan said .
" Everything they do is advanced by secret personnel , throughout the world . "
Secret service agents will also guard Obama 's family , as well as vice - president - elect Joe Biden and his family .
Some presidents have found the 24 - hour security cocoon suffocating and the agency 's safety demands stifling .
Obama recently remarked that he dreams about driving a car , something he has not done in more than a year .
Upon taking office in 1977 , Jimmy Carter was unhappy to see security officials hovering about the White House everywhere he went , opening doors for him as he approached .
He told them to keep their distance so he could have some solitude .
The secret service made Bill Clinton stop his regular morning jogs , fearing an assassination attempt , and in his memoirs , Clinton writes of his frustration at having to accommodate the secret service 's concerns in other matters such as international travel .
But President Lyndon Johnson is reported to have found co-conspirators among his secret service detail .
According to journalist Ronald Kessler 's 1995 expose of the executive mansion 's inner workings , Inside the White House , the secret service installed a buzzer to warn Johnson when his wife Lady Bird was approaching the Oval Office , lest he be caught in a tryst with one of the comely secretaries he hired .

Conservative councillor Maria Gatland resigned as a cabinet member on Croydon Council after being exposed as the author of a " kiss and tell " book about the provisionals .
The book described how , among other tasks , she acted as an interpreter for the movement on an arms - buying trip to Europe .
The council appears to have been unaware of her past because the book was published in 1973 under her maiden name , Maria McGuire .
A spokeswoman for Croydon Council said today : " The council has been advised that Maria Gatland has resigned as cabinet member for children , young people and learners .
" This follows emerging news of her connection to the Provisional IRA - which has come as a complete shock to Croydon .
" Officers understand she has been urged to resign from the council .
It is also understood that urgent steps are being taken to replace her as cabinet member . "
Ms Gatland 's book - To Take Arms : My Year With The IRA Provisional - was described in a review in Time magazine in 1973 as a " kiss and tell story " about her relationships with the movement .
It was written after she became disillusioned with the provisionals , and fled to England .
The turning point was apparently when 20 bombs were detonated in Belfast on 21 July , 1972 , killing 11 people and injuring more than a hundred .
" Almost for the first time , I wondered about the crippled and the widowed and the lives that had been changed forever , " she wrote .

She is believed to have been sentenced to death by the IRA as a result .
Ms Gatland 's activities when in her 20s only emerged after cryptic clues in a public meeting yesterday .
The Croydon Advertiser reported that Peter Latham , a leader of the local Save Our Schools campaign , referred to her as " Councillor McGuire " .
Apologising and suggesting he was a bit mixed - up , Dr Latham added that he was a devotee of Irish history and had been reading a book about the IRA which " you , Councillor Gatland , might have heard about as you are Irish " .
According to the newspaper , Ms Gatland has been suspended by the local authority 's ruling Conservative group pending an investigation .
" I have resigned .
I am not prepared to say anything more at this stage , " she told the Advertiser .
The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has concluded that it has no objection to rebiana , ( Reb A ) at 95 percent purity or above , having GRAS ( generally recognized as safe ) status as a general purpose sweetener for food and drink , not just as a supplement .
Two applicants , Merisant Company and Cargill , had notified the FDA that natural , zero calorie sweetener rebiana should have FDA GRAS and submitted evidence to show that it is safe for use in the food supply .
They both confirmed they have received official notification of no objection from the FDA .
And within hours Coca - Cola and PepsiCo announced that their first drinks sweetened with Reb A will be hitting US shop shelves shortly .
Coca -Cola partnered with Cargill to develop their rebiana brand called Truvia , and PepsiCo , along with Whole Earth Sweetener Company ( a subsidiary of Merisant Company ) and PureCircle , have their own product under the PureVia brand .
Marcelo Montero , president , Cargill Health & Nutrition , said : “ Given the extensive research conducted to assure the safety of Truvia rebiana , Cargill has tremendous confidence in the product . ​
“ The FDA letter further validates what the science has concluded - that Truvia rebiana is safe for use for all consumers . ” ​
The Malaysian company PureCircle , which boasts of being the world ’s largest supplier of high - purity Reb A , also supplies Cargill with the ingredient .
Surging demand ​
The US is a key market for the natural , zero calorie sweeteners which can be used as a complement to sugar or a substitute for synthetic sweeteners .
Peter Milsted , PureCircle sales and marketing director , told FoodNavigator that receiving no objection from the FDA means that stevia will now move into the mainstream in the US and product launches by PepsiCo and Coca - Cola will signal to other companies to follow suit .
He said : “ I think we will see an incredible increase in momentum . ​
“ It now opens the door for Reb A to be used right across the food spectrum . ​
“ Initially what we will see in the market place is beverages .
But we have seen interest for food products .​
“ Other manufacturers now will feel sufficiently confident to go ahead and incorporate it in their own product development . ” ​
He added that companies had been experimenting with applications for dairy , bakery and confectionery products , including boiled sweets and chewing gum .
Milsted stressed it was important for PureCircle that FDA GRAS was for 95 percent purity because “ it separates it completely from stevia extract , which does n’t have that kind of purity level as Reb A ” . ​
Product launches ​
Coca -Cola North America said Sprite Green and Odwalla juice drinks , due to go on sale this month , would be the first of what it expects to be many US products sweetened with Truvia .
PepsiCo said its first US PureVia sweetened products would SoBe Lifewater in three different flavors , due to hit stores “ shortly ” . ​
Elizabeth Wynne Johnson , a senior correspondent with Capitol News Connection public radio was out at Reagan National Airport to interview Rep.-elect Jason Chaffetz ( R - Utah ) as he carries his cot for his new living space , his congressional office .

New member comes packing a cot
More than 50 soon - to - be members of Congress arrived on Capitol Hill this week with plans for changing America .
Jason Chaffetz came with a cot wrapped in duct tape and a plan for washing his underwear .

Elected two weeks ago to represent Utah ’s 3rd Congressional District , Chaffetz intends to serve how he lives and how he campaigned : frugally .
So rather than renting an apartment in Washington , he ’ll join the ranks of members who sleep in their offices at night and shower each morning in the House gym .
He will take his suits to the House dry cleaner and will bundle together his “ socks and undies ” to take home every weekend to be washed .
“ My wife is just worried that it is going to stink , ” he said .
“ She said , ‘ Jason , get good air circulation . ’ ”
Chaffetz says he ’s always lived a pay - go lifestyle — his only debts have been a house and a car — and that he ’d like to see Washington start doing the same .
“ This is a town where a billion dollars tends to be a rounding error , ” he said .
“ We have to stop running this country on a credit card . ”
Chaffetz ( his website says it ’s pronounced “ Chay - fits ” ) decided to sleep where he works after learning that several current members do the same .
No one knows how many members have their offices do double duty as residences .
Neither the Committee on House Administration nor the Office of the House Chief Administrative Officer keeps a list .
Nor does the sergeant - at - arms ’ office , which might be interested in knowing which offices contained sleeping members if there were an emergency on the Hill .
Outgoing Rep. Tim Walberg ( R - Mich . ) told the Gannett News Service in 2007 that , based on what he saw in the health club each morning , as many as 40 other congressmen sleep in their offices .
Members and their office staffers are n’t so keen on giving out names , and no offices would confess to knowing who or how many are asleep near their desks .
Fred Beuttler , the deputy historian of the House , said that , in the 1980s , Democratic leaders advised members to move their families to Washington with them .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia advised Republicans to do the opposite to minimize their footprint in favor of more time spent in their districts .
Kevin Smith , a spokesman for House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , said the only advice Republican leaders give new members about their families today is “ to work hard to make them a priority . ”
A number of Republican members are known to sleep in their offices .
Among them : Reps. Jeff Flake of Arizona , Pete Hoekstra of Michigan , Denny Rehberg of Montana , Lee Terry of Nebraska and John Sullivan of Oklahoma .
After decamping from a room in a nearby town house , Sullivan sleeps on a mattress in his office .
Terry recently graduated from a succession of air mattresses to a rollaway bed , an aide said .
Rep. Jack Kingston ( R - Ga. ) used to sleep in his office .
But spokesman Chris Crawford said Kingston eventually moved out for the benefit of staffers who got tired of finding containers of ramen noodles around .
For all the majesty of the Capitol , there ’s nothing particularly glamorous about living in a House office building .
Still , Chaffetz may be taking the low - rent approach to a new extreme .
Before flying into Washington on Sunday , Chaffetz went to a local grocery store in Utah to buy his new bed .
His wife was out watching the new James Bond movie with girlfriends , so Chaffetz took his 7 - year - old daughter , who was apparently mortified as he unfolded and tested cots in the aisle of the store .
Satisfied with what he saw , Chaffetz paid $ 44.89 for his new bed - away - from - home , then wrapped it in a garbage bag and duct tape for the trip east .
At Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport , the Marine escort assigned to meet Chaffetz watched as he picked up the cot from baggage claim — and then the driver of the luxury sedan sent to shuttle Chaffetz to Capitol Hill spent 10 minutes trying to stow the unwieldy package in the trunk .
The cot and its owner are currently ensconced — along with the rest of the members - elect and their families and belongings — at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill .
Chaffetz does n’t know exactly where he ’ll be laying his head long - term just yet ; incoming members wo n’t be assigned their offices until Friday .
But he ’s looking at the bright side while he waits .
House office buildings have “ great security , ” he said .
“ When they give me a terrible office up on the seventh floor , I ’ll chalk it up as the penthouse , and I wo n’t have noisy neighbors above me . ”
Amassing over a million downloads in under seven days , ' The Dark Knight ' is by far the most pirated movie of this week .
Earlier this year , Cam and DVD - screener versions of the latest in the Batman series already found their way onto the Internet , making this blockbuster the most pirated movie of 2008 .
The Dark Knight has been a huge success in theaters , grossing a billion dollars worldwide .
The movie currently holds the record for the best opening week , and weekend , and later this year is expected to surpass ‘ Titanic ’ as the greatest grossing movie in history .
This success is a truly remarkable accomplishment in times where piracy is rampant .
As with every other blockbuster , ‘ The Dark Knight ’ was leaked onto the Internet in various formats .
It began right after the premiere in July with a cammed version , which was celebrated by the folks from The Pirate Bay .
The Cam was followed by a DVD - screener in early September .
Although Hollywood did its best to prevent the movie from hitting BitTorrent , their efforts were not very successful .
In July , just a few days after the film premiered , the police arrested a 40 - year - old man who tried to record the movie with a camcorder .
However , around the same time someone else had already put up a cammed version from another source .
This week , in another round of leaks , DVD - rips of ‘ The Dark Knight ’ found their way to BitTorrent .
Unsurprisingly , given the commercial success of the movie , these were downloaded well over a million times in just a few days .
From the looks of it , Batman will crush Iron Man , The Incredible Hulk and Transformers , as it will easily become this year ’s most pirated movie .
First things first though .
Below is this week ’s list of most pirated movies on BitTorrent .
The data is collected by TorrentFreak , and is for informational and educational reference only .
Currently both DVDrips , DVD Screeners and R5 rips are counted .
Miss Runway , Miss Cockpit and Miss Hostess Critics Accuse Ryanair of Sexism for Charity Calendar
Thirteen flight attendents at a European budget airline have stripped off their uniforms for the company 's annual charity calendar , but feminist groups say Ryanair has gone too far this time and that it is perpetuating sexist stereotypes about stewardesses .
After weeks of preparations for the largest sex event of its kind in Israel , organizers were forced to cancel it this week due to public pressure and threats exerted on the owner of the venue where the sex fest was to take place .
The event in question , which was scheduled to take place on " International Orgasm Day , " aimed to bring together some 250 participants seeking to promote world peace through multiple orgasms reached by masturbation or sex .
The orgy was organized by the Raelian movement , a UFO religion whose followers believe humankind was created by aliens .
The group 's spokesman , Kobi Drori , said that the orgy was meant to include straights , gays , lesbians and bisexuals , all of them over 18 .
" The purpose of the event was to try and bring world peace through mass orgasm , this by experiencing consensual sex and natural , uninterrupted pleasure .
It was important to make love without feeling guilty or shy , " he explained .
Drori protested the fact that nowadays the words " war , " " violence " and " murder " have become more legitimate than " sex , " " orgasm " and " pleasure . "
" It should be the other way around .
Several years ago an Iraqi boy whose limbs were amputated was shown on TV and everybody treated this as if it was okay , but when Janet Jackson exposed her breast during the Superbowl the American nation was appalled .
" We wanted to put into practice the saying ' make love , not war ' . "
' Society based on self - fulfillment '
According to Drori , the orgy was just the first in a series of events dedicated to promoting this objective .
On January 22 the movement will hold a conference on sexuality and masturbation with experts and writers in the field .
He also vowed that the cancelation of this year 's orgy would not deter the Raelians from setting up another sex fest next year .
The Raelian movement has several hundreds followers in Israel and some 70,000 members worldwide .
" We do n't believe in demons , ghosts and gods , " said Drori .
" The group 's primary goal is to inform humanity , without attempting to persuade , regarding scientific messages that deal with the origins of life on earth .
" The second goal is to expedite the establishment of a society based on the principles of non-violence , solidarity , self - fulfillment and pleasure .
To establish one global currency , one global government and harness science to the service of humanity , and not against humanity , " he concluded .

When the University of Chicago 's David Mazziotti talks about chemistry , perhaps he is thinking about how the behavior of all of the electrons in a molecule can be anticipated from the behavior of just two of its electrons .
For 50 years theoretical chemists have puzzled over the problem of predicting many - electron chemistry with only two electrons , which many thought intractable and perhaps impossible to solve .
Mazziotti , an associate professor in chemistry , will present a new approach to tuning his solution to the problem for exceptional computational accuracy and efficiency in the Dec. 12 issue of Physical Review Letters .
" We can do all these calculations using a desktop computer , " Mazziotti said .
" We 're getting accuracy and efficiency that supercedes some of the traditional techniques , so it really opens up a whole new ballgame . "
Scientists have grappled with the problem for decades because a detailed statistical description of electrons ' positions in a molecule can reveal whether a particular chemical reaction will occur .
But the number of electrons in an atom or molecule can range from 10 to hundreds or thousands .
Even the most powerful computers lack the power to perform these calculations , which become increasingly expensive as more electrons are added to the mix .
The computational cost stems from the laws of quantum mechanics , the branch of physics that governs the behavior of atoms and molecules .
Mazziotti's advance means that chemists will be able to compute the electronic properties of a given molecule with greater accuracy at a lower cost .
Mazziotti anticipates that his research tool will enable scientists to more rapidly solve a wide range of problems in chemistry , including the chemistry of free radicals .
Free radicals are molecules with unpaired electrons that play a key role in reactions that deplete atmospheric ozone and create greenhouse gases .
Radical - type reactions are also important in the design of new drugs and more efficient combustion engines .
Mazziotti began working on the problem of using two electrons to represent many electrons in the mid-1990s as a graduate student at Harvard University .
His graduate school mentor , Nobel laureate Dudley Herschbach , has called the quest " a ' holy grail ' of theoretical chemistry . "
Speaking of Mazziotti's progress in 2006 , Herschbach said that " David Mazziotti has made a major advance in fundamental theory . "
Herschbach employed a football analogy to illustrate Mazziotti's method , known to theoretical chemists as the 2 - electron Reduced Density Matrix ( 2 - RDM ) method .
In this analogy , a coach could automatically determine the actions of an entire team by simply plotting the motion of just two to three players : the quarterback and one running back / receiver , with auxiliary help from one lineman .
" His method requires dealing with just pairs and trios of electrons , " Herschbach said .
The late Joseph Mayer , a professor in chemistry at the University of Chicago from 1946 until 1960 , was one of the first scientists to propose doing electronic structure calculations for many - electron atoms and molecules by using just two electrons .
In the 2 - RDM approach , one determines the probabilities for finding a pair of electrons at different locations in an atom or molecule .
But a problem arises , Mazziotti said .
" If one wants to work with these two - electron distributions , one has to make sure that they actually represent the many - electron system adequately . "
Mazziotti has in fact developed several two - electron approaches that target different levels of accuracy and efficiency .
The previous approaches tuned for maximum accuracy have applications to highly challenging problems like bi-radicals ( molecules with two unpaired electrons ) , electron - rich materials , and molecular conductivity .
The latest tool extends independent work by Christian Kollmar at the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials in the Netherlands as well as work with University of Chicago graduate student Eugene DePrince .
It is tuned for high efficiency and impressive accuracy for applicability to a very wide range of chemical problems .
" We view 2 - RDM theory as a platform that we can now tune , essentially , to get high accuracy or high efficiency or some combination of both of those for different molecular systems , " Mazziotti said .
Last year Mazziotti published a book , Two - Electron Density Matrix Mechanics for Many - Electron Atoms and Molecules , which serves as a roadmap for scientists in his field .
More than 20 scientists contributed chapters to the volume , which summarizes historical and recent advances in the field .
Supporting Mazziotti's work are the National Science Foundation , the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund , Microsoft Corporation , the Dreyfus Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation .

Govenor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a fiscal emergency yesterday and called the state 's politicians into a special session to address California 's $ 11bn ( £ 7.4 bn ) deficit .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The state 's revenue gap is expected to hit $ 28bn over the next 19 months without bold action .
The emergency declaration authorises the governor and politicians to change the existing budget within the next 45 days .
Without quick action , the state is likely to run out of cash in February .
Schwarzenegger and Democrats have proposed a combination of tax hikes and spending cuts , but Republican politicians are steadfast in their refusal to raise taxes .
Politicians failed to reach a compromise during the special session Schwarzenegger declared last month , pushing the problem to a new Legislature that was being sworn in yesterday .
The crisis worsens each week , so the Republican governor did not want to waste any time in declaring a special session , said his spokesman , Aaron McLear .
" It 's important that we start on Day One so the new Legislature can start immediately to solve our fiscal crisis , " he said .
There appeared to be little reason to believe that Republican politicians would budge on their opposition to tax increases .
" If anything , I think our resolve ( against raising taxes ) is deeper than it has ever been because of the economic realities , " Senate Minority Leader Dave Cogdill said yesterday .
Democrats do n't have the two - thirds majority in either the Assembly or Senate that is required to pass tax increases or a state budget .

There has yet to be a serious debate in the Muslim world about the compatibility of evolution and Islam , but that will soon change .
Rising education levels , access to the internet , and exposure to evolution - creation debates in the US and Europe are bringing the issue of evolution to the fore – and opinion among Muslims will solidify in the coming years .
Can we avoid a mass rejection of evolution in the Muslim world ?
There are subtle differences in the way Muslims and Christians approach evolution .
For example , the age of the Earth is not an issue for Muslims .
The account of creation in the Qur'an , like its Biblical counterpart , involves six stages or ' days ' .
The length of each period , however , is not specified in the Qur'an .
In one passage , the period is defined as " in a day the measure of which is a thousand years of what you count " ( 32:5 ) and in another as " ... a day the measure of which is fifty thousand years " ( 70:4 ) .
The resulting ambiguity leaves open the possibility of a very old Earth .
Indeed , so - called young Earth creationism – which asserts that the planet is between 6000 and 10,000 years old – is wholly absent in the Muslim world and a universe billions of years old is commonly accepted .
In addition , there are religious scholars who find evolution to be compatible with Islam .
For example , Dr Israr Ahmed in Pakistan believes that God works through the process of evolution .
Similarly , south Asian poet and philosopher Mohammad Iqbal , writing in the early 20th century , accepted evolution and even credited the idea to Muslim philosophers of the 9th and 11th centuries .
So there are voices within Islam that do not find evolution fundamentally opposed to religion .
How should scientists respond to the rising challenge of creationism in the Muslim world ?
Despite surveys showing hostility towards evolution , there is also an overwhelmingly pro-science attitude .
This is particularly true for sciences that have practical and technological benefits .
The message about evolution in the Islamic world therefore needs to be framed in a way that emphasises practical applications and shows that it is the bedrock of modern biology .
This is the approach advocated in the US in the recent National Academy of Sciences publication Science , Evolution , and Creationism .
The arguments for evolution will have to be framed differently in each country .
The national academies of Muslim countries can tailor the specifics of the message according to the political and cultural realities of their respective communities .
For example , while evolution is included in the high school curricula of both Turkey and Pakistan , the challenges faced by schools in secular Turkey are very different from those in highly religious Pakistan .
Crucially , if a link between evolution and atheism is stressed , as some prominent scientists in the west have been advocating , this will undoubtedly cut short the dialogue and the vast majority of people in the Muslim world will choose religion over evolution .
Muslim creationists know this and they have been stressing this link in their anti-evolution works .
It is not simply a matter of presenting evidence .
Even in the US , a survey by the Pew Research Foundation has found that among those who reject evolution , only 14 % cite lack of evidence as the reason for their rejection .
Religion in the Muslim world plays a much larger role in the social and cultural landscape , and thus , our tactics for combating creationism in these countries need to take that into account .
I am not advocating suppressing or shying away from hard problems at the interface of science and religion .
Evolutionary ideas addressing human origins , for example , may face serious obstacles and may turn into a major fault line in Islam .
But a peaceful accommodation is possible , like that achieved within the Catholic Church .
As scientists we should present , without compromise , the best available science , but avoid stressing those metaphysical consequences that may surely lead to a widespread rejection of an established scientific theory in parts of the world already lagging behind in science .
At present , the dominant voice shaping the evolution - creation debate in the Muslim world is that of Turkish creationist Adnan Oktar , who uses the pen name Harun Yahya .
Scientists , especially biologists , should write for newspapers and magazines read by a Muslim audience and seize back the initiative from creationists like Yahya .

Obama Claps Back With Keating Five
Created : October 06 , 2008 11:38 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
When the McCain campaign announced this weekend that it would start attacking Sen.
Barack Obama via guilt by association , peddling smears about people he barely knows , I thought the tack would lead to the Keating Five .
But I did n’t know it would happen this quickly .
The Obama campaign swung into action immediately .
By the time the Sunday news shows were taping , Democratic surrogates were hitting McCain with opposition research on his associations with extremist , racist groups ( Begala ) and the Keating Five ( Emanuel ) .
Today , of course , camp Obama is pushing a new Keating Economics website , which begins streaming a documentary about McCain ’s Keating problem at noon .
Obama ’s campaign has never pushed the Keating button before , so this attack carries an original punch–and is clearly salient given the current financial crisis .
Because the scandal involved McCain ’s actions in public service , it is more likely to arise during the remaining two debates .
McCain ’s dredging up of Bill Ayers , in contrast , is not only old news but has no link to anything Obama has done in public life .
Patrick Ruffini , a Republican operative who worked on Bush ’s reelection campaign , said today that McCain ’s Ayers attacks are so old that airing them now “ appears desperate . ”
Desperate and risky — given the corrupt skeletons in McCain ’s closet .

15 ore fa
The Financial Times reports that AIG is up to its old tricks , back again to the trough for more money .
Christmas
The Iceland credit default swaps settlement is coming soon , you know .
The worst is that AIG is pretending to act as if this is a negotiation as opposed to extortion .
Get a load of this crap :
AIG ’s executives were on Friday night locked in negotiations with the authorities over a plan that could involve a debt - for - equity swap and the government ’s purchase of troubled mortgage - backed securities from the insurer .
Ahem , are they trying to help the government by coming up with a fig leaf ?
Are they assuming that everyone forgot the terms of the original loan ?
From the Fed ’s press release :
The interests of taxpayers are protected by key terms of the loan .
The loan is collateralized by all the assets of AIG , and of its primary non-regulated subsidiaries .
These assets include the stock of substantially all of the regulated subsidiaries .
The loan is expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the firm ’s assets .
The U.S. government will receive a 79.9 percent equity interest in AIG and has the right to veto the payment of dividends to common and preferred shareholders .
The “ interests of taxpayers are protected bit ” now looks like a complete joke .
The original loan was ALREADY secured by ALL of AIG ’s assets .
Everything that could be hocked WAS ALREADY hocked .
And the government has a 79.9 % equity interest .
So what is this talk of a debt for equity swap ?
The government does n’t want to go over 79.9 % , then it has to consolidate the operations on its balance sheet .
And it has the right of first refusal on everything else ( the fact that it has all the assets as security means they cannot be sold unless the proceeds are remitted to the Fed .
The mechanics ought to be that AIG gets some sort of waiver in order to complete a sale , but I am certain somewhere the lawyers have a procedure in mind , since it was understood from the get - go that AIG would repay the loan via asset sales ) .
The idea of selling dodgy MBS to the Fed is also ludicrous , but that does not mean the Fed will not go ahead with it .
Again , the Fed now has ALL of AIG ’s assets as security .
So it is going to increase what it lends to AIG , since AIG really has the upper hand , and AIG is offering the ruse of pledging the MBS because other banks have used MBS as collateral for loans , and version 1.0 of the TARP was to have banks sell crappy MBS to Treasury .
So AIG presumably hopes that the Fed will gamble that the generally inattentive public at large will think this latest move resembles other bank rescue activities and therefore will not make angry calls to Congressmen .
But this is all a ruse .
This is the essence of AIG ’s latest proposal :
Man walks into pawn broker .
He says to the person behind the counter , “ You know that watch I brought in two weeks ago ?
I know you lent me $ 85 , but now I need another $ 50 .
And I will tell you why you will give it to me .
I have a gun with me .
I will blow my brains out here , right now .
With your nice carpet , I guarantee it will cost you more than $ 50 to clean up your store .
And that ’s before we get into the cost of keeping your store closed while you clean my grey matter off your walls and what my suicide might do to your store ’s reputation . ”
Oh , and we forgot to mention that the man in the story above pulled the same trick last week and it worked like a charm .
The other bit that is offensive is ( separately ) that AIG is unhappy that it is paying more its bailout than banks did for theirs .
The arrogance is breathtaking .
Banks and securities firms are regulated by Federal agencies .
The fact that they came close to going under says the oversight was defective , and one can argue that the government was required to prevent a disaster that happened on its watch .
The federal government has NO oversight over AIG .
Its mess was SOLELY AIG ’s own doing , and they should consider themselves incredibly lucky that they were so big that the Fed felt it has to intercede .
Now they think they are entitled to demand an improvement of terms ?
They should be told to take a long walk off a short pier ( the management , that is ) .
If we are merely going to salvage random about - to - fail - that - might - hurt - the - financial - markets players , I ’d much rather rescue GM .
They at least have a better attitude ( and Obama made noises that he would demand better fuel efficiency as a quid pro quo ) .
And I have far more sympathy for blue collar workers than AIG executives .
And if the interest really is too much for AIG on a current basis , no reduction in rate or debt - for - equity optics .
Just lower the proportion that has to be paid in cash , and add the deferred interest to the principal .
No free lunches here .
But then again , the Fed does not want brains and skull fragments all over its board room … .
From the Financial Times :
The UK economy is likely to go into a deep recession next year The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) has warned of a " severe " economic downturn in the UK in 2009 .
The Paris - based body has predicted that economic output in the UK will fall by 1.1 % next year , more than any other major G7 country .
Unemployment in the UK is predicted to rise significantly to over 8 % by end of 2009 from 5.5 % in 2008 .
The US economy is forecast to decline by 0.9 % in 2009 , and Germany by 0.8 % .
Economic growth in the 30 countries of the OECD is forecast to fall by 0.4 % , before growing by 1.5 % in 2010 .
The downturn is likely to be the most severe since the early 1980s leading to a sharp rise in unemployment
OECD
As well as the UK , the OECD identifies Hungary , Iceland , Ireland , Spain and Turkey as being the countries most affected by the economic slowdown .
" These economies are most directly affected by the financial crisis , which in some cases exposed other vulnerabilities , or by severe housing downturns , " it says .

In the pre-Budget report , the chancellor accepted that the UK economy would decline by 0.75 % to 1.25 % next year , but said that the UK was " better placed " than other countries to cope with the downturn .

The OECD has endorsed the need for government spending in affected countries to boost growth , because it says that interest rate cuts are no longer effective .
" Against a background of deep economic downturn , additional macroeconomic stimulus is needed , " it says .
" Current conditions of extreme financial stress have weakened the monetary transmission mechanism .
In this unusual situation , fiscal policy over and above the support provided through automatic stabilisers [ such as unemployment benefits ] has a role to play . "
But it warns that " the scope for easing is limited in countries that start from a weak fiscal position , " and warns of the risk of " adverse financial market reaction " unless there is a credible framework for reducing budget deficits in the medium - term .
It forecasts that budget deficits throughout the OECD area will widen from 1.4 % of GDP in 2007 to 3.8 % in 2009 .
In the UK , the OECD says that the fiscal risks are greater because of the costs of the bank bail - outs .
Worldwide slowdown
The OECD warns that any recovery in the US is likely to be " languid " as consumption is held back by the large losses in household wealth .
And it says that the risks are still on the downside , suggesting that economic conditions could worsen significantly .
These risks include " further failures of financial institutions , " a " longer period before financial conditions normalise , " and the possibility that emerging market countries such as China will be harder hit by the downturn in global trade .
And it adds that when downturns are caused by banking crises , " the recovery is typically more anaemic than usual . "
The OECD says the downturn is the " most severe since the early 1980s " and is likely to lead to a " sharp rise in unemployment " with growth not returning to trend before the second half of 2010 .
World trade growth will also slow sharply , from 4.8 % this year to 1.9 % in 2009 , which will hit many major developing countries .
However , the slowing economy , and the effect of lower commodity prices , will bring about a sharp slowdown in inflation , leaving space for more cuts in interest rates .

en years after the ratification of the first ISO C++ standard , C++ is heading for no less than a revolution .
C++0x , the new C++ standard due in 2009 , brings a new spirit and new flesh into the software development world .
Brace yourself for state - of - the - art design idioms , even better performance , and a plethora of new features such as multithreading , concepts , hash table , rvalue references , smarter smart pointers , and new algorithms .
No doubt you 'll find a lot to like in C++0 x !
New Core Features
The two most important features of C++0 x are concepts and concurrency support .
Concepts enable programmers to specify constraints on template parameters , thus making generic programming and design immensely simpler and more reliable ( see Douglas Gregor 's excellent introduction to concepts ) .
Variadic templates , template aliases ( also called template typedefs ) , and static_assert — though not directly related to concepts — will also make the use of templates in generic libraries more intuitive , flexible , and less error prone .
The importance of a standardized concurrency API in C++ can't be overstated :
As multicore processors are becoming widespread , you simply can't afford to remain stuck in the single - threaded era , or compromise on platform - dependent APIs .
At last , there 's a portable , standardized and efficient multithreading library for C ++.
To get a glimpse of the new concurrency facilities of C++0x , you 're welcome to read Anthony Williams ' brilliant introduction to multithreading in C++0 x .
You can find additional info about thread - local storage here .
Rvalue references are yet another silent revolution .
While most users will probably not even know they exist ( read my interview with Bjarne Stroustrup ) , rvalue references enable library designers to optimize containers and algorithms by implementing move semanticsand perfect forwarding easily , thus reducing unneeded copy operations .
Automatic type deduction is made possible by the new keywords auto and decltype which deduce the type of an object from its initializer and capture the type of an expression without having to spell it out , respectively .
Adding auto and decltype also paves the way for a new function declaration syntax .
The function 's return type appears after the -> sign :
auto func( int x ) -> double { return pow( x ) ; }
Lambda expressions and closures are another prominent feature of C++0 x .
A lambda expressionis a nameless function defined at the place where it 's called .
It is similar to a function object except that the programmer is rid of the burden of declaring a class with a constructor , defining an overloaded ( ) operator and an instantiating a temporary object of that class — this tedium now becomes the compiler 's job .
Here 's an example of a lambda expression :
//a lambda expression is used as an argument myfunc ( [ ] ( int x , int y ) -> int {return x+y;} )
The lambda expression is indicated by the lambda introducer [ ] followed by a parameter list in parentheses .
The optional return type comes next , following the -> sign .
Finally , the lambda block itself is enclosed in braces .
Sarah Palin : Alaska's Dead Wolf Pups Demand Justice !
by : Care2.com
recipient : Alaska Governor Sarah Palin
This summer , Alaska wildlife agency personnel reportedly staked out a known wolf denning site – a practice that is illegal under Alaska law – and , using helicopters , gunned down 14 adult wolves from the air .
When they landed , they found 14 helpless pups in the nearby dens – infant wolves just weeks old – and methodically shot each one in the head .
28 wolves gunned down in all .
Due to a loophole in federal law , Alaska is the only state in the U.S. where a few hunters still use aircraft to shoot wolves or chase them to exhaustion before landing and shooting them point blank .
But the practice of " denning " – the killing of wolf young in the den – is prohibited even under Alaska law .
This killing of 14 wolf pups disturbs even longtime hunters in Alaska .
During her two years as governor , Sarah Palin proposed a $ 150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf and introduced legislation to make it even easier to use aircraft to hunt wolves and bears .
But it 's time that Governor Palin call for a thorough investigation into the killing of these 14 wolf pups , and bring any Alaska employees who acted illegally to justice .
Governor Palin presents herself as a pro-ethics reform politician .
Please sign our petition to hold her accountable to her promises and send an email to your friends to spread the word .

I am appalled by reports that the Alaska Department of Fish and Game illegally killed 14 wolf pups as part of their efforts to boost caribou numbers and that they intentionally excluded this information from a June 30 press release .
This cover up only further diminishes the public 's faith and trust in the department 's ability to properly manage wolves and bears and follow the law .
Governor Palin , you have presented yourself in the media as a politician who stands for comprehensive ethics reform in government .
Thus , I urge you to call for a thorough investigation into the June " denning " and killing of 14 wolf pups in Game Management Unit 9 , and to ensure that any Alaska Department of Fish and Game employees who acted illegally be brought to justice .
Predator reduction efforts deserve careful scrutiny and justification .
This is the first time in more than 20 years that department biologists shot and killed wolves from the air and the first time that it has killed pups in their den .
Alaska law prohibits the killing of pups in their dens as part of a predator reduction effort .
What 's more , the state itself advised the Board of Game in January of 2008 that it should reject a proposal that sought to allow killing in the den .
So , clearly the state is aware the practice is illegal even as part of a predator control effort .
Had this predator control program been scientifically and legally based it would not have been conducted at a time of year when wolves are tending to newly born offspring , making the illegal killing of pups in the den inevitable .
If you truly believe in government reform , you must apply it in all circumstances of the law .
Those responsible for the ' denning ' must be held accountable just as any person who acts outside of the law would be fined and jailed for an illegal action .

The internet is abuzz .
McCain may make Alaska Governor Sarah Palin his running mate .
The Trail reports :
Speculation quickly turned to a dark - horse candidate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
The Atlantic ’s Mark Ambinder was the first to report that a private plane from Anchorage landed last night at a private airport about 30 miles from here .
The private plane is connected to a McCain fundraiser .
There have been more female names dropped recently , among them Condoleeza Rice and Carly Fiorina .
Poor Mitt ..
UPDATE :CNBC calls it for Palin !
UPDATE II : Palin is under investigation for abuse of power !
UPDATE III : Audio from her spokesperson , shows the lack of openness and transparency in her government .

The Israeli Ambassador to Australia says his nation will only stop air strikes on the Gaza strip when Palestinians halt rocket attacks .
A six - month ceasefire has collapsed and Israel has retaliated to Hamas rocket fire with sustained air strikes that have killed over 300 people .
Hamas responded to the continuing bombardment by firing rockets the farthest yet into Israel , with one striking not far from Ashdod , Israel 's second - largest port , some 30 kilometres north of Gaza .
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard yesterday accused Hamas of breaking the ceasefire and said Israel was responding to an act of aggression .
Israeli Ambassador Yuval Rotem says Israel will not stop its strikes until Hamas back down .
" We are willing and we are basically going to support any kind of quiet for quiet period , " he said .
" But if any further provocation is going to come , Israelis continue to respond in a very decisive way .
If there is going to be no fire by Hamas there will be no reaction from Israel . "
He says the deaths are unfortunate , but hard to avoid .
" Hamas [ has ] deliberately put all their infrastructure around crowded areas and deliberately manufacture their rockets around mosque and schools in order to prevent us from responding to their provocation , " he said .
" It 's heartbreaking to see civilians in the line of fire , but it was deliberately done by the Hamas organisation . "
A spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says at this stage no Australians are believed to be caught up in the latest violence .
The nearest planetary system to our own has two asteroid belts in addition to a previously known ice belt , according to the latest observations by NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope .
The location and structure of the asteroid belts relative to the system 's central star , Epsilon Eridani , suggests the existence of earth - like planets .
" We certainly have n't seen it yet , but if its solar system is anything like ours , then there should be planets like ours , " says astronomer Massimo Marengo of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics [ USA Today ] .
The Epsilon Edidani system has long been of interest to astronomers and science fiction fans alike because of its proximity ( 10.5 light - years ) and resemblance to our solar system .
The newly discovered asteroid belts give the system an appearance even more like our own .
The inner asteroid belt looks identical to ours in terms of material , and it orbits at 3 astronomical units ( AU ) from Epsilon Eridani — the same distance between the sun and the rocky asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter .
( An astronomical unit equals the average Earth - sun distance of 93 million miles , or about 150 million km . )
Epsilon Eridani's second asteroid belt is 20 AU from the star , or about where Uranus is in relation to our sun , and it is crowded with as much mass as Earth 's moon [ Science News ] .
The outer asteroid belt was captured directly by Spitzer 's infrared cameras and the inner asteriod belt , though too far from the cameras , was indicated by the thermal energy from its infrared emissions .
A Jupiter - mass planet discovered in 2000 is thought to orbit just outside of the inner asteroid belt .
The new study , to be published in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal , supports the existence of more planets because the asteroid belts
were likely shaped by planets whose gravitational forces could remove any excess material flung from the belts , while also keeping the shape of the rings .
Planets in our solar system exert similar shaping effects .
" The big planets that are now keeping those gaps are determining the geometry of the system of rings , " [ SPACE.com ]
says Marengo .
Epsilon Eridani is nearly the same mass as our sun but only about one - fifth as old .
While the sun is an estimated 4.5 billion years old , Epsilon Eridani has been around for just 850 million years .
" Studying Epsilon Eridani is like having a time machine to look at our solar system when it was young , " [ SPACE.com ]
says Marengo .
Trekkies will also recognize the star as the home of logical Mr. Spock .
Marengo adds ,
" Of course there is disagreement among Star Trek fans about whether the planet of Mr. Spock could be at Epsilon Eridani , because it is such a young star and Vulcans are supposed to be an advanced civilization " [ USA Today ] .

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency routinely allows companies to keep new information about their chemicals secret , including compounds that have been shown to cause cancer and respiratory problems , the Journal Sentinel has found .
The newspaper examined more than 2,000 filings in the EPA 's registry of dangerous chemicals for the past three years .
In more than half the cases , the EPA agreed to keep the chemical name a secret .
In hundreds of other cases , it allowed the company filing the report to keep its name and address confidential .
This is despite a federal law calling for public notice of any new information through the EPA 's program monitoring chemicals that pose substantial risk .
The whole idea of the program is to warn the public of newfound dangers .
The EPA 's rules are supposed to allow confidentiality only " under very limited circumstances . "
Legal experts and environmental advocates say the practice of " sanitizing , " or blacking out , this information not only strips vital information from the public , it violates the agency 's own law .
Section 14 of the Toxic Substances Control Act , the foundation for all the EPA 's toxic and chemical regulations , stipulates that chemical producers may not be granted confidentiality when it comes to health and safety data .
" The EPA has chosen to ignore that , " said Wendy Wagner , a law professor at the University of Texas - Austin .
The newspaper 's findings are just the latest example of how EPA administrators more often than not put company interests above the needs of consumers .
Over the past 18 months , the Journal Sentinel has reported on numerous EPA programs that bow to corporate pressure , frustrating health and environmental advocates and disregarding the agency 's own mission to inform the public of potentially dangerous chemicals .
The EPA has the authority to fine companies that fail to fully disclose information about dangerous chemicals .
And , in at least one instance , it has done so .
But critics say the program has been allowed to flounder , and the agency rarely challenges a company 's request for confidentiality .
It 's been frustrating to see the program " starved of resources and generally abandoned , " said Myra Karstadt , a toxicologist who worked on the EPA 's program from 1998 to 2005 .
" It 's a very worthwhile program but only if it 's given a chance to work . "
Intent was to inform
The program began 30 years ago as a way to help the public avoid contact with dangerous chemicals .
The law requires companies that make chemicals to submit any information of potential hazards about their products to the EPA .
The EPA , in turn , is supposed to make that information available to communities and consumers .
Companies can claim confidentiality if they are worried that their disclosures will reveal trade secrets .
They have to answer 14 questions , including specifics on why disclosing the information would harm the company .
EPA administrators then decide which ones are granted confidentiality .
EPA spokesman Dale Kemery said the agency realizes the claims of confidentiality " do in some instances limit the public 's ability to understand the specifics of a particular filing . "
In those cases , the agency works with the companies to get them to provide more information , which many do , he said .
But the Journal Sentinel examination of the agency 's substantial risk program found that large information gaps remain .
More than half of the 32 submissions for March 2004 , for example , are still missing information necessary for the public to connect the name of the chemical with the information submitted .
Some have no information at all .
Consider File No. 8EHQ-0308-17103A .
The EPA document , filed in March , marks as confidential the names of the chemical and the company that makes it .
Even the generic class of chemical has been removed .
What is the information that this unnamed company is submitting about this unnamed chemical so the public can see if it poses a substantial risk ?
Anxious consumers have no way of knowing .
" No information is provided in the sanitized copy of the submission , " the EPA Web site entry reads .
Hazardous if inhaled
One report , posted by an unnamed company about an unnamed chemical , shows that if the substance is inhaled , it produces " foamy macrophages " or diseased cells , in the lungs of rats .
The report also indicates the chemical may cause pulmonary fibrosis - a deadly and irreversible disease in people .
There is no way to know if this is a chemical coming out of a smokestack in some town or a concern for workers at a factory .
The write - up does not say where the chemical is produced or used .
Nor is there any indication in the description of what this chemical is or how it works .
Another filing in May refers to a study that shows a chemical had caused liver abnormalities consistent with cancer .
Again , the chemical name and any identifying information are blacked out .
" The public is being denied useful and sometimes critical information on chemical - related health and environmental hazards , " said Karstadt , the former EPA toxicologist .
Karstadt said the whole point of the program was to provide the public with information about dangerous chemicals .
" By law , health and safety data is supposed to be kept open , " she said .
The EPA 's own Web site indicates that studies , letters and accident reports are intended to be viewed by the public so citizens can " understand potential human health and environmental risks associated with exposure to chemical substances . "
The EPA posts all reports , redacted or not , on its Web site .
Oversees 28 programs
The law that requires companies to report data on dangerous chemicals is just one of 10 laws that the EPA is supposed to enforce .
The office oversees 28 programs that address air pollution , water pollution , hazardous waste , toxic substances and pesticides , among other things .
The EPA is an enormous agency with three headquarters in the Washington , D.C. , area and 10 regional offices all over the country .
The office that administers the dangerous chemicals program has eight divisions .
The overview describing their responsibilities fills 41 pages .
Even Kemery , the spokesman , could not say exactly who or how many people decide what information is allowed to be kept confidential .
Nor did he know how many claims of confidentiality have been submitted and how many were granted .
The Environmental Working Group , a watchdog group based in Washington , D.C. , reports that less than 1 % of the EPA 's enforcement and compliance budget is spent on the Toxic Substances Control Act .
Renee Sharpe , a senior scientist with the Environmental Working Group , spent more than a year trying to get information from the EPA about some of the chemicals under the program , only to be denied at every turn .
" It 's pretty outrageous , is n't it , " she said .
The EPA advises companies on how to keep information confidential .
It is less helpful to consumers .
The information on its Web site is difficult to access .
You can't look up the chemical by name or by the name of the company that makes it .
So , you have to go through the filings month by month to see if there is any information listed on that particular chemical .
There are huge gaps in reporting .
The Web site does not have any information on chemicals before 2004 .
For reasons the EPA does not explain , the Web site does not include the second half of 2004 .
That means there is no information at all about more than 16,000 entries .
Enforcement at work
Sometimes , the program works .
In 2004 , the EPA fined DuPont de Nemours and Co. $ 10.25 million for not reporting data on Teflon .
The chemical , used as nonstick coating in cookware , was found to be toxic and had been linked to birth defects .
The EPA alleged that DuPont had information for more than 20 years that the chemical was harmful but did not disclose the risks .
The company agreed to settle and pay the penalty .
It was the largest civil administrative penalty the EPA had ever obtained under any federal environmental statute .
Other times the EPA has encouraged companies to withdraw chemicals found to be dangerous .
In 1999 , 3 M agreed to phase out its use of perfluorinated chemicals after discussions with the EPA .
The chemicals , used in furniture coatings and to waterproof clothing , were found to cause reproductive and developmental toxicity in rats .
Still , critics including Karstadt and Wagner say the agency 's policies have grown too lax .
The real problem with the program " is a complete lack of commitment , " Karstadt said .
Even when companies say they understand the need for transparency , they are n't always willing to provide it , the Journal Sentinel found .
Adam Bickel , manager of the Product Regulatory Center of Expertise at BASF , a major German - based chemical producer , said his company recognizes that toxic law is a " key chemical control and chemical management statute to protect human health and the environment . "
BASF is one of the companies that files the most reports to the EPA under the program .
Bickel said his company takes its obligations " seriously and complies with the reporting . "
BASF submitted 101 reports to the EPA in 2008 .
It blacked out the chemical name in 85 of those entries .

The pint of beer is safe and wo n't be replaced by the litre Amid the economic gloom , UK drinkers have found a measure of good news - the pint will not have to be renamed .
Decades of wrangling with the EU over switching to metric measures has ended with a vote confirming that imperial measures can carry on indefinitely .
The European Commission acknowledged last year that persuading the UK to embrace litres and kilometres over pints and miles was a lost cause .
Minister for Europe Caroline Flint said it was a " victory for common sense " .
The vote means a 2009 deadline to end the use of imperial measurements alongside metric units has been scrapped .
Innovation , Universities and Skills Secretary John Denham , who is responsible for national weights and measures , was delighted .
He said after the European Parliament vote : " People in Britain like their pint and their mile .
They should be able to use the measures they are most familiar with , and now they can be sure that they will continue to do so .
" We made strong arguments for the UK 's right to carry on using pints and miles and maintaining dual metric and imperial labelling .
" I know how important this is to the British people and businesses and am grateful for the Commission 's support . "
Cheers to saving the British pint Europe Minister Caroline Flint said : " This is a victory for common sense .
It shows that the EU is listening to the concerns of businesses and consumers and is not intent on imposing a ' one - size - fits - all ' regime where unnecessary .
" In the current difficult economic climate , it will also mean that British companies do not face extra labelling costs in order to do business in the United States . "
Since 1995 , goods sold in Europe have had to display metric weights and measurements , but to appease a public outcry in the UK , imperial indications have also been allowed .
That concession to British tradition was due to expire in 2009 , when imperial measures faced the final curtain - banished from packaging and market stalls .
The reprieve follows months of Commission consultations with British industry , trade and consumer groups , an exercise which convinced European officials emotions were still running high over the imperial system and a move to metric - only in the UK would give sceptics more ammunition for the anti-EU campaign .
The issue of metrification aroused strong passions with many in the UK
The issue caused most controversy when Britain 's so - called " metric martyrs " lost a battle to trade only in pounds and ounces .
One of them , Steve Thoburn , who died suddenly in 2004 , had been convicted in 2001 of selling bananas only by the pound .
His offence was to fail to provide customers with the metric equivalent , as required under EU law .
But the metric saga in the UK predates the EU - the government set up the UK metrication board in 1969 , four years before joining the Common Market .
The request to look into metrication had come from industry in the mid-1960s .
Now schools routinely teach children to think of their weight in kilograms and their height in metres and centimetres , and petrol by the litre is common .

My car has a terrible suspension so I hate speed bumps .
Even people with decent cars probably feel the same way .
Would n't it be awesome if the speed bump flattened when you were driving slow ?
Advertisement
Well , that is the idea behind this concept from designers Jae-yun Kim & Jong - Su Lee .
According to the description , the bump would rely on " retractors that open up if the impact on them is small enough . "
In other words , if you are driving slow , the weight of the car would flatten the bump .
Drive too fast and the bump would stay active .
I do n't know how smooth the transition would be , or whether it would be to expensive to produce , but at least the idea is fairly plausible .

This is the second part of a three - part article on the Awk one - liners .
This part will explain
Awk one - liners for text conversion and substitution .
See part one for introduction of the series .
What are Awk one - liners ?
They are concise and beautiful Awk programs that span no more than 70 characters ( less than one terminal line ) .
They were written by Eric Pement and are floating around on the Internet as awk1 line .
txt file .
If you 're interested in this topic , you subscribe to my posts .
Eric Pement 's
Awk one - liners collection consists of five sections :
I also recommend that you print out my Awk Cheat Sheet before you proceed .
This way you will have the language reference in front of you and you 'll faster memorize variables , functions and command line switches quicker .
Awesome news : I have written an e-book based on this article series .
Check it out :
Grab the local copy of Awk one - liners file here awk1 line .
txt and let 's roll .
Text Conversion and Substitution
21 . Convert Windows / DOS newlines ( CRLF ) to Unix newlines ( LF ) from Unix .
awk '{ sub ( / \r$ / , " " ) ; print }'
This one - liner uses the sub( regex , repl , [ string ] ) function .
This function substitutes the first instance of regular expression " regex " in string " string " with the string " repl " .
If " string " is omitted , variable $ 0 is used .
Variable $ 0 , as I explained in the first part of the article , contains the entire line .
The one - liner replaces ' \r ' ( CR ) character at the end of the line with nothing , i.e. , erases CR at the end .
Print statement prints out the line and appends ORS variable , which is '
' by default .
Thus , a line ending with CRLF has been converted to a line ending with LF .
22 . Convert Unix newlines ( LF ) to Windows / DOS newlines ( CRLF ) from Unix .
awk '{ sub ( / $ / , " \r " ) ; print }'
This one - liner also uses the sub ( ) function .
This time it replaces the zero - width anchor ' $ ' at the end of the line with a ' \r ' ( CR char ) .
This substitution actually adds a CR character to the end of the line .
After doing that Awk prints out the line and appends the ORS , making the line terminate with CRLF .
23 . Convert Unix newlines ( LF ) to Windows / DOS newlines ( CRLF ) from Windows / DOS .
awk 1
This one - liner may work , or it may not .
It depends on the implementation .
If the implementation catches the Unix newlines in the file , then it will read the file line by line correctly and output the lines terminated with CRLF .
If it does not understand Unix LF's in the file , then it will print the whole file and terminate it with CRLF ( single windows newline at the end of the whole file ) .
Ps. Statement ' 1 ' ( or anything that evaluates to true ) in Awk is syntactic sugar for '{ print }' .
24 . Convert Windows / DOS newlines ( CRLF ) to Unix newlines ( LF ) from Windows / DOS
gawk - v BINMODE= " w " ' 1 '
Theoretically this one - liner should convert CRLFs to LFs on DOS .
There is a note in GNU Awk documentation that says : " Under DOS , gawk ( and many other text programs ) silently translates end - of - line " \r
" to "
" on input and "
" to " \r
" on output .
A special " BINMODE " variable allows control over these translations and is interpreted as follows : ... If " BINMODE " is " w " , then binary mode is set on write ( i.e. , no translations on writes ) . "
My tests revealed that no translation was done , so you can't rely on this BINMODE hack .
Eric suggests to better use the " tr " utility to convert CRLFs to LFs on Windows :
tr -d \r
The ' tr ' program is used for translating one set of characters to another .
Specifying -d option makes it delete all characters and not do any translation .
In this case it's the ' \r ' ( CR ) character that gets erased from the input .
Thus , CRLFs become just LFs .
25 . Delete leading whitespace ( spaces and tabs ) from the beginning of each line ( ltrim ) .
awk '{ sub ( / ^[ \t ] +/ , " " ) ; print }'
This one - liner also uses sub ( ) function .
What it does is replace regular expression " ^ [ \t ] + " with nothing " " .
The regular expression " ^ [ \t ] + " means - match one or more space " " or a tab " \t " at the beginning " ^ " of the string .
26 . Delete trailing whitespace ( spaces and tabs ) from the end of each line ( rtrim ) .
awk '{ sub ( / [ \t ] +$ / , " " ) ; print }'
This one - liner is very similar to the previous one .
It replaces regular expression " [ \t ] + $ " with nothing .
The regular expression " [ \t ] + $ " means - match one or more space " " or a tab " \t " at the end " $ " of the string .
The " + " means " one or more " .
27 . Delete both leading and trailing whitespaces from each line ( trim ) .
awk '{ gsub ( / ^[ \t ] + |[ \t ] +$ / , " " ) ; print }'
This one - liner uses a new function called " gsub " .
Gsub ( ) does the same as sub ( ) , except it performs as many substitutions as possible ( that is , it 's a global sub ( ) ) .
For example , given a variable f = " foo " , sub ( " o " , " x " , f ) would replace just one " o " in variable f with " x " , making f be " fxo " ; but gsub ( " o " , " x " , f ) would replace both " o "s in " foo " resulting " fxx " .
The one - liner combines both previous one - liners - it replaces leading whitespace " ^ [ \t ] + " and trailing whitespace " [ \t ] + $ " with nothing , thus trimming the string .
To remove whitespace between fields you may use this one - liner :
awk '{ $ 1= $ 1 ; print }'
This is a pretty tricky one - liner .
It seems to do nothing , right ?
Assign $ 1 to $ 1 .
But no , when you change a field , Awk rebuilds the $ 0 variable .
It takes all the fields and concats them , separated by OFS ( single space by default ) .
All the whitespace between fields is gone .
28 . Insert 5 blank spaces at beginning of each line .
awk '{ sub ( / ^/ , " " ) ; print }'
This one - liner substitutes the zero - length beginning of line anchor " ^ " with five empty spaces .
As the anchor is zero - length and matches the beginning of line , the five whitespace characters get appended to beginning of the line .
29 .
Align all text flush right on a 79 - column width .
awk '{ printf " %79s
" , $ 0 } '
This one - liner asks printf ( ) to print the string in $ 0 variable and left pad it with spaces until the total length is 79 chars .
Please see the documentation of printf function for more information and examples .
30 .
Center all text on a 79 - character width .
awk '{ l=length ( ) ; s=int ( ( 79 - l ) / 2 ) ; printf " % " ( s+l ) " s
" , $ 0 } '
First this one - liner calculates the length ( ) of the line and puts the result in variable " l " .
Length ( var ) function returns the string length of var .
If the variable is not specified , it returns the length of the entire line ( variable $ 0 ) .
Next it calculates how many white space characters to pad the line with and stores the result in variable " s " .
Finally it printf ( ) s the line with appropriate number of whitespace chars .
For example , when printing a string " foo " , it first calculates the length of " foo " which is 3 .
Next it calculates the column " foo " should appear which ( 79 - 3 ) /2 = 38 .
Finally it printf ( " %41 " , " foo " ) .
Printf ( ) function outputs 38 spaces and then " foo " , making that string centered ( 38*2 + 3 = 79 )
31 . Substitute ( find and replace ) " foo " with " bar " on each line .
awk '{ sub ( / foo / , " bar " ) ; print }'
This one - liner is very similar to the others we have seen before .
It uses the sub ( ) function to replace " foo " with " bar " .
Please note that it replaces just the first match .
To replace all " foo "s with " bar "s use the gsub ( ) function :
awk '{ gsub ( / foo / , " bar " ) ; print }'
Another way is to use the gensub ( ) function :
gawk '{ $ 0 = gensub ( / foo / , " bar " , 4 ) ; print }'
This one - liner replaces only the 4th match of " foo " with " bar " .
It uses a never before seen gensub ( ) function .
The prototype of this function is gensub ( regex , s , h[ , t ] ) .
It searches the string " t " for " regex " and replaces " h" - th match with " s " .
If " t " is not given , $ 0 is assumed .
Unlike sub ( ) and gsub ( ) it returns the modified string " t " ( sub and gsub modified the string in - place ) .
Gensub ( ) is a non-standard function and requires GNU Awk or Awk included in NetBSD .
In this one - liner regex = " / foo / " , s = " bar " , h = 4 , and t = $ 0 .
It replaces the 4th instance of " foo " with " bar " and assigns the new string back to the whole line $ 0 .
32 . Substitute " foo " with " bar " only on lines that contain " baz " .
awk ' / baz / { gsub ( / foo/ , " bar " ) } ; { print }'
As I explained in the first one - liner in the first part of the article , every Awk program consists of a sequence of pattern - action statements " pattern { action statements } " .
Action statements are applied only to lines that match pattern .
In this one - liner the pattern is a regular expression / baz / .
If line contains " baz " , the action statement gsub ( / foo / , " bar " ) is executed .
And as we have learned , it substitutes all instances of " foo " with " bar " .
If you want to substitute just one , use the sub ( ) function !
33 . Substitute " foo " with " bar " only on lines that do not contain " baz " .
awk '!/ baz/ { gsub ( / foo/ , " bar " ) } ; { print }'
This one - liner negates the pattern / baz / .
It works exactly the same way as the previous one , except it operates on lines that do not contain match this pattern .
34 . Change " scarlet " or " ruby " or " puce " to " red " .
awk '{ gsub(/scarlet|ruby|puce / , " red " ) ; print} '
This one - liner makes use of extended regular expression alternation operator | ( pipe ) .
The regular expression / scarlet|ruby|puce / says : match " scarlet " or " ruby " or " puce " .
If the line matches , gsub ( ) replaces all the matches with " red " .
35 . Reverse order of lines ( emulate " tac " ) .
awk '{ a [ i ++] =
$ 0 } END { for ( j=i - 1 ; j>=0 ; ) print a[j --] }'
This is the trickiest one - liner today .
It starts by recording all the lines in the array " a " .
For example , if the input to this program was three lines " foo " , " bar " , and " baz " , then the array " a " would contain the following values : a [ 0 ] = " foo " , a [ 1 ] = " bar " , and a [ 2 ] = " baz " .
When the program has finished processing all lines , Awk executes the END { } block .
The END block loops over the elements in the array " a " and prints the recorded lines .
In our example with " foo " , " bar " , " baz " the END block does the following :
for ( j = 2 ; j >= 0 ; ) print a[j --]
First it prints out j [ 2 ] , then j [ 1 ] and then j [ 0 ] .
The output is three separate lines " baz " , " bar " and " foo " .
As you can see the input was reversed .
36 . Join a line ending with a backslash with the next line .
awk ' / \\$/ { sub ( /\\$ / , " " ) ; getline t ; print $ 0 t ; next } ; 1 '
This one - liner uses regular expression " / \$ / " to look for lines ending with a backslash .
If the line ends with a backslash , the backslash gets removed by sub ( / \$ / , " " ) function .
Then the " getline t " function is executed .
" Getline t " reads the next line from input and stores it in variable t. " Print $ 0 t " statement prints the original line ( but with trailing backslash removed ) and the newly read line ( which was stored in variable t ) .
Awk then continues with the next line .
If the line does not end with a backslash , Awk just prints it out with " 1 " .
Unfortunately this one liner fails to join more than 2 lines ( this is left as an exercise to the reader to come up with a one - liner that joins arbitrary number of lines that end with backslash :) ) .
37 . Print and sort the login names of all users .
awk - F " : " '{ print $ 1 | " sort " }' /etc / passwd
This is the first time we see the -F argument passed to Awk .
This argument specifies a character , a string or a regular expression that will be used to split the line into fields ( $ 1 , $ 2 , ... ) .
For example , if the line is " foo - bar - baz " and - F is " - " , then the line will be split into three fields : $ 1 = " foo " , $ 2 = " bar " and $ 3 = " baz " .
If -F is not set to anything , the line will contain just one field $ 1 = " foo - bar - baz " .
Specifying -F is the same as setting the FS ( Field Separator ) variable in the BEGIN block of Awk program :
awk - F " : " # is the same as awk ' BEGIN { FS= " : " }'
/ etc / passwd is a text file , that contains a list of the system 's accounts , along with some useful information like login name , user ID , group ID , home directory , shell , etc .
The entries in the file are separated by a colon " : " .
Here is an example of a line from /etc / passwd file :
pkrumins : x:1000:100 : Peteris Krumins :/ home / pkrumins :/ bin/ bash
If we split this line on " : " , the first field is the username ( pkrumins in this example ) .
The one - liner does just that - it splits the line on " : " , then forks the " sort " program and feeds it all the usernames , one by one .
After Awk has finished processing the input , sort program sorts the usernames and outputs them .
38 . Print the first two fields in reverse order on each line .
awk '{ print $ 2 , $ 1 } ' file
This one liner is obvious .
It reverses the order of fields $ 1 and $ 2 .
For example , if the input line is " foo bar " , then after running this program the output will be " bar foo " .
39 .
Swap first field with second on every line .
awk '{ temp = $ 1 ; $ 1 = $ 2 ; $ 2 = temp ; print }'
This one - liner uses a temporary variable called " temp " .
It assigns the first field $ 1 to " temp " , then it assigns the second field to the first field and finally it assigns " temp " to $ 2 .
This procedure swaps the first two fields on every line .
For example , if the input is " foo bar baz " , then the output will be " bar foo baz " .
Ps .
This one - liner was incorrect in Eric 's awk1 line .
txt file .
" Print " was missing .
40 .
Delete the second field on each line .
awk '{ $ 2 = " " ; print }'
This one liner just assigns empty string to the second field .
It 's gone .
41 . Print the fields in reverse order on every line .
awk '{ for ( i=NF ; i>0 ; i--) printf ( " %s " , $ i ) ; printf ( "
" ) }'
We saw the " NF " variable that stands for Number of Fields in the part one of this article .
After processing each line , Awk sets the NF variable to number of fields found on that line .
This one - liner loops in reverse order starting from NF to 1 and outputs the fields one by one .
It starts with field $ NF , then $ ( NF - 1 ) , ... , $ 1 .
After that it prints a newline character .
42 . Remove duplicate , consecutive lines ( emulate " uniq " )
awk 'a !~
$ 0 ; { a = $ 0 }'
Variables in
Awk do n't need to be initialized or declared before they are being used .
They come into existence the first time they are used .
This one - liner uses variable " a " to keep the last line seen " { a = $ 0 } " .
Upon reading the next line , it compares if the previous line ( in variable " a " ) is not the same as the current one " a ! ~ $ 0 " .
If it is not the same , the expression evaluates to 1 ( true ) , and as I explained earlier , any true expression is the same as " { print } " , so the line gets printed out .
Then the program saves the current line in variable " a " again and the same process continues over and over again .
This one - liner is actually incorrect .
It uses a regular expression matching operator " ! ~ " .
If the previous line was something like " fooz " and the new one is " foo " , then it wo n't get output , even though they are not duplicate lines .
Here is the correct , fixed , one - liner :
awk 'a != $ 0 ; { a = $ 0 }'
It compares lines line - wise and not as a regular expression .
43 . Remove duplicate , nonconsecutive lines .
awk '! a [ $ 0 ] ++'
This one - liner is very idiomatic .
It registers the lines seen in the associative - array " a " ( arrays are always associative in Awk ) and at the same time tests if it had seen the line before .
If it had seen the line before , then a[ line ] > 0 and ! a[ line ] == 0 .
Any expression that evaluates to false is a no- op , and any expression that evals to true is equal to " { print } " .
For example , suppose the input is :
foo bar foo baz
When Awk sees the first " foo " , it evaluates the expression " ! a [ " foo " ] ++ " .
" a [ " foo " ] " is false , but " ! a [ " foo " ] " is true - Awk prints out " foo " .
Then it increments " a [ " foo " ] " by one with " ++ " post - increment operator .
Array " a " now contains one value " a [ " foo " ] == 1 " .
Next
Awk sees " bar " , it does exactly the same what it did to " foo " and prints out " bar " .
Array " a " now contains two values " a [ " foo " ] == 1 " and " a [ " bar " ] == 1 " .
Now Awk sees the second " foo " .
This time " a [ " foo " ] " is true , " ! a [ " foo " ] " is false and Awk does not print anything !
Array " a " still contains two values " a [ " foo " ] == 2 " and " a [ " bar " ] == 1 " .
Finally
Awk sees " baz " and prints it out because " ! a [ " baz " ] " is true .
Array " a " now contains three values " a [ " foo " ] == 2 " and " a [ " bar " ] == 1 " and " a [ " baz " ] == 1 " .
The output :
foo bar baz
Here is another one - liner to do the same .
Eric in his one - liners says it 's the most efficient way to do it .
awk '! ( $ 0 in a ) { a [ $ 0 ] ; print }'
It 's basically the same as previous one , except that it uses the ' in ' operator .
Given an array " a " , an expression " foo in a " tests if variable " foo " is in " a " .
Note that an empty statement " a [ $ 0 ] " creates an element in the array .
44 . Concatenate every 5 lines of input with a comma .
awk ' ORS=NR%5 ? " , " : "
" '
We saw the ORS variable in part one of the article .
This variable gets appended after every line that gets output .
In this one - liner it gets changed on every 5th line from a comma to a newline .
For lines 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 it's a comma , for line 5 it 's a newline , for lines 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 it 's a comma , for line 10 a newline , etc .

Yesterday , EFF filed petitions ( 1 , 2 ) with the Copyright Office seeking DMCA exemptions for three categories of activities that do not violate copyright laws , but that are still jeopardized by the DMCA 's ban on bypassing technical protection measures used to control access to copyrighted works ( i.e , DRM ) .
The three exemptions are for :
Noncommercial video creators ( like YouTubers and vidders ) who rip DVDs in order to use clips for fair use remixes ;
Cell phone owners who want to unlock their phones to use them on cellular networks of their choosing ;
Cell phone owners who want to " jailbreak " their phones in order to use applications of their choosing ( e.g. , iPhone owners who want apps from sources other than the iTunes App Store ) .
The exemption for remix video creators is necessary to protect fair use in a digital world where visual literacy ( what Larry Lessig calls RW culture ) is increasingly important .
Today , if you rip a DVD , the MPAA takes the position that you 've broken the law , even if you are making a video that comments on the latent racism in Disney films or the sexualized violence in 300 .
This is what free speech looks like in the 21st century , and a DMCA exemption is necessary if we want to avoid driving millions of amateur creators into the copyright underground .
The cell phone exemptions ( unlocking and jailbreaking ) are necessary to protect your " freedom to tinker " with products you own .
Cellular carriers lock their phones not to protect their copyrights , but rather to discourage customers from switching carriers .
This is not only anti-competitive , but puts millions of used cell phones into landfills each year .
More recently , cell phone makers have started locking phones to a single source for applications -- which is why more than 350,000 iPhone owners have " jailbroken " their iPhones in order to get the apps they want , instead of just the ones Apple is willing to let them have .
Others are seeking exemptions for computer security researchers who want to investigate DRM on videogames ( SecuROM , we 're looking at you ) ; documentarians , film professors , and media literacy educators who need to take clips from DVD ; and consumers who have been left high and dry by vendors who retired their DRM authentication servers ( e.g. , Walmart , Yahoo , Microsoft ) .
All of the proposals have been posted on the Copyright Office website .
Comments supporting or opposing the proposed exemptions are due by Feb. 2 , 2009 .
Hearings will follow in the Spring , and the Copyright Office will announce its final determinations in October 2009 , as the last set of exemptions expire .

Obama aides are becoming exasperated by the Clinton camp ’s pokey response to demands for former President Bill Clinton ’s finances .
Bill vetting could cost Hillary her Cabinet post
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) is President - elect Barack Obama ’s first choice for secretary of State but his aides are becoming exasperated by the Clinton camp ’s pokey response to demands for extensive information about former President Bill Clinton ’s finances , according to numerous Democrats involved in the process .
“ The sense among the no-drama Obama world is :
This is well on its way to winning best Oscar for drama , ” said one well - connected Democratic official .

There are signs , however , that the Clintons may move decisively to satisfy the vetting requests in coming days , clearing the way for a “ Team of Rivals ” Cabinet that would bring the president - elect ’s opponent for the Democratic nomination into his historic administration .
Democratic officials make it sound as if the job has been all but offered to Hillary Clinton .
But the ball is in her court to show that the former president ’s many foreign and financial entanglements would not pose huge conflicts of interest if she were the nation ’s chief diplomat , the officials said .
Obama is n’t likely to formally offer the post to Clinton unless he ’s given assurances that Bill Clinton ’s global charitable foundation wo n’t create future conflicts of interest with foreign governments , according to a person familiar with the situation .
The Clinton Global Initiative has earned widespread plaudits for its efforts to eradicate AIDS , malaria and poverty in Africa .
But it could prove problematic for Obama if the former president continues to arrange donations from foreign countries at the same time that his wife , as secretary of state , is asking them for diplomatic concessions .
The Clinton Global Initiative , which has raised more than $ 30 billion since 2005 , has matched several foreign governments with projects , including a $ 1 billion pledge from Norway in 2007 .
Obama ’s vetting team expressed similar worries about Bill Clinton ’s overseas fundraising when Hillary Clinton was briefly considered for the vice - presidency , former Clinton aides say . ”
" I doubt that they are looking for an excuse to pick someone else , ” a neutral Democratic official said , “ but rather are genuinely concerned that Bill Clinton ’s work , while worthy , would be greatly complicating if she were SecState . "
Over the weekend , Obama advisers began to get a little scratchy about the Clintons ’ response to vetting requests .
“ The ball is very much in her court , but the president 's finances have been a major point of sensitivity from Day One , ” the well - connected Democratic official explained .
“ Given that everyone 's mystified by how deliberately public the Clintons have made this once - secret process , the assumption is either that the Clintons are trying to use the public buzz to steamroll their way in , create a sense of inevitability that overcomes those concerns , or that it 's just a matter of time before they … satisfy vetting somehow , some way .
Otherwise , after all this speculation , there ’ll be a permanent dark cloud hanging over his finances . ”
The former president was in Rotterdam , the Netherlands , and Kuwait City over the past four days and returned to the United States on Monday morning .
Friends outside government said it seems reasonable for a couple to want to talk about a life decision over the kitchen table rather than over a crackly cell connection 10 time zones away .
In Kuwait , the former president sure sounded like a man who wanted the job for his wife , so he might be expected to do what is necessary for her to earn Obama ’s nod .
AFP quoted the former president as saying at an economic conference sponsored by the National Bank of Kuwait : “ If he decided to ask her and they did it together , I think she 'll be really great as a secretary of state . …
She worked very hard for his election after the primary fight with him , and so did I , and we were very glad that he won and we have a lot of confidence that he can do a good job .
But she did n't do what she did with the hope or expectation of getting any kind of job offer , much less having this discussed . ”

Khalil Semhat insisted he had not used fertilizer to produce his potato
A farmer in southern Lebanon has dug up what might be the heaviest potato in the world .
" This giant weighs 11.3 kilos ( 24.9 pounds ) , " Khalil Semhat told the AFP news agency at his farm near Tyre , 85 kilometres ( 50 miles ) south of Beirut .
" I 've been working the land since I was a boy , and it 's the first time I 've seen anything like it . "
Mr Semhat , 56 , said he had to ask for help from a friend to get the huge vegetable out of the ground .
He insisted that he had used no fertilizer or other chemicals to produce it .
Mr Semhat said he hoped his potato will be recognised as the heaviest potato in the world .
The current world record , as recorded in the Guinness Book of Records , is held by K Sloan of the Isle of Man for a potato weighing a mere 3.5 kg ( 7 lb 13 oz ) .
2008 is the International Year of the Potato , a project sponsored by the United Nations which aims to focus attention on the importance of the vegetable in providing food security and alleviating poverty .
The Future of LRC

In his 1975 film Love and Death , Woody Allen plays a conscript in the Tsar ’s army , which is desperately fighting against the vastly superior forces of Napoleon .
In one scene , Woody and a fellow soldier peer down on the horrors of the battlefield : dense smoke and the hideous cries of man and animal ; French and Russian bodies , some still alive ; twisted canons and carriages ; desolation and despair .
Woody ’s friend , with broken voice , wails , " God is testing us . "
Woody , unflappable and whiney , responds , " Could n’t He have made it a written ? "
2008 has been that sort of year : economic crash , wars , threats of wars , mad dollar printing , police state tactics , bailouts of the power elite , growth of the malignant DC , not to speak of all the blabbing criminal politicians .
Then there was the shining light of Ron Paul .
Ron called forth millions of Americans and citizens of other countries too , young and old , from all walks of life , who cared about sound money , personal freedom , economic freedom , and peace .
He rallied them , energized them , educated them , and inspired them .
He built the future .
LewRockwell.com could have stood aside .
We could have kept our tax - exempt status .
But Lew and I felt that would be deeply wrong .
So we threw ourselves into the fight , and neither of us regrets a minute of it .
Of course , we were smeared along with Ron — by the minions of oil plutocrats , by the tools of neocon billionaires , and by statists of all stripes .
But if that was the price we had to pay for speaking the truth , so be it .
Neocon David Horowitz even said LRC was “ in bed with terrorists ” for opposing perpetual war in the Middle East .
But as Lew pointed out , “ if we were ineffective , they ’d ignore us . ”
Ron Paul , as you know , has taken the libertarian movement to levels never seen before , and kept it focused on Austrian economics , honest money , and non-intervention .
That bothers not only the establishment Republicans and Democrats , but also the " libertarians " who shill for the Federal Reserve , the Pentagon , and the rest of the regime .
I say : Good .
It is important that people reveal their true colors .
Ron , as he is the first to say , could not have done it alone .
He had the foundation that Murray Rothbard , Lew Rockwell , and LRC writers helped build .
It ’s called the " division of labor . "
LRC helped prepare the kindling for the fire of freedom .
Ron is the leader who lit it at just the right time , and fanned it into a mighty bonfire .
No , I have n’t forgotten your role .
The most important part of this message is coming up .
Because contributions to LRC are no longer tax - deductible , we got clobbered .
We took on advertising , which has helped close the gap , but there ’s still a gap , especially with the podcasts ( a runaway success ) , and our increased traffic .
LRC is the most powerful beacon of liberty on the Internet , and the Internet is the most important communications medium in history .
While on the subject of the podcasts , please , please , do n’t tell Lew how good he is as an interviewer .
Sure , he gets great guests , but Lew draws the best from them .
( If Lew ever does find out how good he is , we may lose him to " Meet the Press . " )
Only kidding , fellas .
In the early days of LRC , readers approached our site as they would an oasis .
They came to be refreshed , energized , and informed .
Today , you had better show up at LRC every day .
Your life and freedom depend upon it .
Fascism roams the District of Parasites .
The Fed has plunged us into an economic cataclysm .
The conservative neocons have combined with the liberal neocons ( and even the DC “ libertarians ” ) to cheer the regime and its new Duce .
And they all agree on the importance of silencing LRC .
They know our reach .
They know we change minds , and create activists .
That is why they want to shut us up , and do not hesitate to use the basest tactics in their campaign of fear and hate .
We will not be silenced .
All over America and the world , millions are clamoring for the unvarnished truth about the economic crisis , the imperial crisis , the state crisis .
We will answer the call with principle , passion , and intelligence , if you make it possible .
We will serve all those hungry for the truth in this age of lies .
We will not let the Capitol Hill gang of thieves toast our demise .
We will expose the warmongers , torturers , spies , and inflationists , the liars and the crooks .
Yes , we have our work cut out for us , but we would be voiceless without your help , ( you did n’t think I ’d forget you , didja ? ) .
For almost 11 years , Lew Rockwell and his magnificent writers have battled the bad guys .
Now is not the time to hesitate , stumble , or fade .
If freedom is to survive , we must teach the truth , clearly and fearlessly .
Please , help LRC fight on in 2009 , harder , more widely , more effectively .
Your descendants will bless you for it , and so will all who love liberty .
And so will I .
In February , I celebrate my 80th birthday .
It ’s bad taste to announce your own birthday and make it sound as if you ’re fishing for gifts .
Well , I am guilty of bad taste and your financial support for LRC would be the best birthday gift ever .
These are really tough times , and things may not get better soon .
But how much more important , then , is this work ?
LRC deserves your support even more .
We will make you proud of our efforts .
Do not let the torch be extinguished ; it must blaze higher and brighter .
Please help .
And , remember , there is a bonus .
You will have made this 80 - year - old a very happy man .
The Best of Burton S. Blumert
Odd timing , but in the last couple of days , two Friends of Unfair Park have inquired about the for - sale sign in front of the Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre on Buckner .
Yes , it 's for sale -- has been since 2006 , matter of fact , says Perry Jones of J&B Commercial , who 's repping the 1940s manse .
He tells Unfair Park this morning the property 's " been under contract a couple of times " -- once , with a developer who'd hoped to scrape the property and rebuild -- but that would - be buyers have backed off for various reasons .
" We 've had a lot of tire - kickers , obviously , " he says , referring to folks just curious about touring the facility .
" But with the market changing , it 's been tough .
And now , we 're hoping to sell it to someone who will potentially remodel it . "

As for the reason behind the sale , the Scientologists had hoped to move into its new digs in Las Colinas in 2006 ; now , " we plan to be moved at the end of February , " says the woman who answered the phone at the center this morning .
" There 's lots of expansion happening , " she says .
And to what does she attribute that ?

Print collections are known elsewhere but the scale here is impressive Scientists have identified an amazing collection of dinosaur footprints on the Arizona - Utah border in the US .
There are so many prints - more than 1,000 - that geologists have dubbed the site " a dinosaur dance floor " .
Located within the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument , the marks were long thought simply to be potholes gouged out of the rock by years of erosion .
A paper describing the 190 - million - year - old footprints is published in the palaeontology journal Palaios .
" Get out there and try stepping in their footsteps , and you feel like you are playing the game ' Dance Dance Revolution ' that teenagers dance on , " says Professor Marjorie Chan from the University of Utah .
" This kind of reminded me of that - a dinosaur dance floor - because there are so many tracks and a variety of different tracks . "
" There must have been more than one kind of dinosaur there , " she adds .
" It was a place that attracted a crowd , kind of like a dance floor . "
Dinosaur tail marks are rare .
The diagram better illustrates the drag movement
The site covers about a third of a hectare and records dinosaur movements around what was probably a watering hole during the Early Jurassic Period , when the US south - west was covered with a field of sand dunes larger than the Sahara Desert .
The prints will eventually erode away Investigation of the site reveals at least four dinosaur species were present , with the animals ranging from adults to youngsters .
" The different size tracks [ 2.5 - 50 cm ] may tell us that we are seeing mothers walking around with babies , " says Winston Seiler , who worked on the project .
As well as footprints , the site also records tail - drag marks - which are up to seven metres in length .
The scientists say the dinosaur prints were locked into sandstone after being covered by shifting dunes .
They became exposed through erosion and will eventually disappear through erosion , too .

What are these ?
( PhysOrg.com ) --
You do n't have to look far these days to find examples of corporate scandals involving fraud .
But Judi McLean Parks , the Reuben C. and Anne Carpenter Taylor Professor of Organizational Behavior at Olin Business School at Washington University in St. Louis , wanted to find out what actually motivates people to " cook the books . "
McLean Parks and co-author James W. Hesford had a hunch that compensation packages had something to do with the rising tide in fraud , estimated to total $ 994 billion annually in the U.S.
Specifically , they suspected the type of compensation plans — contingent versus non-contingent — ( and the form of that contingency , as a bonus or penalty based on performance ) , might be related to fraudulent reporting and the misappropriation of assets .
To test their hypothesis , McLean Parks and Hesford conducted a controlled laboratory study using a random sample of students who were paid for solving anagrams according to one of three different compensation plans , although in all cases the expected value of the compensation — regardless of the form of the compensation — was identical .
The students self - scored their work and in half of the cases signed a statement attesting to the veracity of their reported results .
• Participants receiving a ' flat salary ' for their work were the most honest about reporting their scores .
• Many participants who received a performance based bonus cheated when reporting their results .
• Participants who were penalized based on low performance not only cheated but also stole the nice pens that were to be returned at the end of the study !
Professor McLean
Parks sums up the most obvious results of the study this way , " if you pay someone contingent on their performance , you have motivated them to perform .
However , if they are unable to perform well because the task is hard , because of economic conditions or whatever , you have also given them an incentive to cook the books ! "
McLean Parks believes the study 's results have implications for CEO compensation plans and the financial difficulties many companies are experiencing today .
" All I have to do is look at Enron , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac to know that this does happen .
And now we 've demonstrated the causal link to contingent pay . "
Fraud uncovered at Fannie Mae alone from 1998 - 2004 has been estimated to be in excess of $ 10.6 billion .
" For years we have touted the basic mantra of pay for performance because that 's the way you get the best performance , " observes McLean Parks .
" Maybe you get the best performance reported , but what 's the underlying performance ? "
The study suggests that incentives like pay based on performance may not be the foil for unethical behavior they were created to be .
In fact , the authors conclude that , " the use of contingent contracts … may be short sighted in that such contingencies may encourage behaviors such that the cure itself may be worse than the disease . "
Study results are reported in a paper currently under review and titled : Give & Take : Incentive Framing in Compensation Contract , by James W. Hesford , Cornell University and Judi McLean Parks , Olin Business School , Washington University in St Louis .

Open Ponds
The cheapest and quickest way to grow algae is also the riskiest .
The shallow pools get great sun exposure and have little overhead costs , but they leave algae vulnerable to temperature changes , animals , and competing algae strains .
HR BioPetroleum sidesteps these risks by growing algae strains first in sterile , transparent outdoor tubes before transferring them to open saltwater ponds for a day or two -- long enough to flourish and produce plenty of oil but not long enough to be contaminated .
HRBP thinks its method is the only way to mass - produce algae oil at a reasonable cost , and Shell agrees .
The oil company partnered with HRBP last December to begin construction on a pilot facility on the Kona coast of Hawaii .
HRBP thinks it can scale up production to open a commercial facility capable of making more than one million gallons of oil a year as early as 2011 .
This week the FDA will decide whether to recommend approval of the second generation female condom .
You can sign on to a letter in support of approval .
Here is a time sensitive opportunity
for individuals and organizations to take action in support of HIV prevention !
This week the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) advisory committee
on Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices will decide whether to recommend
approval of the FC2 , the second generation of the Female Health Company ’s
female condom .
The Center
for Health and Gender Equity
( CHANGE ) , on behalf of the AIDS
Foundation of Chicago
and the National
Women ’s Health Network ,
is circulating a
letter for organizations to sign
that urges the FDA to consider the importance of female condoms when
deliberating the approval of the FC2 .
Individuals are also encouraged
to sign - on in support of this effort ( click
here ) .
The female condom is a proven HIV and pregnancy prevention
method that can be inserted independently and well in advance of intercourse .
As Lauren Sisson points out in her article Female
Condoms : Freedom Does n’t Come Free ,
the lack of access to and availability of female condoms has nothing
to do with their effectiveness and everything to do with a lack of investment .
Female condoms can reduce the rate of HIV transmission among women having
sex with an infected partner by more than 90 percent and studies show
that effective promotion and programming of the female condom results
in a significant increase in the total number of protected sex acts
between partners .
Misconceptions
and biases against the female condom
have delayed international investment and , as a result , there is a high
cost - per - unit price .
National governments , bilateral aid agencies ,
and international donors could drive down the price of the female condom
by making bulk purchases , as they have done with virtually every reproductive
and sexual health technology , including male condoms .
The FC2 has been approved by
the World Health Organization and the United Nations Population Fund
for distribution by HIV / AIDS and family planning organizations .
FDA
approval would enable USAID to purchase larger quantities of female
condoms and distribute them to non-governmental agencies providing services
to the millions of women living in nations with high HIV / AIDS infection
rates .

this issue and CHANGE visit

Again , individuals are encouraged to sign - on in support of this effort

from organizations wishing to sign on to the letter are asked to email
Jessica Terlikowski at [ email protected ] no later than 5:00 pm Central Time on Wednesday , December 10 to endorse the letter .

President - elect Barack Obama , left , and Sen. Hillary Clinton , greet supporters at the end of a rally in Orlando , Fla .
Cabinet post for Clinton roils Obamaland
Barack Obama 's serious flirtation with his one - time rival , Hillary Clinton , over the post of secretary of State has been welcomed by everyone from Henry Kissinger to Bill Clinton as an effective , grand gesture by the president - elect .
It 's not playing quite as well , however , in some precincts of Obamaland .
From his supporters on the progressive wing of the Democratic Party , to campaign aides of the soon - to - be commander - in - chief , there 's a sense of ambivalence about giving a top political plum to a woman they spent 18 months hammering as the compromised standard - bearer of an era that deserves to be forgotten .
Advertisement
" These are people who believe in this stuff more than Barack himself does , " said a Democrat close to Obama 's campaign .
" These guys did n't put together a campaign in order to turn the government over to the Clintons . "
An overlooked theme in Obama 's primary victory was his belief that the Clinton legacy was not , as the Clintons imagined , a pure political positive .
The Obama campaign had no compunctions about poking holes in that legacy and even sent out mailings stressing the downside of the last " 8 years of the Clintons " – enraging the former president in particular .
And the clearest opposition to the Clinton appointment comes from Obama 's backers on the left of his own party , whose initial support for him was motivated in part by a distaste for the Clinton dynasty , and who now view her reemergence with some dismay .
" There 's always a risk of a Cabinet member freelancing and that risk is enhanced by the fact that Hillary has her own public and her own celebrity and that she comes attached to Bill , " said Robert Kuttner , a Clinton critic and co-editor of the American Prospect whose new book , Obama 's Challenge , implores the president - elect to adopt an expansive liberal agenda .
" The other question is the old rule – never hire somebody you can't fire .
What happens if her views and his views do n't mesh ? "
" The silver lining , for those of us who are skeptical , is that it drastically limits the number of other Clinton administration alums that he can appoint , and that 's a blessing , " Kuttner said .
Kuttner hastened to add that Clinton is " very smart " and capable , and that her appointment would be " greeted very well worldwide .
And other Democratic foreign policy thinkers who are eager to work in , or with , the Obama administration declined to comment on the record , though they noted that foreign policy was an area that marked some of the deepest disagreements between Clinton and Obama .
Some key Obama - Clinton differences :
Whether to meet face - to - face with leaders of hostile regimes ( he was more open to the idea than she was ) and her vote to authorize the war in Iraq .
" The specific policy area at issue seems to be one in which the two of them are n't all that well - aligned , " wrote the liberal blogger Matthew Yglesias .
On Capitol Hill , however , even some of the left ’s most normally unshrinking violets publicly backed a plan that appears to be almost a fait accompli .
" Sen . Clinton is one of the brightest people in Congress and she would be an excellent choice , " Vermont 's independent senator , Bernie Sanders , told Politico through a spokesman .
Inside the campaign , a prominent Democrat said , Obama 's decision was also greeted with ambivalence – though his aides have , as usual , moved into a united front in public on the topic .
During the primary , top aides like David Plouffe and Robert Gibbs developed a particular distaste for all things Clinton , one that filtered down through the campaign .
So the transition from viewing Hillary Clinton
as a relic of a drama - filled Democratic past to the top choice to run the foreign policy of an Obama administration has been difficult for some campaign veterans , to say the least .
The wisdom of an Obama / Clinton team of rivals seems to be viewed with even more skepticism by the campaign ’s rank and file .
One Obama insider said that while Obama 's senior staff has come around to acknowledging the power of a Clinton choice , supporters have not .
" During the campaign there was a lot of agreement and correspondence about how the grassroots felt about the Clintons and how the Obama leadership felt , " he said .
" There 's a bit of a divergence now .
They 're confused that the guy they elected . . . because we need to go in a different direction on the world stage " might choose a secretary of state with whom he had some of his sharpest foreign policy disagreements during the primary campaign .
Obama 's blog network on My.BarackObama.com has been buzzing with both sides of the argument since hints emerged last week of a surprise Clinton choice .
A representative heading : " no hillary for secretary of state why ?? ? "
More common inside Obama 's circle is a grasp of the effective politics , and a sense that she'd be good at the job – though that somewhat grudging acknowledgment does n't extend to a particularly warm
embrace of the defeated primary candidate .
" I can't stand her – but I think she 's a great choice , " said another Obama insider .
Clinton seems poised to take the job , as both sides have steadily shared with reporters the details of an unusually – for Obama – public process .
Democrats on both sides said that the remaining obstacle is
working out the details of an arrangement that would allow the former president to maintain a public role while ending his dealings with foreign governments and his foundation 's financial transactions with
public and private foreign policy players .
Members of Clinton 's circle say they 've felt little resistance from Obama 's aides as the two sides work out the details of what could one of the great political deals of the century , if something short of a
love affair .
" They are being very matter of fact about removing the obstacles , " said a Democrat close to Clinton .
" The attitude is , ' Our boss wants us to work this out , so lets work it out . ' "
A former Clinton aide said Clinton appears likely to accept the job if the details of her husband 's future can be resolved , and that the discussions of how exactly to restructure Bill Clinton 's charitable ventures does n't appear to pose a substantial obstacle , though another Democrat said she 's said Clinton is personally " conflicted . "
One person who apparently has shown no ambivalence : Obama .
" It 's not like he hedged his bets in conversation with her , " said a person involved in the process .
While both sides say the situation
remains fluid , this person said Obama was quite direct : " He offered her the job . "
With a little work and the help of an undocumented feature in Apple 's iPhone Software Developers Kit , one iPhone developer was able to turn its game into a version suited for playback on big- screen TVs .
After discovering the hidden MPTVOutWindow class in the iPhone SDK last month , ArsTechnica 's Erica Sadun got in touch with Freeverse , makers of Moto Chaser , and encouraged them to experiment with the APIs .
A few hours later , the TV version of the iPhone game was born ( video below ) .
Though largely demonstrative , the game uses the iPhone 's accelerometer for input and steering while routing the game 's video through a video - out cable to the TV .
Freeverse noted that the program ran best on the second - generation iPod touch , which includes a 532MHz processor compared to the iPhone and iPhone 3 G's 412MHz chip .
Even so , Moto Chaser maxed out at around 20 frames per second , making it " nearly playable , " according Freeverse , whose producer Bruce Morrison noted that the " norm for commercial games is 30 fps , a point at which motion becomes as smooth and watchable as normal TV video . "
Sound quality , however , was said to be greatly improved when pumped through a respectable sound system .
" When Morrison approached senior programmer Mark Levin , he had basically one set of instructions .
' Make it work before lunch . ' , "
Ars reported .
" Freeverse had very little time to allocate to putting together the demo .
In the end , the entire development effort took about three hours . "

Nearly all hospitals are failing to meet hygiene and cleanliness standards set by the government to prevent superbug outbreaks , inspectors say today .
Most of the breaches are not serious , but the Healthcare Commission warns that only consistent and comprehensive controls in all NHS trusts will ensure that infection rates for MRSA , Clostridium difficile and other hospital - acquired infections continue to fall .
" At nearly all trusts we have found gaps that need closing , " said Anna Walker , the commission 's chief executive .
" It is important to be clear that at these trusts we are not talking about the most serious kind of breaches .
But these are important warning signs to trust boards that there may be a weakness in their systems . "
At three out of the 51 trusts ( around a third of the total ) where unannounced spot checks took place , inspectors found serious breaches of the government 's hygiene code .
Bromley Hospitals NHS trust , Ipswich Hospitals NHS trust and Ashford and St Peter 's NHS trust were all issued with improvement notices which require urgent action to safeguard patients .
More than half of all the trusts were failing to keep all areas clean and well - maintained .
One in five trusts did not properly comply with the rules on decontamination of instruments and other equipment used with patients .
One in eight did not have adequate isolation facilities for patients who have picked up infections , which is extremely important for preventing the spread between patients on wards .
However , the commission said it was encouraged by the positive steps many trusts had taken to remedy the breaches it had identified .
Out of the 51 trusts , only five had a completely clean bill of health .
These were Barking , Havering and Redbridge Hospitals NHS trust , Kingston Hospital NHS trust , Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS trust , St George 's Healthcare NHS trust and St Helen 's and Knowsley Hospitals NHS trust .
Walker said that generally , trusts were paying close attention to infection prevention and control and their efforts appeared to be bringing rates down .
But the commission wants to see compliance with the hygiene code all of the time and for every patient .
" It is the consistent application of these systems that will ensure infection rates continue to drop .
These issues are a top priority for the public .
We make no apologies for demanding high standards .
We have been asked by the government to help maintain the concentration on these issues and we intend to do just that . "
The commission is warning trusts that they must comply before they can register with the new Care Quality Commission , which begins work next April and will be able to impose conditions on trusts and levy fines if they fail .
Health minister Ann Keen said any breach of the code was unacceptable and trusts must take immediate action .
WASHINGTON , Dec. 11 ( UPI ) -- Former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other officials " redefined the law " to allow the use of torture , a report released Thursday said .
The report followed a two - year investigation by Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , and Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . , The Washington Post reported .

" The abuse of detainees in U.S. custody cannot simply be attributed to the actions of ' a few bad apples ' acting on their own , " the report concludes .
" The fact is that senior officials in the United States government solicited information on how to use aggressive techniques , redefined the law to create the appearance of their legality , and authorized their use against detainees . "
The Bush administration has suggested that the use of techniques like sleep deprivation , stress positions and dogs came from a bottom - up request from interrogators who said tougher methods were needed for al - Qaida and Taliban fighters .
But the report concluded that the use of torture was a top - down initiative , originating with a February 2007 memo from President George W. Bush that said the Geneva Convention did not apply to non-government fighters .
TONY Blair could face the prospect of an International Criminal Court investigation for alleged coalition war crimes in Iraq .
The court 's chief prosecutor said at the weekend that he would be willing to launch an inquiry and could envisage a scenario in which the British Prime Minister and US President George Bush could one day face charges at The Hague .
Luis Moreno - Ocampo urged Arab countries , particularly Iraq , to sign up to the court to enable allegations against the West to be pursued .
Iraq 's ambassador to the United Nations said that his country was actively considering signing up .
Pictured : The Britons held in Thailand child sex swoop
Two British men arrested as part of a child sex abuse investigation were today paraded before cameras by Thailand police .
Londoners Malcolm Henry Payne , 59 , and Robert Alexander Horsman, 45 , along with German Fritz Dieter Blattner , 66 , and American Robert Roy Lond , 59 , were held in pre-dawn raids .
Some of the suspects tried to hide their faces during the press conference where police outlined the case against them .
Suspects : ( From right to left ) American Robert Roy Lond , Britons Malcolm Henry Payne , Robert Alexander Horsman and German Fritz Dieter Blattner
Police also laid out a large amount of sexual paraphernalia which they said had been recovered during the raids .
Officers said they had recovered hundreds of photos and videos of abused young boys .
All four men were picked up in the Thai beach resort of Pattaya .
If they are found guilty they could face at least 20 years in jail .
They have been freed on bail to await a court case .
Freed on bail : Fritz Dieter Blattner Robert Alexnadre Horsman leave the press conference
The operation was launched after UK investigators identified an online paedophile network .
Today 's arrests were a joint operation between the UK's Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre ( CEOP ) and the Royal Thai Police .
Officers said CEOP had provided a list of 50 suspected paedophiles who might be hiding in the South - East Asian nation , long regarded as a haven for child sex abusers .
' We are appealing to the victims of these paedophiles to come out so we can press more charges against them , ' chief investigator Police Colonel Suvichpol Imjairat told a news conference .
CEOP chief executive Jim Gamble said the arrests sent a message to European paedophiles who think they can evade capture by travelling to countries where law enforcement is thought to be weaker .
' Britons who travel abroad to abuse children in the belief they can evade justice are a UK problem and we have a duty to protect every child , everywhere , ' he said in a statement .
All four suspects were arrested at the Thai beach resort of Pattaya following a joint police operation between Britain and Thailand
CEOP 's deputy head of operations , Andy Wells , said : ' Working with the Royal Thai Police we have located and identified a number of individuals who are suspected of serious alleged offences against vulnerable children .
' Non -government organisations have been instrumental in helping to build an intelligence picture of the threat that travelling sex offenders pose to children from in the region . '
Pattaya is a popular beach resort about an hour from Thai capital Bangkok .
The operation began when an online network was identified by CEOP internet investigators in the UK .
Links were established with Thailand , prompting the start of a joint operation with their Thai counterparts .
CEOP boss Mr Gamble said : ' This operation and these arrests demonstrate the value of the relationship between CEOP and the Royal Thai Police , a relationship which continues to develop . '
Thailand made headlines last year when police arrested ' swirly - face ' Canadian paedophile Christopher Neil , whose digitally scrambled picture was unravelled from images of abuse found on the internet .
Labour and the Conservatives yesterday vied to associate themselves with Barack Obama 's election as David Cameron argued it represented a triumph for the advocates of change , while Gordon Brown said it was an endorsement for progressive values .
Brown will travel to Washington next weekend for a meeting of world leaders convened by outgoing president George Bush , but Downing Street has downplayed the chances of a bilateral meeting with Obama .
Cameron claimed Obama 's victory undermined Brown 's central attack on him as Tory leader - that he is a novice lacking the experience to be prime minister .
In noisy exchanges in the Commons , Cameron welcomed the election of Obama as a historic moment - just four decades after the ending of segregation - showing that the US is a " beacon of hope , opportunity and change " .
The Tory leader then turned to Brown 's attack on him at the Labour conference , as he added : " I read this morning that the prime minister has sent a message to the president - elect .
Presumably it was n't ' this is no time for a novice ' ? "
Brown hit back : " What I said was that serious times needed serious people .
Once again he 's shown he 's not serious . "
As Labour MPs roared their approval Cameron looked over Brown 's head and said to the government benches : " You have made your strategic choice .
It 's called more of the same and it 's sitting in front of you .
You killed change when you bottled that election and you buried change when you appointed Peter Mandelson . "
The exchanges in the Commons showed how Obama 's historic success will have a major impact on British politics .
Cameron , who has been privately excited by the prospect of an Obama victory , believes that it neutralises Brown 's attack on him as a novice .
Brown slapped down younger rivals , both inside and outside the Labour party , at his conference speech in Manchester in September when he said : " This is no time for a novice . "
The Tory leader confronted Brown a week later , in his own conference speech , when he said it was judgment - not experience - that mattered in a leader .
" We could not have written a more perfect script to illustrate that point after the election of a man who has only been in the US senate for four years , " one Tory said .
Brown believes Obama 's success will make it easier for progressive politicians to secure change .
" Barack Obama is so obviously a really serious man who would never indulge in the sort of theatrics Cameron displays at prime minister 's questions , " one Labour figure said .
They also pointed out that the Conservatives had invited McCain to their party conference only two years ago .
Brown made it clear that he will use Obama 's platform - to reverse the economic legacy of President Bush - when Cameron tried to exploit Obama 's success to claim people want change in difficult economic times .
Brown said : " The reason why the American people voted for change is that ... they want progressive policies . "
President - elect Barack Obama suggested he would package much of his campaign spending proposals as economic stimulus and try to push them quickly through Congress to combat a deepening downturn .
" Not only do I want the stimulus package to deal with the immediate crisis , I want it also to lay the groundwork for long - term sustained economic growth , " Mr. Obama said Monday at a press conference in Chicago to introduce his economic team .
" With our economy in distress , we can not hesitate and we cannot delay . "

The LA Weekly has a feature up about a new book with portraits of very serious Norwegian Black Metal dudes .
In True Norwegian Black Metal , photographer Peter Beste captures the " blackest of the black : apolitical and anti-Christian separatist self - preservationists who'd sooner make a lampshade out of their own skin than to try to convert fans . "
Snip from Siran Babayan 's piece :
Take , for example , Immortal singer - bassist Abbath strolling through the woods surrounded by moss - covered emerald trees ( " That 's essentially his backyard " ) , or Gorgoroth singer Gaahl standing in front of a snow - capped log cabin .
Every turn of the page is a moving postcard of brooks , lakes and forrests .
Which begs the question :
With all the serenity and breathtaking views , what 's to rebel against ?
Apparently , Mother Nature makes mean Vikings out of little boys .
If Black Sabbath were a product of bleak , industrial Birmingham , it should be no surprise that music this extreme thrives in a country with such high precipitation and so many months of either uninterrupted daylight or darkness .
So do n't let the scenery fool you .
These are some disturbed and disturbing fuckers , whether it 's guitarist Ymon of Perished with his arms covered in branding marks , or Nattefrost of Carpathian Forest smoking heroin off tin foil or a nude female model being painted in cow 's blood before she 's about to be hung from a cross for a Gorgoroth show in Krakow .
Nearly everyone is wearing a scowl , corpse paint and spikes .
And Beste 's grossest moment has him shooting Nattefrost smeared in his own shit .
Of all the bands featured , Beste focuses on the Tolkien - inspired Gorgoroth and its lead troublemaker Gaahl , who 's been arrested twice for alleged assault and torture , and whose face , with its sunken cheeks , looks even creepier without makeup .
And that Krakow gig in 2004 not only included human crucifixes but sheep heads mounted on sticks .
( Dude , one photo of decapitated sheep heads would 've been enough . )

" Thank God " Palin is n't prez on Day One , Lieberman says
Joe Lieberman , who prepped Sarah Palin on foreign policy , was asked by the Stamford Advocate what he thought of the prospect of the Alaska governor actually becoming president .
" [ T ] hank God she 's not going to have to be president from Day One.
McCain 's going to be alive and well , " he said .
Not exactly " she 's ready from Day One . "
Later in the article , he adds : " Let 's hope she never has to be ready because we hope McCain is elected and live out his term , " Lieberman said .
" But if , God forbid , an accident occurs or something of that kind , she 'll be ready .
She 's had executive experience .
She 's smart .
And she will have had on - the - job training . "
Then in he throws in an olive branch of sorts to Dems , who are plotting revenge against him for defecting .
" I 'm working my heart out for John McCain to be elected our next president , " Lieberman said .
" But for whatever reason he is not , I 'm going to do everything I can to be bringing people together across party lines to support the new president so he can succeed .
What 's at stake for our country is just too serious . "

The government on Sunday approved Defense Minister Ehud Barak 's demand to operate a national economy emergency system in the Gaza vicinity communities and draft about 6,700 Israel Defense Forces reserve soldiers .
The reservists will be called up ahead of the possibility of expanding the military operation in the Gaza Strip , subject to the approval of the Knesset 's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee .
A national economy emergency system was not operated during the Second Lebanon War .

Barak asked the government to approve the call up of thousands of reserve soldiers ahead of an expansion of the military operation in the Gaza Strip .
The defense minister told the cabinet that the reserve forces would only be used for the reinforcement of a ground operation , if and when it should take place .
" Ahead of the continuance of planned operational activity , we need to draft some 7,000 reserve soldiers with emergency orders , " Barak said .
The IDF has recruited some 2,000 reservists so far , in additional to the regular units sent to the Gaza border .
The army has also begun mobilizing tanks and reinforcement infantry troops to the Gaza region in the event a ground incursion is ordered .
In an interview with the British SKY network , the defense minister said that ground forces would indeed enter the Strip if the move was deemed necessary by Jerusalem .
Barak did not declare outright that there would be a ground offensive , but said that he could not presume to guess what Hamas ' next move would be and therefore was preparing the military for any contingency .
According to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , " This will be a long and difficult war which will be very painful .
The expectation that we will be able to hit hundreds of terrorists a day cannot be realized . "
The prime minister added that " Israel will need a lot of patience and stamina in the home front .
The most important thing is not to involve politics in this process .
We must not involve arguments and propaganda .
The State of Israel must remain united in its war on terror .
That 's what we need in order to succeed . "
Olmert said at the start of the meeting that " the State of Israel has launched a military operation in order to restore a state of calm for the south 's residents , who have been suffering unrest and a disruption to their lives , which have prevented them from leading a normal and peaceful life which any person deserves and needs . "
According to the prime minister , " This is not a simple situation , but we will deal with it with careful consideration , patiently and firmly in order to reach the desired results . "
Addressing the situation in the home front , Olmert said , " While the army units are in a conflict with the enemy , the home front has become the target of attacks in recent years , in a way which overclouds the lives of hundreds of thousands of people .
" The patience , determination and stamina of the people in the home front will eventually determine our ability to complete the mission as has been determined by us and as we believe should be reached . "
According to Olmert , " the government invested many resources in handling the home front over the past few years .
I would like to take advantage of this situation to ask the cabinet members to exert any efforts in the coming days to provide essential services due to the situation created in the south , which may last longer than expected at this time . "
The prime minister added that he hopes " all offices open call centers for the offices in the south and in the region .
There are many communities beyond the rocket range which have been hit now , and this requires a special preparation by all government offices . "
Barak : IDF to extend operation as needed
The government also approved the special situation in the Gaza vicinity communities .
Shin Bet Chief Yuval Diskin said during the meeting , " The level of shock among Hamas ' leadership is high .
Nonetheless , they view the attack as a first step and are looking for a response .
Hamas will respond and will even try to surprise us . "
Diskin added that " a significant part of the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip is content with the damage caused to Hamas , which has harmed and is harming civilians . "
A senior defense official said in response to ministers ' questions that " we must also prepare for the possibility of a ground operation in Gaza . "
An IDF source said that " the second wave of the jets ' attack yesterday hit dozens of underground launching pads used to fire rockets from Gaza .
We estimate that 50 % of them were damaged .
" This is one of the reasons for today 's weak rocket fire .
This does n't mean that Hamas no longer possesses the ability to launch thousands of missiles , and this ability will be realized later on . "
Defense Minister Barak and IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ahskenazi convened before the cabinet meeting .
Barak said after the briefing , " So far we have reached good results in the operational area .
We must know that it wo n't be short , it wo n’t be easy and we 'll have to face whatever the future holds . "
Before entering the cabinet meeting , Barak said that the Hanukkah vacation would be extended in Gaza vicinity schools .
" We have decided to extend the children 's Hanukkah vacation and they wo n't be returning to school , " said Barak .
He added that " the IDF will deepen and extend the operation as much as needed .
" We are embracing the Gaza vicinity residents from here for their stamina , while declaring a special situation in the home front . "
Science , Culture and Sports Minister Raleb Majadele ( Labor ) informed the Government Secretariat that he would not take part in the weekly cabinet meeting , and called on the government to stop the escalation in the south and on Hamas to stop firing rockets on Israel .
According to the minister , " Extending the operation may lead to the collapse of the diplomatic process with the Palestinians and the Arab world . "
Deputy Prime Minister and Shas Chairman Eli Yishai said in response , " It 's a shame that he did n't boycott the cabinet and Knesset meetings during the eight years when Palestinians fired rockets and mortar shells .
If that 's his opinion , he should not run for Knesset in the upcoming elections . "
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
More than 1 billion people globally suffer from a condition in which the eye ’s lens loses flexibility , blurring objects close by , and half of them do not own eyeglasses to help them see , researchers said on Monday .

In 2005 , an estimated 517 million people with presbyopia -- which is thought to be caused by a stiffening of the eyes ’ lenses or a weakening of muscles that focus the lens -- lacked eyeglasses or had an inadequate pair .
Of the 410 million people whose presbyopia left them unable to perform tasks requiring near vision , 94 percent lived in the developing world , according to researchers from the University of New South Wales , Sydney , Australia .
Extrapolating from U.S. Census data on world populations , researcher Brien Holden and colleagues estimated the number of presbyopia cases globally will grow to 1.8 billion by 2050 , adding to the demand for eyeglasses .
The condition commonly afflicts the elderly .
“ Without intervention to make spectacles more accessible , the global number of individuals who will have a disability associated with uncorrected presbyopia is predicted to grow to 563 million people by 2020 , ” Holden wrote in the Archives of Ophthalmology .
A second study in the journal predicted a jump in the number of U.S. cases of diabetes - related vision loss .
Cases of diabetic retinopathy , in which the disease damages small blood vessels in the retina , will climb to 16 million Americans by 2050 from 5.5 million in 2004 , according to researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta .
Diabetics are also more likely to develop cataracts and glaucoma , the report said .
“ Vision loss related to eye disease among people with diabetes is an important disability that threatens independence and can lead to depression , reduced mobility and reduced quality of life , ” wrote researcher Jinan Saaddine and colleagues .
Google has scrapped its internet advertising partnership with struggling rival Yahoo , abandoning attempts to overcome the objections of anti-trust regulators and customers who believed the alliance would give Google too much power over online commerce .
The retreat announced today represented another setback for Yahoo , which had been counting on the Google deal to boost its annual revenue by $ 800 m ( £ 496 m ) and placate shareholders still incensed by management 's decision to reject a $ 47.5 bn takeover bid from Microsoft six months ago .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Google backed off after the US Justice Department said it would sue to block the Yahoo deal to preserve competition in the internet 's rapidly growing advertising market .
" The arrangement likely would have denied consumers the benefits of competition — lower prices , better service and greater innovation , " said Thomas Barnett , an assistant attorney general who oversees the Justice Department 's anti-trust division .
Without Google 's help ,
Yahoo now may feel more pressure to renew talks with Microsoft and ultimately sell for a price well below the $ 33 per share that Microsoft offered in May .
Yahoo shares traded this morning at just $ 14.05 , gaining 70 cents in a move reflecting investor hopes that Microsoft might renew its pursuit .
Surrendering the chance to sell ads on Yahoo's popular website wo n't be a significant financial blow for Google , which already runs the internet 's largest and most prosperous advertising network .
But the capitulation marks a rare comedown for Google , which had been insisting for more than four months that the internet would be a better place to do business if it were allowed to work with Yahoo .
" We 're of course disappointed that this deal wo n't be moving ahead , " David Drummond , Google 's chief legal officer , wrote on a company blog .
" But we 're not going to let the prospect of a lengthy legal battle distract us from our core mission .
That would be like trying to drive down the road of innovation with the parking brake on . "
Yahoo said it wanted to fight the Justice Department in court , but played down the impact Google 's retreat would have on its turnaround efforts .
" This deal was incremental to Yahoo 's product roadmap and does not change Yahoo's commitment to innovation and growth in search , " the company said in a statement .
" The fundamental building blocks of a stronger Yahoo ... were put in place independent of the agreement . "
Google 's management took a strategic risk by agreeing to the Yahoo partnership in June , knowing the move would increase the government 's scrutiny of Google 's market power .
Even though it is now walking away empty - handed , Google figures to remain in regulators ' sights as it tries to expand .
" For the first time , Google has run into real opposition to its marketplace goals , " said Jeff Chester , executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy , a consumer advocacy group .
" Google is aware that its aggressive moves in the online advertising business are potentially contributing to damaging its brand .
The perception of Google has changed . "
The collapse of the Google - Yahoo alliance shapes up as a potential coup for Microsoft .
Although it has publicly said it's no longer interested in buying Yahoo , Microsoft spent a lot of time and money trying to keep Google and Yahoo from coming together .
The world 's largest software maker provided evidence that helped persuade regulators the partnership would diminish competition .
Microsoft also helped orchestrate the campaign that prompted major advertisers to lodge formal complaints against the proposed partnership .
The Justice Department signalled it was considering a legal challenge to the deal in September when it hired veteran antitrust lawyer Sanford Litvack to review the case .
The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Google and Yahoo had proposed restrictions on the deal — capping the amount of search ads Yahoo could outsource to Google — in a late bid to win favour .
Google 's statement today indicated the idea was not successful .
" After four months of review , including discussions of various possible changes to the agreement , it 's clear that government regulators and some advertisers continue to have concerns about the agreement , " Drummond wrote .
" Pressing ahead risked not only a protracted legal battle but also damage to relationships with valued partners .
That would n't have been in the long term interests of Google or our users , so we have decided to end the agreement . "
Now that Google is out of the picture , Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang will have to come up with another way to accelerate his company 's revenue growth and boost a stock price that has lost more than half its value since he became chief executive in June 2007 .
If nothing else , Yang appears to have a bigger incentive to join forces with another tarnished internet star , AOL .
Yahoo has been discussing a possible acquisition with AOL 's corporate parent , Time Warner , for months .
Google also owns a 5 percent stake in AOL .
But many Yahoo shareholders , including new board member Carl Icahn , have indicated they think the Sunnyvale , California - based company should try to lure Microsoft back to the negotiating table .
Most industry analysts still believe Microsoft will make another run at Yahoo , particularly now that the company can be bought at a fraction of the May offer .
Instead of buying Yahoo in its entirety , Microsoft might just want Yahoo's search engine , which ranks a distant second in usage behind Google's .
Microsoft attempted to buy Yahoo's search engine shortly before the Google partnership was reached .
Under the terms of the proposed partnership , Yahoo would have drawn on Google 's superior technology for some of the ads shown alongside the search results on its website .
Yahoo would have pocketed most of the revenue generated from Google 's ads .
The concept did n't pan out because Google and Yahoo combined control more than 80 per cent of the US search advertising market .
Microsoft and the Association of National Advertisers , among others , argued the arrangement would enable Google to gradually increase advertising prices and exert more control over the flow of e-commerce .
Google and Yahoo said the complaints were misguided because search advertising rates are set through an auction - style system .
What 's more , the partnership was supposed to be non-exclusive , leaving an opening for Microsoft and others to vie to sell ads on Yahoo 's website .
But helping out Yahoo began to make less sense for Google as it became apparent how much the proposal was alienating the government and advertisers .

Linux drives the world 's fastest computer - www.reallylinux.com
L inux drives the world 's fastest computer by Mark Rais , senior editor reallylinux.com
R oadrunner breaks a modest threshold of 1,000 trillion calculations per second on Monday -- but unfortuntely few of the news sources indicate what drives this hardware .
As news spreads of the incredible new threshold performed by IBM's Roadrunner supercomputer ( actually over 3,456 tri-blade servers ) , it seems many of the news stories are missing a key ingredient .
The Roadrunner supercomputer broke through one of the absolute world records for computer processing power when it performed one Petaflop or 1,000 trillion calculations per second .
Not a trifling achievement considering that just a decade ago reaching the billion mark was a record .
But perhaps most notable , and prominently absent from news stories and the AP wire reviews is the question of what runs this powerful hardware .
Few seem to be taking a good hard look at the key ingredient that drives the computing capabilities of such a behemoth as this $ 100 million computer system .
Being that I am a strong Linux and Open Source proponent , I consider it a serious error of omission that news stories like the one on CNN , miss the fact that Linux is the underlying operating system .
From the IBM website , details regarding the supercomputer are clearly presented including : " The machine is to be built entirely from commercially available hardware and based on the Linux operating system . "
Notice that Linux multiplatform capabilities are utilized as the hardware includes : IBM System x 3755 servers based on AMD Opteron technology and IBM BladeCenter H systems along with the unique Cell B.E. technology ( same chips used to drive Sony 's PlayStation 3 ) .
At the very least , Roadrunner reaching the Petaflop mark is an overt example of the value of Linux for scaling and performance .
Linux is indeed key to driving that unique and high performance hardware architecture .
You can read more details regarding this achievement in articles such as : this one .

Roger Clemens will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2013 .
Brian McNamee , the trainer whom Clemens is suing for defamation as a result of allegations he made in the Mitchell report , says there 's no chance the right - hander will be enshrined .
" He 's done .
He 's not going to the Hall of Fame , " McNamee said in a video interview with Web site sportsimproper.com .
" There 's no chance .
Too much damage .
Too much trust was broken .
Between the people that gave him his career , the people that wrote about his career , and the people that supported his career . "
Clemens won 354 games , seven Cy Young Awards and two World Series rings in a 24 - year career .
But McNamee 's allegations that Clemens used steroids and human growth hormone may have irreparably damaged Clemens ' chance to be inducted into the Hall of Fame .
" You know , it takes a lifetime to build trust .
All it takes is one monumental moment to break that trust and you 're done .
And that 's what happened , " McNamee said in the interview .
" It not only happened , but it happened at monumental lengths .
So he 's not deserving of the Hall of Fame . "
FBI agents investigating Roger Clemens pored through medical records from his former teams earlier this year , looking for evidence that he perjured himself in February when he told Congress he had never used steroids or human growth hormone , several sources told ESPN's T.J. Quinn .
Agents met with club officials and attorneys from the New York Yankees , Houston Astros and Toronto Blue Jays in late spring , reviewing medical documents the teams had and interviewing some medical and training personnel .
" We 've voluntarily complied in response to congressional requests .
We would have provided them to the government , " Rusty Hardin , Clemens ' lawyer , said Tuesday , according to The Canadian Press .
" We are delighted for any legitimate investigators to peruse Roger 's medical records . "
Yesterday ’s Sunday Times reported a City analyst saying that RBS may report losses of up to £ 28 billion for 2008 when it reports its full year figures .
If it does , or if reports a mere £ 20 billion of losses for last year , that means all the extra capital pumped in by UK taxpayers will have gone in just a few months of ownership .
Many of the losses will be on foreign banks and overseas investments within the RBS group .
In the meantime we do know , now that RBS shares are trading around 42 p , that the taxpayer has lost a small fortune on the shares – around £ 8 billion at current market prices .
When the government first started briefing that it was thinking of buying stakes in several major banks I urged them to carry out due diligence , to ensure the assets they were buying were realistically valued .
Why on earth , I asked , should taxpayers have to take the hit after they bought in ?
Surely any sensible person buying into such banks would demand write offs before putting in so much money ?
I was told the government was in a hurry and would not therefore do what any commercial purchaser would do .
They could have applied a sensible discount to the asset value when constructing the deal , but even that proved too much for this feckless and naïve government .
Their bail out of the banks was their ERM – and its impact will be far worse than the damage the ERM did to the British economy .
Taxpayers have thrown their money down the drain , putting it into banks that had not written down their assets sufficiently to warrant the new capital .
Nor have they cut their costs enough .
If a bank is losing such huge sums it cannot afford all the people it is currently employing , and cannot afford the giddy level of salaries and bonuses it is paying to the managers and directors .
The government should have insisted on proper write offs and proper action to cut costs before purchasing any shares .
Instead we are all losing a packet , without helping fix the banks , who carry on incurring costs as if the world was still the same as during the boom .
Now we need to know from the Regulator whether it will inisist on replacing the lost capital or not .
A few weeks agao when the government and Regulator increased the banking panic by insisting on extra capital we were told it was essential they have a higher capital ratio – i.e. more share capital relative to their lending .
Does that rule still apply to RBS , or will it be allowed now post any losses to have a lower ratio again ?
If it is allowed a lower ratio can we have some assurance these losses mark the end of the likely write offs ?
Will the government do some due diligence on the figures this time to make sure they are prudent ?
If the Regulator is still insisting on the higher capital ratio , where is the money coming from ?
Are taxpayers to be made to put more in , as Mr Bean of the Bank of England hints ?
Or will they now get on with selling assets and cutting costs in a way which gets the bank ’s balance sheet back into better trim ?
What should they do ?
Demand a full independent audit of the assets .
Agree realistic values .
Agree with Regulator and the bank an appropriate capital structure for the revised position .
Then get the bank to raise any extra capital it needs through cutting costs and retaining more profit , selling assets , or finding someone other than taxpayers to put up the money .
Taxpayers have had enough .
I pointed out in Parliamentary debates that the 3 banks with state shareholdings could lose the equivalent of the defence budget in a year .
According to the Sunday Times RBS may have done most of that on its own within the first few months of state ownership !
Ezra Klein and Dean Baker are wondering why so few economists saw the crisis coming .
I think it ’s a two part question .
I think it ’s understandable , though not entirely forgivable , that economists did n’t see the risks of a broad financial breakdown .
We ’re accustomed to thinking of banks as big marble buildings with “ member of the FDIC ” signs in the window ; besides , those are the institutions on whom the standard data series report .
( Indeed , some economists still fixate on those data , which is why there are still economists denying that there ’s a credit crunch . )
So neither the size nor the vulnerability of the “ shadow ” or parallel banking system were widely understood .
The big mystery is the failure to see the housing bubble .
The data screamed “ bubble ” , even in real time .
And there was no excuse for believing that such things do n’t happen in efficient markets , not with the dead body of the dot - com bubble still warm .
So why did so few people point out the obvious ?
One answer may be that macroeconomists , in particular , did n’t want to go up against bubble denier Alan Greenspan , which might get them blackballed from Jackson Hole and all that .
But overall , the failure to see the most obvious bubble of my lifetime remains a puzzle .
When you take energy from the wind and the sun , it becomes precious .
If the wind blows , your meter goes up , there are more volts in the battery , and the last thing you want to do is waste it .
Light switches are anonymous - you do n't see the coal being used up and the oil burning .
What makes most people happy about wind energy is that it can be made from a moving piece of art in a landscape .
It helps dispel the myths that windmills are noisy , ugly , ruin the landscape and force down house prices .
The preferable outcome is that we can still flick switches and have light , but we use lights more meaningfully and allow ourselves to sit around in the dark .
There 's a lovely quality to light as the sun goes down .
That transition from light to dark has been part of us and of life for a long time .
In 20 years , will we be looking back at a golden age ?
' Were you around in that time when we could turn on lights any time ? '
Fossil fuel is so dense because it's a product of millions of years .
But the party 's coming to an end and I 'm not unhappy about it .
There is an upside to letting that way of life end .
Days of jetting around the world are coming to an end .
I 'm happy knowing that there 's a beautiful solution to how to produce energy , and it 's there , rotating with no smoke or noise .
Change does n't have to be about sacrifice .
The future can be a barrel - load of fun .

When Worlds Collide : Fandom and Male Privilege
by Lucy Gillam
I know not all men are like this .
I know not all men in fandom are like this .
I know there are exceptions to everything I am talking about here .
Having said that , I am going to try to avoid tripping all over myself to hedge everything I discuss .
I am talking about larger patterns , and I think it 's possible to do so without hedging every word .
There .
Meta -statement done .
A number of years ago , in my early BBS days , I got into an argument with a ( much older ) man about whether the U.S. medical establishment was gender - biased .
His argument was that not only was U.S. medicine not gender - biased in favor of men , it was gender - biased in favor of women .
His support for this was that as many men get prostate cancer as women get breast cancer , and yet breast cancer receives much more funding and research than prostate cancer .
Without being able to verify either of these facts easily ( this was before such information was available with a couple of mouse clicks ) , I responded thusly : the reason breast cancer has the research and funding it has is because women ( and a few men , most of whom had lost women to breast cancer ) had gotten off their asses and gotten it .
They had raised money and lobbied and dragged what was once a vaguely shameful disease into the public eye .
I do n't actually remember how the debate ended ( knowing this guy , I suspect he blew me off ) , but the gist of it was this : the idea that men as a group might actually have to do something to get their interests represented was totally and completely foreign to him .
The " fact " that they were n't represented already was just proof of bias and oppression .
Flash forward a few years to my active gaming days , when the majority of my social life was either gaming or hanging out with my gaming - geek friends .
As should be no surprise , the majority of those friends were men .
In a group of , oh , about 30 or so people in various concentric circles , there were about four women who regularly showed up at parties and other functions .
After a while , we began organizing " chick nights , " gatherings of just the four of us and maybe some other women we knew from outside the group .
For reasons that were often kind of bizarre , some of the men in the group took exception to this .
They never organized nights at which we were excluded .
When we pointed out that by the law of averages , a good half of the various social outings ended up being guy - only , they replied that it was not the same thing .
" Look , " I finally said to one of them , " when we get together Saturday night , we 're going to paint our nails and put goop on our faces and play with each others ' hair and watch movies with really hot guys and talk about how hot the guys are and probably talk about sex and periods and all that fun stuff .
Do you really have any interest in that ? "
" No , " he replied , " but we could do other stuff instead . "
At which point I walked away , because otherwise things would have ended either with a rant on how it was not only more socially accepted but socially expected for women to be interested in stereotypically guy things than for guys to get into stereotypically female things ( which I did n't want to do , because really , we all did love gaming and horror movies and science fiction all that fun stuff ) , or else with me banging my head on the table .
We live in a culture of male privilege .
I mean , you all do know that , right ?
I 'm not breaking anything to you ?
Cool .
Male privilege may be more obvious in other cultures , but in so - called Western culture it 's still ubiquitous .
In fact , it 's so ubiquitous that it 's invisible .
It is so pervasive as to be normalized , and so normalized as to be visible only in its absence .
The vast , vast , vast majority of institutions , spaces , and subcultures privilege male interests , but because male is the default in this culture , such interests are very often considered ungendered .
As a result , we only really notice when something privileges female interests .
This results in , well , lots of things , but two that I want to talk about here .
The first is that true gender equality is actually perceived as inequality .
A group that is made up of 50 % women is perceived as being mostly women .
A situation that is perfectly equal between men and women is perceived as being biased in favor of women .
And if you do n't believe me , you 've never been a married woman who kept her family name .
I have had students hold that up as proof of my " sexism . "
My own brother told me that he could never marry a woman who kept her name because " everyone would know who ruled that relationship . "
Perfect equality - my husband keeps his name and I keep mine – is held as a statement of superiority on my part .
Or back to the first point there .
Think for a minute about any show that is n't a sitcom ( for some reason , they 're the exception ) or a Lifetime series .
I 'll bet you anything the opening credits have more male names than female .
And if there are more female names , odds are the series is about women , as opposed to being about lawyers or doctors or people living in another galaxy .
I mean , I love Stargate : Atlantis , but , well , realistic that there would be fewer women on an Air Force ship , the more telling point is that the presence of two visible female background characters caused me to take notice .
The second result of the invisibility of male privilege is that a lack of male privilege is taken as active oppression , as male - bashing or bias towards women .
It is not enough that the mere presence of something which actively aims at women and women 's interests is taken as oppressing men ; simply not catering to men's interests is perceived as oppression .
And I mean , by the way , honestly perceived that way .
Let 's talk about Spike TV for a moment .
You know , television for men ?
Leaving aside for the moment that their idea of what " television for men " is is kind of interesting , there was no question that the network label was in part a response to Lifetime .
Again leaving aside what Lifetime thinks " television for women " is or should be ( we live to rant another day ) , it sounds fair enough , right ?
One network that 's " television for women " and on that 's " television for men . "
Except is there anyone out there who does n't know that pretty much every other network on television is courting the male viewer ?
The W - fricking - B is trying to attract more male viewers .
I 'm not saying they 're actively excluding female viewers , unless they 're the sort of network that cancels their second - highest rated show because the only people watching it are women , and no , I am never letting that one go , but is it any secret that male viewers are the Holy Grail of television ?
This is , in essence , the television corollary of the men who point to Women 's Studies programs / classes and ask where the Men's Studies are , at which point I flail in the direction of the history , literature , art , and social studies classes .
I mean , is there anyone who actually thinks men are underrepresented there ?
But again , something which is not predominantly about men is perceived as oppression even though it is actually an attempt to rectify the gender imbalance in the mainstream .
So , what does this have to do with fandom ?
Media fandom as most of us know it is often largely a female space .
By that I mean , many of the circles we run in are made up mostly of women .
Women write stories for other women , make vids for other women , talk with other women , go to cons with other women , and while few of us actively want to exclude men , we 're not really invested in drawing them in , either .
Fandom is one of the few places where you 'll actually hear , " Wait , so - and - so's a guy ? "
And you know , we 're kind of used to that .
Except lately , these fairly small spaces have been expanding , and intersecting with spaces where there are more men .
And often , everything is fine and dandy .
It 's just that sometimes , it 's not .
Let 's take
It is not enough , you see , not to exclude men .
We have to actively get them involved .
I 'm not sure what 's more insidious , there : the notion that we must find it not only desirable that men get involved in fandom but also some kind of imperative , or the notion that it is our , women's , responsibility to get them involved in fandom .
That we are the ones who must act , in other words .
That even though we carved these spaces out for ourselves ( did n't nobody create those lists and cons and archives and communities for us , darlin ' ) , we must take the further step to get men involved in them .
And if you are going to argue that these couple of guys are in no way representative of male privilege at work in fandom , you might want to talk to the vidders who 've been told that vidding can't be an " art " because no men are involved .
Instead , it can only be a " hobby . "
And further , as implied in stop the things that appeal to us .
And that , really , is where things can get ugly .
Because men can stand longingly at the window waiting for us to coax them in all they want , and ultimately , it does n't affect us .
What does affect us is the attempt to reshape the spaces we have set up for ourselves to better reflect their interests .
stopping men from posting things that interested them .
And indeed , they did so ( how many scans of Power Girl have been posted ? ) .
Perfect equality : everyone gets to post what interests them .
Except that was n't enough .
Instead , some men ( some , not all , and I do feel the need to say that here ) felt it necessary to actively try to stop the posts that were of interest to women , the slash and " ooh , pretty man " posts .
Instead , we get liviapenn whole rest of comics fandom on the internet , this one space that does not actively cater to their interests by preventing us from asserting ours has become the object of contention .
And you know , tempers have frayed as a result .
It 's all well and good to try to be understanding , to try to remember that larger comics fandom is a male space , and thus that guys see us as the intruder , etc , etc .
But in a culture of male privilege , when even the spaces we create for ourselves become sites of struggle , it can get really , really frustrating .
And again , I feel the need to reiterate : I 've met some great guys in fandom , guys who 've joined fannish spaces and embraced fannish ways and just been , well , great .
And I always think of them with a bit of a squirm when I anyone likes my work , but I 'm not actively seeking them as an audience .
But you know , that should not be a problem .
It should not be seen as " anti-male " to admit that I 'm mostly writing for other women .
And we should n't have to keep fighting for the spaces that , I have to say yet again , we made for ourselves .
And we really , really should n't feel any need to apologize for having made those spaces for our interests , and made them to reflect our interests .
Seriously , can we stop that ?
This is not oppression .
It is not male - bashing .
It is simply a lack of male privilege , and that ?
Is not a bad thing .
I 'm going to start off this essay with the kind of meta - statement I usually avoid like the plague , but I think in this case it 's necessary .
Here goes .
I know not all men are like this .
I know not all men inare like this .
I know there are exceptions to everything I am talking about here .
Having said that , I am going to try to avoid tripping all over myself to hedge everything I discuss .
I am talking about larger patterns , and I think it 's possible to do so without hedging every word .
There .

His argument was that not only was U.S. medicine not gender - biased in favor of men , it was gender - biased in favor of women .
His support for this was that as many men get prostate cancer as women get breast cancer , and yet breast cancer receives much more funding and research than prostate cancer .
Without being able to verify either of these facts easily ( this was before such information was available with a couple of mouse clicks ) , I responded thusly : the reason breast cancer has the research and funding it has is because women ( and a few men , most of whom had lost women to breast cancer ) had gotten off theirand gotten it .
They had raised money and lobbied and dragged what was once a vaguely shameful disease into the public eye .
I do n't actually remember how the debate ended ( knowing this guy , I suspect he blew me off ) , but the gist of it was this : the idea that men as a group might actually have toto get their interests represented was totally and completely foreign to him .
The " fact " that they were n't represented already was just proof of bias and oppression .
Flash forward a few years to my active gaming days , when the majority of my social life was either gaming or hanging out with my gaming - geek friends .
As should be no surprise , the majority of those friends were men .
In a group of , oh , about 30 or so people in various concentric circles , there were about four women who regularly showed up at parties and other functions .
After a while , we began organizing " chick nights , " gatherings of just the four of us and maybe some other women we knew from outside the group .
For reasons that were often kind of bizarre , some of the men in the group took exception to this .
never organized nights at whichwere excluded .
When we pointed out that by the law of averages , a good half of the various social outings ended up being guy - only , they replied that it was not the same thing .
" Look , " I finally said to one of them , " when we get together Saturday night , we 're going to paint our nails and put goop on our faces and play with each others ' hair and watch movies with really hot guys and talk about how hot the guys are and probably talk about sex and periods and all that fun stuff .
Do you really have any interest in that ?
" " No , " he replied , " but we could do other stuff instead .
" At which point I walked away , because otherwise things would have ended either with a rant on how it was not only more socially accepted but sociallyfor women to be interested in stereotypically guy things than for guys to get into stereotypically female things ( which I did n't want to do , because really , we all did love gaming and horror movies and science fiction all that fun stuff ) , or else with me banging my head on the table .
We live in a culture of male privilege .
I mean , you all do know that , right ?
I 'm not breaking anything to you ?
Cool .
Male privilege may be more obvious in other cultures , but in so - called Western culture it 's still ubiquitous .
In fact , it 's so ubiquitous that it 's invisible .
It is so pervasive as to be normalized , and so normalized as to be visible only in its absence .
The vast , vast , majority of institutions , spaces , and subcultures privilege male interests , but because male is the default in this culture , such interests are very often considered ungendered .
As a result , we onlynotice when something privileges female interests .
This results in , well , lots of things , but two that I want to talk about here .
The first is that true gender equality is actually perceived as .
A group that is made up of 50 % women isas being mostly women .
A situation that is perfectly equal between men and women isas being biased in favor of women .
And if you do n't believe me , you 've never been a married woman who kept her family name .
I have had students hold that up as proof of my " sexism . "
My own brother told me that he could never marry a woman who kept her name because " everyone would know who ruled that relationship . " - my husband keeps his name and I keep mine – is held as a statement of superiority on my part .
Or back to the first point there .
Think for a minute about any show that is n't a sitcom ( for some reason , they 're the exception ) or a Lifetime series .
I 'll bet you anything the opening credits have more male names than female .
And if theremore female names , odds are the series is about , as opposed to being about lawyers or doctors or people living in another galaxy .
I mean , I love , but , well , let 's consider , shall we ?
For that matter , I remember noticing and being pleased by how many women there seemed to be on the Daedelus .
How many is how many ?
Two .
And if it 'sthat there would be fewer women on an Air Force ship , the more telling point is that the presence of two visible female background characters caused me to take notice .
The second result of the invisibility of male privilege is that aof male privilege is taken asoppression , as male - bashing or bias towards women .
It is not enough that the mere presence of something which actively aims at women and women 's interests is taken as oppressing men ; simplycatering to men's interests is perceived as oppression .
And I mean , by the way , honestly perceived that way .
Let 's talk about Spike TV for a moment .
You know , television for men ?
Leaving aside for the moment that their idea of what " television for men " is is kind of interesting , there was no question that the network label was in part a response to Lifetime .
Again leaving aside what Lifetime thinks " television for women " is or should be ( we live to rant another day ) , it sounds fair enough , right ?
One network that 's " television for women " and on that 's " television for men .
" Except is there anyone out there who does n't know that pretty muchon television is courting the male viewer ?
The W - fricking - is trying to attract more male viewers .
I 'm not saying they 're actively excluding female viewers , unless they 're the sort of network that cancels their second - highest rated show because the only people watching it are women , and no , I amletting that one go , but is it any secret that male viewers are the Holy Grail of television ?
This is , in essence , the television corollary of the men who point to Women 's Studies programs / classes and ask where the Men's Studies are , at which point I flail in the direction of the history , literature , art , and social studies classes .
I mean , is there anyone who actually thinks men arethere ?
But again , something which is not predominantly about men is perceived as oppression even though it is actually an attempt to rectify the gender imbalance in the mainstream .
So , what does this have to do with fandom ?
Media fandom as most of us know it is often largely a female space .
By that I mean , many of the circles we run in are made up mostly of women .
Women write stories for other women , make vids for other women , talk with other women , go to cons with other women , and while few of us actively want to exclude men , we 're not really invested in drawing them in , either .
Fandom is one of the few places where you 'll actually hear , " Wait , so - and - so's a guy ? "
And you know , we 're kind of used to that .
Except lately , these fairly small spaces have been expanding , and intersecting with spaces where theremore men .
And often , everything is fine and dandy .
It 's just that sometimes , it 's not .
Let 's take this post for example .
Allowing for the moment that the guy was being obnoxious as all shit in his phrasing , there was still a rather disturbing amount of agreement to what was , in essence , a classic example of male privilege .
It is not enough , you see , not to exclude men .
We have toget them involved .
I 'm not sure what 's more insidious , there : the notion that wefind it not only desirable that men get involved in fandom but also some kind of imperative , or the notion that it is our , , responsibility tothem involved in fandom .
Thatare the ones who must act , in other words .
That even though we carved these spaces out for ( did n't nobody create those lists and cons and archives and communities for us , darlin ' ) , we must take the further step to get men involved in them .
And if you are going to argue that these couple of guys are in no way representative of male privilege at work in fandom , you might want to talk to the vidders who 've been told that vidding can't be an " art " because no men are involved .
Instead , it can only be a " hobby .
" And further , as implied in this response , we must do so by actively suppressing our own interests .
It is not enough to make things more appealing to men ; we mustthe things that appeal to us .
And that , really , is where things can get ugly .
Because men can stand longingly at the window waiting for us to coax them in all they want , and ultimately , it does n't affect us .
Whataffect us is the attempt to reshape the spaces we have set up for ourselves to better reflect their interests .
So let 's talk scans_daily , shall we ?
This was a community set up to be friendly to , if not exclusively about , slash , which is , let 's face it , mostly a female activity .
And again , there was in essence a situation of perfect equality .
No one wasmen from posting things that interested them .
And indeed , they did so ( how many scans of Power Girl have been posted ? ) .
Perfect equality : everyone gets to post what interests them .
Except that was n't enough .
Instead , some men ( some , not all , and I do feel the need to say that here ) felt it necessary totry to stop the posts that were of interest to women , the slash and " ooh , pretty man " posts .
Instead , we get " I do n't understand this kind of fandom . "
We get long essays on why we should not post slashy commentary on a particular set of scans .
We get reminders that Bruce and Dick are " father and son " before a scan that really does n't have much to do with it .
And no matter how many times we point out that , to paraphrase , the male fans have the , this one space that doesactively cater to their interests byus from asserting ours has become the object of contention .
And you know , tempers have frayed as a result .
It 's all well and good to try to be understanding , to try to remember that larger comics fandom is a male space , and thus that guys see us as the intruder , etc , etc .
But in a culture of male privilege , when even the spaces we create forbecome sites of struggle , it can get really , really frustrating .
And again , I feel the need to reiterate : I 've met some great guys in fandom , guys who 've joined fannish spaces and embraced fannish ways and just been , well , great .
And I always think of them with a bit of a squirm when I say that I 'm mostly writing for women like myself .
I 'm happy when men like my stories or other work because I 'm happy whenlikes my work , but I 'm not actively seeking them as an audience .
But you know , that should .
It should not be seen as " anti-male " to admit that I 'm mostly writing for other women .
And we should n't have to keep fighting for the spaces that , I have to say yet again , .
And we really , really should n't feel any need to apologize for having made those spaces for our interests , and made them to reflect our interests .
Seriously , can we stop that ?
This is not oppression .
It is not male - bashing .
It is simply a lack of male privilege , and that ?
Is not a bad thing .
Really nice pics , right ?
Well , peep the ' WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH HER DAMN FACE ?!' pics that will more than likely end up on the cutting room floor by clicking ' READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP !' link on the bottom left .
1. I 'm Sadek Drobi , I ’m here with Ted Neward at QCon 2008 .
Ted , why do n't you introduce yourself , tell us what you 've been up to lately ?
Hi , my name is Ted Neward and I 'm up to about 6 ft 2 inches .
That ’s probably all there is .
That and the fact that I 've been talking a lot about different programming languages but people are probably not interested in that aspect .
2 . I have a concern about Scala : it has a Java - like syntax .
Do n't you think that has some implications in a language like semi-functional programming language with a Java - like syntax for developers ?
I think to classify Scala as a functional language would be a mistake .
To classify it as an object language would be a mistake .
In many respects , what Odersky and some of the other folks working on Scala are trying to do is they try to take the best of both worlds .
We do n't want to abandon everything we know about objects , we do n't want to abandon everything we like about objects , but we also want to incorporate a lot of these functional concepts directly into this language as well .
As a result , the syntax on the surface of things can look very Java - esque and , in fact , that can sometimes be exactly what you would expect and , in some cases , it can lead to some very interesting subtleties that will surprise the Java programmer .
As a matter of fact , in the process of working on the 3rd article for the IBM developerWorks series that I am doing on Scala , I 'm talking about the " for " construct in Scala .
It looks on the surface very similar to the traditional for loop in Java .
It turns out that there is a tremendous amount of stuff hiding behind that very simple syntax , which is very powerful and potentially could be very confusing , but in many respects the power is good because a lot of people have complained about the fact that in Java I have to be able to do so many different things in order to be able to express one basic concept .
I think what we are looking for is more power out of our language and Scala has that .
So I do n't know that it 's bad that Scala has Java - like syntax , but I mean let 's make no mistake about it : it 's not Java ; I can not take my . java files and compile them with a Scala compiler .
It 's different enough that you know you are in a foreign land .
3 . My other concern : I feel that we are searching for another language .
We got Java and we like some kind of modeling concepts .
What are the other modeling concepts we find in F# or Scala or the other languages ?
Specifically , what we are seeing now in terms of F# and Scala is modeling concepts like you mentioned in the sense of higher order functions .
Specifically , I think what we are really reaching for here , in many respects , is we are looking back to some of the older languages - Lisp and SmallTalk - of that era and we are saying " You know , these languages have some really implicitly powerful features most notably that we can build up what I call a compositional language . "
We can start from a very core set of primitives and we can build out .
Based on that core set of primitives to take the language in directions that we had not necessarily intended the time we created the core set of primitives but it 's still genuinely useful .
This notion of the domain specific language like what Neal Ford and Martin Fowler and those guys are talking about - the little language from the previous generation of Unix programmers and so forth - all of these are an attempt to be able to create a language that expresses at the level of abstraction that the user of the language wants to operate .
And the problem is that the languages that we use commonly today - and when I say is that I 'm thinking most notably of C# and Java .
It 's very difficult for you to layer a syntax on top of those languages , that is not somehow intrinsically Java and C# .
I really have a hard time putting a different style of syntax on top of Java , C#. Arguably , it 's easier to do this in C++ because the use of the preprocessor .
We do n't have in either of those languages a preprocessor .
Building an internal DSL where I 'm not explicitly creating a new parser and a new code generator and a new language .
It 's actually really hard to do on Java and the C# platforms .
Languages like Scala , languages that are functional in nature , tend to follow this compositional notion very cleanly , because of the notion of querying , of high order functions , etc .
It makes it easier for us to compose many of these elements together , to create something that looks and feels like it 's language syntax , but in fact it 's simply application of core language features that we pulled out of a library , and that 's powerful .
I remember in C# , when we introduced the using construct - for those who do n't know C# the idea of using is { and you put some resource here } that needs to be explicitly closed prior to it being garbage collected - database connection , files , etc .
Normally , we have to put a try - finally block and we use the resource inside the try block and finally make sure that we close it on our way out .
using works with an interface from C# called IDisposable , and IDisposable has one method called " Dispose " that gets called inside the final block .
Adding this construct which occurred in one of the late betas of C# - C# 1.0 - required Microsoft engineers to go through and make the modification of the language , write the necessary unit tasks , etc .
It was a very big deal because of garbage collection .
To do that same construct in Scala , it takes me about 5 minutes and about 5 lines of code .
4 . That 's because you got some abstraction tools that you can use on higher order functions .
We 've got higher functions , we 've got querying , we 've got a whole bunch of things , these cores of primitives that I can build on to create those additional language constructs .
5 . I remember the arguments ; even foreach of C# , today you can re-implement using high order functions .
What about C# 3.0 ?
Does it offer a lot like what Scala does offer today ?
What C# 3.0 does is it takes the existing syntactic elements of C# and it extends them in some very interesting directions , but , at the end of the day , what 's happening here is still Anders and Microsoft are making modifications to the language .
If you want anything that looks like language construct , you have to go lobby Anders and the C# team at Microsoft to say " Hey , it would be really cool if we had a construct here that , for example , is a great one for the Java community " .
The solution would be the same one that we have in the C# community - you have to go talk to the compiler editors .
We have java.util.concurrent , which has this incredible wealth of very rich powerful locking schemes and conditions and so forth .
If you want to use the lock construct in Java 5.0 , you can't say " synchronized ( lock ) " and expect it to do the right thing .
We have to say " try(lock.lock ( ) ) finally ( lock.unlock ( ) ) " to make sure that whatever we lock gets unlocked regardless of how we leave the block of code .
It would be really nice if we could create , could extend , could modify , whatever you want to call it , the Java language to say synchronized ( ) if it takes a java.util.concurrent .
Lock type instead of actually meeting Monitor .
Enter ( ) /Monitor .
Exit( ) in the try - finally block ; instead it calls lock.lock ( ) , lock.unlock ( ) .
In a language like Scala , where we have these compositional primitives , I could do that myself .
In Java and in C# even in C# 3.0 , I still have to go back to Anders and I have to say " I would like this new linguistic feature .
Can you give it to me , please ? "
6 . I can go on re-implement using through a function and then I pass a block of code .
I can do it today in C#. I can do it .
Anything that allows me to take a function primitive as a parameter it 's going to do it , but it 's going to look like API call .
It 's going to be something that says Util .
Using ( resource , - and here is your anonymous delegate , here is your lambda expression etc. ) .
Java we could arguably do the same thing with an anonymous inner class .
All the debate in Java over closures is really over how can we make it easier to write what we have traditionally had used in anonymous inner class form , and certainly we can do this , but it 's awkward and difficult .
You look at it as a Java programmer and you go : " Why are you doing this ?
Why would n't you just put a try - finally block around us ? "
If you come from a functional background , you can recognize what the programmer is trying to do and you can say " Oh , yes , of course , this makes total sense ! "
But , like the foreach construct hanging off of a collection like we see in Ruby , like we see in Scala , like we see in other functional languages , does just not make sense in a language that does not support these things as first class constructs .
In some respects , what you are arguing is " We did n't really need C++ , because I could do objects in C .
All I had to do was create a struct and then pass around a pointer to the struct and the struct contains a bunch of function pointers and I am going to invoke and - yes , you could , but just because you can , it does n't mean you want to .
7 . In C# we do n't have higher order functions .
Not in the same sense that we think about it , at least from the academic perspective .
We have lambdas , no argument , but that does n't necessarily mean we have high order functions .
8 . I would like to know how does it differ .
For example , an important part of this would be functional querying - what they call partially applied functions .
That permits me a degree of flexibility in terms of how and when functions are applied that C# currently does not support .
You can implement is as an API , but now you 're back to building an API , you are building a library .
9 . What you are talking about is having a multi-paradigm language that would support the law of paradigms at the same time , but C++ was doing that .
Why did it fail ?
It did n't fail .
The notion that C++ failed , the notion that C++ is out of the mainstream , I think is a misnomer .
I think it is fair to say that C++ is not the media darling that it once was 10 years ago , but surprisingly , although not so to the people who 've remained in this space , there are a lot of people writing a lot of C++ code and being very happy and productive doing so .
Certainly the people responsible for the C++ language have not shared their responsibilities .
I was just talking to Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter literally last week in San Jose at the SD West Show , and they were talking about how C++ acts .
The Standards Committee has just ( at the end of last week ) approved a couple of features for C++ , one being a full memory model , so that C++ can now talk about creating a standard thread API and a standard set of synchronization primitives .
Number two , they 've approved lambda support , closures .
Full lambdas in the C++ language environment , what took them so long ?
C++ is not at a point where it 's trying to go out and attract a bunch a new programmers to the language because they figured that their bigger responsibility right now is to do the right thing for the people who are already using it , not to try to go out and attract a whole bunch of people out of college .
There is a tremendous amount of power in C++ language , I mean you just have to look at the boost libraries and realize that maybe we did give up on this train too soon .
Certainly , the fact that it's not garbage collected makes it more difficult then say Java , but you grab the latest C++ compiler , the Bome garbage collector , which is available off the web for free and Voila ! , you now have basically what Java gave us back in 1997 plus a whole bunch more .
If the issue here was just one of the automatic memory management , then we abandoned C++ way too soon .
If the issue here is because lots of programmers could n't handle a lot of the syntactic power that the C++ offered us , then those people ...
10 .
We might have this in Scala .
We might very well .
And to those people who cannot handle that degree of power I say " Look , there is a phrase you need to learn .
It 's ' Would you like fries with that ? ' "
At the end of the day , if you do n't want the power inherent in a powerful language , do n't program in one , but then do n't complain to me when the language is not powerful .
You can't get it both ways .
Anytime we have tried to create a language that somehow satisfies the desires of both the power users and the newbies , we have ended up with something that satisfies nobody .
A compositional language , which to some degree Ruby is , which to some degree Scala is , which to large degree Lisp is and so forth - they have the greatest history of success and try to work at both levels .
Languages like C++ , Java , C# , Visual Basic are running into the same basic problem - how much do we cater to entry level programmer and keeping the rails up so that they do n't wonder off into the ditch , and how much do we relax all those constraints and let them do whatever they want .
That 's really hard to do in a fashion that works for everybody at every level .
11 . We will switch to another topic .
It 's about dynamic typing and type inference .
I 've heard a lot about making a mix of both and that 's what Visual Basic is trying to do as a lot of other languages .
Do you think that dynamic typing will break the inference typing model ?
Obviously , I can't answer that question because it 's going to depend on the language in question .
Certainly there are several languages out there that exploit this concept in some detail and there are a lot of people who believe that dynamic typing and static typing can coexist simultaneously inside the same language , inside the same environment successfully .
There is a language that I was introduced to at this year 's Language .NET Symposium on the Redmond Campus , in January .
The language is called Cobra and it's basically a Python - like syntax , but the guy who is creating it is specifically looking to be statically typed when possible , dynamically typed otherwise .
This is a favorite phrase of Eric Meijer , by the way , who is well - known in the Haskell community and of course is well - known to a lot of the .NET community because a lot of the ideas that made their way in the C# 3.0 he had been flirting with since C? which was called X# and Xen and a couple of other things on the way .
There are two basic variations of that quote and I do n't know which one Eric is fond of saying .
One says " Statically typed where possible , dynamically typed otherwise " and the other one says " Dynamically typed where possible , statically typed otherwise " , depending on which side of the spectrum do you want to come from .
There are a lot of research efforts going on - like around Cobra , around what we are going to see in VB X , VB 10 - that are really trying to find the best of both worlds .
And it 's really interesting that VB is coming back to this , because for years , VB was this dynamically typed byte code driven model that everybody said you can't write real code in an environment like that .
Right at the time VB abandoned that model , Microsoft turned around and released the .NET framework , which was all statically typed and so forth .
Meanwhile , over here , in the Java space , in the Unix space , people started looking at things like Ruby and Python and all these other dynamically typed byte code driven interpreter models .
Suddenly it 's exciting , which is what led me to one conference and almost got me lynched - to say that Ruby is basically the Visual Basic for Java programmers .
That did not go over well !
But in a lot of respects it 's a fair analogy , because Ruby provides a lot of the same things that the early Visual Basic environments provided and Ruby is hailed for a lot of the same things that the early Visual Basic environments provided , which is the same high productivity .
That comes with a degree of discipline , of responsibility that the VB community arguably never quite understood , but to be fair none of us were doing it back then , so I do n't know whether we can really crucify VB for that .
At the end of the day there is a lot to be said about the Visual Basic language that was good and useful and that we walked away from far too soon .
12 . That is about static and dynamic .
Type inference you just got in and then suddenly you find a dynamic object that breaks the model .
In Visual Basic today , when it will see a dynamic return object , all the code is dynamic , it 's not static anymore .
To a degree .
It depends on what the compiler can infer from it .
Just because you declared this is returning object if the compiler can figure out that , yes , in fact this is returning a string , the compiler at that point , unless you 've just left it off , you 've just said " OK , function block return string " , will just go ahead and say " OK , you want to return a string " .
It depends basically on what your options are at the time .
Options static are on / off basically .
In VB it 's not by any stretch of the imagination the last word on type inference language .
I would be much more willing to look at what some of the Scala guys are doing or ML , or some of those environments before I start to say " OK , this is where the model breaks " .
Realistically speaking , the model is not broken in type inferencing if we hit a space that 's dynamically typed .
What happens at that point is additional code has to be admitted to provide necessary scaffold to see that the necessary requirements are in place .
Imagine what you would do as a Java or C# programmer with reflection around this thing being an object when you want to invoke a method - it 's basically what the compiler ends up doing it for you .
But it turns out there is a surprising amount of awareness , of knowledge that a compiler can dig out , that a type inferencing system , not just a compiler , can dig out by following all the possible permutations down and realizing that it has to be something from here down in the class hierarchy .
Therefore , I am going to make that presumption and we 'll go from there .
13 . Can you give us your take about the differences between the the Haskell model and the Erlang model ?
Haskell is a functional language , you call a function and you get the return .
Erlang is a messaging language , so it 's quite different .
TN : There are certain debates you just do n't enter into , like for example : where should the curly braces appear ?
Should they be at the end of the line or should they be at the beginning of the next line ?
That 's one debate you just do n't enter into .
Another one is : Hungarian notation for local variables .
This is another one of those debates where I think lots of very reasonable people can have very reasonable arguments about this , and strangely , they do n't .
We end up with a lot of shouting back and forth .
Suffice is to say the Haskell model , the pure functional model certainly works where you can apply it .
Because we are in a purely functional world , where there is no shared state , no mutable state , concurrency becomes just a footnote , it 's really not that important because there is nothing you have to worry about protecting .
14 .
But it 's not only in the functional world .
Of course .
We could do this at the Java level .
If we just made every object in Java intrinsically immutable , we would have a very smooth concurrency experience .
Having said that , how realistic is it to declare by fiat that all objects in Java should be immutable ?
This is a lot easier to say then it is to do for a lot of practical Java programming .
For starters , much of your Hibernate code goes away .
15 .
There is a very important notion - it 's not only about concurrency , it 's also about behavioral coupling .
When you 've got mutation , you 've got behavioral coupling - a lot of companies depend on the behavior or others .
I am sensing a bias in your question here , as you wear the Haskell shirt .
I do n't want to get into this debate .
Both models have their place .
It 's in some way sort of going back to the old EJB debates between stateless and stateful session beans : " Things are always scaled better if you have stateless session beans . " and " Oh , no , stateful session beans are scaled better then you imagine " .
I do n't care , I really do n't care .
The actor 's model , the Erlang 's model you talked about earlier , scales really well .
The Haskell model scales really well .
16 .
Do you mean it scales in performance or in team members ?
I do n't know what it means scaling in terms of team members .
Can I replicate members and have more people on my team ?
That would be great !
17 .
It means you have a big team and you need to share code , and everyone should understand the code that was written by the other - that kind of scaling I am talking about .
That particular issue has nothing to do with the language we are using .
That has to do with the degree of communication that goes on between your team and that can either or not work whether it 's Java , C# , Scala , Pearl , Python or an assembly language .
That 's a cultural issue , that 's not a technical issue .
18 . What about Ruby ?
Ruby lets you do a lot of things , it gives you a lot of possibility , you can do a lot of cheats in the language , but then , your language does n't look like itself .
How is supposed the other developer to understand what has been done by the other developer ?
I think the answer here is " Let 's hope the developers talk to one another . "
Let 's say I create an API and this API is going to be used by another developer on my team and I have to make this API incredibly brain - dead , because I have to assume that the developers on my team do n't talk to one another , then the problem is with your team and lack of communication , not how you design the API .
This is purely a communication issue - it has nothing to do with technology .
19 .
What about domain specific languages ?
In Java , in Ruby , in any language , I know where to start from .
I got a blank page and then I instantiate an object or I call a static method of a class .
When did you figure out which object to create or which method to call ?
You read something - you read a book , you read the documentation or you talked to another developer on the team and said " Where do I start ? " and he told you .
It 's the same thing with the DSL , with an internal or external DSL .
None of us started with just an empty terminal screen and the compiler waiting at the command line shell and we just typed characters at random until we found something that worked and build up from there .
We all started from some bootstrap mechanism .
The same thing is true of a DSL .
You are going to operate off of the documentation that the DSL author will create .
20 .
I 'm not about textual , I 'm about this mix : I mean it's not the language and it's not that textual , it 's something in between .
Do n't I lose something as coherence in the language ?
No .
You do n't .
We can argue this back and forth .
I can tell you that no , I believe that you wo n't , and you cannot believe me , and we 're done .
I mean at that point we 've just reached an impasse .
If your programmers have a hard time getting started with an internal or external DSL , then I submit that the same programmers will have a hard time getting started with an API .
I think it 's easier to learn the rules around the language , the documentation around the language is better than it is around the API , but other people can choose to disagree with that .
I can't really gain anything .
At the end of the day this becomes more of an aesthetic thing than a hard and fast rule of technology .
21 . You were talking about how some languages have Rails associated with VB and then other languages are as close to the machine as C ++.
With something like the virtual machine model , do you see a space there for multiple languages that work on the same basic platform and you can step from one to the other during the development process ?
Certainly the VM offers a tremendous amount of abstraction away from the underlying machine , which makes things easier for us as programmers - we do n't have to worry about so many details , those details are deferred until runtime .
The VM is arguably better at making those right decisions .
Certainly , there is a place here to say " Let 's use different languages for different problems " and that 's part of the reason why Microsoft designed the CLR the way they did - they wanted to encourage different languages on top of the same platform , they wanted to allow underlying machine specific , platform specific to bubble up through the VM .
That 's why , for example they 've always had a very rich platform interoperability story like PInvoke and COM Interop and so forth .
That 's not necessarily running without the rails in the sense that the VM still does a lot of things to prevent you from doing certain scary tricks .
For example , in the CLR right now I cannot just define a block of memory and then immediately jump to it and start executing .
I could do that in C++ , if I wanted to do that .
Or , inside the CLR I cannot just acquire the address of an object and then figure out the offset of the field inside that object to start parting directly on that memory .
The CLR will prevent that unless you go through one of those escape patches - the PInvoke code , which means now you have to be marked with an appropriate switch that says " This is unsafe code " and there is a whole bunch of permissions that go with that .
I mean you really have to want to do scary little tricks like that , which generally mean you are either a sadistic or you try to do something that the CLR does n't want you to do because you are resting on assumptions that may not be true in the next version .
Some of those kind of things that I did in the C++ era do n't apply much anymore .
I do n't know that 's saying we are running with rails on , we are running with safety bumpers on as much , as it is " Look , we 're protecting programmers , we 're protecting the 99 % population of programmers from the 1 % of crazy wacked out nut jobs like me who did this and thought it would be cool " .
So , I do n't necessarily want to apply that to be on top of the VM is somehow running with safety bumpers .
I do n't think that is true at all .
But even so , we are approaching an era where VM here can be a very loose term .
You 're still compiling to native code or you can compile to their byte code format and you could do a tremendous amount of interesting runtime optimizations , you are using the LOVM toolkit .
That 's not really a VM in the traditional sense of the term , but you can think of it as one at some level from a language perspective .
This notion of VM is itself losing some coherency in its definition , which is why the CLR guys always use to refer to what they built as not a virtual machine but an execution engine ( EE ) .
I do n't know if the difference between the terms is all that semantically rich but it is interesting to look at the full range of tools that are out there .
22 . One of the things you 've talked about was modular toolchain .
So the idea being the move from code to ... back and forth all along that chain .
As a developer that 's a really interesting idea .
How do you get there ?
If I knew that , I 'd be applying for research grants right now .
In that particular blog entry where I talked about the modular toolchain , I eluded to this idea of some sort of universal AST .
I think that 's going to take a very long time for us to get to any sort of meaningful form , so I certainly would not try to do that out of the gate .
Having a recognized AST that covers some percentage of what we'd like to do , would be a good place to start .
So , if you are in the Java space , looking at the Java tool chain , looking at the ways we go through parsing and scanning and lexing and so forth to produce the Java AST - let 's start from that , let ’s define a common Java abstract syntax tree .
What sort of additional things would we like to see to that AST or can we reduce that down to ?
Just because it's the AST for the Java language , it does n't mean that we might not be able to reduce it down to some core common primitives .
Because if we do that , we could define some Java language construct syntax in terms of this core primitives set , then we have flexibility to incorporate other sorts of languages as a part of this environment and so forth .
Let 's be really blunt about this : I 'm not a compiler author by trade .
Neal Gafter or Joshua Block or some of the guys that have been doing this for 20 or so years are likely to have more concrete input that they can weigh in on this particular thing in terms of what those core primitives should look like .
I do n't know exactly , I have a vague sort of idea in my head what it would look like but they have a lot more experience than I do .
If we can get to that notion of core AST , of an intermediate representation that we could define other languages in terms of , then we can start saying " All right , now we are looking at this essentially 2 phase process " .
Number 1 - going from whatever your source representation looks like into this AST model , this tree model , and then going from the tree model to code , generated executable code .
Now we can talk about taking the generated executable code and going back into the AST model , which then lets us bring it back to a source model .
There is a whole bunch of things that I am leaving out in a traditional compiler chain ; there are all sorts of phases that occur once you are in the AST in order to do optimizations and all that stuff .
That 's fine , but if we could get to that AST to start with , to get some tools to go Java to AST , AST to code and then back again - that 's a step 1 .
I mean did all for the .NET space : C# to AST , AST to IL , VB to AST - that , in some ways would be the most interesting challenges .
The really frustrating thing is .NET took about half of the steps there , they have this thing called Code DOM
It ships as part of the .NET frameworks since 1.0 and it's broken .
Fundamentally it 's broken .
They have this document object model about code , Code DOM , and we can use it specifically for code generation .
We can use it specifically to create C# classes that can then be compiled , but I can't go from compiled code back to Code DOM and I can't go from Code DOM back to source .
I talked to one of the guys who worked on it and he said " Well , it turns out it was a lot harder then we thought . "
That 's a good reason !
Instead of just removing the API that says " Let 's create a Code DOM out of compiled code " , they just have thrown an exception because they might fix it someday .
That 's just terrible , awful .
That would be an interesting place to start , but again the DOM there are very directly representative of the languages .
The C# code DOM looks very like C# and the VB code DOM looks very much like VB .
I would like to - and I do n't know how feasible that is - create a simpler DOM model that could express the other languages as a part of .
I do n't know off hand if that means we have to go up one level of abstraction to do that or if we have to try to go back to our Lisp - like roots .
I 'm really not excited to the idea of relearning CAR and CADAR and all those others .
I do n't think we have to go that far back , but certainly , if you look particularly at a lot of the functional languages , they way they are able to compose things with high order functions and so forth , I think there is the germ of an idea that we can explore , and I would love to do it .
Now everything I need is somebody to cover my mortgage for the next 6 months and I 'll go off and do it .
So if you know of anybody , you let me know .
23 .
The upgrades and updates of the bigger languages are quite large .
At what point should you stop adding massive features in languages and stabilize them and create a new language with what you learnt from building it up to a certain stage ?
It 's interesting , Neal is doing his presentation now , so I get to do this .
Neal Gafter is giving a presentation here at QCon in the evolving Java track , because Brian Goetz , the track host said " I want you to talk about how we can add new features to a mature language like Java " .
Neal went and looked up the definition of " mature " .
Mature means having achieved its full growth and therefore , unchanging .
So , by definition it is impossible to add things to a mature language , which makes things funny , but at a certain point , I think it depends on the language and how it 's constructed .
If we look at Lisp , Lisp and SmallTalk , and some of the older languages which are intrinsically compositional in nature , I do n't think there is really any place where you say we need to stop .
Because they are built on top of this core set of primitives and so , if we find that a particular layer of abstraction that we 've built on top of - layer upon layer upon layer .
If we find those layers too high we back down one , we just do n't import that library .
We go back , if necessary , all the way back to the core set of primitives and start building in a different direction if we need to .

Q&A : ANTHROPOLOGY AND WAR Q&A : ANTHROPOLOGY AND WAR Anthropologist Montgomery McFate is the chief social scientist for the U.S. Army 's Human Terrain System program .
She answers a few questions about the program below : Q : In April , Defense Secretary Gates discussed the " unfortunate reality that many people believe there is this sharp divide between academia and the military " in the context of the Human Terrain Teams .
What do you see as the reality of this divide ?
A : The divide between academic anthropologists and the military actually stretches much farther back in time , to Franz Boaz ' censure of a number of anthropologists who assisted the military and intelligence community during World War I .
In my personal view , this estrangement results from deep anxieties within the discipline about its own origins as the " handmaiden of colonialism " and subsequent attempts to reconstruct the discipline after Vietnam as an advocate for indigenous populations .
That the military ... might apply anthropology to solving problems in its domain interferes with and potentially negates the disciplines ' view of itself .
That said , the goals of the military during stability operations are very similar to the core values of most anthropologists : that local consent is critical , that harm should be mitigated , and that local cultural knowledge can alleviate suffering .
Q : Why is it necessary to have social scientists on efforts like the Human Terrain Teams ?
Why not just teach social science skills to military personnel ?
Is the fieldwork experience somehow critical ?
A : While it is certainly possible to teach social science skills to military personnel ... they already have a number of extremely challenging tasks to perform in their own domain and requiring soldiers to perform this function creates an additional burden .
What social scientists bring to the military is in some cases a deep expertise on the specific area of interest .
In all cases , however , they bring a fresh perspective ... and a methodology for research and analysis that benefits both the military and the local civilian population in the area of operations .
Q : What should the military be doing to expand its own social science capabilities ?
A : The military has made enormous strides in the realm of socio-cultural knowledge capabilities since 2003 , including advances in training , doctrine , education , operational programs , analysis , etc .
First , the U.S. military should institutionalize many of the programs , doctrine , and training made during the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan .
...
Failing to institutionalize the adaptations generated by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan presents a real hazard ... building capabilities during a war is difficult , time - consuming , expensive , costs the lives of civilians and soldiers alike , and imposes a huge strain on the bureaucracy .
Second , the U.S. government should develop a large - scale , systematic research program within its science and technology portfolio to support qualitative social science in non-Western societies where future military operations are likely to occur .
...
This information would provide a socio-cultural knowledge baseline that would facilitate future stability operations , the success of which depend on the ability of U.S. personnel to operate within a foreign society ... Q : What would you want our readers to know about efforts like the Human Terrain Teams that has been underreported or not adequately conveyed in news stories so far ?
How does the effort stand today , in your view ?
A : The need for HTS as a capability was recognized in Phase 4 of Iraq and Afghanistan , when the military identified their lack of socio-cultural knowledge as an operational gap .
Building HTS during the war was expensive and difficult because we were reacting to a crisis rather than planning ' left of boom ' .
Had this capability been developed and implemented during a Phase 0 pre-conflict phase , policy decision - makers and planners in the Pentagon would have had a much richer and more granular baseline knowledge of the societies in which operations were to be conducted , which would have allowed them to develop more effective policies and strategies .
Even more important , these senior officials would have potentially had the opportunity to use this knowledge to deter conflict in the first place .
By Dan Vergano SAN FRANCISCO 
The military for years has enlisted anthropologists , depending on their expertise to write up analyses of distant places and cultures .
But debate is growing among those scientists over whether it is appropriate for them to be involved in actually working alongside soldiers in combat or to contribute to the growing field of counterterrorism research .
At the just - concluded American Anthropological Association meeting here , the question of whether anthropologists should take part in military operations took the stage , though not for the first time .
In 2007 , the AAA 's executive board expressed " disapproval " of anthropologists ' work in Afghanistan and Iraq , arguing that they helped in " identifying and selecting specific populations as targets of U.S. military operations . "
The debate is more than academic .
Two social scientists with the U.S. Army Human Terrain System ( HTS ) were killed in bombings this year in Afghanistan and Iraq .
HTS researchers are essentially the Army 's polling force , surveying local sentiments to , among other things , increase the security of the area and facilitate aid and rebuilding efforts and to ensure those efforts are culturally sensitive , according to the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command , which runs the program .
Anthropology , military go way back
Ties between anthropology and the military are old ones .
The science originated as a " tool of colonialism " in the 19th century to understand British Empire subjects , says historian David Kaiser of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
In Iraq and Afghanistan , field anthropologists study culture , kinship and networks in societies , " particularly key " factors in the insurgencies , according to the Army 's counterinsurgency manual .
For example , in these countries it is considered reasonable to put family ties above the needs of society , and nepotism is seen as positive , not negative .
That 's something young soldiers raised in the USA , with our veneration of the rugged individualist , may not immediately understand .
Is this right or wrong ?
A necessary tool in the defense of the nation and the world ?
Or a misuse of science to advance warfare ?
Arguments are raised on both sides .
And the anthropologists , recruited from universities and making from $ 81,093 to $ 124,010 , plus combat pay , are in the middle of the debate .
" The idea of militarization of anthropology alarms people , " says Robert Albro of American University in Washington , D.C.
For one thing , anthropologists do n't want to be viewed as spies , he says , and military financing could bend the field 's purpose away from the study of cultures .
Anthropologist Roberto Gonzalez of San Jose State University posed questions at the meeting for those working with the military : • What safeguards prevent human terrain data being used to target individuals ?
• How do you ensure the information is n't used for war crimes ?
• How can embedded anthropologists get informed consent from civilians ?
Gonzalez says use of information from human terrain teams to unleash lethal force is at odds with the core values of anthropology .
A group Gonzalez helped create called the Network of Concerned Anthropologists submitted a " Pledge of Non-participation in Counterinsurgency " signed by 1,056 anthropologists .
' Working to make the world a better place '
On the other hand , Phillips Stevens of the State University of New York - Buffalo said it became clear to him from the first moment U.S. troops entered Iraq that " the implementation of some cultural advice would have saved lives and dollars . "
" All anthropologists are working to make the world a better place , " said panelist Brian Selmeski , a professor of anthropology at the Air Force 's Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama .
He quoted an infantry officer who told him , " We do n't need your help to break things .
We need your help so we do n't have to break things . "
Defense Secretary Robert Gates agrees .
" It is an unfortunate reality that many people believe there is this sharp divide between academia and the military — that each continues to look on the other with a jaundiced eye , " he said in May .
" Challenges facing the world require a much broader conception and application of national power than just military prowess . "
What social scientists bring to the military " is in some cases a deep perspective on the specific area of interest , " Montgomery McFate , senior social scientist for the HTS program , says by e-mail .
Anthropologist Kerry Fosher of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University believes that the training in understanding the complexities of culture that anthropologists receive is vital to saving lives during conflicts , and that anthropologists should n't be afraid of putting their training to work .
" If we were a little bit less terrified of somebody harming themselves or the world with the knowledge we share , " she says , " maybe the world would look a little bit different than it does . "
READERS : So , what do you think — should anthropologists work alongside soldiers ?

Fox owner is ' becoming something else ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday December 3 , 2008
Print This Email This
The author of a new book about media mogul Rupert Murdoch , which asserts that the owner of Fox News " absolutely despises " top-rated host Bill O'Reilly , believes that Murdoch 's negative feelings about Fox go far beyond a personal distaste for O'Reilly 's bullying .
Michael Wolff , author of The Man Who Owns the News , told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann on Tuesday , " I would mention ... Bill O'Reilly [ to Murdoch ] and he would get this look which was like revulsion . "
Wolff added that " I started to see this around all of Murdoch 's people .
...
No one says , ' O ' Reilly , we hate him ' ... but everybody goes into a contortion . "
According to Wolff , however , the real issue is that Murdoch has " come to like the liberals more than the conservatives -- and many of them have come to like him , too .
...
His life is now largely spent around people for whom Fox News is a vulgarity and a joke . "
" If he became utterly convinced , " asked Olberman , " not only would a liberal network make you five times the money that Fox News makes you , but one will exist and it will put Fox News out of business , would he go down the street tomorrow , shut off Fox News , and put on a liberal version of it just for the money ? "
" In a New York minute , " Wolff replied .
" He saw a market niche , " Wolff explained .
" It was easy to get into , it was easy to service these people , it was cheaper to service these people , and he went for it .
...
He saw a money - making formula . "
Wolff believes that now Murdoch , " wants something else .
...
He is becoming something else . "
Wolff explained , " One of the interesting things about Murdoch is that he is -- how would we say this ?
-- henpecked . "
In the 1980's , Murdoch was influenced by his second wife , who was " classically , and in a doctrinaire way , a Catholic conservative . "
But " now he 's with a woman 38 years his junior , quite young , quite liberal , quite open , and certainly engaged with all of the Hollywood people . "
Wolff believes that Murdoch 's dream is to be accepted as a serious newsman .
He " runs a perfectly up - the - middle straight news operation in the UK " and has bought the Wall Street Journal , " that 's known for its seriousness , its probity , its high journalistic standards . "
Ultimately , Wolff thinks Murdoch has his sights set on the New York Times .
" It 's there , it 's in front of him , he has been openly plotting with his people , ' How do I get this ? "
Wolff told Olbermann .
When Olbermann scoffed at the possibility , Wolff noted that " $ 800 million is what you can buy the New York Times for today . "

Building an alt - energy power plant is risky and expensive , but thanks to a new ruling by an Environmental Protection Agency panel , building a coal plant may become riskier and more expensive .
The Environmental Appeals Board blocked the EPA from issuing a permit to a proposed coal plant addition near Vernal , Utah , about 150 miles east of Salt Lake City .
Perhaps more importantly , the quasi - independent board , composed of four highly regarded , experienced judges , ruled that the EPA needs to develop a single nationwide standard for dealing with carbon dioxide .
" I do n't want to understate its significance .
I think it 's very significant , " said Bob Graham , chair of Jenner & Block ’s Environmental , Energy and Natural Resources Law Practice , a noted environmental law expert who was not involved with the case .
" In the long run , it advances the ball on climate change issues and that 's positive . "
On Thursday , the EPA panel blocked the Bonanza Coal Power Plant 's bid for a permit , reversing an earlier decision , and placing over 100 coal plants into regulatory limbo .
The rulemaking process will likely yield greater CO2 emissions regulation and will take more than a year , say lawyers familiar with the EPA process .
That puts prospective coal power - plant builders in a tough spot , especially with financing already in short supply thanks to the credit crunch .
The ruling introduces more risk into the coal industry , which could drive away investors and their limited cash .
And that , said the Sierra Club 's chief climate counsel , David Bookbinder , is good news for new clean tech companies .
" Where do you think that money is going to go ?
It 's going to go to wind .
It 's going to go to solar .
It 's going to go to something that 's going to get built , " Bookbinder said .
" This is incredibly good for green energy . "
Following a landmark 2007 decision by the Supreme Court that carbon dioxide could be regulated as a pollutant under the 1970s - era Clean Air Act , environmental groups have been pushing the EPA to stop issuing permits to coal plants , which produce massive amounts of CO2 .
But under the Bush administration , the EPA had resisted taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial sources .
Still , the Sierra Club persisted , using a relatively small addition to Deseret Power Electric Cooperative 's preexisting Bonanza Power Plant in Utah , to make a stand against the permitting process .
They lost the first round , when the Denver regional EPA office issued a permit , saying they need not consider greenhouse emissions .
On appeal , however , the Sierra Club appears to have won a much wider - reaching victory .
The Board did not actually side with the Sierra Club 's interpretation of the Clean Air Act , but in deciding to send the decision back to the EPA with the instruction to come up with a nationwide plan for regulating greenhouse gases , the Sierra Club effectively stopped new coal plants in their tracks .
" It 's punting in a technical , legal sense but what it does is give us everything we wanted , " Bookbinder said .
" This plant is dead and every other one is going to have to sit around . "
The current EPA , for its part , was none too happy that they must reconsider their policies , even if it will ultimately give the organization wider powers .
" While we are disappointed that the issue was remanded , EPA looks forward to the opportunity to consider this issue on remand , " the agency said in a statement .
" EPA is firmly committed to taking sensible action to address the long - term challenge of global climate change . "
The definition of " sensible action , " however is likely to change under Barack Obama , who many policy watchers anticipate will grant the EPA far more leeway to deal with greenhouse gas regulation .
" Do I think that the Obama administration would pursue this further ?
Yes , I think they will , " Graham said .
The American Petroleum Institute filed a brief opposing the Sierra Club , arguing that the Clean Air Act , a version of which first passed in 1963 long before climate change became an environmental issue , is the wrong vehicle for reducing carbon dioxide emissions .
" Overall , API does not support regulating greenhouse gases under the current Clean Air Act because it would be a mess , " said Lee Hayden , the American Petroleum Institute 's Washington , D.C. , representative . "
It 's not designed for greenhouse gas emissions . "
But the Appeals Board decision combined with the Supreme Court ruling makes it likely that the EPA will begin using the Clean Air Act in just that way , which will have implications that will reverberate through the economy .
The stricter the EPA limits on carbon dioxide , the more money coal plant operators will have to throw at technologies to reduce their CO2 emissions .
That will eventually make coal power more expensive , which climate - change action advocates hope will make solar , wind , nuclear and other low - carbon technologies more competitive .
" I 'm feeling pretty damn good today , " said Bookbinder .

On 26 November a video message was sent to the Prime Minister on behalf of professional musicians , demanding an extension of copyright protection for performers from 50 to 95 years after any recording .
With many of the classic tracks of the high noon of rock 'n ' roll about to reach their half - century , the issue is becoming urgent .
Such an extension is not thought to be supported by the UK government .
A spokesman for the artists was understandably irate about this , pointing to the " staggering " amount of foreign revenue generated by British session musicians ( " the finest in the world , the absolute finest " ) .
Although sympathy for veterans about to be deprived of their royalties is entirely proper , it is just as well to see the crisis of the modern music industry - of which the wrangling over copyright forms a part - in its historical context .
Modern musicians ' lot compares very well to that of their predecessors .
By definition , it was only when commercial recording began in the early 20th century that a musician could expect any additional payment for a performance .
Not even as great a virtuoso as Paganini or Liszt had a back catalogue .
For composers , too , copyright protection is very much a creation of modern times .
Until deep into the 19th century , piracy of the most flagrant kind was the norm .
As soon as a score was published , it was liable to be copied right across Europe without any kind of payment to its creator .
Moreover , unscrupulous publishers often borrowed the identity of prestigious composers to add allure to slow - selling catalogue items .
In Paris , in 1789 , the Bohemian composer Adalbert Gyrowetz went to a concert to hear a symphony advertised as being by Haydn - and found himself having to sit through one of his own com positions .
Two years earlier , one of the more respectable publishing houses , Breitkopf & Härtel of Leipzig , advertised for sale 96 symphonies by Haydn , even though at that time he had written fewer than 80 .
If modern copyright protection had been in place in Germany in the middle of the 19th century , Richard Wagner would have been a rich man .
As his biographer Ernest Newman pointed out , it was the system that made him a beggar - and then condemned him for being a debtor .
One of the reasons why Wagner - and every other composer - was so keen to make a name in Paris was that legislation introduced during the French Revolution had given France the best intellectual property rights in Europe , and consequently the continent 's most vibrant musical culture .
The result was that Auber , Meyerbeer and Halévy became very rich .
That these three succeeded where Berlioz and Wagner failed ought to be sufficient warning that secure access to the market is not a guarantee of superior quality .
When copyright protection came to Italy in the late 19th century , it marginalised the im presarios and prompted the now dominant music publishers to cosset their star composers .
Whether the music produced under these new conditions by , say , Puccini is superior to that of Rossini , Bellini , Donizetti or the younger Verdi is a different matter .
The relationship between context and content in music has always been problematic .
The rise of the anonymous public in the course of the 18th century certainly liberated musicians from the patronage of prince or prelate .
Never again would a composer of Mozart 's stature be booted out of the service of the Archbishop of Salzburg ( " with a kick to my arse " , as Wolfgang put it in a letter to his father ) .
The development of a prosperous public sphere in London allowed Haydn , in a matter of months , to make six times the annual salary paid to him in Austria by Prince Esterházy .
Yet public patronage came at a cost .
Haydn chose not to settle in London , but to remain in the service of the Esterházys until the day he died in 1809 .
He may well have had an inkling that the public could be a much harder taskmaster than the relatively undemanding aristocrats he served at home .
The public knew what it liked - and that was easy listening in the shape of plenty of variety , good tunes , regular rhythms , and pieces that were not too long or difficult .
Haydn 's symphonies fitted the bill , but Beethoven , especially in his later years , was altogether too demanding .
Increasingly in the early 19th century , public concerts took the form of potpourris , mainly comprising popular overtures , operatic arias and dance tunes , with at best a single movement of a symphony or a concerto .
In particular , the enduring craze for dance music led to even choral music and oratorios being reorchestrated in waltz - or polka - time to allow toes to tap , the ultimate surely being the Stabat Mater Quadrilles .
The industry has not died , but it has been forced to make sweeping changes
Long and loud were the complaints from serious composers that the public did not appreciate them but preferred jaunty melodies and the simple orchestration of Italian ice - cream opera .
Significantly , it was around this time that the word " philistine " entered common usage , to den ote the unsophisticated , unintellectual , money - grubbing bourgeois who knew the price of everything and the value of nothing .
In 1826 , the year before his death , Beethoven pronounced : " It is said vox populi , vox dei .
I never believed it " .
Composers have responded in all kinds of ways to the emergence of the philistine public as the major source of patronage , from " giving the punters what they want " to " doing my own thing regardless " .
Beethoven dealt with the problem by sacralising music , by raising it above the grubby hands of the paying public to become something worshipped in its own right .
If they found his late quartets incomprehensible and concluded that he had gone mad , then so be it .
Perhaps the acme of this kind of attitude was the response of Sir Harrison Birtwistle when criticised for inaccessibility : " I ca n't be responsible for the audience - I 'm not running a restaurant . "
At the other end of the spectrum , there has been what might be called the Tin Pan Alley approach , whose sole criterion is sales .
The ideal has been to achieve popular success and esteem without sacrificing a sense of integrity .
Handel , the first musical millionaire , managed it , taking advantage of London 's precocious size and prosperity , but he was the exception in the 18th century .
When the subsequent explosive growth of the public sphere across Europe created a new Eldorado , it was the composer - performers who did best , since it was they who could achieve a direct relationship with their audiences .
Paganini and then Liszt dem onstrated just what riches and honours were now available to the charismatic musician .
When Liszt left Berlin after a series of recitals in 1842 , he did so in a carriage pulled by six white horses , accompanied by a procession of 30 other coaches and an honour - guard of students , as King Frederick William IV and his queen waved goodbye from the royal palace .
As the music critic Ludwig Rellstab put it , he left " not like a king , but as a king " .
In the course of the 19th century , ever - growing markets , bigger spaces for music and better communications allowed many more performers to make much more money .
Sopranos , especially , became rich beyond the dreams of avarice of even the most famous singers of the past .
Between September 1850 and June 1851 Jenny Lind , " the Swedish Nightingale " , gave 95 concerts in the United States , earning $ 176,675 net of all expenses .
Moreover , all along the way she was feted as a queen .
Had she lived long enough to take advantage of the invention of recording , her colossal fortune might well have been multiplied many times over .
In 1914 , Enrico Caruso was earning £ 20,000 a year from world sales of his records , which may even have increased ten fold after 1918 .
In the course of the past century , a rush of technological changes has made music more accessible and ubiquitous than ever before .
Cinema , the gramophone , radio , the jukebox , television , the electric guitar , transistors , LPs , stereo , the Walkman , discotheques , CDs , the internet , DVDs , the MP3 , the iPod and all the rest have drenched the modern world in music .
Moreover , the eruption of youth culture after 1945 simultaneously propelled musicians to pole position in both status and material reward .
As the annual Sunday Times Rich List shows , no other branch of the creative or performing arts can boast such a concentration of wealth .
When Bono or Bob Geldof ( both honorary Knights of the British Empire ) lecture politicians on what to do about the problems of the third world , those politicians have to appear to be listening .
But , for every Bono and his countless millions , there is a host of modestly paid session players , 90 per cent of whom earn less than £ 15,000 a year , according to one of their leaders .
It will come as no consolation to them to know , if they do not know it already , that it was ever so .
Ever since musicians emerged from the servile but cosy world of aristocratic patronage into the harsh daylight of the public sphere , the musical profession has been a pyramid with a broad base and a sharp top .
The new opportunities brought by every major technological shift have also left many casualties among musicians unable or unwilling to adapt .
A good example was the advent of the gramophone , which sent an army of pianists , piano teachers and piano manufacturers to the scrapheap .
More recently , a combination of digitisation and the internet has torn a great fissure in the recording industry , which has not died ( as Norman Lebrecht claimed in a characteristically strident book last year ) , but which has certainly been forced into fundamental change .
Nor , one imagines , will the musicians plugging their way through yet another Muzak recording session be cheered by the reminder that Jimmy Page ( worth £ 75 m , according to the Sunday Times ) started out as one of their number .
Theirs is an often unrewarding and uncertain profession , but at least now their P45s are not accompanied , as was Mozart 's , by physical violence .

Although Ted Stevens holds a small lead in Alaska and is the favorite to retain his seat , the outcome is not as inevitable as it might appear to be .
Stevens currently holds a lead of 3,353 votes , or about 1.5 percent of the votes tallied so far .
But , there are quite a large number of ballots yet to count .
According to Roll Call , these include “ at least 40,000 absentee ballot , 9,000 early voting ballots , and an undetermined number of questionable ballots ” .
Indeed , it seems possible that the number of “ questionable ” ballots could be quite high .
So far , about 220 thousand votes have been processed in Alaska .
This compares with 313 thousand votes cast in 2004 .
After adding back in the roughly 50,000 absentee and early ballots that Roll Call accounts for , that would get us to 270 thousand ballots , or about a 14 percent drop from 2004 .
It seems unlikely that turnout would drop by 14 percent in Alaska given the presence of both a high - profile senate race and Sarah Palin at the top of the ticket .
But even if Begich were to make up ground and win a narrow victory , this would seem to represent a catastrophic failure of polling , as three polls conducted following the guilty verdict in Stevens ’ corruption trial had Begich leading by margins of 7 , 8 and 22 points , respectively .
The emerging conventional wisdom is that there was some sort of a Bradley Effect in this contest — voters told pollsters that they were n’t about to vote for that rascal Ted Stevens , when in fact they were perfectly happy to .
Convicted felons are the new black , it would seem .
The problem with this theory is that the polling failures in Alaska were n’t unique to Stevens .
They also applied to the presidential race , as well as Alaska ’s at - large House seat .
In each case , the Republican outperformed his pre-election polling by margins ranging from 12 to 14 points :
Contest Projection Result Delta
AL - ALL Berkowitz +6.4 ( i ) Young +7.7 GOP + 14.1
AL - Sen Begich + 12.9 ( ii ) Stevens +1.5 GOP + 14.4
AL - Pres McCain +13.9 ( iii ) McCain +25.3 GOP + 12.4
( i) Pollster.com Trend Estimate
( ii ) FiveThirtyEight Polling Average
( iii ) FiveThirtyEight Trend - Adjusted Estimate
There are three plausible explanations I can think of to explain this discrepancy .
The first and most likely is that the Democratic vote became complacent and did not bother to turn out .
The outcome of the presidential contest was not going to be close in Alaska , and Barack Obama ’s victory in the Electoral College was apparent as of about 4 PM local time .
Begich supporters , moreover , may have looked at the polls and concluded that their candidate was far enough ahead that they did n’t have to bother to vote .
Meanwhile , the Republican base was going to turn out no matter what because of their enthusiasm for Sarah Palin .
There seems to be a sort of danger zone at about 10 points wherein a candidate is far enough ahead that many of his supporters assume the race is in the bag , but not so far ahead that he is immune to poor turnout ( a similar dynamic affected then - Governor Jim Blanchard of Michigan in his 1990 race against John Engler ) .
The second possibility is that a substantial percentage of the Democratic vote is tied up in the early and absentee ballots that have yet to be counted .
We know that Barack Obama overperformed among early voters in many states , and Alaska may be no exception .
( Although , I would guess that the absentee vote is predominately rural , whereas Begich ’s base is in Anchorage ) .
The third possibility is that a lot of those “ questionable ” ballots are Democratic ones , and that there have been irregularities in the voting tally .
Although this is the least likely possibility , Alaska is a provincial state with some history of corruption , and Democrats ought to be making sure that too many of their ballots have n’t been disqualified .
Some notes on Rake 15 November 2008
I ’m busy setting up and extensive suite of Rake tasks to manage the building , configuration , customization and deployment of Gentoo Linux onto USB drives .
We ’re busy migrating all our servers ( new and current ) onto USB for various reasons , which I do n’t want to elude to just yet .
If you think I ’m crazy , Engine Yard does the same and I ’m sure plenty of other providers do the same thing too …
I have n’t really used Rake extensively in the past , but I know how powerful it is and it was a perfect fit for the tasks at hand .
Trying to remember a complicated set of command line parameters and the perfect sequence in which they should run is not a joke .
Rake to the rescue .
I did pickup on some non-obvious Rake details , well non-obvious to me at least , and thought I ’d share them here .
Current working directory
Rake changes the current working directory to that of the Rakefile before running tasks .
This might sound obvious , but I discovered it by mistake .
Consider the following directory structure :
+ tmp - Rakefile + some + nested + directory
Now edit Rakefile to have this :
task : default do sh " pwd " end
You should see the top level directory get outputted to the console no matter how deep you go down the rabbit hole :
~ /tmp$ rake ( in /home / kenneth / tmp ) pwd / home / kenneth / tmp ~ / tmp $ cd some / ~/tmp / some$ rake ( in /home / kenneth / tmp ) pwd / home / kenneth / tmp ~ /tmp / some $ cd nested / ~/tmp/some /nested$ rake ( in /home / kenneth / tmp ) pwd /home / kenneth / tmp ~/tmp/ some/nested$ cd directory / ~/tmp/some/nested/directory$ rake ( in /home / kenneth / tmp ) pwd /home / kenneth / tmp
I ’ve always noticed the directory getting printed out , but never realized the significance of this since I ’m always in the same directory where the Rakefile resides …
Arguments for tasks
Farrel Lifson had this eye opener on arguments for tasks , and I used it happily until I refactored a huge tasks into several smaller ones .
Below is my failed test case :
task : no_args do | task , args | puts " no_args : " + args .
inspect end task :args , : foo , : bar , : needs => : no_args do | task , args | puts " args : " + args .
inspect end
Running it yielded this disappointing output :
~ /tmp$ rake args [ hello , world ] ( in /home / kenneth / tmp ) no_args : {} args : {: foo= > " hello " , : bar= > " world " }
And then as Murphy would have it , after I ’ve changed the tasks back to using standard ENV style arguments , I mistyped the initial failed code like this :
task : no_args , : foo , : bar , : extra do | task , args | puts " no_args : " + args .
inspect end task :args , : foo , : bar , : needs => : no_args do | task , args | puts " args : " + args .
inspect end
And got these results :
~ /tmp$ rake args [ hello , there , world ] ( in /home / kenneth / tmp ) no_args : {: foo= > " hello " , : bar= > " there " , : extra= > nil} args : {: foo= > " hello " , : bar= > " there " }
So there is some hope , but managing arguments in this style for the entire dependency tree would be a nightmare .
Anyone have some good suggestions on the latter we can pass on to the Rake team for inclusion ?
Lonely men ought to flaunt their copies of New Scientist .
Women looking for both one - night stands and long - term relationships go for geniuses over dumb jocks , according to a new study of hundreds of university students .
“ Women want the best of both worlds .
Not only a physically attractive man , but somebody in the long term who can provide for them , ” says Mark Prokosch , an evolutionary psychologist at Elon University in North Carolina , who led the study .
To many women , a smart man will appeal because he is likely to be clever enough to keep his family afloat .
But he may also pass on “ good ” genes to his children , say Prokosch and his colleagues at the University of California , Davis .
Rather than ask women to rate qualities they seek in men , as other studies had done , Prokosch ’s team asked 15 college men to perform a series of tasks on camera .
Advertisement
The volunteers read news reports , explained why they would be a good date , and what would be the ramifications of the discovery of life on Mars .
They also threw and caught a Frisbee to parade their physical appeal .
Each potential suitor also took a quantitative test of verbal intelligence .
Smart is sexy
More than 200 women watched a series of these videos before rating each man ’s intelligence , attractiveness , creativity and appeal for a short - term or long - term relationship .
While the difference between short - and long - term mates may amount to a boozy decision students face each weekend , it has some evolutionary significance , Prokosch says .
In potential husbands , women look for signs that a man might be a good provider and father .
In one - night stands , women are on the prowl for little more than good genes , not to mention a good time .
Women proved to be decent judges of intelligence , with their scores generally matching each man ’s intelligence test results .
As for picking a bed - mate , the men ’s actual smartness proved a reliable indicator of their appeal for both brief hook - ups and serious relationships – which came as something of a surprise .
Other studies have suggested that , for women anticipating short - term relationships , a man ’s braininess is n’t foremost in their minds .
The disparate results may be due to women ’s lack of awareness that intelligence also affects the attractiveness of candidates for quick flings – how intelligent women perceived a man to be influenced his desirability as a long - term mate much more than his appeal for a one - night stand .
Bright and beautiful
Martie Haselton , an evolutionary psychologist at the University of California in Los Angeles , also notes that although women were good judges of intelligence , they were n’t perfect .
In many cases , women rated good hook - ups as dunces , when their intelligence scores indicated otherwise .
“ There could be aspects of intelligence that we pick up on when we interact with a person and that affect our assessment of them , even if we would n’t label it as intelligence , ” she says .
But some things never change .
Looks were still a much more powerful predictor of sex appeal than brains .
“ Women are still going for the hunk , ” Prokosch says .
“ If you had an option to pick from five different people , you would pick the most attractive one . ”
So in a perfect world , women want a Nobel prize winner with movie - star looks .
Creativity also proved to be a sought - after trait , and Prokosch ’s team is currently working on an objective measure of creativity , similar to the intelligence test they used .
However , in a world of limited resources , not every woman gets what she wants , and some are bound to fall for ugly , unintelligent and uncreative men .
“ There ’s always other people out there that find everything attractive , ” Prokosch says .

Until recently , no one thought of John McCain as a culture warrior .
Distrusted by the religious right , he seemed annoyed even to have to address issues like gay marriage .
In February , a political lifetime ago , a poll commissioned by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund found sizeable support for McCain among pro-choice women , and revealed that seven in 10 of these women did n't know the candidate 's actual anti-abortion views ( pdf ) .
By many accounts , his first choice for a running mate was the pro-choice Independent Joe Lieberman .
As recently as May , he told Glamour Magazine that he would encourage the Republican party to include exemptions to the anti-abortion plank of its platform for cases of rape , incest and threats to the mother 's life .
How odd , then , that in these final weeks , McCain 's rhetoric on women has reached a pitch of febrile wingnuttery not heard from a presidential candidate in decades .
The first clues came with the Sarah Palin pick , as well as with his ultimate failure to even try to moderate the party platform 's abortion language , which emerged as absolutist as ever .
Both those things , though , could have been taken as more evidence of disinterest toward women 's issues , rather than active extremism .
Not so his recent fulminations .
First there was the final presidential debate , where McCain attacked Obama for his insistence that any ban on late - term abortions have an exception when a woman 's health is at risk .
Using sarcastic air quotes , McCain treated such concerns as risible , saying : " That 's the extreme pro-abortion position , quote , ' health ' . "
He used the phrase " pro-abortion " , a locution favoured by the hard right , three times , and clearly stated his desire to see Roe v Wade overturned .
Then , speaking on Fox News on Sunday , McCain celebrated Palin as " a direct counterpoint to the liberal feminist agenda for America " who has a " wonderful family " .
( The implication , perhaps , being that feminists do not have wonderful families , which someone should tell to grandmother - of - six Nancy Pelosi , among many , many others ) .
To some observers , this might all this might seem quite standard .
There 's nothing new , after all , about the Republican party opposing abortion or lambasting feminism .
In recent elections , however , GOP presidential candidates have generally tried to soften their message for mass consumption .
In 1992 , after George HW Bush lost to Bill Clinton , the chastened Republican party vowed to remake their image as angry plutocratic puritans .
Reporting on the 1992 meeting of the Republican Governor 's Association , held just after the election , the New York Times described a party desperate to start promoting an image of " diversity " and " tolerance " .
It quoted Haley Barbour , currently the governor of Mississippi , saying : " We need our heads examined if we let abortion be the threshold issue of Republicanism . "
To be sure , Republicans since then have n't changed their position on reproductive rights .
They have , however , changed their language .
In 1996 , Bob Dole tried to reach out to pro-choice voters and infuriated the right by failing to bring up late - term abortion while debating Clinton .
Even the resolutely anti-abortion George W Bush mostly signalled his position with allusions and dog- whistles heard only by the already committed .
Rather than declare his desire to see Roe v Wade swept away , he spoke of his opposition to the US supreme court 's infamous pro-slavery Dred Scott decision , baffling those who did n't know that in the anti-abortion movement , Dred Scott is constantly invoked as a Roe analogy .
Republicans even stopped bashing the women 's movement , trying instead to co-opt it .
Hence all the recent crowing that Palin , presented as half Arctic Annie Oakley , half supermom , represents real , you - can - have - it - all feminism , the kind that might even appeal to disaffected Hillary Clinton supporters .
But now , losing , frustrated and discombobulated , McCain has dropped the pretence .
The surprise is not his contempt for feminism , but his willingness to express it so baldly .
Ironically , it 's precisely the fact that he has n't spent his career in the Elmer Gantry wing of the party that now makes him sound so unhinged .
He 's not fluent in the codes and dodges more practiced Republicans use to lull moderates while signalling their faith to the true believers .
As a spokesman for reaction , he 's unvarnished .
His blunt anti-feminism is slightly shocking , but , given the party he's now leading , at least it 's honest .

Dive right in to this image that contains a sea of distant galaxies !
The Very Large Telescope has obtained the deepest ground - based image in the ultraviolet band , and here , you can see this patch of the sky is almost completely covered by galaxies , each one , like our own Milky Way galaxy , and home of hundreds of billions of stars .
A few notable things about this image : galaxies were detected that are a billion times fainter than the unaided eye can see , and also in colors not directly observable by the human eye .
In this image , a large number of new galaxies were discovered that are so far away that they are seen as they were when the Universe was only 2 billion years old !
Also …
This image contains more than 27 million pixels and is the result of 55 hours of observation , made primarily with the Visible Multi Object Spectrograph ( VIMOS ) instrument .
To get the full glory of this image , here ’s where you can download the full resolution version .
It ’s worth the wait while it downloads .
Or click here to be able to zoom around the image .
In this sea of galaxies – or island universes as they are sometimes called – only a very few stars belonging to the Milky Way are seen .
One of them is so close that it moves very fast on the sky .
This “ high proper motion star ” is visible to the left of the second brightest star in the image .
It appears as a funny elongated rainbow because the star moved while the data were being taken in the different filters over several years .
The VLT folks describe this image as a “ uniquely beautiful patchwork image , with its myriad of brightly coloured galaxies . ”
It shows the Chandra Deep Field South ( CDF - S ) , one of the most observed and best studied regions in the entire sky .
The CDF -S is one of the two regions selected as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey ( GOODS ) , an effort of the worldwide astronomical community that unites the deepest observations from ground - and space - based facilities at all wavelengths from X - ray to radio .
Its primary purpose is to provide astronomers with the most sensitive census of the distant Universe to assist in their study of the formation and evolution of galaxies .
The image encompasses 40 hours of observations with the VLT , just staring at the same region of the sky .
The VIMOS R - band image was obtained co-adding a large number of archival images totaling 15 hours of exposure .

Who knew there were so many historical elephants ?
I was aware of Dumbo ( fiction , I know ) , and I was aware of Jumbo ( P.T. Barnum 's famous elephant ) , but they are just the tip of the iceberg .
Here are 10 more who have left their footprints in history ( get it ?? ) .
1. Abul - Abbas was Charlemagne 's personal pet .
He was exhibited for the public many times , especially when Charlemagne 's court was together .
He died pf pneumonia in his 40s in the year 810 " ¦ probably after a session of swimming in the Rhine River .
2. Ruby , a petite 4.5 Asian elephant , was famous for her paintings .
Her keepers saw her basically doodling in the dirt with her trunk and gave her a brush and some paint , and her career as an artist was born .
She died in 1998 during birth " “ her 320 - pound calf had died in the womb and a massive infection had spread through Ruby .
She had to be euthanized .
3. Batyr was also known as the " Speaking Elephant "  because he could replicate human noises .
He lived his whole life at the Karaganda Zoo in Kazakhstan and never came in contact with another elephant .
He first started " talking "  at the age of eight ; he often asked his attendants for water and praised himself .
Among his words were Batyr , water , good , bad , fool , yes and give .
He also could imitate dog barks and human whistles .
He made the noises by pushing his trunk into his mouth and manipulating his jaw and tongue .
He died in 1993 at the age of 23 .
4. Hanno was Pope Leo X's pet white elephant .
Pope Leo loved him immensely and was devastated when he died at the young age of six .
Supposedly he died when he was given a treatment for constipation that was worse than the constipation itself .
Nonetheless , he died with the Pope at his side .
The Pope wrote Hanno's epitaph himself and had a fresco by Raphael commissioned .
5. ( and 6 ) .
Poor Castor and Pollux .
Paris was under siege from the Prussian army in 1870 , citizens killed various zoo animals for their meat .
Horses were first ; cats , dogs and rats soon followed .
Then the zoo animals got the axe " “ antelope , camels , yaks and zebra .
Sadly , Castor and Pollux suffered the same fate .
The citizens really had no qualms about eating the beloved elephants that had been popular for rides around the park " “ writer Henry LabouchÃ¨re gave the meat a review as if he were dining at Nobu : " Yesterday , I had a slice of Pollux for dinner .
Pollux and his brother Castor are two elephants , which have been killed .
It was tough , coarse , and oily , and I do not recommend English families to eat elephant as long as they can get beef or mutton . " 
7. Murderous Mary is another sad tale , in my opinion .
She killed an assistant at the circus when he prodded her behind the ear with a hook ; she was immediately given the death sentence .
But how do you kill a five - ton Asian elephant ?
You hang it , of course .
Obviously , the standard tree or gallows would n't work , so an industrial crane was procured .
The first time they tried to hang her , though , the chain snapped .
She fell and broke her hip .
The second time , she died .
I find the picture terribly sad and disturbing , so I wo n't publish it here " “ but if you 're interested , here 's the link .
8. John L. Sullivan was named after the famous boxer .
Why , you ask ?
Because he boxed , of course .
He had a glove put on the end of his trunk and then sparred with his trainer .
He retired after a while and became known as " Old John "  .
He still proved to be useful , though " “ he would watch the performers ' children , led the rest of the elephants around and lifted heavy items .
In 1922 , he walked 53 miles to pay tribute to one of the first elephant in America , who we will get to in a second .
He laid a wreath at her grave .
9 . Old Bet was one of the first " “ if not the first " “ elephant in the U.S .
She was an African elephant purchased by a farmer in 1808 to help him around the farm , but she ended up being so fascinating that he traveled around and charged people to see her instead .
If you did n't have any money on you , a two - gallon jug of rum would work just fine .
She was basically assassinated by a fellow farmer in 1816 who thought it was a sin for people to be spending money on such frivolous things .
Old Bet is memorialized by the Elephant Hotel and statue in Somers , New York " ¦ which is where Old John paid tribute to her in 1922 .
10 . Hansken was on tour throughout Europe in the mid-1600s .
Even Rembrandt was enamored of her and drew four chalk sketches of her .
Her talents included pickpocketing , drumming , firing a gun and waving a flag .

BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Lebanese and Spanish archaeologists have discovered 2,900 - year - old earthenware pottery that ancient Phoenicians used to store the bones of their dead after burning the corpses .
They said more than 100 jars were discovered at a Phoenician site in the southern coastal city of Tire .
Phoenicians are known to have thrived from 1500 B.C. to 300 B.C and they were also headquartered in the coastal area of present - day Syria .
“ The big jars are like individual tombs .
The smaller jars are left empty , but symbolically represent that a soul is stored in them , ” Ali Badawi , the archaeologist in charge in Tire , told Reuters Wednesday .
Badawi and a Spanish team from the Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona have been excavating at the Phoenician site for years .
The site was first discovered in 1997 but archaeologists have only been able to dig up 50 square meters per year .
“ These discoveries help researchers who work on past Phoenician colonies in Spain , Italy and Tunisia , to pin down a large number of their habits and traditions , ” said Maria Eugenia Aubet , who leads the Spanish team .
“ Especially since there are few studies of the Phoenicians in their motherland ‘ Lebanon ’ , ” Aubet said , adding that the remains proved that the Phoenicians were a people who had a vision for life after death .
The last excavation was in 2005 .
A war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas concentrated in southern Lebanon and the tenuous political and security situation in 2007 halted work on the site until this year .
A seafaring civilization , the Phoenicians ’ earliest cities included Byblos , Tire and Sidon on Lebanon ’s coast .
From Tire , the Phoenicians are thought to have expanded into other colonies on the Mediterranean coast .

Sources close to the Ohio Corrupt Practices Act / RICO claim sent us a copy of the following letter that asks Attorney General Mukasey for protection for Michael Connell and his family who have been allegedly threatened by Karl Rove .
Rove is believed to be the strategic mastermind behind the Bush 2004 re-election campaign and the possible Ohio election improprieties .
The alleged threats appear to be the result of the re-opening , through the Ohio Corrupt Practices Act / RICO claim , of the stalled investigation into the 2004 Ohio Elections .
Date : Thu , 24 Jul 2008 13:50:55 EDTSubject : Report of Rove threats against witness Michael ConnellDear Attorney General Mukasey :
We have been confidentially informed by a source we believe to be credible that Karl Rove has threatened Michael Connell , a principal witness we have identified in our King Lincoln case in federal court in Columbus , Ohio , that if he does not agree to " take the fall " for election fraud in Ohio , his wife Heather will be prosecuted for supposed lobby law violations .
This appears to be in response to our designation of Rove as the principal perpetrator in the Ohio Corrupt Practices Act / RICO claim with respect to which we issued document hold notices last Thursday to you and to the US Chamber of Commerce Institute for Legal Reform .
See : http://www.bradblog.com/?p=6189 and http://www.archive.org/details/ElectionFraudInOhioCourtCase.
I have informed court chambers and am in the process of informing the Ohio Attorney General 's and US Attorney 's offices in Columbus for the purpose , among other things , of seeking protection for Mr. Connell and his family from this reported attempt to intimidate a witness .
Concurrently herewith , I am informing Mr. Conyers and Mr. Kucinich in connection with their Congressional oversight responsibilities related to these matters .

A Dallas , Texas jury today convicted a once - prominent Muslim charity and five of its former leaders of financing the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas , rejecting the defendants ' assertion the men were aiding Palestinians oppressed by the Israeli occupation .
The US government has described the prosecution of the defunct Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development as a necessary action in the US war on terrorism , accusing its leaders of funnelling more than $ 12 m to Palestinian schools and charities controlled by Hamas , which controls the Gaza strip .
The US state department declared it a terrorist group in 1995 , making such contributions illegal .
Prosecutor Jim Jacks described the defendants as " leaders of Hamas in the United States " who revelled in the group 's message of martyrdom , jihad and " killing Jews " .
The government described the local recipients of Holy Land aid as terrorist recruiters .
Holy Land was the nation 's largest Muslim charity before it was shut down in December 2001 .
President George Bush personally announced the government 's freezing of the group 's assets , calling the move " another step in the war on terrorism " .
The verdict in the seven - week trial may constitute a final victory for Bush as he turns over the reins of foreign policy and of the war on terrorism over to President - elect Barack Obama .
Obama has not indicated he will seek a new course with Hamas , nor suggested he will cease terrorism - financing prosecutions .
Ghassan Elashi , Holy Land 's former chairman , and Shukri Abu-Baker , the chief executive , were convicted of a combined 69 counts , including supporting a specially designated terrorist , money laundering and tax fraud .
Mufid Abdulqader and Abdulrahman Odeh were convicted of three counts of conspiracy , and Mohammed El - Mezain was convicted of one count of conspiracy to support a terrorist organisation .
Holy Land itself was convicted of all 32 counts .
The organisation 's defence attorneys argued it had cast politics aside , helping Palestinians suffering under the Israeli occupation .
" It 's a sad day , " said Mohammed Wafa Yaish , Holy Land 's former accountant and himself a witness of the trial , told the Dallas Morning News .
" It looks like helping the needy Palestinians is a crime these days . "
This was the second trial for the group .
A trial last year ended in mistrial .
Whether polished obsidian , bronze or metal - backed - glass , we have been gazing at our reflection for thousands of years .
Still , mirrors are somewhat behind the times when it comes to creative and off - the - wall modern furniture designs .
But while mirror mirror on the wall still holds true in most cases ( we have yet to think of a better place for it ) , designers have never been more playful at exploring new design concepts in mirror - making .
Here are 16 unique examples of new mirror designs that one would expect to find lurking with Alice in Through the Looking Glass .

Whatever a mirror is made from , it has to be reflective , surely ?
Not if you think laterally .
Daniel Rozin ‘s creations get around non-reflectivity by interpreting the image from an outward - facing camera and converting it into subtle changes in an array of small side - lit objects – in effect , pixels .
The result is mirroring made from wooden blocks , wooden pegs , ball - bearings and even lumps of trash .
See the wooden mirror at work here ( Quicktime required ) .
Converting the humble wall - mirror into something rarely seen outside a funfair , the Flect Magic Mirror warps and contorts when you run the magnetic “ magic wand ” over it .
When you have finished twisting your reflection hither and thither , remove the wand and the mirror springs back into shape .
All the fun of “ breaking ” a mirror without the seven years of bad luck .
What else can a mirror be ?
Here are two designs that reflect on this problem .
Philippe Starck evidently believes that it can be a set of shelving that subtly encourages you to tidy up after yourself .
Juanco ‘s mirror has a built - in tape measure , neatly stepping around the need for another person in the room when you want to check exactly how tall you are in your new shoes .
Seeing yourself head - on is all very well , but hair - styles wrap around .
A sensible alternative to awkwardly working a hand mirror behind your head is this 360 Degree Mirror – except it ’s only 180 degrees , and surely they ’ve got their reflections mixed up there ?
However , no denying it is a great concept .
One theme , two perspectives .
On the left we have the Chandelier Mirror , adding a touch of Phantom of the Opera to your decor .
And on the right , its mirror - image , the Mirror Chandelier – a pendant lamp that would n’t fail to stun if it was surrounded by candles or positioned to catch firelight .
Convention dictates that a mirror is a single unbroken surface .
Evidently these designers do n’t hold much truck with convention .
Afroditi Krassa works with mirrored sculptures , working mirrors into images of her design to hold images of yours .
Alternately , this mirror from Inside IDSland appears to be cascading gently off the wall like a giant , feather - like Slinky .

For traditional single - surface wall mirrors , there are two directions to go .
The Wipe Mirror goes down the quirky route , simulating what you ’re forced to do when the mirror ’s too fogged up to be useful .
The stunningly clean - lined Dog Head mirror from TranSglass ® seeks otherworldly sophistication , looking less manufactured than CGI - rendered .
Mirrors for the geekily - minded .
A tribute to the maddeningly addictive puzzle game by Alexey Pajitnov , the Tetris Mirror will have you whistling that theme tune as you brush your hair – and Oregon Scientific ’s grandly - titled Mirror Weather Station will be able to tell you the likelihood of whether you will need a coat to two decimal places .

So what is next for mirrors ?
Most likely , they turn into windows .
Thanks to nifty technology developed in Japan , what appears to be simple plate glass can become a mirrored surface at the flick of a switch , via the introduction of either oxygen or hydrogen into a layer between glass sheets .
As well as a breakthrough in the techniques of keeping sunlit buildings cool , it ’s a whole new world of mirrors .
Although we cannot be sure , we are presuming the Allure mirror is one such example – from a few feet away it appears to be an array of glowing lights , but get within sensor - range ( around 18 inches ) and suddenly there you are , staring right back …
Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich Arrested
Illinois Governorhas been arrested on corruption charges .
Blagojevich is charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and solicitation of bribery .
According to the U.S. Attorney 's office for the Northern District of Illinois , Blagojevich conspired to trade or sell the U.S. Senate seat left vacant by President - elect Barack Obama .
The 51 - year - old governor has also been charged with illegally threatening to withhold state assistance to Tribune Co. , the owner of the Chicago Tribune , in the sale of Wrigley Field .
In return for state assistance , Blagojevich allegedly wanted members of the paper 's editorial board who had been critical of him fired .
" The breadth of corruption laid out in these charges is staggering , " U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said in a statement .
" They allege that Blagojevich put a ' for sale ' sign on the naming of a United States Senator ; involved himself personally in pay - to - play schemes with the urgency of a salesman meeting his annual sales target ; and corruptly used his office in an effort to trample editorial voices of criticism . "
In wiretaps over the past month , Blagojevich is alleged to have discussed obtaining a substantial salary for himself at either a non-profit foundation or an organization affiliated with labor unions ; a spot for his wife on paid corporate boards ; promises of campaign funds -- including cash up front ; a Cabinet post or ambassadorship for himself .
" If they 're not going to offer me anything of value I might as well take it , Blagojevich allegedly said .
" I 'm going to keep this Senate option for me a real possibility , you know , and therefore I can drive a hard bargain , "
He was also quoted as saying that the seat was " a valuable thing _ you just do n't give it away for nothing . "
He also allegedly noted becoming a U.S. senator might remake his image for a possible presidential run in 2016 .
Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth , a former congressional candidate who now serves in Blagojevich 's administration have been mentioned as possible Senate replacements for Obama .

I could n’t be more thrilled to ( finally ) announce ( and reveal the big secret I ’ve been hinting at for over a week ) QMx ’s most ambitious project to date : The Complete and Official Map of the Verse .
Over two years in the making , the Map of the Verse measures 25 inches by 38 inches and is printed on both sides of a sheet of 65 lbs cover stock ( believe me , we needed the space ) .
It documents the names , positions , sizes , populations and other never - before - published details of the 215 terraformed planets and moons orbiting the five star systems that comprise The Verse of Joss Whedon ’s Firefly and Serenity .
The Map of the Verse encompasses every bit of information about the Verse we could lay our hands on .
It not only includes all the worlds from the show and movie , but also extended canon from licensed products and even a few from popular fan fiction .
A team of researchers including folks from The Signal Podcast and other luminaries of the Browncoat community worked diligently on the science of The Verse , factoring in distances , orbits , masses , stellar classes and a lot of other astrophysical stuff that frankly made my head hurt .
It was our goal that The Map of the Verse makes sense – scientifically and in terms of story continuity – and thanks to the help of many , many dedicated people , I think we were able to come pretty close to achieving that goal .
We also considered the politics of The Verse in constructing the map .
We tried to answer questions like why Hera was so important that the loss of a single battle there could end the war decisively : Turns out Hera orbits a protostar ( along with Shadow and Sturges ) that rides the inner edge of The Border and is an ideal jumping - off point for travelers going to The Core or out to The Rim .
In combination with Persephone – which orbits a stellated gas giant on the outer edge of The Core – Hera / Persephone form a kind of “ airlock ” between The Core and the rest of the Verse , making it a target of great strategic importance .
And that ’s just one detail the team – including map designer Geoffrey Mandel who created the maps you see in the movie – considered as they constructed this model of the Verse .
The Map will be available for the first time next weekend at the Creation Serenity Convention in Burbank , CA and then shortly thereafter on the QMx website .
We ’ll be offering the map in two forms – Z - folded roadmap style for $ 26.95 and hand - rolled and inserted into an archival tube for shipping and storage for $ 34.95 .
It ’s also worth noting that Margaret Weiss Productions has endorsed the Map and we expect they ’ll be using this Verse model in future Serenity Role - Playing Game supplements .
( By the way , if you have n’t gotten a copy of the Serenity RPG , you should .
It ’s a fantastic read , even if you do n’t roleplay ! )
With literally thousands of details I could ramble on all day about the map and all it encompasses .
But , rather than do that , I ’ve prepared a little gallery of images for you to ponder :
So , what do you think ?
Big enough for ya ?
A top HSBC banker has been found hanged in the room of a five - star hotel , police said tonight .
Scotland Yard said there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Danish - born Christen Schnor , 49 , who was found at around 2.40 pm on Wednesday at the Jumeirah Carlton Tower Hotel in Knightsbridge , west London .
The Mail on Sunday reported Mr Schnor , who leaves a wife and two children , was found hanging by a belt , naked in a closet in his room .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A spokesman for HSBC said : " Our thoughts are with his family and we will do all we can to help them at this difficult time . "
Mr Schnor studied at Henley Management College and graduated in 1994 .
He joined HSBC in June 2007 when he was appointed head of insurance with responsibilities for Europe and the Middle East .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said it had been called to reports of a man found hanging , adding : " The 49 - year - old man was pronounced dead at the scene .
" A post mortem will take place in due course .
His death is being treated as non-suspicious . "
She said : " The time is approaching when the use of bills and bank statements to prove our identity will no longer cut it , and when our personal dictionary of different passwords for different purposes will become too unwieldy to work effectively . "
( CNN ) -- Pakistan 's president Tuesday pointed to a weekend raid in Kashmir as proof of his government 's commitment against terrorism , urging India to " pause and take a breath " before blaming Pakistan for the November massacre in Mumbai .
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari addressed India in an opinion piece in The New York Times .
In a sometimes deeply personal opinion piece in The New York Times , President Asif Ali Zardari wrote that his government , which took office earlier this year , was also the target of Islamic extremists -- " and we continue to be their victims . "
But Sunday 's raid on a camp used by the group India blames for the Mumbai attacks shows Pakistan is willing to crack down on " non-state actors " operating on its territory , he wrote .
" We understand the domestic political considerations in India in the aftermath of Mumbai , " he wrote .
" Nevertheless , accusations of complicity on Pakistan 's part only complicate the already complex situation . "
Pakistani security forces raided a camp near Muzaffarabad , the capital of Pakistani - controlled Kashmir , on Sunday and arrested 15 people , a Pakistani security official told CNN .
It was the first sign of government action against Lashkar - e - Tayyiba ( LeT ) -- the Islamic militant group India says was behind the killings of more than 160 people in Mumbai -- since the attacks .
Watch what 's known about the raid »
" As was demonstrated in Sunday 's raids , which resulted in the arrest of militants , Pakistan will take action against the non-state actors found within our territory , treating them as criminals , terrorists and murderers , " Zardari wrote .
" Not only are the terrorists not linked to the government of Pakistan in any way , we are their targets and we continue to be their victims . "
Zardari's wife , former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , was killed in December 2007 in the second of two attempts on her life after she returned from exile that October .
The president invoked her death to express sympathy for India 's victims , writing , " I feel this pain every time I look into the eyes of my children . "
" The Mumbai attacks were directed not only at India , but also at Pakistan 's new democratic government and the peace process with India that we have initiated , " he wrote .
" Supporters of authoritarianism in Pakistan and non-state actors with a vested interest in perpetuating conflict do not want change in Pakistan to take root . "
Zardari wrote that militants in his country have been strengthened by the United States and its allies which empowered " the most fanatic extremists " to fight Soviet forces in Afghanistan during the Cold War .
The Pakistani president never mentioned his country 's past support of LeT , which Pakistan 's intelligence agency , the ISI , helped create to fight against Indian rule in Kashmir in the 1990s .
LeT has denied any role in the Mumbai attacks , and Pakistan has rejected accusations that the government supports terrorist groups .
Under pressure from the U.S. , Pakistan banned LeT after a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that brought the nuclear - armed rivals to the brink of war .
Citing American intelligence and counterterrorism officials ,
The New York Times reported on Monday that LeT continues to receive assistance from the ISI which has allowed it to " quietly gain strength in recent years . "
Zardari 's government -- which took power earlier this year -- has attempted to reform the ISI , including appointing a new chief in September .
A key component to Pakistan 's fight against terrorism is a strong economy and government , and the world " must act " to ensure that , Zardari wrote .
Pakistani was recently approved for a $ 7.6 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to help it avoid an economic collapse .
Zardari warned that the terrorist groups are " trying to provoke " a war between India and Pakistan , something that his country is committed to avoiding through diplomacy .
" In the current environment , reconciliation and rapprochement is the best revenge against the dark forces that are trying to provoke a confrontation between Pakistan and India , and ultimately a clash of civilizations , " the president said .

Live from Brad Blog Election Center in North Hollywood , CA , we pause from election updates to bring you these reports of election irregularities , oddities and irritations coming in from all over our great nation .
We have n't vetted these , so do n't shoot the messenger .
Or as the Bard ( that 's Bard , not Brad ) once said , " Hey , I do n't make the freaking news , I just blab it to youse . "
When the dust has cleared and the euphoria of the election has subsided , we 'll still have to address deal with the dirty tricks and voter suppression and ... yes , the machines ...

Vermont--BlackBoxVoting.org reports : Ballots are not supposed to be printed with the oval on the fold line .
Maryland may read them fine because the oval is not on the fold .
In Vermont , the Obama oval is at the fold .

Iowa --Republican Party leaders in Poweshiek County want election officials to toss the votes of 50 Grinnell College students who listed the general campus address on their absentee ballots instead of their own campus addresses .
The complaints , filed Monday , allege that the college mailing address does n’t match the students ’ campus addresses .
Each Grinnell College student is assigned a post office box .

Hat tip to John Gideon for this one .
Florida-- The center of voting controversy in 2000 , Palm Beach , Florida is back in the news with their 2008 confusing ballot .
As Kerry Sanders demonstrated on MSNBC , the ballot is not a simple check box or fill in the dot like most of Florida ballots .
Rather , Palm Beach voters have to color in a space to complete an arrow .
If they check a box or circle the arrow , their vote is not necessarily counted .
He pointed out the lawyers watching the vote tabulation as the confusion set in .

Phi­los­o­phy as the Miss­ing Link An Eye - Open­ing Audit of Our School ’s Cur­ricu­lum
By : Kim­ber­ly Wick­ham
The ques­tion might be asked , “ Why would any­one want to teach phi­los­o­phy to pre-ado­les­cent chil­dren ? ” but there are very good rea­sons why one might want to take on such a lofty task .
I am not sug­gest­ing that the his­to­ry of phi­los­o­phy would be par­tic­u­lar­ly per­ti­nent for a young child to learn , but there is sub­stan­tial evi­dence to sup­port the devel­op­ment of an already nat­ur­al ten­den­cy towards philo­soph­i­cal thought .
Some may think that the pre-ado­les­cents have n’t got the cog­ni­tive devel­op­men­tal abil­i­ty to wrap their minds around such an elu­sive and sub­jec­tive study as phi­los­o­phy .
How­ev­er , devel­op­ing this skill has shown long term pos­i­tive effects .
These effects range from devel­op­ing crit­i­cal think­ing skills and cog­ni­tive abil­i­ty to rais­ing emo­tion­al matu­ri­ty and encour­ag­ing the child ’s sense of secu­ri­ty with­in his or her world .
For years there has been an empha­sis on cog­ni­tive and phys­i­cal aspects of chil­drens devel­op­ment , but recent­ly more atten­tion is being placed on both the social and emo­tion­al aspects of a child ’s devel­op­ment .
It is becom­ing rec­og­nized that a child ’s emo­tion­al matu­ri­ty has a big impact on their abil­i­ty to learn and process infor­ma­tion .
While that , at first blush , may seem an obvi­ous con­clu­sion there is a lit­tle more to the sto­ry .
A child ’s emo­tion­al matu­ri­ty and self esteem has a sig­nif­i­cant impact on his or her behav­ior as well .
An increas­ing num­ber of chil­dren are being iden­ti­fied as need­ing addi­tion­al learn­ing strate­gies and show­ing chal­leng­ing behav­iors .
Edu­ca­tion sys­tems are strug­gling to find cre­ative meth­ods to address these needs before the prob­lems arise .
It is rec­og­nized that a child ’s abil­i­ty to learn depends on how advanced they are at man­ag­ing per­son­al and social tasks .
Their work suf­fers when they are inca­pable of cop­ing effec­tive­ly with impor­tant skills such as the abil­i­ty to be aware of oth­ers feel­ings , man­age rela­tion­ships and be part of a social com­mu­ni­ty .
Encour­ag­ing philo­soph­i­cal thought and devel­op­ing crit­i­cal think­ing skills in pre-ado­les­cent chil­dren pro­vides a foun­da­tion for cog­ni­tive , social and emo­tion­al skills to flour­ish .
Chil­dren con­tin­u­al­ly ask philo­soph­i­cal ques­tions with­out prompt­ing , such as : “ If I squeeze my eyes shut real­ly tight­ly and I ca n’t see where I am , does that make where I am become some­where else ?
As adults used to nav­i­gat­ing the world in our cur­rent under­stand­ing of real­i­ty we answer these types of ques­tions fol­low­ing the strict rules of our present view , but it might be far more use­ful to the child to encour­age exam­i­na­tion of the ques­tion .
For exam­ple an appro­pri­ate response might be , “ What do you think about that ? ”
Fur­ther dis­cus­sion can take place when the child has had a chance to explore their own opin­ions and ideas about their phys­i­cal real­i­ty , for exam­ple .
A pre-ado­les­cent child may not move as fast and furi­ous­ly through this type of meta­phys­i­cal analy­sis as a col­lege stu­dent but they cer­tain­ly do have the cog­ni­tive abil­i­ty to use this type of crit­i­cal think­ing to expand their think­ing process­es .
So what is meant by Ëœcrit­i­cal think­ing ” exact­ly ?
The Amer­i­can Philo­soph­i­cal Asso­ci­a­tions Com­mit­tee on Pre-Col­lege Phi­los­o­phy describes it as pur­pose­ful , self - reg­u­la­to­ry judg­ment which results in inter­pre­ta­tion , analy­sis , eval­u­a­tion , and infer­ence , as well as expla­na­tion of the evi­den­tial , con­cep­tu­al , method­olog­i­cal , cri­te­ri­o­log­i­cal , or con­tex­tu­al con­sid­er­a­tions upon which that judg­ment is based ( Facione 1989 )
But for those of us look­ing for a sim­pler expla­na­tion it is essen­tial­ly the abil­i­ty to use rea­son­ably reflec­tive , focused think­ing to decide what to believe and do .
Chil­dren need to be encour­aged to reflect care­ful­ly on their own beliefs and be encour­aged to explore oth­er points of view .
Phi­los­o­phy encour­ages chil­dren to learn to think inde­pen­dent­ly as well as think and dis­cuss with oth­ers .
In order to gain the most advan­tage chil­dren need to be able to engage in open class­room dis­cus­sions on an ongo­ing basis .
By mas­ter­ing this type of think­ing the child devel­ops deep­er emo­tion­al lit­er­a­cy and learns to cre­ate a more thought­ful and pur­pose­ful life .
On anoth­er lev­el philo­soph­i­cal dis­cus­sion can be used to devel­op a deep­er under­stand­ing of ethics .
Dr. Stephen Law , a senior lec­tur­er in Phi­los­o­phy at Heathrop Col­lege , Uni­ver­si­ty of Lon­don explains the skills that are cul­ti­vat­ed in such dis­cus­sions as the fol­low­ing :
* reveal and ques­tion under­ly­ing assump­tions
* fig­ure out the per­haps unfore­seen con­se­quences of a moral deci­sion or point of view
* spot and diag­nose faulty rea­son­ing
* weigh up evi­dence fair­ly and impar­tial­ly
* make a point clear­ly and con­cise­ly
* take turns in a debate , and lis­ten atten­tive­ly with­out inter­rupt­ing
* argue with­out per­son­al­iz­ing a dis­pute
* look at issues from the point of view of oth­ers
* ques­tion the appro­pri­ate­ness , or the appro­pri­ate­ness of act­ing on , one ’s own feel­ings
He goes on to say , “ Acquir­ing these skills involves devel­op­ing , not just a lev­el of intel­lec­tu­al matu­ri­ty , but a fair degree of emo­tion­al matu­ri­ty too .
For exam­ple , turn - tak­ing requires patience and self - con­trol .
Judg­ing impar­tial­ly involves iden­ti­fy­ing and tak­ing account of your own emo­tion­al bias­es .
By think­ing crit­i­cal­ly and care­ful­ly about your own beliefs and atti­tudes , you may devel­op insights into your own char­ac­ter .
By step­ping out­side of your own view­point and look­ing at issues from the stand­point of anoth­er , you can devel­op a greater empa­thy with and under­stand­ing of oth­ers .
So by engag­ing in this kind of philo­soph­i­cal , crit­i­cal activ­i­ty , you are like­ly to devel­op , not only the abil­i­ty to rea­son cogent­ly , but also what now tends to be called “ emo­tion­al intel­li­gence . ” ( Law 2007 )
In order to gain the most advan­tage , chil­dren need to be able to engage in open class­room dis­cus­sions on an ongo­ing basis .
As a teacher of pre-ado­les­cent chil­dren I have had the oppor­tu­ni­ty to wit­ness these dis­cus­sions tak­ing place spon­ta­neous­ly .
In most instances I have been able to set aside the par­tic­u­lar les­son that might have been planned for the time and let the free - wheel­ing philo­soph­i­cal dis­cus­sion go on with min­i­mal but well - timed guid­ance .
Although it would have been ide­al to have had time set aside on a dai­ly basis for such dis­cus­sion there is a fair amount of pres­sure from the already demand­ing cur­ricu­lum , there­by restrict­ing the fre­quen­cy of these crit­i­cal­ly impor­tant dis­cus­sions .
As a writer of phi­los­o­phy for chil­dren , I give exam­ples with­in my sto­ries of my char­ac­ters explor­ing deep philo­soph­i­cal ques­tions in an alter­nate school set­ting as well as in every day events .
It is my hope that when chil­dren read my sto­ries they will have a sparked inter­est in explor­ing the deep­er ques­tions of life with their fam­i­lies and per­haps even insti­gate such dis­cus­sions with­in their class­rooms .
I also have great hope that the edu­ca­tion­al sys­tems cur­rent­ly in place will take a clos­er look at the ben­e­fit of adding philo­soph­i­cal dis­cus­sions to their cur­ricu­lums .
This would pro­vide an oppor­tu­ni­ty to advance the world ’s devel­op­ment by pop­u­lat­ing it with emo­tion­al­ly intel­li­gent and crit­i­cal­ly inquis­i­tive minds .

NYT to Raise New Questions on McCain ’s Health
One of the stories bubbling just over the surface is the issue of John McCain ’s health .
While the story of his frequent bouts with cancer have been well documented , and he did allow reporters to see his records in a very controlled setting , many have demanded a more thorough accounting of his various medical issue .
The New York Times will be shedding some additional light on this issue .
Story :
The New York Times will break new ground on the health of the presidential candidates and their running mates in a major expose set to be published in Monday ’s print edition .
Lawrence Altman — the veteran Times reporter , George Polk Award winner , and one of the few medical doctors working as a full - time journalist — has spent weeks working with the campaigns and medical professionals on the piece , sources say .
Much of the speculation centers on new questions about the status of John McCain ’s cancer raised by the story .
The Washington Post reported last week that a growing number of doctors believe that McCain ’s melanoma is “ more advanced than his physicians concluded and that the chance of recurrence is consequently higher . ”
But another peculiar facet of the Times story involves the McCain campaign ’s refusal , as of this weekend , to turn over Sarah Palin ’s medical information .
As I noted above the jump , there has been some frustration from various reporters and doctors about how the release of the previous records was handled :
“ We were given three hours to go over 1,200 pages of records .
That is a lot to go through .
It was very sort of cloak and dagger and I ’m sure they had their reasons .
Given that I had my medical training , I was able to hone in on what it thought was important more quickly .
But the pages were n’t numbered , so I had no way of knowing what was missing …
As a reporter I can only comment on what I saw but I ca n’t say by any means that this was complete …
As far as the secretiveness of it , what they said to us is that you ca n’t take anything out of the room , but you could make notes .
So it was a lot to go through in a short period of time . ”
This story should be interesting , and will probably provide more headaches for McCain .
All in all , not the way they probably wanted to start the week .
One morning during my medical residency many years ago , one of the senior doctors pulled me aside after rounds , as was his routine , to review the status of patients in the intensive care unit .
A few had single - organ failure  their lungs were n’t doing well , or their hearts were n’t beating efficiently .
A few struggled with double - organ failure .
But the majority of patients were battling multisystem organ failure , and their prognoses were not good .
“ People can survive one organ system failing and even two , ” the senior doctor said to me after we were finished .
“ But when that third one goes ... ”
He leaned forward and looked me in the eye .
“ Three strikes , and the game is over . ”
That remark came to mind recently when I thought about the crisis in primary care and President - elect Barack Obama ’s plans to make health care accessible to all .
Primary care is delivered in a variety of settings by a variety of professionals , including nurses and physicians ’ assistants , but it is anchored by family - practice doctors , general internists , pediatricians and , for many women , gynecologists .
As the nation ’s front - line doctors , primary care physicians address everything from chronic diseases , like diabetes , heart disease and high blood pressure , to more acute conditions , like pneumonias , intractable flus and potentially cancerous masses and lumps .
Exclusive Ministers led by Peter Mandelson are considering a power grab at the independent company at the centre of UK 's internet infrastructure , The Register can reveal .
Mandelson 's Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ( BERR ) has asked Nominet , which is in charge of the .co.uk registry , to justify its independence from Whitehall .
In a letter dated October 15 , senior civil servant David Hendon , BERR 's Director of Business Relations , asked Nominet chairman Bob Gilbert : " What arguments would you employ to convince my Ministers that the present relationship between government and the company is appropriate in ensuring that public policy objectives in relation to the management of the domain name system and the standing of the UK in the internet community are understood and taken into account ? "
' Unresolved concerns '
The letter followed a meeting on September 8 , when BERR said it was worried about Nominet 's constitution .
It puts key decisions to vote by the non-profit 's domain industry membership .
Hendon wrote : " At the conclusion of our meeting I was left with unresolved concerns about how Nominet 's constitution and structure addressed its responsibility to stakeholders other than its membership . "
As well as day - to - day running of the .co.uk registry , Nominet represents the UK at ICANN meetings .
The US organisation exercises overall control over the internet 's naming systems , and so has a very significant role in policy and development debates in which governments demand a voice .
Nominet also coordinates the UK's presence at the UN's Internet Governance Forum , an annual discussion of internet policy independent of ICANN .
In response to BERR 's letter , Nominet today announced it will conduct an " independent corporate governance review " , as suggested by Hendon .
Gilbert said : " We 've been actively looking to enhance corporate governance in line with best practice for some time now .
Our recent discussions with BERR have bought this desire to the fore once more and we feel that a rigorous , independent review will help us to achieve compliance with best practice efficiently and effectively . "
In a telephone interview , Gilbert told The Register he hoped the review will be completed by Christmas .
It will be conducted by an individual independent of Nominet and " someone very well respected by BERR " , but yet to be decided .
Power struggle
The issue of how Nominet should be run has long been a cause of divisions between its leaders and members .
At this year 's AGM in May , the executive proposed " special resolution 6 " for new powers that would let it appoint two extra board members without member approval .
The proposal failed to win the 75 per cent of votes required to change Nominet 's constitution .
Critics of the executive argued special resolution 6 would grant it autocratic control of the board by outnumbering the member - elected seats .
Chief executive Lesley Cowley said the measure was necessary as control of Nominet was " vulnerable to capture " by so - called domainers , who buy and sell web addresses for profit , and who Cowley said would not act in the interests of the wider UK internet .
Following the vote , the Nominet executive promised its structure would remain under review .
Sources familiar with debates over Nominet 's structure , on both sides , suggested BERR 's letter shows that the government would consider appointing people to unelected seats .
Any government involvement in Nominet affairs would mean wholesale reconstruction of the basis the company trades upon .
" It would require a complete rewriting of the constitution , or legislation , " Gilbert said .
One Nominet member , who asked not to be named , said : " They 're saying this in such a way that 90 per cent of the members will take a glance and not realise what is going on .
What concerns me is that the government has shown itself not competent to run the economy - what will happen if we put them in charge of DNS ? "
Gilbert said Nominet 's executive takes no position on whether it would want the government to take control .
While conceding that the government now considers Nominet a critical part of national infrastructure , he said : " We would wish Nominet to continue as a members ' organisation . "
Although Hendon is not specific in the letter about how BERR could increase its sway over Nominet , the intention is clear .
He wrote : " The domain system is , of course , a crucial element in the internet economy .
In this context I noted that many countries regarded their country code as a national asset , the management of which required the direct involvement of government . "
A BERR spokeswoman said : " All I can say at the moment is we have no plans . "
She described the letter as a " fact - finding " exercise , adding that Nominet 's interpretation that it could lead to a complete restructuring " is a matter for Nominet " .
Boardroom split
Also at May 's AGM , Jim Davies , a domain lawyer whose election the executive had campaigned against , was elected to Nominet 's board .
In its press release today , the non-profit appeared to allude to boardroom struggles caused by the appointment when it referred to " governance issues " , " which include conflicts of interest , [ and ] demand immediate and proactive action " .
Bob Gilbert said the allusion referred to complaints about " a board member " but refused to discuss his or her identity as it was " subject to a process yet to be completed " .
Jim Davies did not return a call requesting comment .

Update
While refusing to discuss its dispute with Jim Davies with us , Nominet has posted details here ( pdf ) .
Mississippi students told not to say Obama 's name David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 7 , 2008

This A controversy has erupted at a Mississippi junior high school over allegations that a bus driver and a coach threatened students with punishment for saying Barack Obama 's name .
The incidents became public when outraged parents called the studios of WAPT news in Pearl , Miss .
Some said their children were threatened by a bus driver with being written up and taken to the principal 's office , others that their children were told by a girls ' basketball coach they would be suspended .
Reginald Simpson , a student at Pearl Junior High , explained that when students on the bus started saying , " Obama is our president , " the bus driver told them she did n't want to hear his name .
One kid said , " This is history woman , " and according to Simpson , " She pulled over and kicked me and the kid off the bus . "
They were left waiting at the high school and later taken to their own school .
" They feel like they afraid to say who our president is , cause they afraid they going to be in trouble , " Reginald 's mother Canishia told WAPT .
" We teach our kids not to be racist , and here it is going on .
I just feel hurt by it . "
The Simpson family is black .
However , another mother whose son was on the bus and who also plans to confront school officials about the incident is white .
" This is what the whole election was about , " Venus Neagu told WAPT .
" It was supporting someone .
And now that they 've done it and they 're on the school bus , now they 're getting consequences for it . "
School officials reviewed video from the bus and promised that no students would be punished .
The superintendent released a statement saying , " It appears that some persons , out of disappointment and disillusionment with the election may have been so frustrated that they said something inappropriate to students .
We have taken appropriate steps with the bus driver and the coach . "
The WAPT story is also available here .

Ellen H. Brodsky Jailed Overnight After Being Barred From Oversight Several Times by Incumbent SoE Brenda Snipes
Third Such Arrest of an EI Activist Since Summer ...
Brad Friedman Byon
11/14/2008 , 5:06 pm PT
A candidate for Supervisor of Elections in Broward County , FL , was arrested yesterday , following threats and orders from her opponent , the current Broward SOE , Dr. Brenda Snipes .
Ellen H. Brodsky , the county 's first non-partisan candidate for SOE , had previously been barred from public counting and oversight on a number of occasions , at the county 's official Canvassing Board site and voting machine warehouse in Lauderhill , Florida .
After being taken into custody yesterday afternoon by three uniformed police officers , Brodsky was held overnight at the Broward County Jail even though the $ 25 --- that 's twenty - five dollar --- bail had been posted for her by her son by 8 pm last night .
She was finally released well after 5 am this morning .
( Note : An account of the arrest posted this morning on the South Florida Sun Sentinel 's blog incorrectly reported that Brodsky was " released on bail Thursday evening . "
A report later filed on their website by the same reporter correctly noted that she " was released from jail at 5:40 a.m. Friday . " )
Brodsky is a longtime member of a number of election integrity advocacy groups in Florida , including the Broward Election Reform Coalition , which she also founded .
Earlier this year , she determined to run against Snipes as a non-partisan candidate .
Brodsky is the latest in a string of election integrity advocates around the country who have been arrested in the course of attempting oversight of our election procedures --- although she is the first , to our knowledge , who also happens to be a candidate on the ballot .
The action has brought condemnation from a number of other election watchdogs and even other election officials in Florida who have characterized the arrest to The BRAD BLOG as an outrage and an abuse of power by Snipes and her office ...
" Outrageous "
" For a candidate , or a member of the public who wishes nothing more than to observe the process , to be taken into custody would be outrageous absent really extraordinary reasons --- none of which I 've heard articulated in this matter , " Leon County ( Tallahassee ) Supervisor of Elections Ion Sancho told The BRAD BLOG this afternoon .
" I 've been an election official for twenty years .
Not even one time has it become necessary to even threaten someone 's removal by law enforcement at any kind of meeting that I 've ever attended , " said Sancho who has spoken with Brodsky " on many occasions " and met her " a couple of times in face to face meetings . "
Ellen Theisen , of the non-partisan election integrity watchdog organization VotersUnite.org , was similarly troubled by the arrest .
" It 's outrageous that Ellen Brodsky was arrested and kept in jail overnight , " Theisen wrote via email today .
" Her work toward election integrity in Broward County has been dedicated , creative , effective , and respectful to the law .
The idea that she would be ' disruptive ' is nonsense .
I 'm convinced that was fabricated by those who appear to be threatened by her requests for transparency and accountability in the Broward County election process . "
Filmmaker David Earnhardt , who earlier this year released the award - winning documentary Uncounted : The New Math of American Elections , calls Brodsky " a remarkable woman who has dedicated the better part of the decade to demanding fair and honest elections . "
He told us that she hosted a screening of his film in Fort Lauderdale in late September .
" It 's offensive that she was arrested for this and kept in jail overnight .
I have no doubt that she was assertive in demanding her rights - but it 's ridiculous they would have even called the police in the first place , much less arrest her , " he said .
Brodsky was arrested , according to the inmate summary she was given upon release ( on which her name is misspelled as " Bordsky " ) , for " TRESPASS / STRUCTURE OR CONVEYANCE " and " DISORDERLY CONDUCT . "
The bond for the trespass claim was set at $ 25 , no bond amount was attached to the disorderly conduct charge , according to the summary .
" A total abuse of power "
" It was horrible , " Brodsky told us by phone today , concerning " the whole process of being in jail overnight . "
" The arrest was a total abuse of power on Brenda Snipes ' part .
She had given the orders .
The buck stops with her . "
" I did n't do anything .
They just want to eliminate any kind of critics , " she explained , following a number of weeks when she had occasionally been allowed to monitor testing , counting and recount processes by the county Canvassing Board .
" They wanted to eliminate me from the process , because I 'm the only one who is on top of these things .
I go out of my way to be an expert on this , to watch what 's going on , " she said in a detailed recounting of the problems she 's faced with Snipes and her deputies over the last several months .
At times she was barred from oversight of testing and counting , other times she was allowed in under strict rules , often accompanied by a number of armed guards , she told us .
In the meantime , a number of public records requests she 's made have gone unanswered , including information she sought after noticing that voting machines had been opened for use beginning on October 1 , even though early voting was not scheduled to begin until weeks later .
During her last visit to the Canvassing Board to monitor counting and the processing of ballots of November 7th , she was evicted after asking a number of questions to Canvassing Board judges , even though she raised her hand , as instructed , and even waited a full hour and a half before being allowed to ask her questions , according to her account .
" The first question I asked on the 7th , " she says , Lauderhills officer C.Y .
Bell " jumped on me . "
Literally , she says .
" She was standing there the whole time ready to pounce on me .
Her taser thing was right in front of my face .
It was very scary .
She jumped on me , grabbed my arm , she was ready to throw me out then and there . "
" Then I screamed ' Help , canvassing board , I did n't do anything . '
This was like that ' Do n't tase me , bro ' thing . " she explained .
" That got their attention .
I then waited an hour and a half , and then they took a break and I reminded her [ Judge Zeller , President of the canvassing board ] that I was told I could ask a question . "
She asked three questions , the last of which concerned why she was not allowed in the building the night before , at 7 pm , when she believes the counting board was in session , which should have required the ability for public oversight under Florida 's Sunshine Law .
She then says she was ejected from the counting room , and told by Officer Bell , " if If you ever come back here , we 'll have a warrant for you .
If you ever come back to this voting machine warehouse or canvassing board , we 'll have you arrested . "
After discussing the matter with her attorney , Brodsky returned yesterday with a friend for a 1 pm counting that was listed on the county 's website .
She says she recorded much of what occurred on her cell phone 's recorder .
" We saw the notice on the door , proceeded to ask , ' can we come in ? ' because the Canvassing Board was supposed to meet at 1 pm .
But the first thing I was told was 'we do n't want you in the building , you 're not allowed in the building . '
Next I was told the canvassing board is not meeting , even though it was posted on the door , and on the website . "
" While I 'm trying to inquire about the canvassing board meeting , " she says , Snipes deputy Fred Bellis " is busy photographing me , calling on his cell phone to who knows where . "
Soon two officers arrived and suggested there was a warrant out for her arrest .
But " after they researched , they said ' yeah , there is no warrant out for your arrest . ' "
Then Officer Bell arrived , met with the other officers , and " all three , in a concerted effort , handcuff me and throw me into the back of a police car . "
Latest in a string of such arrests
Brodsky 's arrest is the latest such detention of an election integrity advocate .
In September , activist John Brakey of AuditAZ was arrested during a mandatory post-election " audit " in Pima County ( Tucson ) , AZ , after questioning officials about dozens of ballot bags that had missing or broken security seals .
In August , Phil Lindsey of ShowMeTheVote.org was arrested and thrown in jail in Jackson County , MO , when he refused to show a photo ID to pollworkers who had wrongly insisted he could not vote without one .
The demand by the election officials was in violation of state law .
" I will tell you , my feeling from a lot of officials is they do n't like being questioned , " explained Tallahassee 's Sancho , who was chosen by the Florida Supreme Court to oversee the 2000 Presidential recount in the state .
" I would caution officials over the removal of any observer from the elections process , because only by keeping the process as open as possible can we maintain credibility within the elections process , " he says .
" Elections officials in Florida , " he continued , " really are uniquely placed , because of the power we have over the process --- and it 's pretty immense --- so there 's a tendency , a lot of times , for election officials to act in an autocratic manner .
I 'm not saying [ Snipes ] did , but it would n't surprise me . "
" The power that we as elected officials have , has to be used very , very , very judiciously , " he added .
" What this has to be about is , fundamentally , the process .
Quite frankly , I 've never found the use of police powers an effective answer to people who are looking for the truth , " Sancho told us .
For Brodsky , she now wonders what will become of her ability to oversee her own election which , according to the results reported by officials , show that she lost in a landslide .
" It was a difficult time to run as an independent , with Barack Obama on the ballot , " she noted .
Her opponent , Snipes , ran as a Democrat , though she was originally appointed by then - Gov. Jeb Bush ( R ) after he suspended her predecessor in 2003 .
But it 's now virtually impossible for Brodsky to know if her election was conducted fairly .
" I 'm gonna have a hard time auditing my own election if I 'm not allowed to be there , and if my public records requests are n't getting answered , " she said .
LATE UPDATE : Brodsky joined us for our weekly guest appearance on the Peter B. Collins Show today to discuss her ordeal .
The interview ( app. 16 mins ) follows , or can be downloaded ( MP3 ) here .
Additional note , it was too late this afternoon on the West Coast to contact Snipes for her point of view on all of this , but we refer you again to the Sun - Sentinel 's coverage for some of that here and here .
UPDATE 12/9/08 : A video tape of the arrest --- revealing just how outrageous that it was , and that there was , in fact , no " disorderly conduct " by Brodsky , as speciously claimed by the arrest report --- is now posted here ...
UPDATE 3/11/09 : All charges are dropped against Brodsky .

However , an Instapundit reader noted that the US government may impose a stiff exit tax for the more productive people seeking to leave :
… ” Going John Galt ” is not that easy — Congress quietly passed an “ exit tax ” earlier this year to penalize any ( somewhat ) high net worth US resident that decides to vote with their feet .
As quoted in the links below , the U.S. government , through the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Act of 2008 ( the HEART bill , for short , and I am not making this up ) , effective June 17 , 2008 , imposes an “ exit tax ” on certain citizens and long - term residents who expatriate or terminate their long - term residency .
Such individuals , called covered expatriates , will be deemed to have sold all of their worldwide property for its fair market value on the day before expatriating or terminating U.S. residency , and will be liable for U.S. tax on the amount deemed realized in excess of $ 600,000 ( subject to cost of living adjustments ) .
Covered expatriates are : citizens and long - term residents who ( a ) have an average annual U.S. tax liability for the previous five years of $ 139,000 ( adjusted for inflation ) , ( b ) have a net worth of at least $ 2,000,000 on the expatriation date , or ( c ) fail to certify compliance with all U.S. federal tax obligations for the previous five years .

An engraving of Nikolao Keian , one of the martyrs being remembered on Monday
Enlarge Image
Christians from all over Japan have gathered for a ceremony in Nagasaki to honour 187 people who were killed as a consequence of their faith during the 17th Century .
Roman Catholics maintain that the campaign against Christianity which took place in Japan in the early 1600s was more ferocious than any other religious persecution in the history of the Church .
They estimate that tens of thousands of Japanese Christians were put to death , many after being tortured .
During that period , Japan 's shogunate rulers were attempting to unify the country and repel foreigners .
They expelled missionaries from Spain and Portugal who had won many converts , especially in western Japan .
Christianity was regarded as a malevolent influence on Japanese affairs .
In the early part of the 17th Century , an attempt was made to eradicate Christianity altogether .
At the time there were approximately 400,000 Catholics and many who did not renounce their faith were killed .
Crucifixion and burning at the stake were common forms of execution .
Women and children
At the ceremony organised by the Roman Catholic Church in Nagasaki on Monday , 187 people who were killed between 1603 and 1639 were beatified , as well as a Japanese priest by the name of Julian Nakaura who was put to death in the late 15th Century .
Many Japanese people today will find it difficult to understand why the martyrs gave up their lives
Father Paul Miki Murakami Beatification is sometimes regarded as a step on the path to sainthood , although in this case the church says its primary aim is to commemorate the sacrifice of the martyrs .
Similar ceremonies have taken place periodically in Japan over the past 150 years .
The service in Nagasaki followed historical research which uncovered new details of the Christians who died during the 17th Century .
They included people from all over Japan and from all levels of society , including lay people and priests , women and children , commoners and samurai .
Decline Father Paul Miki Murakami , a Roman Catholic priest in Tokyo , says : " Many Japanese people today will find it difficult to understand why the martyrs gave up their lives , but these were in a sense a spiritual elite .
Few Japanese today describe themselves as Christian " Japan remains a spiritual country in some ways , but during the economic boom period of the 1960s and 1970s , many people turned from religion and began to focus more on money and secular matters .
They believed a strong economy would make them happy and turned into economic animals . "
Father Murakami believes this is one reason why membership of the Catholic Church has declined among native Japanese in recent decades , although it has been strengthened by an influx of foreigners from Korea and the Philippines .
Less than 1 % of Japanese people define themselves as Christian .
Most subscribe to Buddhism or the traditional faith of Shinto , although those who profess deep religious convictions are rare and it is usually regarded as impolite to talk about religion with strangers .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States will insist on strong protections for the environment and for workers in future trade deals , President - elect Barack Obama said on Friday as he introduced his nominee to be chief U.S. trade negotiator .
Former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk “ will help make sure that any agreement I sign as president protects the rights of all workers , promotes the interests of all Americans , strengthens American businesses , and preserves the planet we all share , ” Obama said at a news conference in Chicago .
The focus on what Kirk described as a “ values - driven ” trade agenda could complicate efforts to complete the 7 - year - old Doha round of world trade talks .
Many developing countries are suspicious of efforts to include binding labor and environmental provisions in trade pacts because they believe they could be used as an excuse by rich countries to block imports .
Obama has promised one of his first acts as president would be to call the president of Mexico and prime minister of Canada to begin negotiations to “ fix NAFTA ” by adding stronger labor and environmental provisions .
Although Kirk is little known in global trade circles , Obama said Kirk ’s experience as a big city mayor from 1994 to 2001 prepared him to be U.S. trade representative .
“ Ron helped steer one of the largest economies .
He ’s seen the promise of trade , but also its pitfalls , and he knows there is nothing inconsistent about standing up for free trade and standing up for American workers , ” Obama said .
Obama opposes a free trade deal the Bush administration negotiated with Colombia on grounds that the staunch U.S. ally has not done enough to reduce murders of trade unionists .
He also wants to renegotiate a Bush administration trade deal with South Korea .
Obama has said the pact would open the U.S. market to more South Korean cars without sufficiently opening that country ’s market to more U.S. auto exports .
This chart shows the IEA WEO 2008 forecast together with Sam 's forecast derived from using Megaprojects sanctioned capacities and yet to be sanctioned capacities ( including yet to find oil - YTF ) .
By 2020 , the IEA 's forecast is significantly greater than Sam 's forecast .
Until quality data about production history , reserves and future development plans including capacities are obtained for fields in secretive OPEC countries , forecasts beyond 2012 are highly uncertain , regardless of the source .
While quality data remain unavailable , the world 's future energy security , in particular liquid fuels supply security , remains an extremely high risk .
A wide variety of methods can be used to forecast future oil production .
Each will provide different indications .
Sam and I each make projections with megaprojects data , using somewhat different methods .
Sam ’s projections are shown in Figure 6 .
My forecasts are shown in Figures 8 , 9 , and 10 .
Despite our differing methods , the indications we produce are all substantially lower than the indications of the IEA .
In this analysis , Samuel Foucher ( “ Khebab ” ) and I ( Tony Eriksen or “ ace ” ) present an update of Wikipedia Megaprojects data .
We also provide forecasts of future oil production , reflecting the Megaprojects data .
The IEA uses megaprojects in its analysis and we reconcile our Megaprojects information to the data they provide in their report .
1. Background
This is a special update on the Wikipedia Oil Megaprojects Database , maintained by the Oil Megaprojects task force , to coincide with the release of the IEA WEO 2008 .
Wikipedia Megaprojects was developed in late 2007 .
Data about each project includes country , production capacity , reserves and most importantly , project references .
There are difficulties with forecasting production rates using referenced production capacities .
The production capacity , provided by references , is usually the capacity of the production platform and associated infrastructure .
The future production from a field is often significantly less than the capacity .
A very good example of production additions falling short of capacity additions is Brazil , for which there was almost 1,000 kbd of capacity additions in 2006 and 2007 .
The average crude and condensate production for the first quarter of 2006 , prior to 2006 capacity addition , was 1.69 mbd .
The average production for the first eight months of 2008 was 1.80 mbd , an increase of 0.11 mbd .
This means that only about 10 % of the almost 1,000 kbd of capacity additions became net production additions .
Probable causes of this small net increase is that Brazil 's existing offshore field decline rates are incredibly high and production , from new fields and expansions , is well below production targets .
Capacity Addition versus Production Addition – Pyrenees Project
An example of forecast production addition being lower than the capacity addition is the Pyrenees project , scheduled for first oil in 2010 .
The operator , BHP Billiton states that the capacity of the Pyrenees FPSO is 96 kbd which is much higher than the forecast 55 kbd addition , estimated using data supplied by Apache , the other Pyrenees partner .
Apache presented this chart from their October 2008 presentation .
The chart shows the forecast production growth by project , net to Apache .
The peak production addition from Pyrenees is 7 million barrels of oil equivalent ( mboe ) in 2010 which is the same as 19 kboed , slightly less than Apache ’s press release figure of 20 kboed .
Apache has a 29 % interest in Pyrenees which means the forecast total Pyrenees production is about 65 kboed .
As the forecast oil production addition is needed , an estimate of gas production is needed .
Fortunately , BHP Billiton states that gas production capacity is 60 million cubic feet of gas per day which is equal to about 10 kboed .
Consequently , the forecast oil production addition is about 55 kbd , the peak in 2010 , much less that the FPSO capacity of 96 kbd .
Apache ’s forecast production from Pyrenees also shows a high decline rate , a common characteristic of many small offshore field developments .
In 2010 , annual production is forecast to be 55 kbd and in 2014 , only 15 kbd .
This corresponds to an average annual production decline rate of 28 % .
The Pyrenees decline rate from 2010 to 2011 is almost the same at 29 % .
Since Apache gave a production forecast for Pyrenees , the more accurate 55 kbd oil production addition for Pyrenees is shown in Megaprojects 2010 , rather than the higher 96 kbd capacity .
Unfortunately , for almost all other Megaprojects supply additions including Brazil 's , the higher , less accurate , project capacity additions are shown due to a lack of data on forecast project production additions .
If this important issue is not considered then oil production forecasts are likely to be too high using unadjusted Megaprojects annual supply additions data .
Megaprojects data can be used to forecast production using two methods .
The first is to add up the capacity additions for each year and apply decline rates , as in the chart above .
The second is to forecast production by each megaproject , then aggregate these forecasts to derive a world forecast , discussed later .
The chart below shows how capacity addition profiles have evolved since December 2007 .
Many of the large capacity reductions from May 2008 to November 2008 are due to excluding projects which have not yet been sanctioned , from countries such as Iraq and Iran .
The latest November 2008 profile is also a result of updating from the IEA WEO 2008 , oil company reports and project delays due to the current credit crisis and low oil prices .
Fig 2 - Previous Megaprojects Annual Capacity Addition Profiles
2. IEA WEO 2008 Project Data
The Wikipedia Megaproject data have been reconciled to the IEA WEO 2008 project data and corresponding revisions have been made to the Wikipedia Megaprojects .
Project / field names and data from WEO pages 263 , 268- 276 , 299 , 312 , 313 , and 314 were used for this reconciliation .
The Wiki Oil tables show capacity additions , excluding bio-fuels and including GTL / CTL , of 25.7 mbd from 2008 to 2015 , inclusive .
These capacity additions , unlikely to all become future production , are based on additions from projects which are likely to start .
The project names and associated data contained in the WEO relate to about 16.3 mbd from 2008 to 2015 .
Consequently , there is about 9.4 mbd of project capacity not referred to in the WEO 2008 .
It would have been much better if the IEA included a full sanctioned project list , from 2008 to 2015 , as an appendix to their WEO .
From 2016 to 2030 , the projects the WEO considers are mainly unsanctioned projects .
The WEO forecasts that all of these projects will be successful in the timeframe provided .
It is doubtful that anyone can forecast individual projects accurately so far in the future .
This 2030 forecast is based on hope and the validity of the WEO forecast beyond 2015 needs to be seriously questioned .
There were some differences in project capacities between Megaprojects and the IEA , but fortunately the degree of consistency was good .
One of the bigger differences was for Project Kuwait .
Megaprojects included only 50 kbd for Project Kuwait , since no formal development plan has been accepted by the Kuwaiti parliament , and the WEO has 450 kbd .
Offsetting this difference is the Wiki forecast for Vankor at 420 kbd compared to WEO at 200 kbd .
WEO has a BS500 Urugua project at 175 kbd whereas Wiki excludes this project because it was not on Petrobras project schedule from their June 2008 presentation .
In contrast , Wiki has a greater project capacity for Petrobras ' large Tupi discovery ( 300 kbd ) , as compared to only 100 kbd from the WEO .
The WEO has a 120 kbd Burgan expansion but Wiki excludes this because no internet reference could be located .
WEO has two oil sands projects of 180 kbd ( Northern Lights and Muskeg River ph 2 ) ;
Wiki excludes these because of indefinite delays .
3. Sanctioned Capacity Additions from MegaProjects and Yet to be Sanctioned Projects
The updated Megaprojects world supply additions are shown below .
A decline in annual project capacity additions from 2008 and on is evident .
In addition to the Megaprojects supply additions , the chart also includes a future capacity estimate of a total of 15 mbd for yet to be sanctioned projects , including yet to find oil .
This unsanctioned / YTF capacity is expected to start in 2012 and increase to 2020 .
Yet to be sanctioned capacity of 10 mbd includes capacity from discovered fields mainly located in the countries of Iraq , Brazil , USA ( deepwater Gulf of Mexico ) , Saudi Arabia , Canada ( oil sands ) and Russia .
In addition , there is another 5 mbd of yet to be sanctioned capacity from fields yet to be found ( YTF ) , which is consistent with Figure 11.5 of the IEA WEO 2008 .
These yet to be sanctioned projects can be expected to help slow the decline of oil production in the future .
Fig 3 - Megaprojects Annual Capacity Additions and Yet to be Sanctioned / YTF Additions
The chart below shows the project contributions ranked by size .
From 2008 to 2011 , note the large capacity additions from projects under 100 kbd .
Many of the larger projects , greater than 250 kbd capacity , are from Saudi Arabia .
In 2008 , there are two large NGL projects , about 300 kbd each , due to start .
In addition , two other large projects are Khursaniyah , split into 300 kbd for 2008 and 200 kbd in 2009 , and Shaybah , 250 kbd in 2009 .
The problem of capacity additions being greater than production additions for projects was previously discussed for Brazil .
This problem also applies to Saudi Arabia , as data about field reserves and production are state secrets .
In the chart below , Saudi Aramco claims that Khurais will add capacity of 1,200 kbd , split into 600 kbd for 2008 and another 600 kbd for 2009 .
As the data quality about Khurais is poor , there is a high degree of uncertainty about Khurais true capacity additions .
Instead of adding 1,200 kbd , it might add only 800 kbd .
Fig 4 - Megaprojects Annual Capacity Additions by Contribution
4. Production Forecast , using Annual Supply Additions
Wikipedia Megaprojects also includes other useful charts about sanctioned capacity additions .
This chart shows the estimated percentage of new supply additions from 2003 to 2020 , by country .
The top three contributing countries are Saudi Arabia , Brazil , Angola , Canada and Iran .
An additional chart splits the annual capacity additions into the categories of crude oil / lease condensate , NGL and unconventional .
Starting in 2008 , capacity additions from NGL and unconventional oil gain importance .
This third chart shows the annual capacity additions split between OPEC and Non-OPEC .
Finally , this fourth chart shows the capacity additions from each year since 2002 .
Below is a scenario for future supply growth based on the Megaproject database and a 5 % decline rate for the resource base .
The last monthly numbers from the EIA seem to confirm an increase in supply of about 1 mbpd , shown by the Net New Capacity additions below .
2008 should see a small supply growth from 2007 .
However , 2009 appears very small and given that field production additions are usually below the corresponding field capacity additions , it is highly likely the net new production addition for 2009 will be negative .
Negative additions are forecast for 2010 and 2011 .
Biofuels are not included in these forecasts .
Increases from biofuels production should partially offset these negative additions .
2012 and beyond show further negative additions which should be partially offset by yet to sanctioned / YTF capacity additions .
Nevertheless , when all these sources of capacity additions are aggregated , the total liquids production is likely to remain on peak plateau , perhaps for another two years , discussed later and shown by Fig 9 .
Fig 5 - Gross and Net New Annual Capacity Additions
The decline rates applied to the existing resource base and annual supply additions give the forecast in the chart below .
A 5 % decline rate for the existing resource base is assumed partly because this decline rate was already used by the IEA in its Medium Term Oil Market Report , July 2008 .
This decline rate of 5 % is higher than the 4.5 % decline rate used by CERA .
However , considering that past forecasts of both the IEA and especially CERA have been extremely optimistic , a higher 5 % decline rate is thought to be more realistic .
This decline rate is higher than the least squares fit of 4.35 % from the IEA WEO 2008 as discussed in the Oil Drum 's recent story on The 2008 IEA WEO - Production Decline Rates .
Note also that the assumption of one decline rate applying to the resource base for all years is very simplistic .
Ideally , separate decline rates should be applied to each country and to each year .
Note also that the assumed decline rate of 5 % for the resource base is much lower than the IEA WEO 's natural , or underlying , decline rate of 9 % for post peak fields , from page 43 of the IEA WEO 2008 Executive Summary .
A peak plateau of just over 80 mbd is forecast for 2007 to 2011 .
Unfortunately , this forecast is about 25 mbd below that of the IEA in 2020 .
The IEA forecast is optimistic and expects that the supply should be able to increase sufficiently to meet demand , if there is sufficient investment .
Fig 6 - Possible Future Supply Capacity Scenario for Crude Oil and NGL
An important feature of the chart above is that the forecast from 2004 using Megaprojects has been about 1 mbd below the actual production from the EIA and the IEA .
This difference is to be expected as Megaprojects project data does not include data about every capacity addition in the world .
Megaprojects focuses mainly on project capacity additions , from new fields , workovers and enhanced oil recovery programs , greater than 20 kbd .
The most likely explanation for most of the 1 mbd difference between actual production data and the Megaprojects forecast are production capacity increases from maintenance programs .
These programs are excluded from Megaprojects and can be significant .
It is commonplace to do annual maintenance on fields , for example in the North Sea and Middle East .
Saudi Arabia has a Maintain Production Potential ( MPP ) Program .
This program is not considered as a separate project to add capacity , but if this program were not done , then production declines from some of Saudi Arabia 's fields would have occurred .
One of the risks of these types of MPP programs is that keeping production rates higher may cause overproduction from the reservoirs due to higher extraction rates .
If the extraction rates are too high and recovery factors are not increased , then future production decline could become high as it becomes equal to the high extraction rate .
Colin Campbell summarises this effect , except that he uses the term " depletion rate " instead of " extraction rate " .
Depletion Rate is defined as annual production as a percentage of the amount Yet - to - Produce at the end of the preceding year .
It tends to increase in a country until the midpoint of depletion , when it stabilises and equates to the Decline Rate , the percentage change in production from one year to the next .
The reason is that in practice it is mainly controlled by the large early fields , which are already in decline , giving a composite Depletion Rate , which effectively masks the impact of any late stage small discoveries .
The supply addition forecast from Canadian tar sands does not assume any depletion nor does it ramp up over time .
Nonetheless , we get a reasonable forecast as shown on Figure 6.b below .
Fig 6.b - Supply Additions from the Canadian Tar Sand megaproject .
5. Production Forecasts , using Megaproject Supply Additions
The Megaprojects capacity additions can also be used to forecast oil production , based on a bottom up project basis rather than using an annual capacity basis as above .
In the case of the project being a new field start - up , the field production profile takes the generic form shown in the chart below .
There is a ramp up to a peak plateau , followed by sustained production , and next a production rate decline until the field is abandoned .
For a small offshore field , the ramp up time can be quick in months with a very short plateau .
Larger onshore fields can have peak plateau production periods lasting decades .
Fig 7 - Generic Field Production Profile
The 2009 Megaprojects data table has about 50 projects , a combination of new start - ups and expansions , each of which will have its own forecast production profile .
The forecast production of projects from this year and all the other years are aggregated to produce a world oil forecast .
If only the crude , condensate and oil sands projects are selected from Megaprojects then the crude , condensate and oil sands forecast to Dec 2012 can be calculated , and is as shown below .
The peak production month has probably occurred in the past , on July 2008 , at 74.94 mbd .
The production decline rate , an output of the forecasting model , is about 3 % / year , starting within the next year .
Fig 8 - Crude Oil and Lease Condensate Production to 2012 ( bottom up forecast ) - click to enlarge
The same procedure for crude oil and lease condensate projects can be repeated for the other project data from Megaprojects which includes data for capacity additions from natural gas liquids ( NGL ) , gas to liquids ( GTL ) and coal to liquids ( CTL ) .
If bio-fuels production data and processing gains are included , then forecast total liquids can be estimated , shown in the chart below .
The peak month of July 2008 for total liquids is 87.9 mbd .
This is the same as the peak month for crude oil and lease condensate .
The peak year for total liquids is forecast to be 2008 at 86.7 mbd , including bio-fuels .
Colin Campbell has also forecast the peak year for total liquids to be 2008 at 85.3 mbd , which is lower because bio-fuels are excluded .
Fig 9 - Total Liquids Supply to 2012 ( bottom up forecast ) - click to enlarge
The total world supply additions of crude and condensate ( C&C ) , including the yet to be sanctioned capacities , are unlikely to be sufficient to produce a rebound in the C&C production .
Consequently the C&C production is forecast to continue declining beyond December 2012 , possibly to the end of this century as shown below .
The forecast to 2012 is from the chart above and from 2013 to 2100 is an exponential fit to the ultimate recoverable reserves ( URR ) .
The URR is a bottom up aggregation of the URRs of all of the oil producing countries .
In Figure 10 , there are two forecast scenarios shown .
The first , represented by a URR of 1.92 trillion barrels is shown by the red line .
This scenario , up to 2020 , is consistent with the sanctioned and yet to be sanctioned capacities .
The second , represents a URR of 2.20 trillion barrels which is the amount estimated by Colin Campbell , from his ASPO monthly newsletter .
This second scenario is possible , but less likely .
Colin Campbell may use a slightly more optimistic URR but his forecast predicts peak total liquids in 2008 , excluding bio-fuels , which is consistent with the forecast below .
The dark blue line shows the production profile for OPEC countries of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and the UAE .
It 's an interesting coincidence that the world C&C production 74 mbd plateau occurs during the same years , 2005 to 2008 , as the OPEC Core 14 mbd plateau .
If further project delays occur , as a result of low oil prices and funding constraints due to the current credit crisis , then forecast C&C production could fall below the red line , after 2012 .
The IEA WEO 2008 report is a start in the right direction , as it has begun its bottom up field analysis .
However , for the bottom up field analysis to have meaning , third party audited data on many of the OPEC fields must be acquired .
For example , in the IEA WEO 2005 , an estimate of oil initially in place for the world 's largest field , Ghawar in Saudi Arabia , was 300 billion barrels ( Gb ) .
In the IEA WEO 2008 it decreased down to 250 Gb .
Other analysts estimate OIIP of 200 Gb .
Recovery factors can only be guessed as Saudi Arabia keeps reservoir data as a state secret .
Until quality data are obtained from fields in secretive OPEC countries , forecasts beyond 2012 are highly uncertain .
The forecast range in Figure 10 for 2030 is between 37 and 44 mbd , including oil sands .
The IEA WEO 2008 crude and condensate forecast for 2030 , from Figure 11.1 and Figure 11.12 , is about 83 mbd , including oil sands .
This massive forecasting difference of potentially more than 40 mbd is an extremely high risk to future energy security and will only be resolved through acquiring quality data on all of the world 's fields .

6. Comparison of the IEA WEO Forecasting Method to the Two Forecasting Methods using Megaprojects Data
The IEA WEO forecasting method assumes very low decline rates and very high remaining resources which can be changed into increased production if there is enough investment .
The IEA 's forecast assumes that there are almost 2.5 trillion barrels remaining conventional oil and NGLs .
In reality , this number is probably closer to 1.4 trillion , an overstatement of about 1.1 trillion as discussed in the Oil Drum 's recent story on The 2008 IEA WEO - Oil Reserves and Resources .
Since 2000 , the IEA has consistently produced optimistic supply forecasts which easily meet demand .
The IEA 's forecasting method leads to an overoptimistic supply forecast .
The last year that the IEA gave somewhat realistic forecasts was in their IEA WEO 1998 .
In this report , page 100 , Fig 7.7 , the IEA 's forecast for 2030 was about 55 mbd , using ultimate conventional oil reserves of 2.3 trillion barrels .
This number is 20 mbd less than the forecast in the IEA WEO 2008 and deserves a full explanation from the IEA .
In stark contrast to the WEO forecasting method , the two forecasting methods discussed here are based on robust project data from Megaprojects .
Nevertheless , even these two methods have differences .
The first forecast method , using annual supply additions , shown in Fig 6 , indicates a crude oil , lease condensate and NGL production rate of about 71 mbd in 2020 .
The second forecast method , using project supply additions , shown in Fig 10 , indicates 56 mbd for crude oil and lease condensate in 2020 , using the higher URR of 2.2 trillion barrels .
A reasonable forecast for NGLs in 2020 is that from Sadad Al Husseini , at about 8 mbd , which is also similar to the number used to generate Fig 9 .
This gives a total of 64 mbd crude oil , lease condensate and NGL for 2020 .
The first forecast method indicates 71 mbd crude oil , lease condensate and NGL in 2020 , while the second gives 64 mbd , a significant difference of 7 mbd .
How can two methods both using the same Megaprojects data give different forecasts ?
The first forecast in Fig 6 assumes that 100 % of the total annual capacity addition from the Megaprojects data becomes a production addition in that year .
In reality , projects can be delayed or cancelled which has a negative impact on production additions .
However , the main reason for the different forecasts is that the first method uses decline rates for global annual capacity .
The second method uses decline rates for individual fields which are aggregated to give country forecasts , which are in turn aggregated to give a global forecast .
A good example to illustrate the difference is Brazil .
The first method would take Brazil 's capacity additions and sum them together with capacity additions from other countries to get a global capacity addition .
Next a single global decline rate would be applied to the capacity additions .
Megaprojects shows Brazil 's capacity additions of 1.53 mbd from 2004 to 2007 .
The production for Brazil for 2003 was an average of 1.50 mbd ( EIA ) .
The year to date average to August 2008 was 1.80 mbd.
Brazil 's net production additions since 2003 was 0.27 mbd based on a capacity addition of 1.53 mbd .
This means that the capacity additions are not becoming production additions .
The second forecast method uses decline rates specific to Brazil , which in deepwater can be as high as 20 % .
In addition , almost all of Brazil 's capacity additions are the nameplate capacities of the FPSOs , not the production capacities of the underlying fields .
For example , a 100 kbd FPSO might be connected to a field but perhaps only 50 kbd , on an annual average , might be produced through the FPSO .
Individual country forecasts can take these factors into account , which cannot be done by a forecast using global data .
Colin Campbell also does country forecasts first , before doing a global forecast .
His forecast for Brazil takes into account the nature of Brazil 's fields and is currently showing a peak production plateau of just over 2 mbd , despite all of Brazil 's claimed capacity additions .
Another example of Megaprojects capacity additions being possibly overstated is Mexico .
The first forecasting method would include Mexico 's capacity additions of 483 kbd , from Megaprojects 2008 and 2009 , in the global annual capacity additions for those years .
However , some of these Mexican project supply additions are heavy oil , requiring huge numbers of production wells , and are expected to take over ten years to ramp up to peak production .
In contrast , the second method would forecast Mexico 's production taking into account the long ramp up period , giving less production additions for 2008 and 2009 than the first method .
Forecasting global oil production is difficult .
A project by project basis can be used to produce country forecasts .
The second method aggregates these country forecasts to produce a global forecast .
Jean Laherrere and Colin Campbell have been doing global forecasts for several years but using mainly a logistic curve fitted to ultimate recoverable reserves for the world .
This method ignores the reality of projects needed to produce oil .
Laherrere has acknowledged the importance of projects in his latest world forecast as he states that this is why , for the short term , it is better to rely on the study of already planned large oil developments = megaprojects .
Megaprojects data can be used to forecast until 2012 , with some accuracy .
Afterwards , a mathematical production rate fit to remaining recoverable reserves can be performed to give a long term forecast , as in Fig 10 .
7. Summary
The Wikipedia Megaprojects database contains extensive information about past and future projects to 2020 , including many useful summary charts .
The projects listed are mainly those that have been sanctioned .
Consequently , estimates are made for capacity additions from yet to be sanctioned projects and additions from yet to find oil .
When all of these sources of capacity additions are aggregated then production forecasts can be made .
Both forecasting methods use Megaprojects data , annual supply additions and project supply additions , and show significantly lower forecasts than those from the IEA WEO 2008 .
The IEA forecast for crude oil and natural gas liquids is just over 95 mbd in 2020 , about 25 mbd greater than the 70 mbd forecast by the annual supply addition method shown in Fig 6 .
The forecasts , using the project capacity addition method , show lower results for the reasons discussed in Section 6 .
Fig 9 shows total liquids forecast below the IEA forecast .
The crude oil , lease condensate and tar sands forecast in Fig 10 shows a huge gap of at least 40 mbd between the IEA forecast and the forecast assuming the higher remaining URR .
Until quality data are obtained from fields in secretive OPEC countries , forecasts beyond 2012 are highly uncertain .
The IEA WEO 2008 does not have quality data on the critical OPEC countries .
The huge forecasting differences between the IEA WEO 2008 and the results from the two methods discussed here represents an extremely high risk to future energy security and will only be resolved through acquiring quality data about production and reserves on all of the world 's fields .

( CNN ) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that despite President Bush 's low approval ratings , people will soon " start to thank this president for what he 's done . "
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice says " there is no greater honor than to serve this country , "
" So we can sit here and talk about the long record , but what I would say to you is that this president has faced tougher circumstances than perhaps at any time since the end of World War II , and he has delivered policies that are going to stand the test of time , " Rice said in an interview that aired on CBS ' " Sunday Morning . "
The secretary of state brushed off reports that suggest the United States ' image is suffering abroad .
She praised the administration 's ability to change the conversation in the Middle East .
" This is n't a popularity contest .
I 'm sorry , it is n't .
What the administration is responsible to do is to make good choices about Americans ' interests and values in the long run -- not for today 's headlines , but for history 's judgment , " she said .
" And I am quite certain that when the final chapters are written and it's clear that Saddam Hussein 's Iraq is gone in favor of an Iraq that is favorable to the future of the Middle East ; when the history is written of a U.S. - China relationship that is better than it 's ever been ; an India relationship that is deeper and better than it 's ever been ; a relationship with Brazil and other countries of the left of Latin America , better than it 's ever been ...
" When one looks at what we 've been able to do in terms of changing the conversation in the Middle East about democracy and values , this administration will be judged well , and I 'll wait for history 's judgment and not today 's headlines . "
Asked by CBS ' Rita Braver why some former diplomats say Americans are disliked around the world , Rice said that 's " just not true . "
" I know what U.S. policy has achieved .
And so I do n't know what diplomats you 're talking to , but look at the record , " she said .
Rice said she was n't bothered by criticism about her or the administration 's polices , saying if a person in her business is not being criticized , " you 're not doing something right . "
" I'm here to make tough choices , and this president is here to make tough choices , and we have .
And yes , I -- there are some things that I would do very differently if I had it to do over again .
You do n't have that luxury .
You have to make the choices and take the positions that you do at the time , " she said .
Asked about historians who say Bush is one of the worst presidents , Rice said those " are n't very good historians . "
" If you 're making historical judgments before an administration is already out -- even out of office , and if you 're trying to make historical judgments when the nature of the Middle East is still to be determined , and when one cannot yet judge the effects of decisions that this President has taken on what the Middle East will become -- I mean , for goodness ' sakes , good historians are still writing books about George Washington .
Good historians are certainly still writing books about Harry Truman , " she said .
Rice , 54 , said she has enjoyed working in the Bush administration during the last eight years , first as national security adviser , then as secretary of state .
" There is no greater honor than to serve this country , " she said , adding that there is also no greater challenge .
Rice said when the new administration takes over , she plans to return to the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and write two books -- one on foreign policy and one about her parents .

[ I wrote the following op - ed , which appeared in the Nov. 14 issue of The Recorder .
Because that publication 's website is not publicly available , I 'm posting a copy here , with their permission . ]
For most of the decade , Silicon Valley technology startups have assumed that Google would pay their legal bills .
Not literally , mind you , but rather by taking on the big , high - profile cases about fair use , interoperability , and other digital intellectual property issues that would set precedents that all disruptive innovators could rely on .
Well , Google just put the Valley on notice that the free ride is over , which means more legal burdens for smaller technology companies that previously depended on Google clearing a path for them .
Late last month , Google announced a settlement in its lawsuit with book publishers and authors over its Google Book Search offering .
At the heart of the dispute is the question of whether scanning copyrighted books in order to index them violates copyright law , as the publishers argued , or is permissible as a fair use , as Google argued .
If approved by the court , the $ 125 million settlement would buy Google — and only Google — permission not just to scan books for indexing purposes , but also to expand Book Search to provide more access to the scanned books .
The Book Search case is just one of a series of high - stakes lawsuits that Google has taken up in the name of the disruptive innovation that fuels the Internet economy .
Others include the billion - dollar suit brought by Viacom over copyrighted video clips appearing on YouTube , as well as cases brought by trademark owners attacking Google 's right to sell trademarks as keyword triggers for those " sponsored links " that appear when you use Google 's search engine .
Google has also fought copyright owners to defend its search engine , news aggregation , image search and Web caching activities .
Google , assisted by its expensive , top - drawer legal team , has a track record of winning these precedent - setting Internet cases .
And by winning , Google sets a precedent that other innovators can rely on , as well .
In essence , Google 's legal investments have paid dividends for the entire Internet innovation economy .
Until now .
By settling rather than taking the case all the way ( many copyright experts thought Google had a good chance of winning ) , Google has solved its own copyright problem — but not anyone else's .
Without a legal precedent about the copyright status of book scanning , future innovators are left to defend their own copyright lawsuits .
In essence , Google has left its former copyright adversaries to maul any competitors that want to follow its lead .
Google will doubtless be considering the same endgame for the Viacom lawsuit against YouTube .
If Google can strike a settlement with a large slice of the aggrieved copyright owners , then it solves the copyright problem for itself , while leaving it as a barrier to entry for YouTube 's competitors .
But when innovators like Google cut individual deals , it weakens the Silicon Valley innovation ecology for everyone , because it leaves the smaller companies to carry on the fight against well - endowed opponents .
Those kinds of cases threaten to yield bad legal precedents that tilt the rules against disruptive innovation generally .
For better or worse , it looks like tomorrow 's cutting - edge Internet law precedents are going to be left to smaller companies to set .
That means smaller startups ( and their venture capital backers ) need to start planning strategically to pick up the slack left by Google 's gradual retreat from the field of battle .
To put it bluntly , they need to set aside real money for litigation and find ways to cooperatively invest in the legal precedents that all of them collectively need .

After 17 cans of energy drinks in seven days , I started to regret taking this assignment .
It sounded innocent enough at first : buy as many energy drinks as I can find in my local grocery store , drink them as fast as I can without blowing out my kidneys , and write a review of the whole experience .
Before I give you the results , you should know that I ’m qualified — a recovered Mountain Dew addict .
For a few years in my late teens I had a two - liter per day habit .
Fueled on sugar and caffeine , I practically peed yellow number five .
It helped me stay awake to finish projects I had procrastinated on all semester and gave me the jolt I needed to take a test after getting a few hours of sleep .
It helped me plow through late - night miles on road trips and was a constant companion in the passenger seat of whatever beater car I was driving .
I stopped drinking Mountain Dew during a half - decade conversion to vegetarianism .
Like anything fun , energy drinks are best in moderation .
Or at least , are best when they do not comprise 73 % of your daily caloric intakes .
So it ’s not a stretch to say I ’m an energy drink aficionado — I ’ve had more than a few cans of Red Bull , stayed awake through three days of Phish shows thanks to the Rockstar they were giving away , and bought Monsters to stay up for a 24 hour blogathon last year .
All this aside , I make it through the day without caffeine and Taurine .
On a side note , did you know Taurine was first derived from bull bile ?
Sick , but fascinating .
Yum .
After a visit to my doctor for medical clearance for this energy drink binge , I stopped at the two local grocery stores and bought one of every energy drink on the shelves — 17 total .
After I told the girl at the cash register that I was a writer doing a story on energy drinks she gave me an almost pitying , sympathetic smile .
“ What a terrible way to make a living , ” her thoughts were almost audible .
I decided to include Mountain Dew and plain ole coffee as baseline measurements .
I ’m no coffee drinker and have n’t gotten past the point of actually enjoying the taste of it , so take that into account when looking at the one out of five I gave it for taste and drinkability .
Without further adieu , I present you with the Geeks Are Sexy Energydrinkaganza 2008 results .
Many
Bothans died to bring us this information , use it wisely .
Cup o’ Joe
Like I said , I ’m not a fan of coffee .
I never transitioned off of soda to java , so a cup of straight black coffee was n’t easy to choke down .
I can drink it all day long if it ’s doctored with piles of sugar and barrels of cream , but the hard stuff was a struggle .
While the taste was n’t my cup of tea , the buzz was great .
Coffee comes with the additional benefit of having no sugar and almost no calories , as long as you keep it black .
If you need a consta - buzz and do n’t want to pile on the pounds , a thermos of black coffee might be a good choice .

Red Bull
The drink that started it all .
Red Bull came to life back in the early 80s when Austrian entrepreneur Dietrick Mateschitz worked to adapt a Thai drink called Krating Daeng into what we now know as Red Bull .
His million - dollar gamble paid off for him and his partner Chaleo Yoovidhya as they watched their drink build up a billion - dollar industry that it mostly controlled ( half of the U.S. energy drink market and 80 % in some countries ) .
King of Energy though it may be , I ’ve never been a huge fan .
It has that typical energy - drink taste twinge that always made it feel a little like it was work to get it down .
I would never drink a Red Bull if it did n’t drop a hell of a buzz on me , so it got docked a few points for taste and drinkability .
It has solid distribution channels , so what it lacks in taste it more than makes up for in availability .

Steaz Energy Organic Fuel
Steaz brings the green .
Unfortunately , they forgot the energy .
It ’s not really fair to clump this in with the other drinks , it ’s like comparing apples and really small apples .
Steaz opts to the greener side of the ingredient market and pairs organic yerba mate extract with organic , fair - trade Ceylon green tea sweetened with organic evaporated cane juice .
The Steaz buzz is a mellower , lower - level buzz .
There ’s less edge , but there ’s also less edge .
You do n’t drink Steaz to stay awake during an all nighter , you chug it down to perk yourself up during the afternoon sustainable - energy seminar .
Steaz is a good choice for the green set , but is best left out of the energy drink quiver of the hardcore energy drinkerati .

Grape Nos
OMFFSMBBQ !
Grape Nos is gooooooood .
It tastes like heavenly grape liquid candy .
I did n’t know what to expect out of this crazy purple bottle but was blown away on all counts — it was tasty , went down smoothly , and delivered a one - two knockout buzz punch .
Grape
Nos comes packed with a massive 334 mg of caffeine and I felt every milligram of it for hours after drinking my last sip .
Finding Grape Nos was worth every sleepless night and jittery meal experienced during the course of the Energydrinkaganza .
I bought a few extra bottles and have them stocked up in the pantry .
You know , for emergencies .

No Fear Super Energy
Two words - liquid lollypop .
This energy drink was sweet , maybe even too sweet .
The first few sips were cloying with overly sharp strawberry flavors set against a good level of carbonation .
This stuff came in tied for first in most calories and grams of sugar per fluid ounce ( in an exact tie with the other SoBe - created drink ; same base with different artificial flavors ? ) .
No Fear Super Energy delivered the buzz with a full aresenal of Taurine , Inositol , Caffeine , Panax Ginseng Extract , Guarana , L - Carnitine , L - Arginine , and Vitamin B12 .
I was in a nicely sharpened state of mind and body for a few hours after the last sip .

Rockstar Energy Drink
Good ol ’ Rockstar .
I drank my first can of Rockstar in the middle of a muddy field during the last Phish shows in Coventry , Vermont .
I stumbled to the Rockstar tent after not having anything to drink for five hours and gratefully chugged down the free sample cans they were handing out .
It rehydrated me , pumped me full of buzz , and gave me the energy to head back into the sea of dirty hippies for the second set .
Rockstar goes down easy .
It has a not - too - sweet citrus tang that bubbles down your throat , delivering 160 mg of caffeine in a 16 oz can .
It ranked at the top for both calories and grams of sugar per fluid ounce ; healthy it is not .

Rockstar R Juiced , Energy + Juice
Rockstar knows energy drinks .
This extension includes a Pomegranate and Guava flavor — my local store stocks Original +
Juice , which ends up being a tasty orange brew .
It has just the right amount of carbonation and delivers a strong and steady heady buzz .
Energy +
Juice is actually 50 % juice , which definitely sounds healthy .
Juice has sugar and can be nearly as empty a calorie as a sugar - sweetened soda , but it ’s a nice psychological boost to think you ’re doing your body a favor by drinking something healthy .
That ’s natural , right ?

Lost Five -
O
Lost Five - O is a great pick for those watching their sugar and calorie intake .
It ’s 50 % juice and is one of the lowest on the list in terms of calories and grams of sugar per fluid ounce .
The orange flavored Lost Five - O has a slight hint of that energy drink taste twinge .
It tastes kind of like a mutated Orangina left out in the sun for a day .
The buzz was good , but nothing to write home about .
I cracked my can of Lost Five - O in the morning to start day four and ended up petering out an hour or so before lunch .
The can helped get the buzz rolling with its graphics — it looks like a semi-talented high school artist hopped up on goofballs was let loose in Photoshop — stuck on spray paint .

Moxie Citrus
I have to admit that I was a little scared to crack this one open .
My previous experiences with Moxie was limited to single sips of old - school Moxie punctuated with involuntary spit takes .
Old - school Moxie tastes terrible .
I was encouraged by the “ citrus ” part of this new Moxie extension though , and bravely cracked it open .
The first sip was good .
So was the second and third .
Moxie Citrus is really good .
It has none of the energy drink taste twinge and all of the drinkability of a Sprite .
Citrus Moxie has a pleasantly bland citrus flavor , like Mountain Dew without the sharp tang .
It dropped a mountain of buzz on me — I got a lot of wood chopping done in the few hours after finishing my Moxie Citrus .
Five out of five all around , another one to stock up on .

Full Throttle Fury ( Orange )
If you like Orange Crush you ’ll dig Full Throttle Orange .
I enjoyed drinking this tall can of orange nectar from first sip to last .
Full Throttle Orange comes with all the standard Energy Drink add - ons ; Guarana , Taurine , Carnitine , and Ginseng and a healthy ( and by healthy , I mean unhealthy ) 57 grams of sugar in a 16 ounce can .
The only thing Full Throttle did n’t drive home was a buzz .
I do n’t know what it was , but I started feeling post - buzz sleepy after only a couple of hours .
This was toward the end of the Energydrinkaganza , so it could have just been the sleepless nights talking .
Anyway you cut it , Full Throttle Orange delivers .
It ’s not perfect , but it does the trick .

SoBe Energy Glass Bottle
It was a little hard to take this seriously as an energy drink .
It was sold in the aisle with the other SoBe bottles and has an anemic level of caffeine for an energy drink .
It leveled an equally anemic buzz on rounded out by a fairly tasty flavor .
This drink is n’t a bad choice if you run into it at a gas station that does n’t carry anything else or if you have a low tolerance for caffeine .

Max Velocity Uncaged
Max Velocity would have lost a few points if I were grading the can .
It ’s not pretty .
I could easily go as far as to say it ’s ugly .
Luckily for me , I thought it tasted pretty damn good , so we ’ll ignore the Albertsons corporate - designed graphic .
Max Velocity tastes good and goes down smooth .
The buzz is good but lacking in the fullness of a Rockstar or a Monster , probably due to Albertsons going cheap on ingredients and only including Taurine and Caffeine .
The 62 grams of sugar and caffeine punched in and gave me a few hour buzz with a not - too - bad come down .

Monster Energy
Mmmm … Monster … I love Monster .
It as a great citrus flavor that ’s easy on the tongue and stomach .
Monster is one of the original energy drinks that popped up after Red Bull first made their splash , so they ’ve had time to refine their formula .
It does n’t have the same medicinal twinge that harsher energy drinks can have and gave me a good , active buzz .
Monster packs a good punch for the money and was especially good when I drank in poured over a tumbler of ice .
The vodka that I added ( it was the end of the day on a Friday ) did n’t hurt , although it is recommended to never , ever mix energy drinks with alcohol .
Another side note : did you know you could pour cheap vodka through a Brita Filter a few times and get top - shelf - quality booze out the end ?

I like chai .
I like energy drinks .
I did NOT like the Monster chai energy drink .
It was too heavy , too sweet , and just tasted … wrong .
I could n’t even get past the third sip and ended up pouring it out into the grass to the gods of Energy Drinks .
I hope they liked it better than I did .

Mountain Dew
What can I say ?
It ’s Mountain Dew .
It ’s yellow , it ’s sharp , and it ’ll give you a kick in the pants buzz .
Mountain Dew does n’t have Taurine , Guarana , Ginseng , Ginko Biloba , or Inositol .
What it does have is a crapload of high - fructose corn syrup and caffeine that delivers almost the same level kick of a Rock Star or a Moxie Citrus .
Step into the Dew and rock your old school credibility .
Plus , if you drink enough , you ’ll pee Mountain Dew color ( I know this from firsthand experience ) .

Amp Energy
When I call Amp Energy “ watered down Mountain Dew , ” I mean it in the nicest way .
This stuff goes down easy with a lower level of carbonation and has a blandly citrus flavor .
This was made by the Mountain Dew labs and feels like something someone put together from the Mountain Dew recipe over a weekend .
It ’s effective but a little vanilla .
They throw in a pinch of Taurine ( 20 mg to No Fear ’s 2,000 mg ) and Panax Ginseng so they can put “ Taurine ” on the can .
The caffeine and high - fructose corn syrup made up for their stingy hand with Taurine , though — and kept me on a slightly edgy buzz for a few hours .

Amp Energy Overdrive Cherry
I ’m a sucker for cherry sodas .
I ’m a lifelong patient of Dr. Pepper and would do more for Cherry Coke than a Klondike Bar , so it ’s no surprise that I liked Amp Energy Overdrive .
I ’m pretty sure the drink engineers at Amp just took a vat of regular Amp and poured in some cherry syrup .
There ’s nothing new here when you ’re looking at the original Amp platform but that turned out to be just fine with me .
Familiarity is comforting and Amp Overdrive works that angle for all she ’s worth .
If you like Amp and if you like cherry , you ’re going to ninja flip out all over yourself for Amp Overdrive .

With that , I close out the Geeks Are Sexy Energydrinkaganza 2008 .
I ’m departing tomorrow morning for a small , exclusive health resort tucked in the Canadian Rockies to recover from the last week ’s caffeine and sugar shock .
I ’ll spend my days doing yoga , receiving Ayurvedic cleansing treatments , hiking , and napping .
Kiltak , you should get the bill at the end of the year .
I ’ll try to keep it to five digits .

The historic central offices of the General Confederation of Greek Workers in Athens have been occupied by militant workers
The action forms part of a strategy to counteract the designs of the union bureaucracy to distance its membership from the current revolt , and protest its management and mediation of workers ' struggles in Greece .
The occupants aim to create a space in which to facilitate a grassroots and self organised workers response to the crisis , and bring the wider working class into the events unfolding on the streets of Greece .
Town halls in Athens and Thessaloniki have also been occupied in order to hold general assemblies .
The communique of the " General Assembly of Insurgent Workers " follows below :
DECLARATION
We will either determine our history ourselves or let it be determined without us
We , manual workers , employees , jobless , temporary workers , local or migrants , are not passive tv-viewers .
Since the murder of Alexandros Grigoropoulos on Saturday night we participate in the demonstrations , the clashes with the police , the occupations of the centre or the neighborhoods .
Time and again we had to leave work and our daily obligations to take the streets with the students , the university students and the other proletarians in struggle .
WE DECIDED TO OCCUPY THE BUILDING OF GSEE
- To turn it into a space of free expression and a meeting point of workers .
- To disperse the media - touted myth that the workers were and are absent from the clashes , and that the rage of these days was an affair of some 500 " mask - bearers " , " hooligans " or some other fairy tale , while on the tv-screens the workers were presented as victims of the clash , while the capitalist crisis in Greece and Worldwide leads to countless layoffs that the media and their managers deal as a " natural phenomenon " .
- To flay and uncover the role of the trade union bureaucracy in the undermining of the insurrection - and not only there .
GSEE and the entire trade union mechanism that supports it for decades and decades , undermine the struggles , bargain our labor power for crumblings , perpetuate the system of exploitation and wage slavery .
The stance of GSEE last Wednesday is quite telling : GSEE cancelled the programmed strikers ' demonstration , stopping short at the organization of a brief gathering in Syntagma Sq. , making simultaneously sure that the people will be dispersed in a hurry from the Square , fearing that they might get infected by the virus of insurrection .
- To open up this space for the first time - as a continuation of the social opening created by the insurrection itself - , a space that has been built by our contributions , a space from which we were excluded .
For all these years we trusted our fate on saviours of every kind , and we end up losing our dignity .
As workers we have to start assuming our responsibilities , and to stop assigning our hopes to wise leaders or " able " representatives .
We have to acquire a voice of our own , to meet up , to talk , to decide , and to act .
Against the generalized attack we endure .
The creation of collective " grassroot " resistances is the only way .
- To propagate the idea of self - organization and solidarity in working places , struggle committees and collective grassroot procedures , abolishing the bureaucrat trade unionists .
All these years we gulp the misery , the pandering , the violence in work .
We became accustomed to counting the crippled and our dead - the so - called " labor accidents " .
We became accustomed to ingore the migrants - our class brothers - getting killed .
We are tired living with the anxiety of securing a wage , revenue stamps , and a pension that now feels like a distant dream .
As we struggle not to abandon our life in the hands of the bosses and the trade union representatives , likewise we will not abandon no arrested insurgent in the hands of the state and the juridical mechanism .

There was an event that happened on Sunday , November 9 , 2008 , in Lansing , MI , that appears to have slipped under the radar of most Michigan and national news .
According to Catholic Online , which appears to give the least biased account of the happenings at Mount Hope Church in Lansing :
Okay , while nothing too violent appears to have happened during this confrontation , I disapprove of involving children on either side of a radical event .
Right or Left .
And I 'll point out that while we cannot claim that Jesus was homosexual with any definity , he was certainly raised in a homosocial environment .
Seriously , look it up .
Back to the action
According to Bash Back !
Lansings " Points of Unity " , as listed on their MySpace account , all members must agree to :
Which , again , why do ' Anarchist ' groups have rules , tenets , or manifestoes ?
Again , why portray this group as ' Anarchists ' ?
They obviously had a plan , brought the press , had two groups in action , one as an " inside " team that wore suits and carried bibles and the " outside " team who brought in the demonstration gear .
They were also wearing Secret Service style earwigs to coordinate the action .
Apparently Nathan Harris , a reporter for ' City Pulse ' , had prior knowledge of the event and was there to document it .
But there were no reports made of physical violence , just a disruption of services , a bit of lewdness , passing out of flyers and glitter .
Actually something I would have prayed for when I used to have to go to church .
However , there was some indecency involved .
Some members of the operation held back and reported what their demonstrated had wrought .
To which members of Bash Back !
Lansing reponded by saying :
However , journalist Kyle Bristow points out that :
Which is not the point of the story of the moneychangers , but why let reason seep in when it comes to religion and legitimizing your instinct to retaliate .
That would be falling into the argument of the Bash Back !
organization , legitimizing their claim that Mount Hope Church is bigoted against the LGBT community .
Nor was there a need to put in the beating of Matthew Shepard in there .
Again , terms like ' Fascism ' seem a little heavy handed for what went on and deals more with a econo - political structure , but why worry about words .
There is surprising little video out there of this event , just people commenting on it , such as Jason Goldtrap , a novelist in Florida .
I will admit that there was more , from what I gather , a paramilitarian aspect of this event , the first group who looked like " normal " folk , the second group who were wrapped in pink kuffiyas ( a headdress more commonly now associated with terrorists , unfortunately ) , and a third group who reported back to the main group the after effects of event .
Plus the earwings .
Seriously , that 's organized .
Actually , this reminds me more of what William S. Burroughs wrote in The Wild Boys : A Book of the Dead and The Red Night Trilogy .
Burroughs claimed that what the GLBT community was not expressing themselves as they really are , but by " reclaiming " what is thought to be homosexual is to fall into the trap of accepting the role the heterosexual has already defined for you .
I believe I read Bash Back !
make a similar claim that the regular GLBT community is simply opting for assimilation , not identity .
Hence , Burroughs has never really been given his due as a writer who was writing both as a junkie and a homosexual during the 1950s on .
He 's usually written out of the gay canon as an oddity whose identity was tainted by a male - dominant role , whereas his novels project an anti-straight and anti-assimilated gay society where wild boys can run free being equal , no dominant / submissive roles , no male / female roles .
Just the perfect society before societal rules are assimilated .
Happy 200 !
Hope to hear some response to this .
UPDATE : Bash Back !
Lansing bash redefined
The first polls had just closed when the Republican Right ’s “ Agony of Defeat ” moment arrived .
It was just after 8 p.m. — right as Fox ’s “ America ’s Election HQ ” show returned from a commercial break , and Brit Hume welcomed viewers back to his “ Fair and Balanced ” network .
But something was n’t right :
There was a strange lack of background banter , none of the golf - buddy joshing that comes with overconfidence .
There was just Bergman - esque silence between every one of Brit Hume ’s dramatic pauses .
The Fox cameras wandered over an incredible scene : the cream of right - wing / neocon punditry — William Kristol , Fred Barnes and Mort Kondracke — were caught slumped in their chairs during the commercial break , deep in a state of hopelessness and depression .
They did n’t see the camera train on them , or maybe they were incapable of faking it , as if they ’d been on a three - day Ecstasy roll at Burning Man , and now they were paying the horrible serotonin - deprived price .
Kristol looked like he was suffering the worst :
He was slouched over the table , his grotesque Stewie - shaped head sulking down to his navel , his glazed eyes staring down at the floor .
He strained to lift his head when Hume called on him to comment — and when Kristol spoke , it was in a raspy , slow voice , not his usual smirking , energetic arrogance .
To quote a sympathetic right - wing blogger , “ Will Collier e-mails to tell me that he has n’t seen Bill Kristol look this bad since his man McCain get stomped in S.C. by Bush in 2000 . ”
I started my Fox News Election Day Agony Watch at 6:30 a.m.
I was expecting a lot of last - minute shrieking about voter fraud , ACORN and Barack Hussein Osama terrorist - mongering , the climax to a vicious campaign that Fox had been promoting over the previous month or two , but what was so strange that day was the relatively subdued , quasi-civil tone that Fox was taking .
They pushed those buttons on Election Day , but only halfheartedly .
You ’d have to have watched a lot of Fox News — which I have , out of morbid curiosity — to detect the tonal shift on Nov. 4 .
It was as if they had decided to pull their punches .
Before the polls opened , Ann Coulter appeared for a few minutes to riff against the liberals , but the 47 - year - old MILF - wannabe looked oddly desperate in her mini-miniskirt and knee - high boots , as if she stole her imaginary teenage daughter ’s clubbing outfit and wanted to show it off .
The effect was wrong , a desperate eccentricity , like a neocon Michael Jackson .
What was going on ?
It was as if the Fox News execs were nervous , so they came up with a Plan B approach .
Gone was the usual mob-incitement chest - beating that has made Fox News such a hit in Middle America .
It seems that the craftier vanguard of the Republican right - wing mob got together and decided that this was the craftiest position to adopt .
Just before the elections , Kristol published a New York Times column that threw his entire 20 - year divide - and - quagmire playbook out the window in favor of a new pseudo - gracious “ hey , we ’re all friends , liberals and conservatives , and is n’t it a wonderful country we live in ? ” mantra .
The Fox execs also did their best to affect a civil , gracious tone .
That ’s why watching the Fox News agony - of - defeat spectacle was more subtle than I ’d expected :
The mob leaders had decided to abandon the mob — meaning if I wanted to get a glimpse into the raw screeching agony that the right wing really feels when the camera is turned off , I would have to head into the blog world , where they could squeal their lungs out in safe anonymity .
The “ patriots ” at Freerepublic.com , which boasts millions of visitors , went through at least four rapid stages of decline on Election Day : first , hope ; then utter shock at the realization of defeat ; then outrage and a sense of betrayal ; and finally a retreat into Christian prayer and empty threats of Red Dawn armed insurrection .
The Freepers are n’t just outraged at Obama and the communist - Islamo - terrorists taking over the White House ; they are also outraged at the Republican Party that “ betrayed ” them , outraged at the American population that proved to be nothing but brainwashed “ sheeple ” ( someone named kimchilover wrote , “ For the first time , in my adult life , I am ashamed of my country … my little take on Michelle ’s sentiments ” ) , and even outraged at , yes , Fox News , which they quickly sensed was abandoning them .
Many could n’t make sense of being abandoned by Fox .
As one commenter wrote , “ Watch Fox with the sound off and you will be LESS aggravated . ”
I lapped up every squeal and screech on Freerepublic.com that I could .
Gloating is a healthy human activity , nothing to be ashamed of .
How could you not gloat when you watch a thread that goes from this :
My friend , wait until 11 or 12 Eastern time before drawing any conclusions , by then you will see the Palin landslide !! ( by word_warrior_bob )
To this :
Turn out the lights .
Party is over .
Go to bed .
… Election is lost .
I ’m gonna get drunk .
( by GerardKempf )
And the most desperate , toothless woofing stance of all , so popular among the harmless nerds in Freeperland :
All over but the shooting .
Stock up on guns and ammo .
Use them whenever necessary .
( PermaRag )
Next I checked a B - list neocon blogzine , Pajamas Media .
You can get a sense of where the Republican elite and their mob followers are at Pajamas , which appeals to a more coastal , secular neocon demographic than the Freepers .
Here again you could see what was only hinted at on Fox News .
• UK and Germany welcome pact to be signed today • US and Russia among the governments opting out
More than 100 governments , with some notable exceptions , will sign an international convention today banning the production of cluster bombs whose unexploded canisters have killed and maimed thousands of innocent civilians and are dangerously scattered over more than 20 countries .
The convention is enthusiastically welcomed today by the Red Cross , and on the Guardian 's website by David Miliband , the foreign secretary , and Frank - Walter Steinmeier , his German counterpart .
The weapons had " rendered huge tracts of land unusable , cutting farmers off from their crops and visiting further suffering on families forced to risk their lives simply to pursue their livelihoods " , said Matthias Schmale , international director of the British Red Cross .
Miliband and Steinmeier said their goal was a " truly global treaty on cluster munitions " .
They noted that " many of the major users , producers and stockpilers of cluster munitions " had not yet agreed to sign it .
These countries include the US , China , Russia , India and Pakistan as well as Israel , which fired many cluster bombs during the 2006 Lebanon war .
Up to 1 m devices failed to explode during the 34 - day conflict and this summer more than 40.6 m square metres were identified as still being contaminated , according to the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) .
More than 200 civilians died in the year after the Lebanon ceasefire .
Cluster bombs also caused more civilian casualties in Iraq in 2003 and Kosovo in 1999 than any other weapon system .
At least 75 countries currently stockpile cluster munitions .
More than 30 have produced the weapons .
Unexploded cluster bombs have also killed civilians in Afghanistan , Chad , Eritrea , Chechnya , Sierra Leone and Vietnam .
Despite initial misgivings within the military , Britain , which fired Israeli - made cluster bombs in its attack on Basra in 2003 and had been the third biggest user of cluster bombs after the US and Israel , has agreed to get rid of its stockpiles of land - fired and air - launched cluster weapons .
British diplomats are trying to persuade the US to get rid of stockpiles at its bases in the UK , officials said yesterday .
Today 's convention excludes weapons which fire fewer than 10 explosive submunitions designed to locate a " single target " .
One of the most difficult issues during the negotiations in Dublin this summer leading to the convention was whether troops from countries who signed up to it would be criminally liable if engaged in joint operations with countries which had not signed such as the US for example .
The text does not prohibit such " military cooperation " .
But British forces , like those from any other country which had signed the convention , would be required to discourage the US from using the weapons , and not stockpile them .
The convention will become part of international humanitarian law once 30 countries have ratified it .
In defending the city against a lawsuit brought by the family of a San Francisco musician who died after riding the Cyclone last year , a city attorney is insisting that the roller coaster 's potentially fatal dangers are " obvious . "
While riding the Cyclone on his birthday in July 2007 , 53 - year - old Keith Shirasawa fractured three neck vertebrae and died four days later after complications from surgery .
In the lawsuit , his family contends that the Parks Department is at fault for not regularly inspecting the landmark ride .
But city attorney Cynthia Goldman argues that " any and all risks , hazards , defects and dangers to the extent alleged are of an open , obvious , apparent and inherent nature known and should have been known to [ Shirasawa ] , " according to court papers obtained by the Daily News .
Shirasawa family attorneys blame the injury on a malfunction that made the Cyclone drop too fast , and an " antiquated " single position lap bar .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Fortune ) --
Here 's why you should buy , not bail , on Yahoo .
1. Eventually , management will get tossed .
Starting with the least scientific or analytical reason for owning Yahoo , there 's every reason to believe the days are numbered for CEO Jerry Yang and President Susan Decker .
By all accounts fine people , they simply have n't led Yahoo well .
The former excelled as Chief Yahoo , dabbling in deals and motivating the troops .
But Yang has n't been a decisive leader and is " lurching from crisis to crisis , " as The New York Times aptly phrased his tenure .
Decker , in turn , is widely derided in Silicon Valley as too much the finance chief , not enough the operations guru .
Yahoo's doormat board tolerated Yang 's ascension to CEO as a way of appearing to not have fired his predecessor , Terry Semel .
Now that raider Carl Icahn - who has been quiet of late regarding Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) - is on the board , though , action is far more likely .
Were the board to dump Yang and Decker it 's an easy bet the stock would pop , even if it did n't immediately name a successor .
2. Microsoft will return .
Microsoft ( MSFT , Fortune 500 ) continues to deny that it 's interested in bidding again for Yahoo .
It is forced to make these protestations because Steve Ballmer can't seem to stop talking about why such a deal would make sense .
The math is pretty straightforward here .
Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo for $ 31 per share .
Yang thought his company should n't fetch a dime less than $ 37 .
Microsoft said it was willing to pay $ 33 .
Today , Yahoo has been nosing below $ 12 .
Microsoft , instead , has been talking about buying back more stock .
Just wait .
Microsoft likely is waiting to see what the Justice Department has to say about Yahoo's search - advertising deal with Google .
When that 's all done , a Microsoft - Yahoo tie - up makes as much sense as ever , especially considering that Microsoft , amazingly , still can't make money in its online business .
It needs Yahoo's scale to get profitable .
There is another Microsoft option that could benefit Yahoo and its stock price .
" We believe Microsoft is waiting in the wings to replace Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) as a search outsourcing partner , " writes Marianne Wolk of Susquehanna Financial Group , " which could afford Yahoo some upside lift to [ its ] earnings forecasts , assuming there is a minimum guarantee from Microsoft to exceed Yahoo 's internal figures as incentive to get the deal done . "
That 's a good thought :
If Google can't help Yahoo make money , Microsoft will .
3 . Investors are looking for reasons to buy this stock .
In the initial hours after Yahoo reported a generally atrocious third quarter and a bleak outlook Tuesday , its stock popped .
The various reasons postulated by observers were amusing when taken as a whole .
The San Francisco Chronicle guessed this was due to " relief that Yahoo's fourth - quarter financial guidance was n't as bad as feared . "
Others chalked it up to the cost reductions associated with announced layoffs of 10 % of Yahoo's workforce - even though the layoffs were widely expected and therefore should n't have affected the stock price .
One analyst , Mark Mahaney of Citigroup , praised Yahoo for having had the foresight to avoid stock buybacks until now - and then prognosticated the positive impact of future buybacks .
" We note that the company ended [ the third quarter ] with about $ 3.3 billion in cash and no debt , " he wrote , adding that buybacks were likely .
4. Long - term trends favor Yahoo .
Yes , Yahoo is losing share to Google .
Yes , Yahoo is barely growing .
Yes , it 's a tired argument that Yahoo is one of the strongest brands in the media world .
Yes , this argument for owning its stock has n't worked in a long time .
Yet the company 's argument still holds water .
The company global page views grew 17 % in the third quarter .
It 's part of an industry , online advertising , that will continue to grow ( or at least take share ) no matter the economy .
Compared with The New York Times , a sterling brand in a declining industry , Yahoo is a powerful brand in a growing industry .
5 . It 's cheap .
There 's always that .
Morgan Stanley 's Mary Meeker figures that given the value of Yahoo's cash and its publicly traded Asian assets ( even taking into account the difficulty in selling stakes in other companies ) , investors value Yahoo's core business at just $ 6 per share , or eight times Wall Street 's estimates of 2009 profits .
That 's an extraordinarily low multiple for any company with the opportunities in front of it that Yahoo has .
Yahoo's management thought Yahoo was cheap at $ 30 , of course .
Today , investors would do quite nicely for a fraction of that amount .
November 4 , 2008  --
The Federal Reserve Bank is drawing jeers for hiring a former top executive from the now - defunct investment bank Bear Stearns to help it gauge the health of other banks .
" How 's this for sweet irony ? " business publication Portfolio.com needled the pick .
Michael Alix was head of risk management for Bear Stearns for two years until the institution imploded this spring , a victim of its ( risky ) subprime - mortgage related investments .
Last Friday , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York quietly announced it had hired Alix to advise it on bank supervision .
" You 're kidding me , " said economic policy expert Dean Baker , of the Washington , D.C. - based Center for Economic Policy and Research .
While he did n't know Alix personally , he said , " You would think [ his record ] would be a big strike against him . "
The collapse of Bear Stearns led to its pennies - on - the - dollar buyout by J.P. Morgan Chase ; the bank 's shareholders saw their wealth plummet .
To facilitate the buyout , the Fed agreed to assume potential billions in losses on bad Bear Stearns investments .
" [ Alix ] was the guy on the mast charged with yelling ' iceberg ' just before the Titanic introducted its bow to a floating chunk of ice , " wrote financial expert and blogger John Carney on the web site Clusterstock.com , where he flagged the hire .
The Fed 's move " is sure to put to rest the notion that there are no second acts in American life , " Carney observed drily .
A spokesman for the Federal Reserve declined to comment .

( CNN ) --
The Roman Catholic Church is cutting off funds to the community organizing group ACORN , citing complaints over its voter registration drives in the November 4 election as part of the reason .
Authorities raid a Las Vegas , Nevada , ACORN office after allegations of voter fraud .
The Catholic Campaign for Human Development froze its contributions to the group in June amid allegations that Dale Rathke , the brother of ACORN founder Wade Rathke , had embezzled nearly $ 1 million .
This week , as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops met in Baltimore , Maryland , the campaign 's chairman said it was cutting all ties with the group .
" We simply had too many questions and concerns to permit further CCHD funding of ACORN groups , " Roger Morin , the auxiliary bishop of New Orleans , Louisiana , told his colleagues in a letter to the conference .
Watch why fired board members allege a cover - up »
The CCHD has donated more than $ 7.3 million to ACORN - related projects over the past decade , including $ 40,000 to an ACORN chapter in Las Vegas , Nevada , that was raided before the election in an investigation into fraudulent voter registration forms .
Among other questionable documents , the ACORN chapter submitted registration forms for members of the Dallas Cowboys football team .
ACORN contends it has tried to help head off election fraud .
" In nearly every case that has been reported , it was ACORN that discovered the bad forms and called them to the attention of election authorities , putting the forms in a package that identified them in writing as suspicious , encouraging election officials to investigate , and offering to help with prosecutions , " ACORN said in an October 9 news release .
Morin said a church review completed in November found ACORN no longer met standards of further funding .
The reported embezzlement dates back several years , but was only recently disclosed to ACORN board members and donors .
Morin said the registration fraud complaints " raise additional serious concerns . "
" Nonpartisan voter registration , especially in poor communities , is important and needed work .
Too often , poor voters are not registered or are not encouraged to participate in the vital choices that affect their families and communities , " he wrote .
However , he said , the ban on donations to ACORN wo n't be lifted " until and unless it is clear that CCHD funds will not go to an organization that has engaged in unlawful activities or voter registration fraud . "
In a statement to CNN , ACORN Executive Director Steven Kest said his group is grateful for the church 's funding in the past .
" We look forward to continuing discussions with CCHD officials and the bishops in the months ahead in hopes that we can continue working together on projects , which have been so important to so many in low - income neighborhoods across the country , " Kest said .
However , Ralph McCloud , the Human Development campaign 's director , said the church has " severed ties " with ACORN and there are no plans for further discussion at this time .
CNN 's Marcus Hooper contributed to this report .

Somehow Paulson has gone from " Our banking system is a safe and a sound one " ( See You Know The Banking System Is Unsound When .... ) to Paulson telling Congress
“ That we ’re literally maybe days away from a complete meltdown of our financial system , with all the implications here at home and globally . ”
Inquiring minds may wish to consider a recap of things that have happened since Paulson made his " Our banking system is a safe and a sound one " speech .
Everyone Wants A Bailout
In a change from the original proposal sent to Capitol Hill , foreign - based banks with big U.S. operations could qualify for the Treasury Department ’s mortgage bailout , according to the fine print of an administration statement Saturday night .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson confirmed the change on ABC's " This Week , " telling George Stephanopoulos that coverage of foreign - based banks is " a distinction without a difference to the American people . "
On “ Fox News Sunday , ” Paulson told Chris Wallace that he would resist the Democrats ' desired limits on executive compensation .
" If we design it so it 's punitive and institutions are n't going to participate , this wo n't work the way we need it to work , " Paulson said .
" Let 's talk executive salaries :
There have been excesses there .
I agree with the American people .
Pay should be for performance , not for failure .
We 've got work to do in that regard .
We need to do that work .
But we need this system to work .
And so reforms need to come afterwards .
Participation Not Voluntary
Paulson resists calls for added help in bailout
" The credit markets are still very fragile right now and frozen , " Paulson said in an interview on NBC's Meet the Press .
" We need to deal with this and deal with it quickly . "
Paulson made the rounds of the television talk shows to stress the need for speed in getting the bailout package approved .
The administration spent the weekend negotiating the details of the proposal with members of Congress with the expectation that it can be passed in the next week .
Paulson said that " it pains me tremendously to have the American taxpayer put in this position but it is better than the alternative . "
Sen . Richard Shelby of Alabama , the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee , said that what Congress was being asked to approve was the " mother of all bailouts " which Shelby said would end up costing more like $ 1 trillion rather than $ 700 billion when the costs of the government taking over mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and insurance giant American International Group Inc. were added .
Mother Of All Bailouts Is Correct

( OrganicJar ) Research finally agrees with naturopathic physicians that heart disease can be reversed .
The study provides hard evidence that tiny pieces of genetic material called microRNA , which degrades the function of heart cells , plays a key role in the development of heart disease .
Research using mice concluded by blocking microRNA in heart cells , heart disease was revered .
I ’m sure the Pharmaceutical Cartel will jump all over this to develop a new miracle pill that we all should take .
The truth is preventing and curing heart disease is as simple as eating healthy and exercising .
The best way to do that is to follow a largely raw , plant - based diet combined with daily exercise and you 'll reverse heart disease .

RFID technology that allows the remote identification of travellers in moving vehicles is being rolled out at US land border crossings this month .
Crossing points with Canada at Blaine , and with Mexico at Nogales , came online last week , with Buffalo , Detroit and San Ysidro to follow , and a total of 39 planned .
The system uses the US PASSport ( People , Access Security Service ) card , which is intended to operate within the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative ( WHTI ) for US citizens entering the US via land and sea ports .
Using " Vicinity RFID " it can read the cards from a healthy skimming distance of 20 - 30 feet , but according to the Department of Homeland Security this is n't a problem .
The RFID chip on the card does n't contain any personal information , only a unique identification number , and skimmers would n't have access to the data the number matches up with .
The system is intended to work like this .
As a vehicle approaches the border post , the numbers of the cards inside it are read , and pictures and data on the holders are called up from a database .
Then , presumably , the immigration officers check the faces of the passengers to make sure they match , and bust any who happen to be flagged as terrorists or loose criminals .
In addition to the PASSport card , some US states are beginning to issue Enhanced Driver 's Licence / ID cards ( EDL / ID ) , which have the PASSport RFID functionality added to a standard driver 's license .
These can also be used for land or sea entry to the US , but neither variety of card is valid elsewhere , or for WHTI air travel into the US .
Obviously , they 'd only be of any use at anybody else 's border post if there were compatible readers there , and if the US had kindly shared its ID database with the relevant country .
So it 's an internal passport system , one that 's entirely incompatible with the biometric ID system that the US has gone to such pains to get the world to adopt .
Were they only kidding , then ? ®
Sarah Palin apparently does n’t understand a couple of very basic concepts about Israel .
It is not a Jewish state , no more so than Canada or Britain are Christian states .
Israel is a secular government , just like the one here in the United States .
Jewish is n’t a nationality , and Israel is not ‘ Jewish ’ .
This is such a very basic concept that I can’t even begin to fathom the depth of her ignorance .
Perhaps in the church where people speak in tongues , the congregants speak of the quickly approaching end times , and the certainty of dinosaurs and man living at the same time right after the earth was created ( a mere 6,000 years ago ) this type of thinking is encouraged .
These radical evangelicals spout nonsense about Antichrists and demons , witches and angels , all the while claiming a false appreciation for Israel , contrived from the mistaken conception that the ‘ apocolypse ’ is coming any day now .
They feign their friendship because Israel controls the ‘ Holy ’ land , and these radical , far right Christians need to imagine having access to that area .
As foreign relations gaffes go , this would be on par with calling up the Archbishop of Canterbury to negotiate a treaty between Britain and the US .
It ’s just that idiotic .
What could her reaction be when she ’s told that Israel is not a ‘ Jewish ’ state ?
“ Oh , gosh golly , you must be mistaken there fella , I know fer certain that those people wear those beanies ! ”
To say , direct to the face of the Israeli Ambassador , “ We look forward to … working with your Jewish agency , ” is not only an affront to Israel , it ’s an affront to all of those knowledgeable potential running mates of John McCain .
To think that Sarah Palin , a governor embroiled in an ethics probe , completely lacking any understanding of the Bush Doctrine ( the driving philosophical force behind this administration ’s foreign relations ) , and closely connected to a secessionist group would be picked over …well , anyone , is unbelievable .
But this –this very basic mistake of Sarah Palin ’s may be the most telling .
Israel is n’t a nation to her , it ’s a religion .
Edit :
There is a misconception among some because of the statement “ Hereby declare the establishment of a Jewish state in the land of Israel to be known as the State of Israel . ” in the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel .
Israel , however , has universal suffrage , and is not theocratic .
This precludes the language appearing in the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel , in that it is the law of the land , and is direct contradiction to the previous statement .
It is much like the United States being considered a nation that has legal slavery , even though the practice is now unconstitutional .
Another case made for Israel being a Jewish nation is contained within the Balfour Declaration , which is just silliness .
Israel does not even have a state religion , negating the concept of ‘ Jewish State ’ referring to the religion , but rather pointing to a cultural usage of ‘ Jewish ’ .
According to Daniel Elazar , of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs :
As understood by the Knesset and the Israeli Supreme Court , religious law stands in relationship to the secular law of Israel roughly as state law stands in relationship to federal law in a federation with a dual legal system .
That is to say , it is distinct , tends to be exclusive in its sphere , but is held to certain national tests in its application …
It is important to understand that the government of Israel does not control or try to control the religious establishment …
$ 150 billion more for AIG : US gov't .
Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday November 10 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) 
The US government announced Monday an expanded bailout for insurance giant AIG of more than 150 billion dollars , as the Treasury tapped into emergency funds originally set for banks .
The latest bailout plan , the largest in US history , came as AIG burned through billions of dollars of cash and reported a third - quarter loss of 24.47 billion dollars .
The original Federal Reserve rescue of 85 billion dollars in mid-September , at the time the largest in corporate history , was expanded by 37.8 billion dollars just a few weeks later , and involved the government acquisition of a 79.9 percent stake in the troubled insurer .
But AIG , the world 's largest insurer before the global credit crisis , has continued to suffer from soured bets on credit default swaps ( CDS ) and other complex financial instruments amid a financial crisis that accelerated in October .
Under the revised program for AIG announced Monday , the Treasury will replace the entire previous package with a larger , longer - term 152.5 billion dollar program , including a 60 billion dollar five - year loan and 52.5 billion dollars to buy up distressed securities .
The Treasury will tap its Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) for 40 billion dollars to buy preferential shares in the company .
" This action was necessary to maintain the stability of our financial system , " said Neel Kashkari , the head of the US Treasury 's 700 billion dollar rescue operation for the financial industry established in October .
" We recognize that the financial system remains fragile and we continue to stand ready to prevent systemic failures , " he said .
The White House emphasized the huge risk of an AIG failure and defended the Treasury 's extension of the financial lifeline to the insurer .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke " have determined that a failure by the firm would cause damage to our financial system , the US economy and the global economy , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino told reporters .
" Today 's announcement is new proof that the TARP will be used more and more to bail out distressed companies -- and not only banks -- instead of its initial goal of buying toxic assets , " Marie - Pierre Ripert , analyst at Natixis .
The rescue came as AIG reported its balance sheet deteriorated quickly over the third quarter .
The company said it took 15 billion dollars in provisions , reporting that in addition to losses in its credit default swaps portfolio and securities lending business , its general insurance division was in the red to the tune of 899 million dollars , compared with a profit of 2.51 billion dollars a year ago .
AIG chief executive Edward Liddy defended the expanded aid from Treasury , saying it puts AIG " in a much better position " to address its problems and set it toward recovery .
The extra money gives AIG " more flexibility and more time " to sell assets .
" It is a smart , disciplined process , " he said in a conference call with reporters .
" AIG is , in fact , on the road of recovery . "
The Treasury rescue , however , suggests that AIG 's recovery period could be much longer than anticipated just a few months ago .
In the new program , the previous 85 billion dollar loan is cut to 60 billion , and a lower interest rate is set , but its duration is extended to five years from two .
Another 52.5 billion dollars is provided to purchase distressed assets from the company , including 30 billion for collateralized debt obligations and 22.5 billion for residential mortgage - backed securities .
Thirdly , the government will use 40 billion dollars in TARP funds to buy AIG preferential shares , which will carry a high interest rate of 10 percent .
Defending the deal , Kashkari said the government was setting " stringent " limitations on executive compensation for AIG 's senior executives , corporate expenses , and lobbying .
AIG shares were up 8.53 percent at 2.29 dollars in afternoon trading .
The expanded bailout for AIG from a fund originally set aside for banks was likely to raise eyebrows in the US Congress .
According to a Treasury official , President - elect Barack Obama , who is already crafting strategies for the economy ahead of his inauguration on January 20 , was briefed Sunday on the Treasury 's new AIG plan .
The Treasury insisted Monday its exposure to AIG would have a limited lifespan .
" The US government intends to exit its support of AIG over time in a disciplined manner consistent with maximizing the value of its investments and promoting financial stability , " it said in a statement .
There are few places one can go where a gleaming pair of yellow arches cannot be found proudly declaring some variant of " Over 99 Billion Served . "
Now browser - maker Mozilla has something in common with McDonaldland :
As of last week , Mozilla has officially served up their billionth add - on .
One of the big draws for Firefox — outside of being Open Source , of course — is the plethora of extensions , themes , and other tweaks available to make one 's browsing life complete .
Way back in 2005 — when Firefox 1.5 was still Deer Park Alpha — someone got the bright idea to start tracking the number of add - ons downloaded from Mozilla 's servers .
Now , three and a half years later , the tick marks have finally tallied up to one billion , placing Mozilla — and all the developers , testers , users , and everyone else involved — firmly in the one billion club .
The one billionth download — which , sadly , cannot be traced to a specific add - on — came just twenty - four hours after the launch of Mozilla 's " Fashion Your Firefox " application , aimed at bringing the most popular and relevant extensions to users in an easy - to - understand point - and - click interface .
The tool presents users with nine sets of extensions , categorized by common on - line activities like " News Junkie " and " Social Butterfly , " with the intent of making it easier for users to find extensions that match their on - line activities without having to navigate the sometimes overwhelming selection available from the normal add - on repository .
The list draws heavily from Mozilla 's Recommended Add - Ons section , and has been specially vetted for user - friendliness , compatibility , and positive user reception .
Reaching a billion add - on downloads is just one among many recent achievements that demonstrate Firefox 's increasing distribution .
Just under a year ago , Mozilla released figures estimating over 125 million instances of Firefox running worldwide , while the June release of Firefox 3 set a world record for software downloads and brought Mozilla 's servers to their knees .
That , of course , all built up to the release of July 's market share numbers , which showed Firefox breaking the 20 % mark eight times , while the other browser saw some of its lowest numbers in recent memory .

10 . Area Boys
Public Domain
Lagos , Nigeria Drug trafficking , extortion , murder , inciting riots35,000
Over the past three decades , Nigeria ’s Area Boys have gone from young kids committing crimes of opportunity to a massive if still largely unorganized street gang responsible for acts of extortion and murder .
Local authorities , who have made a number of failed humanitarian attempts to eliminate the gang , tie the rising level of violence to a depressed economy , high unemployment and the increasing prevalence of drug addiction among the gang ’s members .
This article is part of a series describing a port of the samples from On Lisp ( OL ) to Clojure .
You will probably want to read the intro first .
This article covers Chapter 7 , Macros .
A Few Simple Macros
OL begins with a simple nil !
macro that sets something to nil .
nil ! is implemented as a macro in Common Lisp ( CL ) nil needs to generate a special form .
Clojure puts much more careful boundaries around mutable state , so most Clojure data structures are not set - able at all .
The few things that can be set are reference types , each with an explicit API and concurrency semantics .
Because setters go through an explicit API instead of a special form , the Clojure nil !
does not need to be macro at all .
Here is a nil ! for Clojure atoms :
( defn nil ! [ at ] ( swap ! at ( fn [ _ ] nil ) ) )
The swap !
function is specific to atoms .
Usage for nil !
looks like :
( def a ( atom 10 ) ) ( nil ! a ) @ a -> nil
The next interesting macro in OL is nif , which demonstrates the use of backquoting .
One way to implement Clojure nif is :
(( use ' [ clojure.contrib.fcase :only ( case ) ] ) ( defmacro nif [ expr pos zer neg ] ` ( case ( Integer / signum ~ expr ) - 1 ~ neg 0 ~ zer 1 ~ pos ) )
There are a few interesting differences from CL here :
Clojure unquoting uses ~ and ~@ instead of CL's , and , @ .
This allows Clojure to treat commas as whitespace .
and instead of CL's and .
This allows Clojure to treat commas as whitespace .
Clojure does not have a built - in signum , but it has access to all of Java , including Integer / signum .
, but it has access to all of Java , including .
Clojure 's case is not part of core , and is provided by Clojure Contrib .
Defining Simple Macros
OL demonstrates the " fill in the blanks " approach to writing macros :
Write the desired expansion .
Write the desired macro invocation form .
Use backquoting to create a template based on the desired expansion .
Use unquoting to substitute forms from the macro invocation into the template .
As examples , OL uses our - when and our - while .
The Clojure equivalents are :
( defmacro our - when [ test & body ] ` ( if ~ test ( do ~@ body ) ) )
( defmacro our - while [ test & body ] ` ( loop [ ] ( when ~ test ~@ body ( recur ) ) ) )
There is one interesting new thing here .
Clojure ' loop / recur is an explicit way to denote a self - tail - call so that Clojure can implement it with a non-stack - consuming iteration .
( Clojure cannot optimize tail calls in a generic way due to limitations of the JVM . )
It is also worth noting that while loops are uncommon in Clojure .
They rely on side effects that change the result of test , and most Clojure functions avoid side effects .
Destructuring in Macros
Both Clojure and CL support destructuring in macro definitions .
The OL example of this is a when - bind macro .
Here is a literal translation in Clojure :
( defmacro when - bind [ bindings & body ] ( let [ [ form tst ] bindings ] ` ( let [ ~ form ~ tst ] ( when ~ form ~@ body ) ) ) )
The [ form tst ] is a destructuring bind .
The first element of bindings binds to form , and the second element to tst .
Usage looks like this :
( when - bind [ a ( + 1 2 ) ] ( println " a is " a ) ) a is 3
Do not use the when - bind as defined above .
Clojure provides a better version called when - let :
; from Clojure core ( defmacro when - let [ bindings & body ] ( if ( vector ?
bindings ) ( let [ [ form tst ] bindings ] ` ( let [ temp # ~ tst ] ( when temp # ( let [ ~ form temp # ] ~@ body ) ) ) ) ( throw ( IllegalArgumentException .
" when - let now requires a vector for its binding " ) ) ) )
when - let adds two features not present in when - bind :
when - let requires that the binding form be a vector .
This leads to the " arguments in square brackets " style that distinguishes Clojure from many Lisps .
requires that the binding form be a vector .
This leads to the " arguments in square brackets " style that distinguishes Clojure from many Lisps .
when - let introduces a temporary binding temp # using Clojure 's auto - gensym feature .
The temporary binding of temp # keeps the binding form from being expanded directly into the when , because some binding forms are not legal for evaluation .
The following output shows the difference :
( when - bind [ [ a & b ] [ 1 2 3 ] ] ( println " b is " b ) ) ->java.lang .
Exception : Unable to resolve symbol : & in this context ( when - let [ [ a & b ] [ 1 2 3 ] ] ( println " b is " b ) ) -> b is ( 2 3 )
If it is not clear to you why when - bind does n't work , try calling macroexpand - 1 on both the forms above .
Wrapping up
The concepts in OL Chapter 7 translate fairly directly from Common Lisp into Clojure .
The bigger differences are choices of idiom .
Many of the examples in Common Lisp presume mutable state .
In the typical Clojure program these forms would be in the minority .
Notes
The sample code is available at http://github.com/stuarthalloway/onlisp-clojure.
Thanks to Chouser for setting me straight on why temp# appears in when - let .

Why the Continuity Model Makes Sense For Your Internet Business
What do I mean by continuity ?
A continuity program is anything that requires you to pay on a recurring basis to access a product .
Magazine subscriptions , membership sites , pay - for - access tools , and product - of - the - month clubs are all examples of solid businesses that use the continuity model .
If you think about it , a continuity program has huge potential ; you ’re continually paid even after creating a product and making a sale .
There are opportunities to incorporate continuity into almost every business .
It ’s just a matter of realizing the potential , coming up with a new idea that will lure people in , and executing a proper strategy .
I ’m currently focusing on building membership sites mainly because I love the continuity business model .
There are many reasons why it ’s beneficial and makes sense , especially for independent webmasters .
I ’ve listed out some of the advantages below .
6 Reasons why continuity makes sense for your business
1. Continuous cash flow & long term profits
One of the biggest concerns of most Internet entrepreneurs is sustaining a level of cash flow that can carry them through month to month .
Sure , a new project might be successful this month , but what happens next month with new projects ?
Most people prefer to be tied to corporate desk jobs mainly because of the financial security that jobs provide .
Getting a salary paycheck every couple of weeks means that there is a steady flow of cash coming in regardless of new projects .
Well what if I told you that you could get the best of both worlds – to be an entrepreneur who is paid on a continual basis ?
The continuity model provides that solution .
By charging customers for access , you ’re essentially increasing your cash flow for the long term – which is crucial in times of economic recession .
For example , say that you have a membership site that costs $ 57 per month .
With an average member base of just 50 people , you ’re set to make $ 2,850 every single month .
That ’s not bad at all .
2. Lower price point means more customers
Another benefit of continuity is that you can sell your products at a lower price point , knowing that you ’ll profit from recurring membership fees .
Lower prices mean more customers , which will then lead to huge long term profit potential .
As an example , many of the big Internet marketing product launches feature packages that cost in the thousands of dollars .
This is a huge barrier for many potential customers and they ’re ultimately unable to invest in the product .
However , say that the product was turned into a continuity membership site instead that cost $ 97 per month to access .
Would n’t that bring in more customers ?
Not only will you make up the cost in volume , but you ’ll also receive recurring fees that will increase profit margins even more .
PPC Classroom is a recent launch that followed this model with great success .
They went on to do $ 1 million in sales from a $ 77 + $ 22 / month membership site in just a week .
Crazy !
That just goes to show you the power of continuity .
Smaller recurring fees ( rather than a big lump sum ) means more customers who pay you over a longer period of time .
3 . Do work once , get paid forever
Are you tired of constantly writing blog posts and thinking of new ideas to generate income for your business ?
The beauty of membership sites and continuity programs is that you essentially do the work once , and get paid for it forever .
Think about it .
You can either work yourself to death constantly producing content so that you can sell advertising against it or you can produce premium content once and sell access to it forever .
Which would you rather do ?
Continuity programs significantly increase your efficiency – you create a product or idea , market it to gain subscribers , and move on to new projects that interest you .
Unlike blogs and service - oriented businesses , continuity programs can run themselves without needing you to be there all the time .
By setting up a continuity program now , you could be paid 2 years down the line for work you do today .
4. Easier to sell to existing customers
You know how the saying goes …
It ’s easier to sell to existing customers than it is to obtain new ones – and it ’s very true .
Continuity programs are effective because that ’s exactly what you ’re doing – selling to existing customers .
If people like what you have to offer and think that it ’s valuable , they ’ll continue to pay for it on a recurring basis .
Your product is essentially your marketing and you ’re developing a strong relationship with your customers in the process .
Since current customers are more likely to continue than new prospects are to sign on , lead generation costs are significantly decreased .
You can then take the higher profit margins and invest in new marketing channels that will bring in more people to the continuity funnel – which will lead to a snow ball effect for profits .
5 . People are willing to pay for updates & community
So far , we ’ve mostly discussed the benefits of a continuity model for you , the Internet business owner .
But how is continuity advantageous for consumers ?
Do they really want it ?
The answer to that question is yes .
People are willing to pay for exclusive cutting edge products that are frequently updated and kept up to date .
For example , SEOmoz PRO is a member ’s only area that provides the best tools and resources related to SEO .
Marketers want to pay for access because it gives them a competitive advantage – something that would n’t be possible if everything was publicly available for free .
In the same way , there ’s a need for continuity programs in almost every niche imaginable .
Marketers want access to the latest tools and tactics , day traders want insider information and expert advice , shoppers want to know about the best deals , and students of any topic want convenience and ease of information .
People want this kind of stuff and are willing to pay for it .
The possibilities with membership sites and continuity programs are endless .
6. Exclusivity = higher quality , better branding & increased demand
By nature , continuity programs are exclusive because they require recurring payment .
Someone who does n’t have $ 50 + to spare every month wo n’t be allowed to join .
This weeding - out process naturally ensures that everyone involved is serious and significantly increases both the real and perceived quality of the program .
What does this mean for you ?
First of all , the continuity means that everyone involved in your program is serious about your product and is considering staying with you for the long term .
This increases the community aspect of your site as well as your branding ; your program essentially becomes a high quality hub in your niche .
That in turn increases demand and thus your membership levels and profit .
If you take a look at all of the successful continuity programs on the web , they ’re all very exclusive with a tight - knit community .
For example , SEO Book , SEOmoz Pro , and Teaching Sells are all very high quality Internet marketing membership sites that follow this model .
Does your Internet business utilize a continuity program ?
If not , you ’re probably leaving a lot of income on the table .
Now that you know about all of the benefits , it ’s time to figure out how can you successfully incorporate continuity into your current sites .
I recently discovered Ryan Deiss ’ Continuity Blueprint , a marketing course that outlines everything you need to know about membership sites and continuity .
The price is pretty steep ( $ 1,997 ) but if you ’re serious about the model , I suggest you at least take a look at what it has to offer .
I bit the bullet and paid for it , but I know that it ’ll pay off once I implement the strategy .
Be sure to watch Ryan ’s continuity videos if you have n’t already .
There ’s a lot to be learned from those alone .
What do you think ?
Are you ready to use continuity to improve your business ?
Tomorrow , I ’ll be going over the niches that work best with continuity as well as a few examples of continuity programs .

Dr. D. Carleton Gajdusek , the brilliant yet deeply flawed pediatrician , virologist and anthropologist who won the 1976 Nobel Prize in medicine for his identification and description of kuru , the exotic disease of a remote tribe in New Guinea that was caused by a family of mysterious agents called prions , died Dec. 12 at the hotel where he lived in Tromso , Norway .
He was 85 .
No cause of death has been released , but he had suffered for years from congestive heart failure , according to his biographer and former student , Dr. Robert Klitzman of Columbia University .
An energetic and intellectual researcher , Gajdusek often said he was more proud of his anthropological studies among the Fore and Anga people of Micronesia than he was of the research that brought him the ultimate prize .
But blinded by his hubris and self - admitted pedophilia , he spent the last decade of his life in exile in Europe after his arrest and imprisonment for molesting one of the more than 50 children he brought to the United States , adopted and educated .
Intrigued by his two years of studying rabies , plague , arbovirus infections and scurvy at the Institut Pasteur in Tehran , Gajdusek scoured the Hindu Kush , the jungles of South America and the mountains , swamps and high valleys of Papua New Guinea and Malaysia searching for a rare disease he could make his own .
He found it when he met Dr. Vincent Zigas , an Estonian medical officer who served the Fore people in eastern Papua New Guinea .
Zigas introduced him to the Stone Age people , who were suffering from a mysterious malady that they called kuru , from the Fore word meaning “ to shake . ”
The disease , which caused trembling , sporadic fits of laughter and madness before inevitably leading to death , affected one out of 10 people in the 35,000 - member tribe .
Autopsies showed that victims ’ brains were riddled with gaping holes , making their once solid organs resemble sponges -- leading to the general name spongiform encephalopathies for diseases in the class .
The disease was not believed to result from an infection , because victims did not suffer a fever and there were no signs of inflammation -- both indications of classical infections .
Most researchers thought kuru was either hereditary or the result of a dietary deficiency .
Gajdusek described the disease in a 1957 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine and took samples back to his lab at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Md. , for study .
He concluded that the disease was spread during an ancient funerary ritual when women and children consumed the brains of the deceased .
Since that practice was formally banned in 1959 , no new cases of the disease have appeared except in those who were exposed before the ban took effect .
Gajdusek injected samples of diseased human brain tissue into a variety of small animals hoping to reproduce the disease , but without success .
He ultimately obtained some chimpanzees and injected them as well .
At first , that too yielded no results .
But after periods ranging from 1 1 / 2 to three years , the animals began to develop symptoms similar to those exhibited by the Fore .
In a 1966 paper in the journal Nature describing the transmission experiments , Gajdusek dubbed the infectious agent a “ slow , unconventional virus . ”
Further studies by Gajdusek and others showed that a similar agent was responsible for a disease in sheep called scrapie , another malady in humans called Creutzfeldt - Jacob disease and the variant form of Creutzfeldt - Jacob commonly known as mad cow disease .
Eventually , neurologist Stanley Prusiner of UC San Francisco identified the infectious agent as an unexpected rogue form of protein called a prion -- a feat that won him his own Nobel Prize in 1997 .
Prions are mis-folded forms of protein that , through mechanisms not yet understood , induce other proteins to assume similar shapes , disrupting cellular metabolism and killing cells in the brain .
Prions cannot be disrupted even in boiling water , are not susceptible to drug treatment and cannot be classified as living because they contain no DNA or RNA .
They are also not recognized by the immune system as foreign , so the body cannot fight them off as it would any other infectious agent .
Some researchers now believe that prions may also be involved in producing dementia and perhaps even in triggering cancer .
Gajdusek later helped other researchers find genetically isolated populations that helped shed light on the causes of hermaphroditism , Huntington ’s disease and other rare illnesses .
Daniel Carleton Gajdusek was born Sept. 9 , 1923 , in Yonkers , N.Y. , the son of a Slovak father and a Hungarian mother .
As a child , he demonstrated a remarkable interest and skill in science , stimulated by his aunt , Irene Dobroscky , who worked at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in New York .
She tutored him in the biology of plants and the insects that infested them and introduced him to other researchers at the institute .
During the summers of his 13th to 16th years , he worked in the laboratory of chemist John Arthur , synthesizing a variety of compounds that Arthur thought might have insecticidal properties .
One of those chemicals , 2,4 - dichlorophenoxyacetic acid , became a commercial weed killer , and the institute based its patent claims on young Gajdusek ’s laboratory notebook .
He was an undergraduate at the University of Rochester , then entered Harvard Medical School , where he received his degree in 1946 , specializing in pediatrics .
His postgraduate education included work at Harvard , Columbia and Caltech , where he interacted with many of the notable biologists of the era .
In 1951 , he was drafted into the Army and sent to the Walter Reed Army Medical Service Graduate School as a research virologist , spending time at the Tehran institute .
Afterward , he went to Australia to perform postdoctoral work at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research .
It was on the way home from this interlude that he discovered the Fore , changing the course of his life forever .
Klitzman and others say Gajdusek mingled comfortably with the isolated tribes , communicating easily in a nonverbal fashion and becoming a de facto member of the tribes ’ extended families .
Some critics have charged that Gajdusek brought children from the tribes to the United States and adopted them to satisfy his pedophilia .
But anthropologist Ceridwen Spark of Monash University in Australia , who studied Gajdusek , argues that it was his need for an extended family that led him to help the boys .
In any case , Gajdusek spent much of his own money raising the boys and educating them , sending some to graduate school and medical school on his own dime .
But his efforts ultimately led to his downfall .
In 1996 , one of his boys , by then an adult in college , went to the police alleging that when he was a teenager his adopted father had abused him .
The FBI then recorded a call between the young man and Gajdusek in which the scientist admitted that he was a pedophile , that he had touched the boy sexually and that he had had sex with some of the other boys .
He named one other boy in the conversation , and the boy confirmed the story .
But Gajdusek ’s friends helped the boy return to New Guinea , and authorities could prosecute only the offense against the boy who had gone to the police .
On the advice of his lawyer , Gajdusek negotiated a plea bargain and in April 1997 was sentenced to 12 to 18 months in prison -- despite a stack of letters from prominent scientists begging the court for leniency .
He was released the following April and immediately left for France , spending the rest of his life working and writing in Europe .
He apparently liked the long , dark winters of Tromso because the isolation gave him plenty of time for writing .
He remained unrepentant about his sexual relationships with the young boys .
He often said he thought American law was unduly prudish and argued that he had chosen boys only from cultures where man-boy sex was common and unremarkable .
In addition to his many adopted sons and daughters , Gajdusek is survived by two nephews , Karl Lawrence Gajdusek and Mark Terry .

Hope for children with leukaemia as scientists find new way to ' buy time ' for transplants
Scientists have shed new light on how healthy blood cells are disabled in people with leukaemia and how to stop it from happening .
The findings could help ' buy time ' for patients who need life - saving transplants , they believe .
The study on mice showed that leukaemia cells lure healthy blood - forming stem cells into their cancerous lairs – and handicap them – using powerful chemical signals .
But jamming the potent signals protects the vital stem cells – allowing them to replenish the blood .
Hope :
The findings point towards a new treatment that could buy valuable time for children with leukaemia
If the same system works in humans , this process could help preserve healthy blood cells in people with leukemia , said Dr. Dorothy Sipkins of the University of Chicago Medical Center , whose study appears in the journal Science .
A third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia and about 400 new cases occur each year in the UK .
In prior studies , Sipkins found that leukaemia cells and some solid tumours create specific niches in the bone marrow - where they multiply and spread .
Healthy blood - making cells also gather in special bone marrow niches , where they divide and make vital blood cells .
The healthy blood cells are needed to fight infection , control blood clotting and carry oxygen to the body .
Sipkins wanted to find out what happens when the two worlds collide .
Her team developed a way to image both types of cells in mice with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or ALL , a cancer of the white blood cells that mostly affects children .
‘ We saw that the cells that were previously in happy normal homes were actually so attracted by the malignant niches they were migrating into these tumour cell niches , ’ Sipkins said .
Her team then studied what happened to the healthy cells in the new environment , and found they were ‘ compromised ’ .
‘ Their number declines over time and once they were in the malignant niche they could n't leave it .
They were stuck there , ’ she said .
Sipkins believes the cancer overproduces a molecule called a stem cell factor , which entices normal stem cells into the cancer niche .
‘ They express it in such a high amount in this malignant niche , the progenitor cells say , “ Wow , I 'm going to abandon where I am because this smells delicious to me . ” ’
But when the team blocked the chemical ’s release with neutralising antibodies , the blood - making cells went about their normal business .
‘ If human stem cells respond in the same way as mouse cells do , it could buy us time to apply other therapies , ’ Sipkins said .
This could make bone marrow stem cell transplants an option for more patients , allowing doctors to collect and bank patients ' own stem cells for use after high - dose chemotherapy .
Or it could simply keep their immune systems healthy .
Sipkins said there is some evidence that other tumors that spread to the bone , such as breast and lung cancer , may have similar effects .
‘ It does give us a lead and that is exciting to us at this stage , ’ she said .
DIGG THIS
Rumor has it that when Professor Walter Block presented a lecture at Loyola College recently in which he argued that free - market competition diminishes rather than exacerbates the male / female " wage gap " the entire College administration , and the majority of the economics department , collectively swooned .
There are even reports that they all collapsed simultaneously on the same swooning couch .
What could Professor Block have said that generated such hysteria , including comical " apologies " from the College president and several members of the economics department ?
In terms of the " wage gap " his main point was one that Nobel laureate Gary Becker ( Professor Block ’s dissertation advisor at Columbia University way back when ) and many other economists have been making for decades : marriage affects men and women differently in terms of their earning abilities .
There are exceptions , but in general women are more likely to drop out of the workforce for a period of time because of child rearing and other chores ( that most men shirk ) .
Consequently , they fall behind their male counterparts in terms of human capital accumulation , productivity , and wages .
If that was enough to cause outrage , apologies all around , and calls to burn Professor Block in effigy atop the Loyola College church steeple , it is unimaginable what might happen if the book Why Men Earn More : The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap — And What Women Can Do About
It , by Warren Farrell ever made it into the stacks at the Loyola College library .
Even more explosive would be the new book by Professor James T. Bennett of George Mason University ’s economics department entitled The Politics of American Feminism : Gender Conflict in Contemporary Society .
Warren Farrell boasts of having been elected to the board of directors of the New York City branch of the National Organization for Women ( NOW ) three times .
The author of the foreword to Farrell ’s book , Karen DeCrow , is a former NOW president who works as an employment discrimination lawyer .
" Men are not involved in a nefarious plot to keep female wages down , " she declares .
( Pass the smelling salts to the Loyola College administration , quick ! )
In The Politics of American Feminism ( pp. 128— 129 ) Professor Bennett paraphrases more than twenty reasons why men earn more than women , as discussed and documented in great detail in Why Men Earn More .
Cumulatively , they go a long way towards explaining the " wage gap , " although neither Bennett nor Farrell believes that wage discrimination by gender is completely nonexistent .
The reasons , based on generalizations that are supported by voluminous statistics , are :
Men go into technology and hard sciences more than women .
Men are more likely to take hazardous jobs than women , and such jobs pay more than cushier and safer jobs .
Men are more willing to expose themselves to inclement weather at work , and are compensated for it ( " compensating differences " in the language of economics ) .
Men tend to take more stressful jobs that are not " nine - to - five . "
Many women prefer personal fulfillment at work ( child care professional , for example ) to higher pay .
Men are bigger risk takers than women , in general .
Higher risk leads to higher reward .
The worst working hours pay more , and men are more likely to work these hours than women .
Dangerous jobs ( coal mining ) pay more and are more male dominated .
Men tend to " update " their work qualifications more than women do .
Men are more likely to work longer hours , and the pay gap widens for every hour past 40 per week .
Women are more likely to have " gaps " in their careers , primarily because of child rearing and child care .
Less experience means lower pay .
Women are nine times more likely than men to drop out of work for " family reasons . "
Less seniority leads to lower pay .
Men work more weeks per year than women .
Men have half the absenteeism rate of women .
Men are more willing to commute long distances to work .
Men are more willing to relocate to undesirable locations for higher - paying jobs .
Men are more willing to take jobs that require extensive travel .
In the corporate world men are more likely to choose higher - paying fields such as finance and sales , whereas women are more prevalent in lower - paying fields such as human resources and public relations .
When men and women have the same job title , male responsibilities tend to be greater .
Men are more likely to work by commission ; women are more likely to seek job security .
The former has more earning potential .
Women place greater value on flexibility , a humane work environment , and having time for children and family than men do .
One message that Farrell has for women is that if they really want to get paid more , they should pay more attention to these determinants of higher pay and less to Quixotic crusades for " comparable worth legislation " or " diversity training " that demonizes male employees but does nothing for them .
This is the kind of practical advice a top - notch economist like Professor Block would offer , but such advice is usually drowned out on today ’s college campuses by politically - correct lynch mobs who , as Professor Bennett says of academic feminists , " find it far easier to simply smear those who point out the phantom nature of the wage gap .

The theme park's ' cage of death ' that drops tourists into a crocodile 's lair
Without the cage you would n't stand a chance swimming with a massive saltwater crocodile .
But for brave punters who still want to get cosy with a feisty croc , a new Australian tourist attraction is offering the chance for a close encounter in the safety of a clear acrylic box dubbed the ' cage of death ' .
Just 4 cm of acrylic , a pair of goggles and a swimsuit , will separate thrill - seekers from the jaws of Choppa , a saltwater crocodile .
Close encounter : A tourist dives into a cage partially immersed in a crocodile pen at Crocosaurus Cove in Darwin , Australia
The cage has no bars , unlike cages used in shark dives , which prevents the reptiles from gripping on but deep teeth scratches are visible on the sides , deterring some hesitant participants .
Top End tourists climb into the clear box before being lowered into Choppa 's lair .
They then spend 15 minutes inside the 9ft high cage and watch Choppa , who lost both front feet while fighting other crocodiles , trying to take a bite out of them .
Getting cosy : Choppa the crocodile looks like he 's ' affectionately ' trying to hug the dare - devil tourist
The attraction at Crocosaurus Cove in the heart of the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory has been given high marks by adrenaline - junkies .
' This is it ! ' said self - confessed thrill - seeker Mark Clayton from Darwin after spending 20 minutes face - to - face with the crocodiles .
' I dive with sharks , large rays , moray eels ... but it 's not this close .
It 's exhilarating to get that close to a crocodile of that size . '
Face - to - face :
The experience is made even more thrilling for tourists because the cage has no bars
Saltwater crocodiles , known locally as " salties , " are the largest crocodile species , with the males growing up to 19.6 ft long and weighing up to 2,204lbs .
They are found in across Southeast Asia but the highest numbers are found in northern Australia .
Michael Scott , who opened the attraction in July , said there was plenty of demand for the £ 35 thrill .
' In the Northern Territory , the saltwater crocodile is an icon and is part of our life .
They are always in the news , either in someone 's swimming pool or killing someone 's favourite horse , ' Mr Scott said .
Hunting for food :
Up to two people are allowed in the cage at the one time
The most famous crocodile to be housed at the park is Burt , who starred as the beast that nearly ate Linda Koslowski ’s character in Crocodile Dundee .
Although saltwater crocodiles are dangerous , fatal attacks on humans are rare in Australia with only one or two reported a year .
Warning signs are displayed at rivers , lake and beaches in areas inhabited by crocodiles .
Dicing with danger : Swimming face - to - face with a massive saltwater crocodile might not be everyone 's idea of fun but thrill - seekers are snapping up Australia 's newest tourist attraction
The most recent fatality was reported last month in Queensland when the suspected remains of a British man were found inside a crocodile .
Arthur Booker , 62 , was last seen checking crab pots on a crocodile - infested river in the state 's north .
There is only one activity more thankless than predicting the future -- and that is publicly sharing your predictions .
But Christmas is the season for sharing , so here is my list of predictions for 2009 .
Caveat lector , of course , so much of this is bound to be wrong .
But I would be willing to bet my Harvard M.B.A. that at least three of them are correct .
Okay , maybe two of them .
Prediction No. 1 : General Motors will file for bankruptcy - law protection by the end of April Will the TARP money tide GM over until 2010 ?
Not a chance .

Observers sense ' something fishy ' in Alaska vote David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday November 7 , 2008

The 2008 presidential race is over , but several Senate races still remain undecided .
Georgia is headed for a runoff , Minnesota for a recount -- and in Alaska things just keep getting stranger .
" It looks like senator and convicted felon Ted Stevens and Congressman - currently - under - investigation Don Young will both hold onto their seats , " MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow noted on Thursday .
" That said , there 's a case to be made that there 's something fishy going on up there . "
Even though the polls this year have generally been pretty accurate , they were way off in Alaska .
Stevens was running between 7 % and 22 % behind his Democratic challenger in the polls , but now he is narrowly ahead in the vote count
Polling analysis website 538.com comments ,
" The emerging conventional wisdom is that there was some sort of a Bradley Effect in this contest -- voters told pollsters that they were n't about to vote for that rascal Ted Stevens , when in fact they were perfectly happy to .
Convicted felons are the new black , it would seem .
The problem with this theory is that the polling failures in Alaska were n't unique to Stevens . "
The polls also consistently showed Rep .
Young as losing by at least 6 % , but he is currently ahead in the vote count by 8 % .
Even in the presidential race , where polls showed McCain leading by 14 % or less , the vote count has him winning by 61 % to 35 % -- precisely the same margin as George Bush in 2004 .
That represents a polling error of at least 11 % to 14 % in all three races .
At the same time , total voter turnout appears to be about 11 % lower in Alaska this year than in 2004 -- despite over 20,000 new registrations , heavy turnout in the primaries , record early voting , long lines at the polls on Election Day , and the state 's own governor being on the ballot , all of which had led to an expectation of record participation .
Maddow turned for explanations to Nate Silver of 538.com , who pointed out that tens of thousands of absentee ballots , early votes , and provisional votes are yet to be counted .
However , these appear to be spread fairly evenly across the state , not concentrated in Democratic areas , so even a final tally is unlikely to jibe with the polls .
" Clearly it did n't go how the pollsters expected , " Silver commented .
The Washington Post reports that pollsters themselves are " not happy " about the results .
" Anchorage pollster and Republican political consultant David Dittman , a Stevens supporter , predicted a ' solid Begich win '
The national polling firm , Rasmussen Reports , accurately predicted every Senate race in the country within the margin of error in their most recent polls -- except Alaska .
Alaska pollsters Ivan Moore , Craciun Research Group and Hays Research Group all also had Stevens and Young trailing in the lead - up to the election . "
" Is there any place ... where you are worried about the potential for shenanigans ? "
Maddow asked Silver as the segment concluded .
" Should the parties be lawyering up ? "
Silver answered that he is n't concerned about Minnesota , but Alaska and Georgia " are two states where you definitely have a high threat level for voter fraud . "

Obama may be stuck with anti-pot crusading GOP US Attorney Nick Juliano
Published : Monday December 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Chong prosecutor dares Obama to fire her
If someone were to make a list of all the things a federal prosecutor could spend his or her time on to distract from fighting the war on terror , organized crime and other top Justice Department priorities , that list would mirror Mary Beth Buchanan 's most touted accomplishments during her previous seven years as a US Attorney .
Now the Bush - appointee -- who spent $ 12 million to put that oh - so - notorious kingpin Tommy Chong behind bars for nine months -- has been struck with another bout of headline - grabbing obstinance .
Buchanan says she wo n't step down once President - elect Obama takes office next month .
" It does n't serve justice for all the U.S. attorneys to submit their resignations all at one time , " she told a local paper last week , adding , " I am open to considering further service to the United States . "
The defiant posture and break with tradition could complicate Obama 's attempt to put his own mark on a Justice Department that has seen its reputation sullied over the last eight years .
Some speculate Buchanan is essentially daring the president - elect to fire her .
Buchanan 's prosecution of Chong , which was profiled in a 2006 documentary , was by no means her only unorthodox crusade against relatively harmless transgressors .
She also pursued the first federal obscenity case in two decades , against a pornography producer , and she 's pursued public corruption charges against outspoken Democrats .
After Operation Pipe Dreams -- the sting aimed at Chong and other pot paraphernalia providers -- Buchanan went after the manufacturer of devises like the Whizzinator and other products aimed at helping people beat drug tests .
This operation ( coincidentally , we 're sure ) led to federal agents raiding the distributor of documentary a /k / a Tommy Chong and confiscating several thousand DVD copies of the film .
Libertarians and drug war critics note that law enforcement agencies -- whether they be federal , state or local -- can always find a better use of their time and money than cracking down on harmless pot smokers or porn peddlers .
What makes Buchanan 's actions particularly egregious , they say , is that she pursued these mixed up priorities in the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terror attacks , which intimately affected her own jurisdiction .
Flight 93 crashed in her western Pennsylvania district .
Buchanan 's indication that she 's not leaving -- as all US Attorneys customarily do following a change in administration -- does not mean her continued employment with the federal government is assured .
Obama , like every president , has the authority to hire and fire federal prosecutors for virtually any reason ; however , he may face some criticism if he moves quickly to oust Buchanan .
After all , Democrats have spent the last two years criticizing President Bush 's politicization of the Justice Department and routinely firing US Attorneys with whom he disagreed .
While the two situations -- assuming Obama gets rid of Buchanan -- would not be directly comparable , it 's not hard to imagine the cries of " hypocrisy " one would hear from the same right wing pundits whose defense of executive power to this point has been nearly boundless .
Indeed , such a controversy may be just what Buchanan wants , as Reason magazine 's Radley Balko hypothesizes .
" Buchanan is nt delusional .
Shes calculating , " he writes .
" My guess is that this is a stunt to force Obama to fire her , at which point shell make a public stink , play the martyr , then attempt to parlay the resulting controversy into a run for the Senate , or perhaps for governor of Pennsylvania . "
The American way of life is dead …
.... and like a beheaded corpse , still stumbling around , it has yet to come to that realization that should be obvious to anyone .
The American way of life is dead …
The American way of life , a system unsustainable by any stretch of the imagination , was facilitated on two facts : cheap gas and a valuable currency , the currency than morphing into cheap credit .
Since the US signed a deal with Saudi Arabia to value oil only in US dollar , something that happened in 1948 , the US dollar has been a powerful currency , quickly rising to the level of the world reserve currency .
As soon as all nations needed the dollar to purchase oil , there seemed to be no end as to how many dollars could be printed and what first the US government and than the ever down sized taxpayer , could afford ... just add the cheap credit .
Godless consumerism never really took off the way it did until Nixon took the US off the gold standard in 1973 .
From then to now , there was no stopping it .
Add to this , the cheap gas , partially guaranteed by that God forsaken deal between America and the worst of the worst of the Islamic jihadists , and the far flung suburban life style , with houses packed full of cheap priced and even cheaper quality Chinese goods , was born .
Of course , anyone with half an understanding of reality and economics knew it could not go on forever and so it has come to an end .
However , the elite oligarchies of America , must be congratulated that they were able to keep it going for so long .
Of course the estimated $ 500 Billion in plundered Russian wealth , from the early and mid 1990s , sure did help .
However , the era of the dollar is over and with it US power .
The dollar has been in a steady free fall for the better of the past 6 years , faster than the steady decline of the preceding 30 years .
How is it , that with a prolonged war , costing close to $ 1 trillion , no new taxes have been raised ?
Well , that 's what printing presses are for and why since 2004 , the Fed has stopped issuing the M3 report .
Due partially to this dieing dollar , the falling US power that has stopped being able to pressure Arabs into pumping more , increase in demand world wide and the resurgence of Russian industry drinking up their own oil , the price of oil has skyrocketed .
It sure does not hurt that the US idiocy of having cake and eating too is still fully in the swing : that would be the plan to be foreign oil independent while not drilling your own oil or to build nuclear power plants .
The era of big spending , large houses , long commutes and giant SUVs and trucks are over .
Sure , the contraction back into tightly packed cities and small modest houses , budgeted spending and compact cars will not come over night and it is equally sure that the indebted and breaking US consumer will fight it every step of the way , but it is over .
The first thing to already go is the big trucks and SUVs .
Sure there are plenty still on the roads , but sales of new ones are falling fast , actually collapsing out right would be a more proper term .
Next , considering the absolute lack of public transportation in most US urban and suburban areas and for that matter the very city centers , next will come the car pooling fad , as smaller cars still eat gas , a commodity still climbing in price .
Sooner or later this will reach a tipping point as well , where even car pooling will no longer work , as incomes will never keep up with inflation .
Incomes will further degrade as the cycle of cut backs by suppliers followed by cut backs and layoffs by businesses continues .
Fewer hours and less real pay will make the expense of far flung large yards , expensive to heat and cool large houses and high gasoline bills , seem rather infuriating and pointless to support .
A final hit upon the suburbanite will be the high increase in the cost of goods around him .
Since rail head are limited and diesel is sailing far ahead of gasoline , the best prices on goods will be those around the inner city , closest to the rail heads .
Goods that have to be trucked out to the various far flung stores will bare the price of the fuel that delivers them .
Many stores will close driving not only jobs away from the suburbs but also the ability to live comfortably .
As more and more suburbanites return to live in the city , the property they sell will have massive downward pressure on their neighbors ' property values .
This in turn will force more of their neighbors to equally move out .
Would be farmers should take note , perfectly good farm land will be rather cheap to come by ... just have to burn off the ply wood massive shacks on it .
Crime will also initially sky rocket , especially in the far flung neighborhoods .
The satellite cities that grew up around the big cities will be hardest hit and many will bankrupt as their tax base continues to erode .
With bankruptcy will come cut backs in services , to include the police force .
Gun rights advocates should take heart as more and more Americans will quickly come to depend on self protection for their sole source of protection .
Large quantities of second hand goods will also come on the market , as people move away from large stuffed houses in the suburbs to smaller , some times much smaller , apartments and houses in the cities .
Craig 's List , Ebay and garage sale hunters will greatly benefit , at least in the short term .
But there will be massive problems in the cities .
Over crowding is the most obvious one .
But with little industry , little money and only the service economy to rely on , the cities will be poor , angry and dangerous , as well as over crowded .
The country side will become once again lonely and manageable and small towns and villages a lot more inviting .
A return to America cira 1920s is more likely .
Illegal aliens take note : not only will American workers compete more directly with you over jobs than any time in the past 50 years , but they will fully view you , and correctly to boot , as the usurpers you are of their livelihood .
Illegals ' lives are going to get very dangerous and violent .
Tourism will of course suffer , so all those far flung , well developed tourist hot spots , that also happen to be in hurricane paths , will become lonely and decayed .
It will become harder and harder for the government to pay for their almost annual rebuilding or even to justify it .
Nature will be a big winner in all this .
But one final issue must be faced , the one issue that could easily launch those over packed cities into full scale revolt : veterans .
Yes , with bankruptcy of the great big world wide empire , some one million well trained and often enough , well armed , veterans will be returning to the cities where their chances of jobs are slim at best .
If they take arms , things in the America of the 2010s will be rather interesting and lively indeed .

Jeffrey Mikulina , a longtime environmental activist in Hawaii , jokes that his home state , which is almost completely dependent on imported oil , is one supertanker away from being Amish .
It also is one superheated ocean away from being underwater .
There , in a nutshell , is the motivation behind a new campaign to wean Hawaii from fossil fuels in 10 years .
The project is Hawaii ’s own moon mission , led by the Blue Planet Foundation and not by the state ’s political establishment , which tends to prefer the slow and tortured way to change ( a long battle over a new commuter rail system was bogged down by a ferocious debate over whether it should have steel or rubber wheels ) .
Blue Planet , a private foundation , is the creation of Henk Rogers , a software entrepreneur who made a fortune in Tetris .
Reassessing his life after a heart attack two years ago , he decided to pursue a goal that for decades has been as elusive as it is drop - dead obvious .
Hawaii is as energy - hungry as any state , but it has no oil , natural gas , hydroelectric dams or nuclear plants .
It needs imported crude to keep the lights on , but it also has an abundance of clean - energy sources : sunshine , wind , powerful tides and waves and cold ocean depths .
We like our Spirituality clean .
That is to say we like our spiritual journey to be clean , neat , filled with lots of wonderful happy experiences , and love .
If that ’s all you want you can at best go , , , half way .
That kind of spiritual journey ignores or denies dealing with the ego , self importance , fears , and various other illusions in the mind .
Coming face to face with your inner demons like the Judge , or Victim aspects of your personality are a dirty affair .
Being honest with our lack of impeccability , how we judge our self , or other people , is humbling .
Miss those opportunities , and you miss out on dissolving the ego .
This business of cleaning up and dissolving your fears is dirty as well .
You ca n’t move through your fear of death , loneliness , or what others think of you , by looking at it from afar .
Nope .
You have to get dirty .
Be present with with those fears , , , and stay aware and awake at the same time .
That ’s how your emotional body gets cleaned of fears and emotional wounds .
If you try and stay “ clean ” in this work you will miss those wounds .
You ’ll end up having a nicely spiritual coat over your emotional wounds .
Challenge your inner demons and you will lose your attention to their tricks more often in the beginning than you will win .
You will take your licks as you learn to play their game better than they do .
You will have some falls into muddy emotions of shame , guilt , embarrassment , and perhaps even touch hopelessness now and again .
With some good training , and practice you can keep your self clean .
But you will get dirty along the way .
Yes this spiritual journey is dirty business .
At least it can be that way in the beginning .
Later , if you ’ve cleaned up your emotional wounds , and dissolved your self importance , it takes on that bright sparkling look , and may even have a lemon fresh scent to it .
But for now , it ’s okay that this spiritual work is dirty business .
Joining the ranks of federal district judges in Arizona and Massachusetts , District of Minnesota Chief Judge Michael Davis today concluded [ 44 - page PDF ] that simply making a music file available in a shared file does not violate copyright law , and ordered a new trial in Capitol Records v. Jammie Thomas .
The case made headlines last year as the first peer - to - peer file - sharing case to go all the way to trial .
In October 2007 , a jury held Thomas liable and awarded $ 222,000 in damages to the record companies , based in whole or in part ( it was n't clear ) on an instruction that merely making a file available violates a copyright owner 's distribution right .
Earlier this year , Chief Judge Davis said he was concerned that he might have made a mistake with that instruction and asked for more briefing on whether Thomas deserved a new trial .
EFF , joined by Public Knowledge , the United States Internet Industry Association , and the Computer and Communications Industry Association filed an amicus brief urging the Court to reject the RIAA 's making available theory .
One key holding :
The Court ’s examination of the use of the term “ distribution ” in other provisions of the Copyright Act , as well as the evolution of liability for offers to sell in the analogous Patent Act , lead to the conclusion that the plain meaning of the term “ distribution ” does not including making available and , instead , requires actual dissemination .
. . .
If simply making a copyrighted work available to the public constituted a distribution , even if no member of the public ever accessed that work , copyright owners would be able to make an end run around the standards for assessing contributor copyright infringement .
In addition , Chief Judge Davis called on Congress to amend the Copyright Act :
The Court would be remiss if it did not take this opportunity to implore Congress to amend the Copyright Act to address liability and damages in peer - to - peer network cases such as the one currently before this Court .
. . .
While the Court does not discount Plaintiffs ’ claim that , cumulatively , illegal downloading has far - reaching effects on their businesses , the damages awarded in this case are wholly disproportionate to the damages suffered by Plaintiffs .
Thomas allegedly infringed on the copyrights of 24 songs — the equivalent of approximately three CDs , costing less than $ 54 , and yet the total damages awarded is $ 222,000 — more than five hundred times the cost of buying 24 separate CDs and more than four thousand times the cost of three CDs .
While the Copyright Act was intended to permit statutory damages that are larger than the simple cost of the infringed works in order to make infringing a far less attractive alternative than legitimately purchasing the songs , surely damages that are more than one hundred times the cost of the works would serve as a sufficient deterrent .
. . .
Unfortunately , by using Kazaa , Thomas acted like countless other Internet users .
Her alleged acts were illegal , but common .
Her status as a consumer who was not seeking to harm her competitors or make a profit does not excuse her behavior .
But it does make the award of hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages unprecedented and oppressive .
EFF applauds Chief Judge Davis 's thorough rejection of the RIAA 's effort to rewrite copyright law and thereby avoid the trouble of actually proving any infringement has occurred .
And we wholeheartedly endorse the court 's call to amend the Copyright Act 's oppressive damages provisions .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- China 's 4 trillion yuan ( $ 586 billion ) economic - stimulus plan may have lifted sentiment toward global growth , commodities and related stocks , but on Monday some market strategists were quick to identify potential losers from the plan , starting with U.S. consumers and Treasury debt .
" News of China 's massive economic stimulus plan has helped markets worldwide , but for the U.S. the impact will be reduced by a number of important factors , " said Tony Crescenzi , market strategist at Miller Tabak .
" For starters , China must of course finance its plan , which could mean it will have to either sell its holdings of U.S. Treasury and agency securities or slow its rate of accumulation in these securities , " Crescenzi wrote in a note .
China holds roughly $ 1 trillion of U.S. securities , including $ 541 billion of U.S. Treasurys and $ 200 billion in agency securities , according to Miller Tabak .
Massive selling of those securities , at a time when the U.S. government is already expected to issue large amounts of debt to finance its own economic stimulus measures , could further raise borrowing costs , such as mortgage rates , which are benchmarked to bond yields .
On Monday , however , bonds rallied , sending yields lower , as U.S. stocks reversed earlier gains and the government successfully sold $ 25 billion in three - year notes .
See Bonds .
Similarly , the dollar initially sank , as the stimulus package raised investors ' risk appetite .
In recent weeks , the greenback has benefited from risk aversion .
But the dollar pared losses as U.S. equities erased gains .

Beijing unveiled on Sunday what it described as a " massive " economic stimulus package in an effort to reverse slowing economic growth in the world 's most populous country .
See full story .
The immediate market beneficiaries of China 's plan were evident overnight and early Monday .
See Resource Stocks on Fire
Led by miners and other commodities - related stocks , Asian and European markets rallied after Beijing unveiled the package , which is heavily focused on infrastructure spending .
" While unlikely to have an immediate effect , this is clearly to be positive for sentiment and , in time , commodity demand , " said analysts at Numis Securities .
Crude oil futures first surged over 7 % before settling more than 2 % higher , and corn futures also gained nearly 2 % .
See Futures Movers .
Gold gained $ 12 .
See Metals Stocks
Funds from the stimulus package will be spent in 10 major areas that include low - income housing , rural infrastructure , water , electricity , transportation and improvements in the environment .
The report said spending will also include " rebuilding from several disasters , " most notably the May 12 earthquake in Sichuan province .
Credit Suisse analysts said that accelerated infrastructure spending in China will benefit European steelmakers , especially early - cycle firms such as Luxemburg - based ArcelorMittal MT , - 0.22 % the world 's largest steelmaker , which gained nearly 4 % .
Among U.S. steelmakers , United States Steel Corp. X , - 2.90 % and Nucor Corp. NUE , - 2.45 % also advanced , with each gaining about 1 % .
And among other miners , Newmont Mining NEM , +1.03 % gained 5.6 % , Alcoa AA , - 4.65 % rose 5.3 % and Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold FCX , - 3.64 % rose 1.4 % .
While U.S. stocks gave up early gains , Canadian shares , heavily represented by energy producers and miners , finished higher , with the Toronto Stock Exchange rising nearly 1 % .
See Canadian Shares .
On Wall Street , the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % finished 73 points , or 0.8 % , lower at 8,870 , losing early steam that led the blue chip average to a high of 9,159 .
Consumer - discretionary stocks were the second - worst performers , with the sector losing 3.9 % on the S&P 500 index SPX , - 0.48 % .
With the U.S. and other major economies already experiencing a major economic slowdown , a rebound in commodities prices would n't be a welcome development for consumers , Crescenzi noted .
Multinational firms with the S&P 's industrials sector , however , were the second best performing , falling only 0.5 % , while the energy sector rose 1.3 % .
" The main positive for the U.S. [ from the plan ] will be the business generated by U.S. multinational companies with a presence in China , " Miller Tabak 's Crescenzi said .
" It is difficult to see how China 's stimulus plan will translate into anything meaningful with respect to U.S. exports to China , especially since the stimulus is geared toward infrastructure , " he said .
Emerging markets
The scope of the stimulus plan also led some analysts to worry more about the global economy .
" China has gone from having to slow their economy to having to boost it , " said Phil Flynn , a vice president at Alaron Trading .
" The market is still trying to determine the extent of the global economic downturn . "
Similarly , emerging markets analysts at RBC Dominion believe that the Chinese measures disprove the theory that China and Asia could decouple from other major economies around the world -- and be immune from a global slowdown .
" We have our doubts that the impact of the package will be felt in time to prevent a further weakening in Chinese growth in the near - term , " they wrote in a note .
Infrastructure spending takes longer to boost growth than direct payments to consumers , the RBC analysts said , and this means Chinese growth expectations could further be downgraded over the coming year .
" We are not convinced that China will support global growth to the extent most expect , " they said .
" This could further dent already rapidly waning investor euphoria towards [ leading emerging markets , such as Brazil , Russia and India ] , negatively impacting other emerging markets via the growth , commodity price and investment flow channels . "
Introduction to Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a method for efficiently solving a broad range of search and optimization problems which exhibit the characteristics of overlappling subproblems and optimal substructure .
I 'll try to illustrate these characteristics through some simple examples and end with an exercise .
Happy coding !
Contents
Overlapping Subproblems
A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused multiple times .
This is closely related to recursion .
To see the difference consider the factorial function , defined as follows ( in Python ) :
def factorial ( n ) : if n == 0 : return 1 return n*factorial ( n - 1 )
Thus the problem of calculating factorial ( n ) depends on calculating the subproblem factorial ( n - 1 ) .
This problem does not exhibit overlapping subproblems since factorial is called exactly once for each positive integer less than n .
Fibonacci Numbers
The problem of calculating the nth Fibonacci number does , however , exhibit overlapping subproblems .
The naÃ¯ve recursive implementation would be
def fib( n ) : if n == 0 : return 0 if n == 1 : return 1 return fib ( n - 1 ) + fib ( n - 2 )
The problem of calculating fib( n ) thus depends on both fib ( n - 1 ) and fib ( n - 2 ) .
To see how these subproblems overlap look at how many times fib is called and with what arguments when we try to calculate fib ( 5 ) :
fib ( 5 ) fib ( 4 ) + fib ( 3 ) fib ( 3 ) + fib ( 2 ) + fib ( 2 ) + fib ( 1 ) fib ( 2 ) + fib ( 1 ) + fib ( 1 ) + fib ( 0 ) + fib ( 1 ) + fib ( 0 ) + fib ( 1 ) fib ( 1 ) + fib ( 0 ) + fib ( 1 ) + fib ( 1 ) + fib ( 0 ) + fib ( 1 ) + fib ( 0 ) + fib(1 )
At the kth stage we only need to know the values of fib ( k - 1 ) and fib ( k - 2 ) , but we wind up calling each multiple times .
Starting from the bottom and going up we can calculate the numbers we need for the next step , removing the massive redundancy .
def fib2 ( n ) : n2 , n1 = 0 , 1 for i in range ( n - 2 ) : n2 , n1 = n1 , n1 + n2 return n2+n1
In Big - O notation the fib function takes O ( cn ) time , i.e. , exponential in n , while the fib2 function takes O ( n ) time .
If this is all too abstract take a look at this graph comparing the runtime ( in microseconds ) of fib and fib2 versus the input parameter .
The above problem is pretty easy and for most programmers is one of the first examples of the performance issues surrounding recursion versus iteration .
In fact , I 've seen many instances where the Fibonacci example leads people to believe that recursion is inherently slow .
This is not true , but in cases where we can define a problem with overlapping subproblems recursively using the above technique will always reduce the execution time .
Now , for the second characteristic of dynamic programming : optimal substructure .
Optimal Substructure
A problem is said to have optimal substructure if the globally optimal solution can be constructed from locally optimal solutions to subproblems .
The general form of problems in which optimal substructure plays a roll goes something like this .
Let 's say we have a collection of objects called A .
For each object o in A we have a " cost , " c(o ) .
Now find the subset of A with the maximum ( or minimum ) cost , perhaps subject to certain constraints .
The brute - force method would be to generate every subset of A , calculate the cost , and then find the maximum ( or minimum ) among those values .
But if A has n elements in it we are looking at a search space of size 2n if there are no constraints on A .
Oftentimes n is huge making a brute - force method computationally infeasible .
Let 's take a look at an example .
Maximum Subarry Sum
Let 's say we 're given an array of integers .
What ( contiguous ) subarray has the largest sum ?
For example , if our array is [ 1,2, - 5,4,7 , -2 ] then the subarray with the largest sum is [ 4,7 ] with a sum of 11 .
One might think at first that this problem reduces to finding the subarray with all positive entries , if one exists , that maximizes the sum .
But consider the array [ 1,5, - 3,4, - 2,1 ] .
The subarray with the largest sum is [ 1 , 5 , - 3 , 4 ] with a sum of 7 .
First , the brute - force solution .
Because of the constraints on the problem , namely that the subsets under consideration are contiguous , we only have to check O ( n2 ) subarrays ( why ? ) .
Here it is , in Python :
def msum ( a ) : return max ( [ ( sum ( a [ j :i ] ) , ( j , i ) ) for i in range ( 1 , le n ( a ) +1 ) for j in range ( i ) ] )
This returns both the sum and the offsets of the subarray .
Let 's see if we can't find an optimal substructure to exploit .
We are given an input array a .
I 'm going to use Python notation so that a [ 0 :k ] is the subarray starting at 0 and including every element up to and including k- 1 .
Let 's say we know the subarray of a [ 0 :i ] with the largest sum ( and that sum ) .
Using just this information can we find the subarray of a [ 0 :i+1 ] with the largest sum ?
Let a [j : k+1 ] be the optimal subarray , t the sum of a [ j :i ] , and s the optimal sum .
If t+a [ i ] is greater than s then set a [ j : i+1 ] as the optimal array and set s = t .
If t + a [ i ] is negative , however , the contiguity constraint means that we cannot include a [ j : i+1 ] in our subarray since any such subarray will have a smaller sum than a subarray without it .
So , if t+a [ i ] is negative set t = 0 and set the left - hand bound of the optimal subarray to i+1 .
To visualize consider the array [ 1,2, - 5,4,7 , -2 ] .
Set s = - infinity , t = 0 , j = 0 , bounds = ( 0,0 ) ( 1 2 - 5 4 7 - 2 ( 1 ) | 2 - 5 4 7 - 2 ( set t=1 .
Since t > s , set s=1 and bounds = ( 0,1 ) ) ( 1 2 ) | - 5 4 7 - 2 ( set t=3 .
Since t > s , set s=3 , and bounds = ( 0,2 ) ) 1 2 - 5(| 4 7 - 2 ( set t= - 2 . Since t < 0 , set t=0 and j = 3 ) 1 2 - 5 ( 4 ) | 7 - 2 ( set t=4 .
Since t > s , set s=4 and bounds = ( 3,4 ) ) 1 2 - 5 ( 4 7 ) | - 2 ( set t=11 .
Since t > s , set s=11 and bounds = ( 3,5 ) ) 1 2 - 5 ( 4 7 ) - 2 | ( set t=9 .
Nothing happens since t < s )
This requires only one pass through the array and at each step we 're only keeping track of three variables : the current sum from the left - hand edge of the bounds to the current point ( t ) , the maximal sum ( s ) , and the bounds of the current optimal subarray ( bounds ) .
In Python :
def msum2 ( a ) : bounds , s , t , j = ( 0,0 ) , - float ( ' infinity ' ) , 0 , 0 for i in range ( len ( a ) ) : t = t + a [ i ] if t > s : bounds , s = ( j , i+1 ) , t if t < 0 : t , j = 0 , i+1 return ( s , bounds )
In this problem the " globally optimal " solution corresponds to a subarray with a globally maximal sum , but at each each step we only make a decision relative to what we have already seen .
That is , at each step we know the best solution thus far , but might change our decision later based on our previous information and the current information .
This is the sense in the problem has optimal substructure .
Because we can make decisions locally we only need to traverse the list once , reducing the run-time of the solution to O ( n ) from O ( n2 ) .
Again , a graph :
The Knapsack Problem
Let 's apply what we 're learned so far to a slightly more interesting problem .
You are an art thief who has found a way to break into the impressionist wing at the Art Institute of Chicago .
Obviously you can't take everything .
In particular , you 're constrained to take only what your knapsack can hold — let 's say it can only hold W pounds .
You also know the market value for each painting .
Given that you can only carry W pounds what paintings should you steal in order to maximize your profit ?
First let 's see how this problem exhibits both overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure .
Say there are n paintings with weights w 1 , ... , w n and market values v 1 , ... , v n .
Define A( i , j ) as the maximum value that can be attained from considering only the first i items weighting at most j pounds as follows .
Obviously A ( 0 , j ) = 0 and A ( i,0 ) = 0 for any i ≤ n and j ≤ W .
If w i > j then A ( i , j ) = A ( i - 1 , j ) since we cannot include the ith item .
If , however , w i ≤ j then A ( i , j ) then we have a choice : include the ith item or not .
If we do not include it then the value will be A ( i - 1 , j ) .
If we do include it , however , the value will be v i + A ( i - 1 , j - w i ) .
Which choice should we make ?
Well , whichever is larger , i.e. , the maximum of the two .
Expressed formally we have the following recursive definition
This problem exhibits both overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure and is therefore a good candidate for dynamic programming .
The subproblems overlap because at any stage ( i , j ) we might need to calculate A ( k,l ) for several k < i and l < j .
We have optimal substructure since at any point we only need information about the choices we have already made .
The recursive solution is not hard to write :
def A(w , v , i , j ) : if i == 0 or j == 0 : return 0 if w [ i - 1 ] > j : return A( w , v , i - 1 , j ) if w [ i - 1 ] <= j : return max ( A ( w , v , i - 1 , j ) , v[ i - 1 ] + A ( w , v , i - 1 , j - w [ i - 1 ] ) )
Remember we need to calculate A( n , W ) .
To do so we 're going to need to create an n - by - W table whose entry at ( i , j ) contains the value of A ( i , j ) .
The first time we calculate the value of A ( i , j ) we store it in the table at the appropriate location .
This technique is called memoization and is one way to exploit overlapping subproblems .
There 's also a Ruby module called memoize which does it for Ruby .
To exploit the optimal substructure we iterate over all i <= n and j <= W , at each step applying the recursion formula to generate the A( i , j ) entry by using the memoized table rather than calling A ( ) again .
This gives an algorithm which takes O ( nW ) time using O ( nW ) space and our desired result is stored in the A( n , W ) entry in the table .
Everyday Dynamic Programming
The above examples might make dynamic programming look like a technique which only applies to a narrow range of problems , but many algorithms from a wide range of fields use dynamic programming .
Here 's a very partial list .
That 's all for today .
Cheers !
The UK plans to withdraw its 4,100 troops by the end of July 2009 Iraq 's parliament has rejected a draft law that would have permitted forces from the UK , Australia and a number of other countries to remain after 2008 .
The bill , rejected by 80 votes to 68 , would have given the 6,000 non-US troops a legal basis for staying once the UN mandate expires on 31 December .
It will now be sent back to the cabinet for amendment .
A vote is due next week .
The 140,000 US troops are allowed to remain until the end of 2011 under a separate status of forces agreement .
The UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement that it would now discuss with the Iraqi government how the bill 's rejection could affect the status of non-US coalition forces .
' Great achievement ' Fariad Rawndouzi , a Kurdish MP , told the BBC many of his colleagues were not happy with the formulation of the bill , and wanted it to more closely resemble the deal between the US and Iraq .
A member of the Sunni Iraqi Accord Front in the Council of Representatives , Hussein al - Falluji , echoed the sentiment , saying that relations between Iraq and other states ought to be " arranged , according to international law , through treaties or agreements " .
What the parliament did today , rejecting the bill , was a great national achievement
Nasser al - Issawi
Al - Sadr Bloc
UK Iraq pullout is ' met with relief '
" For this reason parliament rejected this law .
It was a big mistake by the government , " he told the Reuters news agency .
Nasser al - Issawi , an MP loyal to the radical Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr , hailed the rejection of the draft as a " great national achievement " , and said he hoped the foreign troops would be forced to leave when the UN mandate ends .
The government has so far not commented on the vote .
A draft had already been rejected earlier this week , the Associated Press reports .
Earlier in the week , UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that the UK planned to withdraw its troops from southern Iraq by the end of July 2009 , as envisaged by the draft law .
Military operations will end by 31 May and the remaining 4,100 service personnel will leave within two months .
Several hundred trainers will remain , some working with the Iraqi navy .
" As the prime minister announced to parliament last Thursday , Prime Minister [ Nouri ] Maliki confirmed to him in Baghdad on Wednesday that the government of Iraq wants UK forces to remain in Iraq to complete their military tasks , by 31 May 2009 at the latest , " the UK Ministry of Defence said in a statement after Saturday 's vote .
NON -US FORCES IN IRAQ UK - 4,100 Australia - 1,000 Romania - 500 El Salvador - 200 Estonia - 40
" We have worked closely with the government of Iraq to ensure that there is a firm legal basis for the presence of our forces in 2009 .
" We will now discuss with the government of Iraq what the vote in the Council of Representatives means for the proposed legal basis for the UK and other Coalition forces and look at other options . "
The BBC's Caroline Wyatt in Baghdad says she understands that , if the bill is rejected by parliament at a third reading next week , the Iraqi government may sign individual agreements directly with each of the foreign states , giving their troops a legal basis to remain .
However , this is an emergency option which the government had been trying to avoid , as there may not be enough time to negotiate the deals before 31 December , our correspondent says .
Apart from the US and UK , the only countries continuing to provide troops for Multi-National Force - Iraq ( MNF - I ) are Australia , El Salvador , Estonia and Romania .
South Korean troops ended their mission in Iraq on Friday , joining their Japanese counterparts , who pulled out a day earlier .

The System Implodes : The 10 Worst Corporations of 2008 by Robert Weissman AIG
Cargill
Chevron
CNPC
Constellation Energy
Dole
General Electric
Imperial Sugar
Philip Morris Int’l .
Roche 2008 marks the 20th anniversary of Multinational Monitor ’s annual list of the 10 Worst Corporations of the year .
In the 20 years that we ’ve published our annual list , we ’ve covered corporate villains , scoundrels , criminals and miscreants .
We ’ve reported on some really bad stuff — from Exxon ’s Valdez spill to Union Carbide and Dow ’s effort to avoid responsibility for the Bhopal disaster ; from oil companies coddling dictators ( including Chevron and CNPC , both profiled this year ) to a bank ( Riggs ) providing financial services for Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet ; from oil and auto companies threatening the future of the planet by blocking efforts to address climate change to duplicitous tobacco companies marketing cigarettes around the world by associating their product with images of freedom , sports , youthful energy and good health .
But we ’ve never had a year like 2008 .
The financial crisis first gripping Wall Street and now spreading rapidly throughout the world is , in many ways , emblematic of the worst of the corporate - dominated political and economic system that we aim to expose with our annual 10 Worst list .
Here is how .
Improper political influence : Corporations dominate the policy - making process , from city councils to global institutions like the World Trade Organization .
Over the last 30 years , and especially in the last decade , Wall Street interests leveraged their political power to remove many of the regulations that had restricted their activities .
There are at least a dozen separate and significant examples of this , including the Financial Services Modernization
Act of 1999 , which permitted the merger of banks and investment banks .
In a form of corporate civil disobedience , Citibank and Travelers Group merged in 1998 — a move that was illegal at the time , but for which they were given a two - year forbearance — on the assumption that they would be able to force a change in the relevant law .
They did , with the help of just - retired ( at the time ) Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin , who went on to an executive position at the newly created Citigroup .
Deregulation and non-enforcement : Non-enforcement of rules against predatory lending helped the housing bubble balloon .
While some regulators had sought to exert authority over financial derivatives , they were stopped by finance - friendly figures in the Clinton administration and Congress — enabling the creation of the credit default swap market .
Even Alan Greenspan concedes that that market — worth $ 55 trillion in what is called notional value — is imploding in significant part because it was not regulated .
Short - term thinking :
It was obvious to anyone who cared to look at historical trends that the United States was experiencing a housing bubble .
Many in the financial sector seemed to have convinced themselves that there was no bubble .
But others must have been more clear - eyed .
In any case , all the Wall Street players had an incentive not to pay attention to the bubble .
They were making stratospheric annual bonuses based on annual results .
Even if they were certain the bubble would pop sometime in the future , they had every incentive to keep making money on the upside .
Financialization : Profits in the financial sector were more than 35 percent of overall U.S. corporate profits in each year from 2005 to 2007 , according to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis .
Instead of serving the real economy , the financial sector was taking over the real economy .
Profit over social use : Relatedly , the corporate - driven economy was being driven by what could make a profit , rather than what would serve a social purpose .
Although Wall Street hucksters offered elaborate rationalizations for why exotic financial derivatives , private equity takeovers of firms , securitization and other so - called financial innovations helped improve economic efficiency , by and large these financial schemes served no socially useful purpose .
Externalized costs :
Worse , the financial schemes did n’t just create money for Wall Street movers and shakers and their investors .
They made money at the expense of others .
The costs of these schemes were foisted onto workers who lost jobs at firms gutted by private equity operators , unpayable loans acquired by homeowners who bought into a bubble market ( often made worse by unconscionable lending terms ) , and now the public .
What is most revealing about the financial meltdown and economic crisis , however , is that it illustrates that corporations — if left to their own worst instincts — will destroy themselves and the system that nurtures them .
It is rare that this lesson is so graphically illustrated .
It is one the world must quickly learn , if we are to avoid the most serious existential threat we have yet faced : climate change .
Of course , the rest of the corporate sector was not on good behavior during 2008 either , and we do not want them to escape justified scrutiny .
In keeping with our tradition of highlighting diverse forms of corporate wrongdoing , we include only one financial company on the 10 Worst list .
Here , presented in alphabetical order , are the 10 Worst Corporations of 2008 .
AIG : Money for Nothing
There ’s surely no one party responsible for the ongoing global financial crisis .
But if you had to pick a single responsible corporation , there ’s a very strong case to make for American International Group ( AIG ) .
In September , the Federal Reserve poured $ 85 billion into the distressed global financial services company .
It followed up with $ 38 billion in October .
The government drove a hard bargain for its support .
It allocated its billions to the company as high - interest loans ; it demanded just short of an 80 percent share of the company in exchange for the loans ; and it insisted on the firing of the company ’s CEO ( even though he had only been on the job for three months ) .
Why did AIG — primarily an insurance company powerhouse , with more than 100,000 employees around the world and $ 1 trillion in assets — require more than $ 100 billion ( $ 100 billion ! ) in government funds ?
The company ’s traditional insurance business continues to go strong , but its gigantic exposure to the world of “ credit default swaps ” left it teetering on the edge of bankruptcy .
Government officials then intervened , because they feared that an AIG bankruptcy would crash the world ’s financial system .
Credit default swaps are effectively a kind of insurance policy on debt securities .
Companies contracted with AIG to provide insurance on a wide range of securities .
The insurance policy provided that , if a bond did n’t pay , AIG would make up the loss .
AIG ’s eventual problem was rooted in its entering a very risky business but treating it as safe .
First , AIG Financial Products , the small London - based unit handling credit default swaps , decided to insure “ collateralized debt obligations ” ( CDOs ) .
CDOs are pools of mortgage loans , but often only a portion of the underlying loans — perhaps involving the most risky part of each loan .
Ratings agencies graded many of these CDOs as highest quality , though subsequent events would show these ratings to have been profoundly flawed .
Based on the blue - chip ratings , AIG treated its insurance on the CDOs as low risk .
Then , because AIG was highly rated , it did not have to post collateral .
Through credit default swaps , AIG was basically collecting insurance premiums and assuming it would never pay out on a failure — let alone a collapse of the entire market it was insuring .
It was a scheme that could n’t be beat : money for nothing .
In September , the New York Times ’ Gretchen Morgenson reported on the operations of AIG ’s small London unit , and the profile of its former chief , Joseph Cassano .
In 2007 , the Times reported , Cassano “ described the credit default swaps as almost a sure thing . ”
“ It is hard to get this message across , but these are very much handpicked , ” he said in a call with analysts .
“ It is hard for us , without being flippant , to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of those transactions , ” he said .
Cassano assured investors that AIG ’s operations were nearly fail safe .
Following earlier accounting problems , the company ’s risk management was stellar , he said : “ That ’s a committee that I sit on , along with many of the senior managers at AIG , and we look at a whole variety of transactions that come in to make sure that they are maintaining the quality that we need to .
And so I think the things that have been put in at our level and the things that have been put in at the parent level will ensure that there wo n’t be any of those kinds of mistakes again . ”
Cassano turned out to be spectacularly wrong .
The credit default swaps were not a sure thing .
AIG somehow did not notice that the United States was experiencing a housing bubble , and that it was essentially insuring that the bubble would not pop .
It made an ill - formed judgment that positive credit ratings meant CDOs were high quality — even when the underlying mortgages were of poor quality .
But before the bubble popped , Cassano ’s operation was minting money .
It was n’t hard work , since AIG Financial Products was taking in premiums in exchange for nothing .
In 2005 , the unit ’s profit margin was 83 percent , according to the Times .
By 2007 , its credit default swap portfolio was more than $ 500 billion .
Then things started to go bad .
Suddenly , AIG had to start paying out on some of the securities it had insured .
As it started recording losses , its credit default swap contracts require that it begin putting up more and more collateral .
AIG found it could n’t raise enough money fast enough — over the course of a weekend in September , the amount of money AIG owed shot up from $ 20 billion to more than $ 80 billion .
With no private creditors stepping forward , it fell to the government to provide the needed capital or let AIG enter bankruptcy .
Top federal officials deemed bankruptcy too high a risk to the overall financial system .
After the bailout , it emerged that AIG did not even know all of the CDOs it had ensured .
In September , less than a week after the bailout was announced , the Orange County Register reported on a posh retreat for company executives and insurance agents at the exclusive St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach , California .
Rooms at the resort can cost over $ 1,000 per night .
After the House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee highlighted the retreat , AIG explained that the retreat was primarily for well - performing independent insurance agents .
Only 10 of the 100 participants were from AIG ( and they from a successful AIG subsidiary ) , the company said , and the event was planned long in advance of the federal bailout .
In an apology letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , CEO Edward Liddy wrote that AIG now faces very different challenges , and “ that we owe our employees and the American public new standards and approaches . ”
New standards and approaches , indeed .
Cargill : Food Profiteers
The world ’s food system is broken .
Or , more accurately , the giant food companies and their allies in the U.S. and other rich country governments , and at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank , broke it .
Thirty years ago , most developing countries produced enough food to feed themselves .
Now , 70 percent are net food importers .
Thirty years ago , most developing countries had in place mechanisms aimed at maintaining a relatively constant price for food commodities .
Tariffs on imports protected local farmers from fluctuations in global food prices .
Government - run grain purchasing boards paid above - market prices for farm goods when prices were low , and required farmers to sell below - market when prices were high .
The idea was to give farmers some certainty over price , and to keep food affordable for consumers .
Governments also provided a wide set of support services for farmers , giving them advice on new crop and growing technologies and , in some countries , helping set up cooperative structures .
This was not a perfect system by any means , but it looks pretty good in retrospect .
Over the last three decades , the system was completely abandoned , in country after country .
It was replaced by a multinational - dominated , globally integrated food system , in which the World Bank and other institutions coerced countries into opening their markets to cheap food imports from rich countries and re-orienting their agricultural systems to grow food for rich consumers abroad .
Proponents said the new system was a “ free market ” approach , but in reality it traded one set of government interventions for another — a new set of rules that gave enhanced power to a handful of global grain trading companies like Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland , as well as to seed and fertilizer corporations .
“ For this food regime to work , ” Raj Patel , author of Stuffed and Starved , told the U.S. House Financial Services Committee at a May hearing , “ existing marketing boards and support structures needed to be dismantled .
In a range of countries , this meant that the state bodies that had been supported and built by the World Bank were dismantled by the World Bank .
The rationale behind the dismantling of these institutions was to clear the path for private sector involvement in these sectors , on the understanding that the private sector would be more efficient and less wasteful than the public sector . ”
“ The result of these interventions and conditions , ” explained Patel , “ was to accelerate the decline of developing country agriculture .
One of the most striking consequences of liberalization has been the phenomenon of ‘ import surges . ’
These happen when tariffs on cheaper , and often subsidized , agricultural products are lowered , and a host country is then flooded with those goods .
There is often a corresponding decline in domestic production .
In Senegal , for example , tariff reduction led to an import surge in tomato paste , with a 15 - fold increase in imports , and a halving of domestic production .
Similar stories might be told of Chile , which saw a three - fold surge in imports of vegetable oil , and a halving of domestic production .
In Ghana in 1998 , local rice production accounted for over 80 percent of domestic consumption .
By 2003 , that figure was less than 20 percent . ”
The decline of developing country agriculture means that developing countries are dependent on the vagaries of the global market .
When prices spike — as they did in late 2007 and through the beginning of 2008 — countries and poor consumers are at the mercy of the global market and the giant trading companies that dominate it .
In the first quarter of 2008 , the price of rice in Asia doubled , and commodity prices overall rose 40 percent .
People in rich countries felt this pinch , but the problem was much more severe in the developing world .
Not only do consumers in poor countries have less money , they spend a much higher proportion of their household budget on food — often half or more — and they buy much less processed food , so commodity increases affect them much more directly .
In poor countries , higher prices do n’t just pinch , they mean people go hungry .
Food riots broke out around the world in early 2008 .
But not everyone was feeling pain .
For Cargill , spiking prices was an opportunity to get rich .
In the second quarter of 2008 , the company reported profits of more than $ 1 billion , with profits from continuing operations soaring 18 percent from the previous year .
Cargill ’s 2007 profits totaled more than $ 2.3 billion , up more than a third from 2006 .
In a competitive market , would a grain - trading middleman make super - profits ?
Or would rising prices crimp the middleman ’s profit margin ?
Well , the global grain trade is not competitive .
In an August speech , Cargill CEO Greg Page posed the question , “ So , is n’t Cargill exploiting the food situation to make money ? ”
Here is how he responded : “ I would give you four pieces of information about why our earnings have gone up dramatically .
The demand for food has gone up .
The demand for our facilities has gone up , and we are running virtually all of our facilities worldwide at total capacity .
As we utilize our capacity more effectively , clearly we do better .
Fertilizer prices rose , and we are owners of a large fertilizer company .
That has been the single largest factor in Cargill ’s earnings .
The volatility in the grain industry — much of it created by governments — was an opportunity for a trading company like Cargill to make money .
Finally , in this era of high prices , Cargill over the last two years has invested $ 15.5 billion additional dollars into the world food system .
Some was to carry all these high - priced inventories .
We also wanted to be sure that we were there for farmers who needed the working capital to operate in this much more expensive environment .
Clearly , our owners expected some return on that $ 15.5 billion .
Cargill had an opportunity to make more money in this environment , and I think that is something that we need to be very forthright about . ”
OK , Mr. Page , that ’s all very interesting .
The question was , “ So , is n’t Cargill exploiting the food situation to make money ? ”
It sounds like your answer is , “ yes . ” Chevron : “ We ca n’t let little countries screw around with big companies ”
The world has witnessed a stunning consolidation of the multinational oil companies over the last decade .
One of the big winners was Chevron .
It swallowed up Texaco and Unocal , among others .
It was happy to absorb their revenue streams .
It has been less willing to take responsibility for ecological and human rights abuses perpetrated by these companies .
One of the inherited legacies from Chevron ’s 2001 acquisition of Texaco is litigation in Ecuador over the company ’s alleged decimation of the Ecuadorian Amazon over a 20 - year period of operation .
In 1993 , 30,000 indigenous Ecuadorians filed a class action suit in U.S. courts , alleging that Texaco had poisoned the land where they live and the waterways on which they rely , allowing billions of gallons of oil to spill and leaving hundreds of waste pits unlined and uncovered .
They sought billions in compensation for the harm to their land and livelihood , and for alleged health harms .
The Ecuadorians and their lawyers filed the case in U.S. courts because U.S. courts have more capacity to handle complex litigation , and procedures ( including jury trials ) that offer plaintiffs a better chance to challenge big corporations .
Texaco , and later Chevron , deployed massive legal resources to defeat the lawsuit .
Ultimately , a Chevron legal maneuver prevailed : At Chevron ’s instigation , U.S. courts held that the case should be litigated in Ecuador , closer to where the alleged harms occurred .
Having argued vociferously that Ecuadorian courts were fair and impartial , Chevron is now unhappy with how the litigation has proceeded in that country .
So unhappy , in fact , that it is lobbying the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to impose trade sanctions on Ecuador if the Ecuadorian government does not make the case go away .
“ We ca n’t let little countries screw around with big companies like this — companies that have made big investments around the world , ” a Chevron lobbyist said to Newsweek in August .
( Chevron subsequently stated that “ the comments attributed to an unnamed lobbyist working for Chevron do not reflect our company ’s views regarding the Ecuador case .
They were not approved by the company and will not be tolerated . ” )
Chevron is worried because a court - appointed special master found in March that the company was liable to plaintiffs for between $ 7 billion and $ 16 billion .
The special master has made other findings that Chevron ’s clean - up operations in Ecuador have been inadequate .
Another of Chevron ’s inherited legacies is the Yadana natural gas pipeline in Burma , operated by a consortium in which Unocal was one of the lead partners .
Human rights organizations have documented that the Yadana pipeline was constructed with forced labor , and associated with brutal human rights abuses by the Burmese military .
EarthRights International , a human rights group with offices in Washington , D.C. and Bangkok , has carefully tracked human rights abuses connected to the Yadana pipeline , and led a successful lawsuit against Unocal / Chevron .
In an April 2008 report , the group states that “ Chevron and its consortium partners continue to rely on the Burmese army for pipeline security , and those forces continue to conscript thousands of villagers for forced labor , and to commit torture , rape , murder and other serious abuses in the course of their operations . ”
Money from the Yadana pipeline plays a crucial role in enabling the Burmese junta to maintain its grip on power .
EarthRights International estimates the pipeline funneled roughly $ 1 billion to the military regime in 2007 .
The group also notes that , in late 2007 , when the Burmese military violently suppressed political protests led by Buddhist monks , Chevron sat idly by .
Chevron has trouble in the United States , as well .
In September , Earl Devaney , the inspector general for the Department of Interior , released an explosive report documenting “ a culture of ethical failure ” and a “ culture of substance abuse and promiscuity ” in the U.S. government program handling oil lease contracts on U.S. government lands and property .
Government employees , Devaney found , accepted a stream of small gifts and favors from oil company representatives , and maintained sexual relations with them .
( In one memorable passage , the inspector general report states that “ sexual relationships with prohibited sources cannot , by definition , be arms - length . ” )
The report showed that Chevron had conferred the largest number of gifts on federal employees .
It also complained that Chevron refused to cooperate with the investigation , a claim Chevron subsequently disputed .
Constellation Energy : Nuclear Operators
Although it is too dangerous , too expensive and too centralized to make sense as an energy source , nuclear power wo n’t go away , thanks to equipment makers and utilities that find ways to make the public pay and pay .
Case in point : Constellation Energy Group , the operator of the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant in Maryland .
When Maryland deregulated its electricity market in 1999 , Constellation — like other energy generators in other states — was able to cut a deal to recover its “ stranded costs ” and nuclear decommissioning fees .
The idea was that competition would bring multiple suppliers into the market , and these new competitors would have an unfair advantage over old - time monopoly suppliers .
Those former monopolists , the argument went , had built expensive nuclear reactors with the approval of state regulators , and it would be unfair if they could not charge consumers to recover their costs .
It would also be unfair , according to this line of reasoning , if the former monopolists were unable to recover the costs of decommissioning nuclear facilities .
In Maryland , the “ stranded cost ” deal gave Constellation ( through its affiliate Baltimore Gas & Electric , BGE ) the right to charge ratepayers $ 975 million in 1993 dollars ( almost $ 1.5 billion in present dollars ) .
Deregulation meant that Constellation ’s energy generating assets — including its nuclear facility at Calvert Cliffs — were free from price regulation .
As a result , instead of costing Constellation , Calvert Cliffs ’ market value increased .
Deregulation also meant that , after an agreed - upon freeze period , BGE was free to raise its rates as it chose .
In 2006 , it announced a 72 percent rate increase .
For residential consumers , this meant they would pay an average of $ 743 more per year for electricity .
The sudden price hike sparked a rebellion .
The Maryland legislature passed a law requiring BGE to credit consumers $ 386 million over a 10 - year period .
At the time , Constellation was very pleased with the deal , which let it keep most of its price - gouging profits — a spokesperson for the then - governor said that Constellation and BGE were “ doing a victory lap around the statehouse ” after the bill passed .
In February 2008 , however , Constellation announced that it intended to sue the state for unconstitutionally “ taking ” its assets via the mandatory consumer credit .
In March , following a preemptive lawsuit by the state , the matter was settled .
BGE agreed to make a one - time rebate of $ 170 million to residential ratepayers , and 90 percent of the credits to ratepayers ( totaling $ 346 million ) were left in place .
The deal also relieved ratepayers of the obligation to pay for decommissioning — an expense that had been expected to total $ 1.5 billion ( or possibly much more ) from 2016 to 2036 .
The deal also included regulatory changes making it easier for outside companies to invest in Constellation — a move of greater import than initially apparent .
In September , with utility stock prices plummeting , Warren Buffet ’s MidAmerican Energy announced it would purchase Constellation for $ 4.7 billion , less than a quarter of the company ’s market value in January .
Meanwhile , Constellation plans to build a new reactor at Calvert Cliffs , potentially the first new reactor built in the United States since the near - meltdown at Three Mile Island in 1979 .
“ There are substantial clean air benefits associated with nuclear power , benefits that we recognize as the operator of three plants in two states , ” says Constellation spokesperson Maureen Brown .
It has lined up to take advantage of U.S. government - guaranteed loans for new nuclear construction , available under the terms of the 2005 Energy Act [ see “ Nuclear ’s Power Play : Give Us Subsidies or Give Us Death , ” Multinational Monitor , September / October 2008 ] .
“ We ca n’t go forward unless we have federal loan guarantees , ” says Brown .
Building nuclear plants is extraordinarily expensive ( Constellation ’s planned construction is estimated at $ 9.6 billion ) and takes a long time ; construction plans face massive political risks ; and the value of electric utilities is small relative to the huge costs of nuclear construction .
For banks and investors , this amounts to too much uncertainty — but if the government guarantees loans will be paid back , then there ’s no risk .
Or , stated better , the risk is absorbed entirely by the public .
That ’s the financial risk .
The nuclear safety risk is always absorbed , involuntarily , by the public .
CNPC : Fueling Violence in Darfur Many of the world ’s most brutal regimes have a common characteristic :
Although subject to economic sanctions and politically isolated , they are able to maintain power thanks to multinational oil company enablers .
Case in point : Sudan , and the Chinese National Petroleum Corporation ( CNPC ) .
In July , International Criminal Court ( ICC ) Prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo charged the President of Sudan , Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir , with committing genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes .
The charges claim that Al Bashir is the mastermind of crimes against ethnic groups in Darfur , aimed at removing the black population from Sudan .
Sudanese armed forces and government - authorized militias known as the Janjaweed have carried out massive attacks against the Fur , Masalit and Zaghawa communities of Darfur , according to the ICC allegations .
Following bombing raids , “ ground forces would then enter the village or town and attack civilian inhabitants .
They kill men , children , elderly , women ; they subject women and girls to massive rapes .
They burn and loot the villages . ”
The ICC says 35,000 people have been killed and 2.7 million displaced .
The ICC reports one victim saying : “ When we see them , we run .
Some of us succeed in getting away , and some are caught and taken to be raped — gang - raped .
Maybe around 20 men rape one woman .
...
These things are normal for us here in Darfur .
These things happen all the time .
I have seen rapes , too .
It does not matter who sees them raping the women — they do n’t care .
They rape girls in front of their mothers and fathers . ”
Governments around the world have imposed various sanctions on Sudan , with human rights groups demanding much more aggressive action .
But there is little doubt that Sudan has been able to laugh off existing and threatened sanctions because of the huge support it receives from China , channeled above all through the Sudanese relationship with CNPC .
“ The relationship between CNPC and Sudan is symbiotic , ” notes the Washington , D.C. - based Human Rights First , in a March 2008 report , “ Investing in Tragedy . ”
“ Not only is CNPC the largest investor in the Sudanese oil sector , but Sudan is CNPC ’s largest market for overseas investment . ”
China receives three quarters of Sudan ’s exports , and Chinese companies hold the majority share in almost all of the key oil - rich areas in Sudan .
Explains Human Rights First : “ Beijing ’s companies pump oil from numerous key fields , which then courses through Chinese - made pipelines to Chinese - made storage tanks to await a voyage to buyers , most of them Chinese . ”
CNPC is the largest oil investor in Sudan ; the other key Chinese company is the Sinopec Group ( also known as the China Petrochemical Corporation ) .
Oil money has fueled violence in Darfur .
“ The profitability of Sudan ’s oil sector has developed in close chronological step with the violence in Darfur , ” notes Human Rights First .
“ In 2000 , before the crisis , Sudan ’s oil revenue was $ 1.2 billion .
By 2006 , with the crisis well underway , that total had shot up by 291 percent , to $ 4.7 billion .
How does Sudan use that windfall ?
Its finance minister has said that at least 70 percent of the oil profits go to the Sudanese armed forces , linked with its militia allies to the crimes in Darfur . ”
There are other nefarious components of the CNPC relationship with the Sudanese government .
China ships substantial amounts of small arms to Sudan and has helped Sudan build its own small arms factories .
China has also worked at the United Nations to undermine more effective multilateral action to protect Darfur .
Human rights organizations charge a key Chinese motivation is to lubricate its relationship with the Khartoum government so the oil continues to flow .
CNPC did not respond to repeated requests for comment .
Dole : The Sour Taste of Pineapple Starting in 1988 , the Philippines undertook what was to be a bold initiative to redress the historically high concentration of land ownership that has impoverished millions of rural Filipinos and undermined the country ’s development .
The Comprehensive Agricultural Reform Program ( CARP ) promised to deliver land to the landless .
It did n’t work out that way .
Plantation owners helped draft the law and invented ways to circumvent its purported purpose .
Dole pineapple workers are among those paying the price .
Under CARP , Dole ’s land was divided among its workers and others who had claims on the land prior to the pineapple giant .
However , under the terms of the law , as the Washington , D.C. - based International Labor Rights Forum ( ILRF ) explains in an October report , “ The Sour Taste of Pineapple , ” the workers received only nominal title .
They were required to form labor cooperatives .
Intended to give workers — now the new land owners — a means to collectively manage their land , the cooperatives were instead controlled by wealthy landlords .
“ Through its dealings with these cooperatives , ” ILRF found , Dole and Del Monte , ( the world ’s other leading pineapple grower ) “ have been able to take advantage of a number of worker abuses .
Dole has outsourced its labor force to contract labor and replaced its full - time regular employment system that existed before CARP . ”
Dole employs 12,000 contract workers .
Meanwhile , from 1989 to 1998 , Dole reduced its regular workforce by 3,500 .
Under current arrangements ,
Dole now leases its land from its workers , on extremely cheap terms — in one example cited by ILRF , Dole pays in rent one - fifteenth of its net profits from a plantation .
Most workers continue to work the land they purportedly own , but as contract workers for Dole .
The Philippine Supreme Court has ordered Dole to convert its contract workers into regular employees , but the company has not done so .
In 2006 , the Court upheld a Department of Labor and Employment decision requiring Dole to stop using illegal contract labor .
Under Philippine law , contract workers should be regularized after six months .
Dole emphasizes that it pays its workers $ 10 a day , more than the country ’s $ 5.60 minimum wage .
It also says that its workers are organized into unions .
The company responded angrily to a 2007 nomination for most irresponsible corporations from a Swiss organization , the Berne Declaration .
“ We must also say that those fallacious attacks created incredulity and some anger among our Dolefil workers , their representatives , our growers , their cooperatives and more generally speaking among the entire community where we operate . ”
The company thanked “ hundreds of people who spontaneously expressed their support to Dolefil , by taking the initiative to sign manifestos , ” including seven cooperatives .
The problem with Dole ’s position , as ILRF points out , is that “ Dole ’s contract workers are denied the same rights afforded to Dole ’s regular workers .
They are refused the right to organize or benefits gained by the regular union , and are consequently left with poor wages and permanent job insecurity . ”
Contract workers are paid under a quota system , and earn about $ 1.85 a day , according to ILRF .
Conditions are not perfect for unionized workers , either .
In 2006 , when a union leader complained about pesticide and chemical exposures ( apparently misreported in local media as a complaint about Dole ’s waste disposal practices ) , the management of Dole Philippines ( Dolefil ) pressed criminal libel charges against him .
Two years later , these criminal charges remain pending .
Dole says it cannot respond to the allegations in the ILRF report , because the U.S. Trade Representative is considering acting on a petition by ILRF to deny some trade benefits to Dole pineapples imported into the United States from the Philippines .
Concludes Bama Atheya , executive director of ILRF , “ In both Costa Rica and the Philippines , Dole has deliberately obstructed workers ’ right to organize , has failed to pay a living wage and has polluted workers ’ communities . ”
GE : Creative Accounting General Electric ( GE ) has appeared on Multinational Monitor ’s annual 10 Worst Corporations list for defense contractor fraud , labor rights abuses , toxic and radioactive pollution , manufacturing nuclear weaponry , workplace safety violations and media conflicts of interest ( GE owns television network NBC ) .
This year , the company returns to the list for new reasons : alleged tax cheating and the firing of a whistleblower .
In June , former New York Times reporter David Cay Johnston reported on internal GE documents that appeared to show the company had engaged in long - running effort to evade taxes in Brazil .
In a lengthy report in Tax Notes International , Johnston cited a GE subsidiary manager ’s powerpoint presentation that showed “ suspicious ” invoices as “ an indication of possible tax evasion . ”
The invoices showed suspiciously high sales volume for lighting equipment in lightly populated Amazon regions of the country .
These sales would avoid higher value added taxes ( VAT ) in urban states , where sales would be expected to be greater .
Johnston wrote that the state - level VAT at issue , based on the internal documents he reviewed , appeared to be less than $ 100 million .
But , “ since the VAT scheme appears to have gone on long before the period covered in the Moreira [ the company manager ] report , the total sum could be much larger and could involve other countries supplied by the Brazil subsidiary . ”
A senior GE spokesperson , Gary Sheffer , told Johnston that the VAT and related issues were so small relative to GE ’s size that the company was surprised a reporter would spend time looking at them .
“ No company has perfect compliance , ” Sheffer said .
“ We do not believe we owe the tax . ” Johnston did not identify the source that gave him the internal GE documents , but GE has alleged it was a former company attorney , Adriana Koeck .
GE fired Koeck in January 2007 for what it says were “ performance reasons . ”
GE sued Koeck in June 2008 , alleging that she wrongfully maintained privileged and confidential information , and improperly shared the information with third parties .
In a court filing , GE said that it “ considers its professional reputation to be its greatest asset and it has worked tirelessly to develop and preserve an unparalleled reputation of ‘ unyielding integrity . ’ ”
GE ’s suit followed a whistleblower defense claim filed by Koeck in 2007 .
In April 2007 , Koeck filed a claim with the U.S. Department of Labor under the Sarbanes - Oxley whistleblower protections ( rules put in place following the Enron scandal ) .
In her filing , Koeck alleges that she was fired not for poor performance , but because she called attention to improper activities by GE .
After being hired in January 2006 , Koeck ’s complaint asserts , she “ soon discovered that GE C&I [ consumer and industrial ] operations in Latin America were engaged in a variety of irregular practices .
But when she tried to address the problems , both Mr. Burse and Mr. Jones [ her superiors in the general counsel ’s office ] interfered with her efforts , took certain matters away from her , repeatedly became enraged with her when she insisted that failing to address the problems would harm GE , and eventually had her terminated . ”
Koeck ’s whistleblower filing details the state VAT - avoidance scheme discussed in Johnston ’s article .
It also indicates that several GE employees in Brazil were blackmailing the company to keep quiet about the scheme .
Koeck ’s whistleblower filing also discusses reports in the Brazilian media that GE had participated in a “ bribing club ” with other major corporations .
Members of the club allegedly met to divide up public contracts in Brazil , as well as to agree on the amounts that would be paid in bribes .
Koeck discovered evidence of GE subsidiaries engaging in behavior compatible with the “ bribing club ” stories and reported this information to her superior .
Koeck alleges that her efforts to get higher level attorneys to review the situation failed .
In a statement , GE responds to the substance of Koeck ’s allegations of wrongdoing : “ These were relatively minor and routine commercial and tax issues in Brazil .
Our employees proactively identified , investigated and resolved these issues in the appropriate manner .
We are confident we have met all of our tax and compliance obligations in Brazil .
GE has a strong and rigorous compliance process that dealt effectively with these issues . ”
Koeck ’s Sarbanes - Oxley complaint was thrown out in June , on the grounds that it had not been filed in a timely matter .
The substance of her claims , however , are now under investigation by the Department of Justice Fraud Section , according to Corporate Crime Reporter .
Imperial Sugar : 14 Dead On February 7 , an explosion rocked the Imperial Sugar refinery in Port Wentworth , Georgia , near Savannah .
Tony Holmes , a forklift operator at the plant , was in the break room when the blast occurred .
“ I heard the explosion , ” he told the Savannah Morning News .
“ The building shook , and the lights went out .
I thought the roof was falling in .
... I saw people running .
I saw some horrific injuries .
...
People had clothes burning .
Their skin was hanging off .
Some were bleeding . ”
Days later , when the fire was finally extinguished and search - and - rescue operations completed , the horrible human toll was finally known : 14 dead , dozens badly burned and injured .
As with almost every industrial disaster , it turns out the tragedy was preventable .
The cause was accumulated sugar dust , which like other forms of dust , is highly combustible .
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) , the government workplace safety regulator , had not visited Imperial Sugar ’s Port Wentworth facility since 2000 .
When inspectors examined the blast site after the fact , they found rampant violations of the agency ’s already inadequate standards .
They proposed a more than $ 5 million fine , and issuance of citations for 61 egregious willful violations , eight willful violations and 51 serious violations .
Under OSHA ’s rules , a “ serious ” citation is issued when death or serious physical harm is likely to occur , a “ willful ” violation is a violation committed with plain indifference to employee safety and health , and “ egregious ” citations are issued for particularly flagrant violations .
A month later , OSHA inspectors investigated Imperial Sugar ’s plant in Gramercy , Louisiana .
They found 1/4 - to 2 - inch accumulations of dust on electrical wiring and machinery .
They found 6 - to 8 - inch accumulations on wall ledges and piping .
They found 1/2 - to 1 - inch accumulations on mechanical equipment and motors .
They found 3 - to 48 - inch accumulations on workroom floors .
OSHA posted an “ imminent danger ” notice at the plant , because of the high likelihood of another explosion .
Imperial Sugar obviously knew of the conditions in its plants .
It had in fact taken some measures to clean up operations prior to the explosion .
Graham H. Graham was hired as vice president of operations of Imperial Sugar in November 2007 .
In July 2008 , he told a Senate subcommittee that he first walked through the Port Wentworth facility in December 2007 .
“ The conditions were shocking , ” he testified .
“ Port Wentworth was a dirty and dangerous facility .
The refinery was littered with discarded materials , piles of sugar dust , puddles of sugar liquid and airborne sugar dust .
Electrical motors and controls were encrusted with solidified sugar , while safety covers and doors were missing from live electrical switchgear and panels .
A combustible environment existed . ”
Graham recommended that the plant manager be fired , and he was .
Graham ordered a housekeeping blitz , and by the end of January , he testified to the Senate subcommittee , conditions had improved significantly , but still were hazardous .
But Graham also testified that he was told to tone down his demands for immediate action .
In a meeting with John Sheptor , then Imperial Sugar ’s chief operating officer and now its CEO , and Kay Hastings , senior vice president of human resources , Graham testified , “ I was also informed that I was excessively eager in addressing the refinery ’s problems . ”
Sheptor , who was nearly killed in the refinery explosion , and Hastings both deny Graham ’s account .
The company says that it respected safety concerns before the explosion , but has since redoubled efforts , hiring expert consultants on combustible hazards , refocusing on housekeeping efforts and purchasing industrial vacuums to minimize airborne disbursement .
In March , the House of Representatives Education and Labor Committee held a hearing on the hazards posed by combustible dust .
The head of the Chemical Safety Board testified about a 2006 study that identified hundreds of combustible dust incidents that had killed more than 100 workers during the previous 25 years .
The report recommended that OSHA issue rules to control the risk of dust explosions .
Instead of acting on this recommendation , said Committee Chair George Miller , D - California , “ OSHA chose to rely on compliance assistance and voluntary programs , such as industry ‘ alliances , ’ web pages , fact sheets , speeches and booths at industry conferences . ”
The House of Representatives then passed legislation to require OSHA to issue combustible dust standards , but the proposal was not able to pass the Senate .
Remarkably , even after the tragedy at Port Wentworth , and while Imperial Sugar said it welcomed the effort for a new dust rule , OSHA head Edwin Foulke indicated he believed no new rule was necessary .
“ We believe , ” he told the House Education and Labor Committee in March , “ that [ OSHA ] has taken strong measures to prevent combustible dust hazards , and that our multi-pronged approach , which includes effective enforcement of existing standards , combined with education for employers and employees , is effective in addressing combustible dust hazards .
We would like to emphasize that the existence of a standard does not ensure that explosions will be eliminated . ”
Philip Morris International : Unshackled The old Philip Morris no longer exists .
In March , the company formally divided itself into two separate entities : Philip Morris USA , which remains a part of the parent company Altria , and Philip Morris International .
Philip Morris USA sells Marlboro and other cigarettes in the United States .
Philip Morris International tramples over the rest of the world .
The world is just starting to come to grips with a Philip Morris International even more predatory in pushing its toxic products worldwide .
The new Philip Morris International is unconstrained by public opinion in the United States — the home country and largest market of the old , unified Philip Morris — and will no longer fear lawsuits in the United States .
As a result , Thomas Russo of the investment fund Gardner Russo & Gardner told Bloomberg , the company “ wo n’t have to worry about getting pre-approval from the U.S. for things that are perfectly acceptable in foreign markets . ”
Russo ’s firm owns 5.7 million shares of Altria and now Philip Morris International .
A commentator for The Motley Fool investment advice service wrote , “ The Marlboro Man is finally free to roam the globe unfettered by the legal and marketing shackles of the U.S. domestic market . ”
In February , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) issued a new report on the global tobacco epidemic .
WHO estimates the Big Tobacco - fueled epidemic now kills more than 5 million people every year .
Five million people .
By 2030 , WHO estimates 8 million will die a year from tobacco - related disease , 80 percent in the developing world .
The WHO report emphasizes that known and proven public health policies can dramatically reduce smoking rates .
These policies include indoor smoke - free policies ; bans on tobacco advertising , promotion and sponsorship ; heightened taxes ; effective warnings ; and cessation programs .
These “ strategies are within the reach of every country , rich or poor and , when combined as a package , offer us the best chance of reversing this growing epidemic , ” says WHO Director - General Margaret Chan .
Most countries have failed to adopt these policies , thanks in no small part to decades - long efforts by Philip Morris and the rest of Big Tobacco to deploy political power to block public health initiatives .
Thanks to the momentum surrounding a global tobacco treaty , known as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control , adopted in 2005 , this is starting to change .
There ’s a long way to go , but countries are increasingly adopting sound public health measures to combat Big Tobacco .
Now Philip Morris International has signaled its initial plans to subvert these policies .
The company has announced plans to inflict on the world an array of new products , packages and marketing efforts .
These are designed to undermine smoke - free workplace rules , defeat tobacco taxes , segment markets with specially flavored products , offer flavored cigarettes sure to appeal to youth and overcome marketing restrictions .
The Chief Operating Officer of Philip Morris International , Andre Calantzopoulos , detailed in a March investor presentation two new products , Marlboro Wides , “ a shorter cigarette with a wider diameter , ” and Marlboro Intense , “ a rich , flavorful , shorter cigarette . ”
Sounds innocent enough , as far as these things go .
That ’s only to the innocent mind .
The Wall Street Journal reported on Philip Morris International ’s underlying objective : “ The idea behind Intense is to appeal to customers who , due to indoor smoking bans , want to dash outside for a quick nicotine hit but do n’t always finish a full - size cigarette . ”
Workplace and indoor smoke - free rules protect people from second - hand smoke , but also make it harder for smokers to smoke .
The inconvenience ( and stigma of needing to leave the office or restaurant to smoke ) helps smokers smoke less and , often , quit .
Subverting smoke - free bans will damage an important tool to reduce smoking .
Philip Morris International says it can adapt to high taxes .
If applied per pack ( or per cigarette ) , rather than as a percentage of price , high taxes more severely impact low - priced brands ( and can help shift smokers to premium brands like Marlboro ) .
But taxes based on price hurt Philip Morris International .
Philip Morris International ’s response ?
“ Other Tobacco Products , ” which Calantzopoulos describes as “ tax - driven substitutes for low - price cigarettes . ”
These include , says Calantzopoulos , “ the ‘ tobacco block , ’ which I would describe as the perfect make - your - own cigarette device . ”
In Germany , roll - your - own cigarettes are taxed far less than manufactured cigarettes , and Philip Morris International ’s “ tobacco block ” is rapidly gaining market share .
One of the great industry deceptions over the last several decades is selling cigarettes called “ lights ” ( as in Marlboro Lights ) , “ low ” or “ mild ” — all designed to deceive smokers into thinking they are safer .
The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control says these inherently misleading terms should be barred .
Like other companies in this regard , Philip Morris has been moving to replace the names with color coding — aiming to convey the same ideas , without the now - controversial terms .
Calantzopoulos says Philip Morris International will work to more clearly differentiate Marlboro Gold ( lights ) from Marlboro Red ( traditional ) to “ increase their appeal to consumer groups and segments that Marlboro has not traditionally addressed . ”
Philip Morris International also is rolling out a range of new Marlboro products with obvious attraction for youth .
These include Marlboro Ice Mint , Marlboro Crisp Mint and Marlboro Fresh Mint , introduced into Japan and Hong Kong last year .
It is exporting clove products from Indonesia .
The company has also renewed efforts to sponsor youth - oriented music concerts .
In July , activist pressure forced Philip Morris International to withdraw sponsorship of an Alicia Keys concert in Indonesia ( Keys called for an end to the sponsorship deal ) ; and in August , the company was forced to withdraw from sponsorship in the Philippines of a reunion concert of the Eraserheads , a band sometimes considered “ the Beatles of the Philippines . ”
Responding to increasing advertising restrictions and large , pictorial warnings required on packs , Marlboro is focusing increased attention on packaging .
Fancy slide packs make the package more of a marketing device than ever before , and may be able to obscure warning labels .
Most worrisome of all may be the company ’s forays into China , the biggest cigarette market in the world , which has largely been closed to foreign multinationals .
Philip Morris International has hooked up with the China National Tobacco Company , which controls sales in China .
Philip Morris International will sell Chinese brands in Europe .
Much more importantly , the company is starting to sell licensed versions of Marlboro in China .
The Chinese are n’t letting Philip Morris International in quickly — Calantzopoulos says , “ We do not foresee a material impact on our volume and profitability in the near future . ”
But , he adds , “ we believe this long - term strategic cooperation will prove to be mutually beneficial and form the foundation for strong long - term growth . ”
What does long - term growth mean ?
In part , it means gaining market share among China ’s 350 million smokers .
But it also means expanding the market , by selling to girls and women .
About 60 percent of men in China smoke ; only 2 or 3 percent of women do so .
Roche : Saving Lives is Not Our Business Monopoly control over life - saving medicines gives enormous power to drug companies .
And , to paraphrase Lord Acton , enormous power corrupts enormously .
The Swiss company Roche makes a range of HIV - related drugs .
One of them is enfuvirtid , sold under the brand - name Fuzeon .
Fuzeon is the first of a new class of AIDS drugs , working through a novel mechanism .
It is primarily used as a “ salvage ” therapy — a treatment for people for whom other therapies no longer work .
Fuzeon brought in $ 266 million to Roche in 2007 , though sales are declining .
Roche charges $ 25,000 a year for Fuzeon .
It does not offer a discount price for developing countries .
Like most industrialized countries , Korea maintains a form of price controls — the national health insurance program sets prices for medicines .
The Ministry of Health , Welfare and Family Affairs listed Fuzeon at $ 18,000 a year .
Korea ’s per capita income is roughly half that of the United States .
Instead of providing Fuzeon , for a profit , at Korea ’s listed level , Roche refuses to make the drug available in Korea .
Korea is not a developing country , emphasizes Roche spokesperson Martina Rupp .
“ South Korea is a developed country like the U.S. or like Switzerland . ”
Roche insists that Fuzeon is uniquely expensive to manufacture , and so that it cannot reduce prices .
According to a statement from Roche , “ the offered price represents the lowest sustainable price at which Roche can provide Fuzeon to South Korea , considering that the production process for this medication requires more than 100 steps — 10 times more than other antiretrovirals .
A single vial takes six months to produce , and 45 kilograms of raw materials are necessary to produce one kilogram of Fuzeon . ”
The head of Roche Korea was reportedly less diplomatic .
According to Korean activists , he told them , “ We are not in business to save lives , but to make money .
Saving lives is not our business . ”
Says Roche spokesperson Rupp : “ I do n’t know why he would say that , and I cannot imagine that this is really something that this person said . ”
Another AIDS - related drug made by Roche is valganciclovir .
Valganciclovir treats a common AIDS - related infection called cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) that causes blindness or death .
Roche charges $ 10,000 for a four - month course of valganciclovir .
In December 2006 , it negotiated with Médicins Sans Frontières / Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) and agreed on a price of $ 1,899 .
According to MSF , this still - price - gouging price is only available for poor and very high incidence countries , however , and only for nonprofit organizations — not national treatment programs .
Roche ’s Rupp says that “ Currently , MSF is the only organization requesting purchase of Valcyte [ Roche ’s brand name for valganciclovir ] for such use in these countries .
To date , MSF are the only AIDS treatment provider treating CMV for their patients .
They told us themselves this is because no - one else has the high level of skilled medical staff they have . ”
Dr. David Wilson , former MSF medical coordinator in Thailand , says he remembers the first person that MSF treated with life - saving antiretrovirals .
“ I remember everyone was feeling really great that we were going to start treating people with antiretrovirals , with the hope of bringing people back to normal life . ”
The first person MSF treated , Wilson says , lived but became blind from CMV .
“ She became strong and she lived for a long time , but the antiretroviral treatment does n’t treat the CMV . ”
“ I ’ve been working in MSF projects and treating people with AIDS with antiretrovirals for seven years now , ” he says , “ and along with many colleagues we ’ve been frustrated because we do n’t have treatment for this particular disease .
We now think we have a strategy to diagnose it effectively and what we really need is the medicine to treat the patients . ”
Multinational Monitor editor Robert Weissman is the director of Essential Action .
" We are OK for a period of time ... but when you go out to the medium term you can begin to see there is not enough collective generation being built in the UK , " Mr Holliday told The Times .
" We will need to watch that very carefully over the next 18 months to ensure that window gets shut . "
When you are in as big a mess as the UK is in , it is vital those in authority begin with an honest review of where we are , and honest analysis of what is possible .
Instead every day I read in the media half truths and lies about the financial position .
We need to start from an accurate base to get the diagnosis and prescription right .
Main myths :
1 . The government will borrow £ 78 bn this year and 8 % of GNP next year .
The government ’s own figures ( PBR ) show it will borrow £ 157 bn this year , more than 10 % of GDP .
Why will no - one write that in the newspapers ?
2 . The Bank will consider “ quantitative easing ” after lowering interest rates more , if they do not work .
The Bank ’s own figures show that it is massively into quantitative easing already , with a ballooned balance sheet that makes most hedge funds and investment banks look very restrained .
3 . The problems came from the USA , and this is a global problem .
Most of the UK ’s problems were home grown .
UK Regulators and the Bank made the same type of mistakes the US authorities made , but they did not import them .
Northern Rock was a British bank lending British money to British customers under a British Regulator .
It was not brought down by sub prime US mortgages .
4 . We will do whatever it takes to get the banks working again and to abate the recession .
Why then did the authorities demand the banks have more capital to sustain their lending at this point in the cycle ?
Could n’t they see that would make the lending crunch worse ?
Why did someone brief the press that our banks were weak and needed more capital , at a time when confidence was low ?
No bank at that point faced a run .
5. Regulators are the answer .
Why then did the Regulators set capital requirements that allowed the excess ?
Why were Northern Rock Directors discussing how they could increase lending and cut capital on the eve of their disaster , in order to get down to regulatory requirements ?
( N Rock Report 2007 )
6. Regulators cannot be expected to detect fraud and scams .
What then is the point of them ?
Why ca n’t they do some detective work based on the usual warning signs of companies likely to overtrade or worse ?
The signs are well known to people with experience in financial markets , but it takes the Regulator ’s powers to go in and find out for sure .
Not all those who show the signs are bad .
The plain truth is you cannot solve a crisis of over borrowing by borrowing more .
The state is not big enough and rich enough to take over all the bad risks of banking and industry at the same time .
The state has to avoid borrowing so much and printing so much that it too loses the confidence of people and markets .
When is this nightmare going to stop ?
When are the authorities going to realise they are pouring petrol onto a fire that has gone out .
Instead of pouring more petrol , they need to find a match and ignite a controlled fire again .
When you look at the massive amounts of money and liquidity they are pumping into the system , when you look at the growing government bond bubble , you must feel “ Here we go again ” .
The authorities have forgotten – if they ever knew – that there are big lags in the system .
It takes time for lower interest rates to work through , just as it took time for their high interest rates to work through a couple of years ago .
Nothing will work without mending the banks , but once they have found a way of mending the banks they need to reverse the ballooning of cash and liquidity rapidly before they create a big inflation .
As someone who pleaded for them to halve interest rates a year ago to stave off recession , I say to them , do not cut interest rates any more until you have worked how to get on top of the government debt problem and have done more to create a sensible and competitive banking system .
Zero interest rates could make the poblems worse , not better .
You need to think of savers as well as borrowers when we are trying to get the country out of debt , not more into it .
So what does it take to mend the banks ?
A sensible way forward would be to invite them in for private talks .
The Regulator shouod be prepared to amend the capital requirements temporarily to get things started again .
The government should be prepared to change the terms of its short term loans and guarantees to help markets .
No more capital should be offered by taxpayers , and a route to getting the taxpayer out of share ownership , and certainly out of majority share ownership should be agreed .
Which would make Valentine 's Day a crap shoot , too .
Yesterday a colleague was raving about her Kindle -- Amazon 's much - hyped and Oprah - endorsed e-book reader -- so , primarily out of curiosity , I asked what a Santa 's helper might expect to spend on one of those bad boys .
Her e-mail reply : " $ 359 , but I think you 've already missed Christmas ( the estimated ship date is 11 to13 weeks ) . "
Say what ?
Eleven to 13 weeks ?
Christmas is only 30 days from today , so the fact that a hot toy is out of stock should n't be a shocker ; but three months for a gadget that 's been on virtual shelves for a year already ?
Here 's what Amazon says on its main Kindle page :
Usually ships within 11 to 13 weeks .
...
Due to heavy customer demand , Kindle is sold out .
Please ORDER KINDLE NOW to reserve your place in line .
We prioritize orders on a first come , first served basis .
This item will arrive after December 24 .
Quite a bit after Dec. 24 .
And does that " usually " open the door to even longer waits ?
As might be expected , would - be buyers are not happy .
Here 's one recent reaction culled from Amazon 's legendary " customer reviews " section :
" You have to be kidding me : an 11 - to 13 - week back order just before Xmas .
Amazon sure screwed up here .
I wanted a Kindle for Xmas but I will instruct my wife not to purchase one .
Why should she pay a premium for a product that has been out for so long ?
Amazon has had plenty of time to build up inventory and now the week of Thanksgiving the Kindle is on back order .
Very disappointing .
... I am so angry ! "
That seems an unassailable point of view , yet the reviewer was assailed by several of those who already have ( and clearly cherish ) their Kindles .
It was off - topic and unfair of Mr. Angry to vent , allege The Lucky Ones , given that he has not actually caressed a Kindle in his own hands .
Off topic ?
I do n't know .
It seems to me that a three - month wait is pretty darn on topic for Amazon visitors doing their Christmas shopping .
I suppose it 's worth noting that there was a " used -- like new " Kindle for sale at Amazon ... one ... for $ 800 .
And you can have your pick of them if you 're willing to compete and pay a hefty premium at eBay .
The easy explanation for Kindle demand outstripping Kindle supply is the vaunted Oprah Effect , although at least one analyst is skeptical of that theory .
But might the shortage be contrived , as is often alleged in such situations ?
Just another way to drum up publicity ?
...
Please , this makes Amazon look plain inept .
Difficult to imagine even the dumbest marketer pulling this stunt on purpose .
I 've got a request in with Amazon public relations for comment about all of this .
Hope they get back to me in less than 11 to 13 weeks .

According to Slog :
Seattle , as part of a national day of action , is planning one big protest of Proposition 8 and the bigoted Utah church behind the measure : Festivities begin in Volunteer Park on Saturday at 10:30 a.m. , a rally begins at noon , the march leaves at 1 p.m. and then heads down to Westlake Park for more protesting , rallying and speechifying .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
As the stock market heads into the last week of the year , what was inconceivable just 12 months ago is now a stark possibility : 2008 could be the worst year ever for Wall Street .
Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York , December 23 , 2008 .

The market ’s most tracked benchmark , the S&P 500 , is down 40.6 percent since last year ’s close with only three trading days left in 2008 .
Given the market ’s hair - trigger volatility this year , that ’s just one bad day away from surpassing 1931 ’s 47.1 percent drop , the biggest yearly decline ever .
As it is , the market ’s swoon this year will cement 2008 ’s place in history by at least one measure : eviscerated wealth .
A record $ 7.3 trillion of stock market value has been obliterated this year , according to the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 index , the broadest measure of U.S. equity performance .
Investors ran for the exits this year as a collapse originally thought to be contained to the U.S. home mortgage sector morphed into a full - blown global credit crisis that now threatens global recession .
The fallout from frozen credit markets permeated all sectors from banks to autos to resources , while unemployment climbed , house prices plummeted and cash - strapped consumers curtailed their spending .
“ How to sum up a year that has been plagued with financial crisis in every form and fashion that you could see and , at the same time , we have an economy that ’s just imploding on itself , ” said Jocelynn Drake , market analyst at Schaeffer ’s Investment Research in Cincinnati , Ohio .
“ If 2008 proved to be anything , I think it was a reality check for a lot of people . ”
A CATACLYSMIC YEAR
Market watchers said it was a year unlike any they have ever seen .
Among the casualties : the restructuring , acquisition or disappearance of such heavy hitters as Bear Stearns , AIG , Washington Mutual , Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers .
The global downturn forced central banks around the world to mount coordinated interest - rate cuts in an attempt to stimulate growth , pushing rates aggressively lower .
Earlier this month , the U.S. Federal Reserve again cut rates to almost zero and pledged to undertake more unconventional methods to fight off the year - long recession .
While no one is feeling celebratory as the year draws to a close , analysts say the Fed ’s offensive has bolstered optimism by showing the central bank is willing to take whatever steps are necessary to get credit flowing again .
REASONS FOR HOPE
The new year will also bring a new White House administration when Barack Obama is sworn in as president in January .
Hopes for a new stimulus package have also buoyed the market of late as Obama ’s picks for his economic team have been greeted favorably .
Obama is expected to unveil a government spending program in areas including infrastructure building to reinforce boosts from the Fed .
Earlier this week , Vice President - elect Joe Biden said the new administration was close to nailing down a deal with congressional Democrats on the package , which aims to generate 3 million new jobs and could cost $ 775 billion or more .
“ 2009 , if it goes according to plan , will be a transition year from one of major disasters and financial distress to one of repair and gradual recovery , ” said Michael Sheldon , chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport , Connecticut .
“ Looking into the new year , the economic data is likely to continue to be very weak .
However , the question really is : ‘ How much of that bad news is already priced in , and how long will it last ? ’ ”
WHEN SANTA SKIPS TOWN
The lack of a significant year - end rally so far does not bode well for the market in the new year .
With stocks unable to mount a Santa Claus rally this week , analysts said they will be looking to next week for a clue as to what to expect in 2009 .
“ A Santa Claus rally can offer clues as to what January , and thus the next year , might bring , ” said Bruce Zaro , chief technical strategist at Delta Global Advisors in Boston .
Conversely , the absence of a rally could be a sign of more hefty losses to come , Zaro added .
Trading is expected to continue to be light next week , when markets will be closed on Thursday for the New Year ’s holiday .
Among economic data on tap is Tuesday ’s report on December consumer confidence index from the Conference Board , expected to read 45.0 versus 44.9 in November , according to a Reuters poll .
The Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing index for December is expected on Friday , and is anticipated to show a reading of 35.5 , down from November ’s 36.2 .
A reading above 50 points to expansion , while a reading below 50 shows a contraction .
( Editing by Jan Paschal )
( UPDATE : Complete text of Pres. - elect Barack Obama 's acceptance speech is available here . )
As expected , the moment the polls closed in California , Oregon and Washington state , network projections declared that Barack Obama would win all three .
And with those three , based on such calls , the senator from Illinois passed the 270 - electoral - vote mark needed to win the presidency .
Not only will he be the nation 's first biracial president , he also will be the first native of Hawaii to move into the White House .
He is the first sitting senator to claim the ultimate political prize since John Kennedy in 1960 ( as would have been John McCain ) .
There is one trend that continues -- Obama will be the fourth straight president with an Ivy League educational pedigree .

Last month I visited a small town in southern Mexico .
It is a quiet and modestly prosperous place .
Outside some of the homes are older Suburbans , Jeeps and Explorers ; the license plates show that their owners have recently returned from the US , driven out by the collapsing economy and heightened nativist anxieties .
Almost every family , it seems , has some member who has spent time up north ; only a very few of them are still hanging on through the recession .
For the most part , Mexicans are innocent by - standers in the current financial debacle .
They did n’t allow themselves to be talked into strange mortgages or multiple credit cards ; whether north or south of the border , this is for them still predominantly a cash economy .
Even for those who went to the US , their key goal was to accumulate dollars and send them south , where , as pesos , they provide the basics and even a few luxuries for many families .
Until recently , these remittances have been second only to oil income in importance for Mexico ; now both are shrinking fast .
There is something more than a little unfair in the manner in which the recession is hurting our southern neighbor .
Mexicans , for the most part , have a personal risk calculus that is the complete reverse of ours .
Like most people who have experienced hard times , they are not obsessed with the little things that might go awry ; they do n’t place little flags around puddles in the grocery store , and most dogs have never received a rabies shot .
The sidewalks often look as though a tree is trying to push its way through the ground and electrical cables are frequently visible .
It ’s not unusual to see a local butcher frying up vast cauldrons of meats in front of his carnecineria , something that would drive American health inspectors to apoplexy .
In contrast to their wealthier Northern neighbors , Mexicans seem quite happy to take responsibility for themselves and do n’t expect to sue someone every time they stub their toe .
But their collective view of risk is also the reverse of ours .
Property is , for most people , something to live in and not something for speculation .
Building one ’s own home is common but it ’s usually done in stages , whenever there is cash to spare .
The results may be untidy , with streets perpetually possessing the appearance of construction zones , but there is no evidence of any foreclosure crisis — forests of ‘ for sale ’ signs are absent , in Veracruz , at least .
Nor is that the only visual difference between nondescript Mexican and American cities .
Antiseptic zoning is much less common in Mexico , with the result that families live above the store , or behind the workshop , or even on the roof of some buildings .
Affluent homes may stand next to literal ruins .
In most American cities , this would be evidence of a neighborhood slipping into decay , causing realtors to flee to more ordered areas .
But for Mexicans , this juxtaposition simply adds to the sense of being in an organic place rather than on a Disney set .
What it means for neighborliness is hard to judge , but it would certainly make an interesting comparative research project .
Of course , there are some equivalents to the homogenous subdivisions that dominate the American housing market .
I saw several large up - scale gated communities that were standing idle , waiting for better times .
I was also shown several housing developments , where government agencies were building terraced homes for state workers .
What is striking to the visitor is that these would never be offered in the US housing market , as they would be judged to be unacceptably small .
At approximately one thousand square feet , they are half the size of the average American home , ( approximately 2200 square feet ) and significantly smaller than most new houses .
Even though Mexican families are , on average , larger ( with more children and more generations living together ) , the expectation is not that every member of the family gets a bathroom or even a bedroom .
It is also common to buy small and build out , or up , as needs dictate and finances permit .
Anyone who has traveled in Asia will also be familiar with this phenomenon , which manifests itself in ground floor apartments that encroach upon the street , balconies that become bedrooms and so forth .
High density and modest means lead to invention , if not the kinds of appearance mandated by Home Owner Associations or preferred by the fusspot New Urbanist designers .
In the past , the Mexican financial system has been criticized for maintaining a tight hold on credit .
Even before the current crisis , high interest rates were unfriendly to the consumer , slowing the pace of both urban development and speculation .
Given our current crisis , perhaps it ’s worth asking whether this points to how the American market may develop in the future .
Certainly , we can expect that credit will remain tight for a significant while .
The rules for obtaining a mortgage will become more onerous ; interest rates will be fixed , appraisals will be exact .
McMansions will be of little interest except to large families of means ; smaller and older homes will be at a premium .
Definitions of overcrowding may change ; design expectations will be downsized , and home maintenance will become more usual .
As opportunities in the formal labor marketplace shrink , perhaps for an extended period , more Americans will work from their homes and garages , much as occurs in many developing countries .
There may also be significantly less mobility , with little or no speculative purchasing .
This is likely to have the greatest impact on the condominium market .
Even affluent parents will be obligated to keep their college - age kids on campus rather than in condos that they hope to flip after graduation .
And even when they have a degree , these young adults – with large student loans , minimal credit and no cash for a down payment – will become used to staying with their parents for longer periods , as is frequently the case in Mexico and other developing markets .
This could extend into marriage and even family formation .
The condos themselves will , for the foreseeable future , revert to rental properties , catering to those who can no longer maintain a foothold in the owner market .
This does not imply that American cities are going to turn into Mexican ones any time soon .
But there is much to be learned by studying the ways that Mexicans calculate risk .
We might have fewer families borrowing beyond their means , and continually trying to beat the market .
And with less aggregate risk in one part of our lives , we might then view other parts of our daily world with a little less obsession with control .
We might be a little more relaxed about who lives next door ; we might also be a little more tolerant about the age of their truck or the color of the drapes .
After all , they might be Mexican , in which case we know that , if they are there , they can probably actually afford it .

TORONTO ( Reuters ) - Canada will follow the United States by providing C$ 4 billion ( $ 3.3 billion ) in emergency loans to the Canadian arms of Detroit ’s ailing automakers to keep them operating while they restructure their businesses , Prime Minister Stephen Harper said on Saturday .
Auto mechanic Paul Cook works on a customer 's Ford Escape SUV in the service department of a Ford car dealership in Warren , Michigan December 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Rebecca Cook
The package , announced by Harper and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty , comes a day after the White House unveiled a $ 17.4 billion package to shore up Detroit ’s auto industry .
Harper also announced two new federal measures to support the overall industry -- one to benefit automotive suppliers and a second to help consumers get credit to buy cars .
“ There are literally across the country hundreds of thousands if not millions of potentially affected families by the distress of this industry , ” Harper said at a joint news conference .
“ And we are obviously making sure at this Christmas time that , within the confines of our responsibility for taxpayer money , that we are also going to look after their interest . ”
A collapse of the Detroit Three automakers would put nearly 600,000 Canadians out of work within five years , most of them in Ontario , according to a recent report by provincial advisory panel .
Under the plan , the federal government will provide C$ 2.7 billion in short - term loans and Ontario C$ 1.3 billion .
General Motors of Canada Ltd is eligible for loans of up to $ C3 billion and Chrysler Canada Inc for up to C$ 1 billion .
The Canadian arm of Ford Motor has not asked for immediate assistance , the Industry Ministry said .
Harper said the governments were attempting to attach some liens and secure some assets of the car companies “ but I will not fool you -- there is obviously some money at risk here . ”
He said the aid reflected Canada ’s 20 percent share of North American production capacity .
But at $ 3.3 billion , the Canadian package actually represents one - sixth , or 16 percent , of the $ 20.7 billion in North American aid announced over the past two days .
FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION
Harper said Canada would not allow a restructuring of the industry on U.S. terms in a way that might cause the relocation of Canadian facilities to the United States .
He said the Bush administration and the incoming Obama team have made it clear they would not let the companies fail .
“ We may well have much smaller companies but they will not fail in my judgment , ” Harper said .
“ The question then for Canada is to ensure that as they are restructured that we retain our market share . ”
Harper said the aid to automotive suppliers would come in the form of additional accounts - receivable insurance coverage through the federal Export Development Corp .
The federal government also will create a new facility to support access to credit for consumers .
Details were not immediately available .
“ We do n’t want a package that simply helps the Detroit Three and therefore has the effect of ... subsidizing those who are struggling while penalizing those who have made good business decisions , ” Harper said in explaining why the package included help for suppliers and consumers .
It was apparent any deal would need some concessions from the Canadian Auto Workers .
Harper said all stakeholders would have to help in the restructuring .
After the announcement , the CAW said it was willing to work with industry to protect jobs .
Even so , it said the crisis was not caused by compensation for North American autoworkers but by the overall troubles in the economy .
McGuinty , the Ontario premier , said Asian automakers , which have facilities in Canada , backed the aid package .
He said that if the one of the Big Three companies fail , the entire industry , including the Asian - based companies , would suffer because of the integration of the North American industry .
A recent study commissioned by the Ontario Manufacturing Council warned that a collapse of the Detroit Three would ripple through the entire economy , hitting creditors , suppliers , parts manufacturers and dealerships .
Harper is a Conservative who generally opposes state intervention in the economy but he said on Thursday that the government would end a 12 - year string of budget surpluses and inject C$ 20 billion to C$ 30 billion of stimulus into the economy next fiscal year .
Interest on the short - term loans to the automakers will be set at 300 basis points above LIBOR , the federal government said in a release .
The closing date is December 29 .

With all due respect to my esteemed colleague Jonathan Freedland , I feel compelled to contest his theory that the belle of this year 's Republican ball will be back in the presidential chase come 2012 .
A victory for John McCain would certainly give Palin the chance to rehabilitate her approval ratings and consolidate her appeal to the conservative base in preparation for a future presidential run .
But if Barack Obama becomes president next year – and it's a bigger assumption than most liberals would like to think right now – Palin is going to have a devil of a time making a viable bid for the White House .
The first factor holding her back is the same enemy that Palin often decries before her rapt audiences : the media .
Every publication from the New Yorker to Field and Stream magazine descended on rural Wasilla , Alaska after Palin joined the Republican ticket last month , and the resulting crush of damning press created a string of ready - made attack adverts for any possible opponent in 2012 .
Imagine if John Edwards , the 2004 Democratic vice - presidential nominee , had emerged victorious as his party 's nominee this year .
Even if Edwards 's infidelity had not become public , Republicans would be subjecting him to a daily re-litigation of the same battles that brought down the Kerry - Edwards ticket four years ago .
His campaign would be watched hawkishly for the slightest hint of a reversal on the issues – and so would Palin 's in 2012 .
Given that the Alaska governor can barely keep her positions straight over a period of weeks on topics as sensitive as military action inside Pakistan and judicial refinancing of mortgages , you 'd better believe that Democrats would salivate at the chance to fact - check her four years from now .
Not to mention , operatives will be watching to see whether Palin 's pricey designer clothes show up at the Salvation Army after the election .
The second drag on Palin 's political future is her state .
Yes , Alaska is certainly remote and offers scant opportunities for national political exposure .
But most importantly , it also lacks a substantial fundraising base from which Palin can extract the cold , hard cash necessary to run for president four years from now .
Her best chance to build a network over the next four years as governor is courting the major oil companies .
But Palin was correct in noting that her independent - minded approach to the Alaska natural gas pipeline turned off Exxon and the other energy giants .
Sarah Barracuda is certain to remain in the good graces of Bill Kristol , Fred Barnes and other A - list conservative pundits who are enthralled by her stage presence .
( Peggy Noonan , as it happens , is far from a Palin fan these days . )
Still , even if Kristol & Co can give her entrée to the Washington power elite – something tells me McCain wo n't be in the mood to share after a loss this year – Palin is bound to watch her approval ratings suffer in Alaska as she openly plans another run at the White House .
On the subject of approval ratings , they happen to be the third factor imperilling Palin 's presidential future .
Polling is generally untrustworthy on the details , but Palin 's numbers paint a distressing picture : the more voters get to know her , the less they like her .
After Palin stormed onto the national stage with her combative convention speech last month , she boasted a 54 % positive rating .
Five weeks later , her approval rating had fallen to 44 % , compared with 60 % for Democratic No 2 Joe Biden .
Voter perceptions of Palin also have suffered back in Alaska , albeit on a smaller scale .
Does anyone think the bespectacled governor will be able to return home quietly for two years of fighting environmental regulations ?
Palin had better start getting used to the pesky media tracking her every move on the local level , particularly her clashes with Alaska critics Andree McLeod , Andrew Halcro and Anne Kilkenny .
Four years from now , Palin is unlikely to be enjoying the 80 % - plus approval that gilded her emergence this autumn , especially if she faces a difficult re-election fight in 2010 .
That brings me to the fourth and final reason that Palin 2012 is less of a sure thing than Freedland and others believe .
Palin 's term expires in 2010 , the same month that Republican Lisa Murkowski must defend her Senate seat .
Having spectacularly unseated Murkowski's father , Frank , in order to become governor , Palin may well decide that knocking off another Murkowski is her best path to broader power .
The Senate would be the best perch for Palin to keep an eye on a potential President Obama if she wants to run in 2012 – which would surely depend on how vulnerable Obama is to a successful challenge by that point .
But wait : Palin would first have to win that Senate seat .
And although she energises the conservative base now , she does so largely through prepared talking points , depicting Obama as a " pal " of terrorists and McCain as " the only man " who can defend America .
The next several years will test her ability to delve into the more substantive critiques that are required of both Senate and presidential candidates .
Before Palin and her fans in the media - political - industrial complex get psyched about a 2012 run , she 'd do well to bone up on policy .
A good place to start might be learning that the vice - president does n't actually rule over the Senate .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Adding radiation therapy to standard drug treatment can cut in half the death rate from advanced prostate cancer and should become the standard of care globally , Swedish researchers reported on Monday .
Their study of more than 800 prostate cancer patients showed that nearly 24 percent of men who got only standard drugs had died after 10 years , compared with just under 12 percent of men who also got radiation treatment .
Adding radiation does not add too many side - effects , they wrote in the journal Lancet Oncology .
“ The quality of life and adverse effect profile is acceptable .
We therefore suggest that endocrine treatment plus radiotherapy should be the new standard of care for these patients , ” Anders Widmark of Umea University in Sweden and colleagues wrote .
“ The results should change current practice , making long - term hormonal therapy plus radical radiotherapy the standard of care for men with locally advanced prostate cancer , ” Dr. Chris Parker and Dr. Alex Tan of Britain ’s Institute of Cancer Research in Sutton , Surrey , wrote in a commentary .
Prostate cancer is the second - leading cancer killer of men , killing 221,000 every year globally , with 679,000 new cases diagnosed .
It is easily cured in early stages with surgery or radiation .
For prostate cancer that has spread , drugs that interfere with cancer - fueling hormones are prescribed .
In the United States , adding radiation therapy is already standard , said Dr. Howard Sandler , chair of Radiation Oncology at Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and a spokesman for the American Society of Clinical Oncology .
He said health agencies in Europe did not always provide radiation as the standard of care .
“ A 50 percent reduction in the risk of prostate cancer death is a real clinical benefit , ” Sandler said in a telephone interview .
“ The radiation therapy that was performed here ( in the study ) was somewhat simplistic , ” Sandler added .

Madison Quartarone was just a week old when the procedure was carried out at London 's Great Ormond Street Hospital .
She was found to have a large , benign tumour , and glue was used to block the blood vessels supplying it , effectively starving it of nutrients .
The baby , from Bedford , is now said to be " doing well " .
Madison is not out of the woods yet but she does look remarkably well
Dominic Thompson
Great Ormond Street Hospital Neurosurgeon Dominic
Thompson , who carried out the procedure , said he was not aware of any younger babies receiving it .
" If successful , it could be groundbreaking , " he told the Bedfordshire on Sunday newspaper .
" Madison is not out of the woods yet but she does look remarkably well . "
Madison , who is now eight weeks old , was born with an obviously swollen head , which meant that the tumour could be spotted quickly .
Mr Thompson said that it was " very unusual " for tumours to present themselves so early in life .
During the procedure , a tube was guided into the blood vessels connected to the tumour , and the glue passed through it to seal them .
Scans have suggested that the treatment was having an impact , starving the tumour of nutrients and oxygen , and causing it to shrink .
Madison 's grandfather Ian Chandler told the paper that she was now putting weight on , and the family was hopeful that the tumour would continue to reduce in size .

... or maybe better walk , lol .
This happened in a town about 20 miles from where i live .
The 2 guys filming the incident were piss drunk themselves , walking home in the morning and just having their breakfast .
But the taxi driver takes the cake , i dont know how wasted you have to be ... Especially funny for me cause they speak in the local dialect , anyway i put subtitles to it .( sadly piss poor quality , mobilecam )
It seems to me that in the absence of a real press conference , the networks and cable news networks should simply cease broadcasting her speeches live and demand of every Republican guest that they explain this descent into anti-democratic territory .
Bush and Cheney despise the press and despise the constitutional balances that restrict their dictatorial impulses .
They do n't recognize the rule of law as an impediment to the exercise of their power and they do n't acknowledge any democratic input , apart from a single " accountability moment " every four years .
And now they want to prevent the public 's ability through the press to ask the toughest questions and toughest follow - ups even during that one " accountability moment " .
This is how Putin behaves .
It is anti-American .
It has never been tried in modern times before .
It is a chilling attack on an open society and the accountability of its leaders to the people they serve .
The press has a duty to stand up against it - and to care more about the process than its own precious reputation in the mouths of Hannity , Steyn , Palin and the rest of them .

Future Cell Phones Could Be Powered by Sound Waves
December 4th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Think about how often your cell phone is plugged into a jack .
What if there was a way to eliminate all that power use ?
There may be , according to Tahir Cagin , a professor at Texas A&M University .
Cagin and his colleagues have discovered a way to power cell phones using sound waves produced by the user .
The researchers found that a certain kind of piezoelectric material ( crystals or ceramics that generate voltage when mechanical stress is applied ) is able to convert energy at a 100 percent increase when manufactured at approximately 21 nanometers in thickness .
If the material is produced at a larger or smaller thickness , its energy - converting capacity diminishes .
Since many electronic devices — cell phones , laptops , and personal communicators included — contain elements measured in nanometers , Cagin ’s discovery has huge implications .
Cagin ’s technology is still in the research phase , but piezoelectrics are already found in microphones , quartz watches , and even cigarette lighters .

Despite months of rescue efforts , hundreds of billions of dollars in government spending and an avant - garde apparatus of financial tools , the American economy has only worsened , and at a faster rate than nearly anyone predicted .
This recession , which officially began in December 2007 , now appears virtually certain to be the longest downturn  and possibly most severe  since the end of World War II , as evidenced last week by a demoralizing rat - a - tat of grim reports on jobs , sales and public confidence .
The reports signaled that even after 11 months , more than the entire length of the last two downturns , this recession has only now entered its fiercest phase , and economists say the pain will not end soon .
“ For the average American it ’s going to be devastating for the next 6 to 12 months , ” said Bernard Baumohl , chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group , a research and forecasting firm .
He added , “ I have not seen anything particularly hopeful right now , which tells me we have a ways to go . ”
Palin subject of new ethics complaint over children 's travel John Byrne
Published : Wednesday October 29 , 2008
Print This Email This Governor Sarah Palin is the subject of a new ethics complaint , according to a new document obtained by CBS News .
This time , she 's being questioned for charging the state for her children 's travel expenses .
The complaint , filed last Friday by a retired lineman in Anchorage , accuses her of Misuse of Official Position : " Gov. Palin attempted to and in fact did use her official position for personal gain by securing unwarranted benefits for her daughters ... "
All allegations are related to state reimbursed travel .
Palin recently escaped legal liability for her husband 's efforts to have the state 's public safety director fired , though the investigating committee rebuked her ethics .
" Palin ran on the platform of ethics , transparency and anti-corruption .
I 'm tired of the hypocrisy that exists in Government and people need to know the truth , " Frank Gwartney , the ex-lineman , told CBS .
All ethics complaints filed against the governor in Alaska are confidential .
The state 's attorney general refused to confirm or deny the filing to the network .
Palin's three daughters have accrued $ 32,629 travel expenses , while her husband has booked another $ 22,174 .
In sum , the travel reimbursements to Palin 's family have totaled $ 54,803 .
Palin 's spokesman said the governor followed state policy .
" Governor Palin followed state policy allowing governors to charge for their children 's travel and there 's also the expectation that the first family participate in community activities across the state , " spokeswoman Sharon Leighow said .

Labour MPs revolt over Brown 's plan to charge 27 % interest on emergency loans to poor
Gordon Brown and his Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell were last night accused of behaving ‘ like loan sharks ’ over plans to slap punishingly high interest rates on vital loans to the poor .
In an astonishing move , rebel Labour MPs joined forces with David Cameron ’s Tories to accuse the Government of penalising hundreds of thousands of families on benefits who get interest - free cash advances to cover the cost of unforeseen crises .
More than one million individual loans worth over £ 600 million were paid out from the Government ’s social fund last year to hard - up people – many of them disabled – who struggled to afford to repair a broken boiler or cope with some other domestic emergency .
Under Fire : Gordon the ' loan shark ' and James Purnell
However , in a provocative move , Mr Purnell wants to start charging 26.8 per cent on new loans – the sort of punitive rate found on High Street store cards and way above normal credit - card rates .
This would add nearly £ 50 to the cost of an average £ 433 loan and saddle the borrowers , who are almost all on State benefits , with an extra four weeks of repayments .
Senior Labour MP
Terry Rooney , chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee , led an all - party attack on the proposal .
‘ Whoever dreamed this up , particularly at this time of year , must have lost their moral compass , ’ he said .
‘ It can not be right to start charging almost 27 per cent interest on loans to the poorest people , who currently pay zero interest . ’
Mr Rooney believed that the plan , outlined in a consultation document produced by the Department for Work and Pensions , was a cynical cost - cutting ploy to stop poor families getting the money they need .
He added : ‘ I fail to see how Mr Purnell can reconcile raising interest rates for the poor with the Prime Minister ’s repeated calls to the banks to pass on interest - rate cuts to struggling mortgage holders .
There will be one hell of a row over this . ’
Ronnie Campbell , Labour MP for Blyth Valley , said : ‘ James Purnell makes me ashamed to be a member of the Labour Party .
It is a disgrace the way he is hitting the poor .
Not even the Tories would try to do this . ’
Labour MPs also suspect that Mr Purnell is worried that the cost of the social fund will rocket as unemployment soars and thousands more people apply for help .
In an embarrassing development for the Government , Labour MPs received support from Tory Work and Pensions spokesman
Chris Grayling , who called on the Government to scrap the plan .
‘ This is beyond outrageous , ’ he said .
‘ It ’s nothing more than James Purnell and Gordon Brown re-inventing themselves as loan sharks .
‘ That any Government would even consider imposing swingeing interest rates on unemployed people in the middle of a recession is just extraordinary .
It ’s a sign that this Government is utterly out of touch with what is really going on in Britain . ’
And Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable said : ‘ This proposal is perverse and inhumane .
The principle of social funds is that they are interest - free to help people cope with emergencies . ’
Mr Purnell ’s document , which suggests that non-profit - making credit unions could run the loans , spells out in stark terms how the poorest families in Britain would be hit hard in the pocket under the new system .
It says : ‘ Interest would be charged ... at affordable rates compared to those charged by commercial lenders in the same market .
‘ We propose to set it at the maximum charged by credit unions of two per cent per month – 26.8 APR .
‘ In 2007 - 08 , the average initial budgeting loan award was £ 433.30 .
The estimated average loan repayment for all loans was £ 10.54 a week .
If interest were charged at two per cent a month , it would take 46 weeks instead of 42 to repay such a loan at such a repayment rate , with a total interest paid of £ 47.80 . ’
Mark Serwotka , general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union , whose members administer the social fund , said : ‘ This might start with credit unions , but it will become a Trojan horse for the private sector to charge loan - shark rates for distributing public money .
‘ It is scandalous that in these dire economic times , vulnerable people in financial difficulties could be exposed to profiteering .
Interest of 26.8 per cent rates alongside some of the most expensive store cards . ’
But the Government hit back last night , saying that under the proposed scheme , hard - up families would benefit from new advice on how to manage household budgets .
It said it would also be easier and quicker to get the loans , which would become available to working people on low incomes as well as those on benefits .
In the consultation document , Mr Purnell signalled that simply handing people interest - free loans without financial advice did little to help them manage their money .
‘ We want to improve the help we give people when many are struggling , ’ he said .
‘ The social fund helps with money problems in the short term , but not the underlying problems of managing a limited budget . ’
Last night , Work and Pensions Minister Kitty Ussher conceded that there was ‘ very strong opposition ’ to the plans .
But she dismissed the idea that the social fund was heading for loan - shark levels of interest , pointing out that ‘ doorstep lenders can legally charge 180 to 240 per cent .
Illegal loan sharks have been known to charge up to 1,000 per cent ’ .
It is not the first time Gordon Brown has been accused of betraying the poor .
As Chancellor , he was criticised for approving a meagre 75 p - a - week increase in the State pension .
And this year , he was forced to climb down over his decision to scrap the 10 p tax rate .
Outgoing Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin is pushing for action in December on a plan to offer free , pornography - free wireless Internet service to all Americans , despite objections from the wireless industry and some consumer groups .
At its December meeting , the FCC could also consider new rules designed to speed up consideration of disputes between independent cable programmers and cable providers such as Time Warner Cable Inc. and Comcast Corp. , which either refuse to carry some channels or put them ...
In the world Islamic fundamentalism , most of us believe that terrorism is brought about by religious bias .
But the terrorist might in fact have an economic motive .
It is abundantly clear that he who risks and often sacrifices his own life in the very act of creating terror does not have a personal economic motive however it is likely that he is motivated to destroy economies .
Wealth , abundance and prosperity after all symbolize the ‘ evil ’ that the Islamist sees as an adversary .
Terrorist attacks occur almost daily in larger and smaller numbers impacting civilians all over the world ( Terrorism Research Center ) however it is the large scale attacks in major global financial centers that leave the world reeling in shock .
An attack on a town in Afghanistan , Gujarat or Dagestan is quickly forgotten as people resume their daily lives the next day .
But an attack on New York or London destabilizes the country ’s entire economic machine for several days , leaving its citizens and those elsewhere in the world fearful and helpless .
When the major financial center is Mumbai , the nerve center of an economy that is growing at 9 % per annum , the terrorist ’s motive is greater .
Perhaps because economic growth in a country with which a terrorist can ethnically identify , is a telling sign that the threads of ‘ evil ’ have become deeply ingrained within his own people .
BBC released a documentary in 2005 entitled “ The Power of Nightmares . ”
It outlines the history of the Neo-Conservative movement in America and interestingly enough it shows how Al - Qaeda and the Neo-Conservatives were rooted in the same ideology : that the economic prosperity of the West represented a decline of social values .
For the Neo-Cons this spurred a desire to create state terror in the guise of war .
For Al - Qaeda it spurred a desire to declare war in the guise of terror .
I put the question out to to several people this week after the terror attacks on Mumbai .
Mona M. from Hong Kong ’s answer summarized most people ’s responses :
“ Terrorism is perpetrated by those who have no hope for a better life in the future hence it is in my view largely caused by economics .
As much of a capitalist that I am , the openly widening gulf between the rich and poor causes jealously especially for the majority of the poor who have no access to free and good health care and schooling .
This jealousy in extreme cases leads to violence and terrorism is just one form .
I suppose this gap has always existed but it has been private while now with mass media it is open for all to see .
Unless we see a bigger trickle down effect I think terrorism will continue to spread . ”

9/11 : A Clear Case for Economic Terrorism
The 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center are probably the most lucid example of the Islamic terrorist ’s mindset against economic prosperity .
The World Trade Center in New York symbolized the economic prosperity of the West at its peak .
New York City is home to the stock exchange and the Twin Towers were home to the top investment banks and financial companies of America .
The very machine of the U.S. economy that infiltrated the homes and livliehood of people across the nation .
A report to Congress estimated that 130,000 people lost jobs due to the 9/11 terror attacks on the World Trade Center .
Several industries faced very strong negative effects after 9/11 , especially in the airline , hotel and insurance industries .
Approximately 18,000 businesses were affected by the 9/11 attacks and because of New York City ’s huge losses , the city was provided aid of $ 11.2 billion for debris removal , $ 5 billion for economic development incentives , and $ 5.5 billion for infrastructure projects .
Disaffected Societies In India Engender Home Grown and Imported Terrorism
Recently , India has been the focus of the global media : its economic leaps and bounds , the emergence of its consumerist middle class , and its status as one of the last frontiers for luxury conglomerates looking to consolidate their recent gains .
However , in a land of glaring paradoxes , the rich get richer in spite of and often at the cost of a disaffected underclass .
In India , this disaffected underclass includes an often neglected Muslim community : economically disenfranchised and increasingly radicalized .
The roots of terror are not always clearly defined .
However even if they come from the outside , incidents are often successful due to internal abetting , most often by marginalized communities .
Mumbai represents lucre and transaction as Suketu Mehta said in his New York Times Op - Ed yesterday .
Hotels such as the terror - struck Taj and Oberoi - Trident are the extended living rooms of Mumbai ’s upper classes .
This is where India ’s top industrialists strike deals and where foreign businesses set up shop as they plan to invest millions in the promise of India .
The J.W. Marriott which escaped a terror mission to be razed to rubble , is home to the Bollywood community .
The ongoing terrorist assault on Mumbai indicates that sustaining economic growth cannot be accomplished without bringing all of its citizens on board , including , most importantly , its disaffected Muslim underclass .
The fact that India has had a history of war followed by ongoing tension with poor neighbor Pakistan ( a key player in America ’s war on terror as well ) does not help either .
Although the differences between India and Pakistan originally stemmed from religious ideology , today they are perhaps more about socio-economics .
The terrorists responsible for last week ’s Mumbai attacks are believed to have hailed from Pakistan .
Yet rather than having an anti-Hindu agenda , they clearly targeted Mumbai ’s elite , its Economic landmarks and its American and British tourists .
You might might argue that the Jewish targets were driven by religious fanaticism but consider the fact that the terrorists had targeted them based upon their research that they would be there for a diamond trading conference .
For the terrorists , the Jewish community represents economic success perhaps as much as religious differences .
Similar to 9/11 , the Mumbai terrorist attacks struck India ’s tourist industry at the start of peak season , compounding problems for airlines and hotels that were already facing the slowest growth in visitor numbers in five years .
How Do We Curtail Terrorism Without Curtailing Economic Progress ?
And this really is the key question .
As an ambitious race that aims to better itself with each generation , economic progress will always be our agenda .
Vineet A of Mumbai says we should “ remove the incentive to become a terrorist by educating people , removing poverty , have a fair and fast judicial system , countries and governments should stop oppressing people for unjust reasons . ”
Or is to “ dream bigger , make even more money , and visit Mumbai more than ever ” as Suketu Mehta of New York says .

Congrats to FCC.gov on five years without an update
Congratulations are in order for the FCC , which today celebrates five years since it last updated its online docket search system , ECFS .
If you look at the bottom of the main search page , you will see the mark of this amazing feat : “ updated 12/11/03 ” .
In internet years that like a century .
Kudos !
Yesterday at the Cato Institute panel on online transparency ( video forthcoming here ) I laid into the FCC for being an agency that ’s supposed to be tech savvy , but that continues to have an online presence that is absolutely abysmal .
Their docketing system is the agency ’s lifeblood and yet there is no full - text search , there are no data feeds , and their robots .
txt file is set to exclude search crawlers .
This is totally unacceptable and I hope a tech - savvy Obama FCC will revamp the site .
Today the Washington Post features Google ’s push to modernize government sites to allow it and other commercial search engines to index those sites :
[ T ]he U.S. government , one of the world ’s largest depositories of data , has been unwilling or unable to make millions of its Web pages accessible [ to search engines ] .
“ The vast majority of information is still not searchable or findable either because it ’s not published or it ’s on Web sites which the government has put up which no one can index , ” Google chief executive Eric Schmidt said during a recent presentation at the New America Foundation .
…
Today , a wide array of public information remains largely invisible to the search engines , and therefore to the general public , because it is held in such a way that the Web search engines of Google , Yahoo and Microsoft ca n’t find it and index it .
Not surprisingly , Yahoo and Microsoft officials agree that people would be better served if more public information became accessible to their search engines .
While an Obama administration could help solve this problem administratively by implementing Google ’s sitemap scheme , Congress could also mandate that agencies make their data searchable .
That ’s exactly one of the thing that the Joe Lieberman - sponsored E- Government Reauthorization
Act of 2007 would do .
Take your pick , just give us the data !
THE evidence suggests that homosexual behaviour is partly genetic .
Studies of identical twins , for example , show that if one of a pair ( regardless of sex ) is homosexual , the other has a 50 % chance of being so , too .
That observation , though , raises a worrying evolutionary question : how could a trait so at odds with reproductive success survive the ruthless imperatives of natural selection ?
Various answers have been suggested .
However , they all boil down to the idea that the relatives of those who are gay gain some advantage that allows genes predisposing people to homosexual behaviour to be passed on collaterally .
One proposal is that the help provided by maiden aunts and bachelor uncles in caring and providing for the children of their brothers and sisters might suffice .
That seems unlikely to be the whole story ( the amount of help needed to compensate would be huge ) , though it might be a contributory factor .
The other idea , since there is evidence that male homosexuals , at least , are more likely than average to come from large families , is that the genes for gayness bring reproductive advantage to those who have them but are not actually gay themselves .
Originally , the thought was that whichever genes make men gay might make women more fecund , and possibly vice versa .
Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research in Brisbane , Australia , and his colleagues have , however , come up with a twist on this idea .
In a paper to be published soon in Evolution and Human Behavior , they suggest the advantage accrues not to relatives of the opposite sex , but to those of the same one .
They think that genes which cause men to be more feminine in appearance , outlook and behaviour and those that make women more masculine in those attributes , confer reproductive advantages as long as they do not push the individual possessing them all the way to homosexuality .
The straight truth
Other evidence does indeed show that homosexuals tend to be “ gender atypical ” in areas beside their choice of sexual partner .
Gay men often see themselves as being more feminine than straight men do , and , mutatis mutandis , the same is true for lesbians .
To a lesser extent , homosexuals tend to have gender - atypical careers , hobbies and other interests .
Personality tests also show differences , with gay men ranking higher than straight men in standardised tests for agreeableness , expressiveness , conscientiousness , openness to experience and neuroticism .
Lesbians tend to be more assertive and less neurotic than straight women .
There are also data which suggest that having a more feminine personality might indeed give a heterosexual male an advantage .
Though women prefer traditionally macho men at the time in their menstrual cycles when they are most fertile , at other times they are more attracted to those with feminine traits such as tenderness , considerateness and kindness , as well as those with feminised faces .
The explanation usually advanced for this is that macho men will provide the sperm needed to make sexy sons , but the more feminised phenotype makes a better carer and provider — in other words an ideal husband .
And , despite all the adultery and cuckoldry that goes on in the world , it is the husband who fathers most of the children .
As far as masculinised women are concerned , less research has been done on the advantages that their appearance and behaviour might bring .
What data there are , however , suggest they tend to have more sexual partners than highly feminised women do .
That may , Dr Zietsch speculates , reflect increased competitiveness or a willingness to engage in unrestrained sexual relations ( ie , to behave in a male - like way ) that other women do not share .
Dr Zietsch and his colleagues tested their idea by doing a twin study of their own .
They asked 4,904 individual twins , not all of them identical , to fill out anonymous questionnaires about their sexual orientation , their gender self - identification and the number of opposite - sex partners they had had during the course of their lives .
( They used this figure as a proxy for reproductive fitness , since modern birth - control techniques mask actual reproductive fitness . )
The rules of attraction
Their first observation was that the number of sexual partners an individual claimed did correlate with that individual ’s “ gender identity ” .
The more feminine a man , the more masculine a woman , the higher the hit rate with the opposite sex — though women of all gender identities reported fewer partners than men did .
( This paradox is normal in such studies .
It probably reflects either male boasting or female bashfulness , but though it affects totals it does not seem to affect trends . )
When the relationships between twins were included in the statistical analysis ( all genes in common for identical twins ; a 50 % overlap for the non-identical ) the team was able to show that both atypical gender identity and its influence on the number of people of the opposite sex an individual claimed to have seduced were under a significant amount of genetic control .
More directly , the study showed that heterosexuals with a homosexual twin tend to have more sexual partners than heterosexuals with a heterosexual twin .
According to the final crunching of the numbers , genes explain 27 % of an individual ’s gender identity and 59 % of the variation in the number of sexual partners that people have .
The team also measured the genetic component of sexual orientation and came up with a figure of 47 % — more or less the same , therefore , as that from previous studies .
The idea that it is having fecund relatives that sustains homosexuality thus looks quite plausible .
Tina Brown : Bush 's endless ' debacles ' made him ' punch drunk ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday November 19 , 2008
Print This Email This
As the last days of George W. Bush 's presidency wind down , it is becoming clear that he expects to leave the urgent problems of his final months for the incoming Obama administration to sort out .
Tina Brown , editor of the journalism and celebrity gossip site , The Daily Beast , appeared on Tuesday 's Rachel Maddow Show with guest host Alison Stewart to speculate about what might be going through Bush 's mind .
" I do feel right now that he 's very stunned , " Brown suggested .
" I think that the financial collapse was one debacle , one disaster that he honestly did n't anticipate .
...
And so he has to recognize he 's going out in a cloud of disaster .
And I think that 's really almost paralyzing him .
I feel he 's fading , he 's becoming the invisible man as we look at him . "
" At this point , Bush has had so many disasters on his watch , " stated Brown , " that I honestly get the sense that this is not a president who 's looking back in a mellow fashion on his presidency -- or even feeling that he has busy things to do -- so much as a president who 's kind of punch - drunk , really , with a series of debacles which even he -- in his great sort of denial and his refusal to really accept his own failures -- has to accept at this point has been a , really a chapter of hideous accidents , if you want to be charitable about it . "
" One of the things that I 'm told at the moment , " Brown noted , " is that Bush is entirely focused right now on his ' legacy . ' ...
All he really wants to talk about is his library , because he wants to build a legacy .
But you know , quite honestly , one can only think of that library as almost like a Halloween house of horror ... from the Guantanamo room to the Abu Ghraib room to the Hurricane Katrina room . "
Brown concluded by commenting with regard to Laura Bush 's proposed memoirs that " Laura really wants to pop .
Laura is fed up with being silent , and she will have things to say . "

Easy and fun to shoot .
Terrific for target shooting varmint hunting , or as a home defense weapon .
Fires “ easy - to - get ” ammo .
Best of all : it ’s literally a Rosco !
Now all you need is something for target practice .
Well , this is the sort of magazine that also sells live monkeys , so put two and two together .
Dear Mr. Zinn ,
I was surprised and disappointed to read your recent comments opposing the immediate need for 9/11 truth .
Perhaps you 've been misquoted .
I certainly hope so .
Did you state that after a mere 7 years , the unsolved mass murder
of thousands of people on 9/11 is simply a thing of the " past " ?
That the still reverberating significance of that horrific day has
" no practical political significance " ?
Did you actually proclaim , Mr. Zinn , that after just 86 months , this nightmarish , Earth - shattering and still very current event , should be relegated to some stale historical record ?
Apparently , 9/11 happened so long ago that you 've forgotten that it
led to some tragic , and very current , circumstances .
As a refresher , 9/11 led to :
of 4,000 + U.S. and other soldiers , and the murder of over 1 million Iraqi soldiers and civilians .
~ the trampling of our Constitutional Rights ...
~ the economy - destroying military spending to support these illegal wars ...
~ and on and on ... all of which continue to this present moment ...
If investigating the cause of these present day tragedies is not the " most important " thing we can do , then pray tell Mr. Zinn , what is ?
Are you really suggesting that only 2,637 days after this atrocity ripped open a gaping , still unhealed wound in the Heart of America ( and much of the world ) , we simply slap a patch on it and move on ?
If so , go meet with the thousands of 9/11 family members and tell them that , sir .
Share it with the heroic 9/11 first responders , who are , to this second , sick or dying as a result of breathing toxic dust while bravely performing their duty on that black day .
Tell it to the parents in New York City , whose children today have lung illnesses , because they were told by their government that the air was safe to breath during the days following 9/11 .
Gather the thousands of Iraqi orphans together , as well as all the children of every nation , and tell them a bedtime story about how investigating the truth of 9/11 , and preventing future false - flag events , future wars , have no immediate importance to them .
And please , Mr Zinn , while sharing your opinions with these people about how archaic 9/11 is , make sure you look them in the eyes .
Then notice how much 9/11 is in the " past " to them .

Last month in San Francisco an elementary - school teacher named Arien O’Connell ran the fast time at the Nike Women ’s Marathon .
But because she did n’t run in the elite group , she was n’t recognized as the winner .
After a few days of embarrassment , Nike retreated and called O’Connell “ a winner , ” but the damage was done .
Most of it , anyway .
Thursday afternoon , representatives of Reebok visited the Children Charter School in Brooklyn .
They gave O’Connell free shoes every month for a year , T - shirts for her class and $ 2,500 to the school .
They also gave her a trophy — the F.U.N. Award — recognizing her as the “ winner and heroine of non-elite runners everywhere . ”
F.U.N .
Are we correct about what that stands for , with the N being “ Nike ” ?

Whether the house has structural damage .
Almost !
It 's essential that you determine if there is any structural damage to the property and if there is , how bad the damage is .
You should n't squat in a home with too much damage as that is unsafe .
You should also avoid properties that are condemned .
While these factors are important to keep in mind , there are also other criteria you should consider .
Pick another answer !
What the indoor temperature of the house is .
You 're partially right !
Once you first enter a property , pay attention to the temperature inside .
If the house is cold inside when it 's warm outside , or vice versa , it might be a better property to squat in than others .
This is correct , but there are also other things you should consider about the house .
Try again ...
Whether the home has running water .
You 're not wrong , but there 's a better answer !
Most properties with a well will continue to have running water after the valid owner leaves the home .
These are ideal houses to squat in , because you wo n't have to turn on a water bill to use the water .
Try another answer ...
Whether the house still has electricity running .
Close !
Sometimes an owner will leave a property before the electricity has formally turned off .
While working electricity is often temporary until you put the utility in your name , you can take advantage of the opportunity to have working air and lights .
However , there are other aspects of a property to consider before you decide to squat there .

Stuff like this is exactly what you hope will happen when you go to a concert .
Prince has been saying some pretty goofy stuff lately , but he ’s still Prince , and you ’d have to be lacking heavily in signs of life to not lose your head if he jumped onstage , unannounced , guitar - in - hand , at a show where he was n’t on the bill , like he did this November at Q - Tip ’s show at the Las Vegas House of Blues .
Pretty cool , but made far cooler by the fact that apparently , the stunt was n’t arranged beforehand , Prince just decided to crash the performance .
According to DJ Scratch , who ’s on tour with Q - Tip , no one had any idea this would happen .
" Yo , while me and Q - Tip were performing " Vivrant Thing " in Vegas last night … this n-a Prince walked out on the stage , took the guitar from our guitar player and just started rocking ! "
Scratch told MissInfo.tv .
" None of us knew he was there until he popped up on the stage … then the n-a vanished like Batman , LOL !
The sound crew said Prince was in the balcony watching the show from the very beginning ( the balcony was closed off ) .
Then when " Vivrant Thing " came out , he just came backstage and walked out onstage . "
Like Batman indeed .

Franken campaign officials said Saturday that Coleman officials are trying to " deprive Minnesota voters of their civil rights . "
Andy Barr , Franken 's communications director , said in a statement : " Ever since the routine process of canvassing to ensure that every vote is counted began , the Coleman campaign has been attempting to obstruct it .
And , in typical fashion , they have now gone to court to shut down the count .
This stealth attack on an early Saturday morning is a disgusting attempt to disenfranchise voters who did nothing wrong , and we will fight hard on behalf of Minnesotans who deserve to have their voices heard . "
So far it is n't working but Coleman has made it perfectly clear that he does n't agree with Al Franken that every single legally cast vote must be counted .
He 's demanded that the state stop counting the ballots sent in by our brave soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines stationed overseas .
These Republicans should all be horsewhipped !
Why is he so hysterical ?
Easy : his tiny 700 vote lead has now shrunk to a 221 advantage and it keeps getting tinier and tinier as counties recheck their numbers and scrutinize each ballot .
If Coleman is prevented from his anti-democratic tactics of getting votes thrown out and disenfranchising more people -- a GOP specialty -- he looks like he 's headed to certain -- and well - deserved -- defeat .
A huge number of undervotes -- votes registered for the presidential race but not for the Senate race -- occurred in three counties , which are all Democratic Party strongholds : Hennepin , Ramsey and St. Louis counties .
Coleman will sue over every vote and hope he winds up with a partisan right wing judge to rule in his favor .
His goal , of course , is to get the case into the most ideologically extremist court in the country , the horrid Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals , which has jurisdiction over Minnesota .
It 's a classic case of a repulsive stacked court .
Bush appointed 7 of its 11 members -- all far right loons -- and 2 of the other 4 are also GOP - appointed extremists .
There 's no chance Minnesota voters would get a fair shake in this Torquemada - like excuse for a court .
Expect him to eventually claim that Minnesota 's Secretary of State , Mark Ritchie , stole the election for Franken .
Anyone who knows Norm Coleman knows one thing for sure : the man has no honor , no dignity and is the Senate 's biggest cheat .
Franken may not be a real progressive like Jeff Merkley but he will be a reasonable moderate with an open mind a far cry from the knee - jerk conservative Coleman has proven himself to be .
And with Jon Kyl already vowing to use the filibuster to block Obama 's program , it is more crucial than every to make sure that if Coleman goes back to Washington , it 's as a K Street lobbyist and not as a senator .

This is the tenth post in an article series about MIT 's lecture course " Introduction to Algorithms . "
In this post I will review lecture fifteen , which introduces the concept of Dynamic Programming and applies it to the Longest Common Subsequence problem .
Dynamic programming is a design technique similar to divide and conquer .
Divide - and - conquer algorithms partition the problem into independent subproblems , solve the subproblems recursively , and then combine their solutions to solve the original problem .
Dynamic programming is applicable when the subproblems are not independent , that is , when subproblems share subsubproblems .
A dynamic - programming algorithm solves every subsubproblem just once and then saves its answer in a table , thereby avoiding the work of recomputing the answer every time the subsubproblem is encountered .
Dynamic programming was systematized by Richard E. Bellman .
He began the systematic study of dynamic programming in 1955 .
The word " programming , " both here and in linear programming , refers to the use of a tabular solution method and not to writing computer code .
Dynamic programming is typically applied to optimization problems .
In such problems there can be many possible solutions .
Each solution has a value , and we want to find a solution with the optimal ( minimum or maximum ) value .
We call such a solution an optimal solution , as opposed to the optimal solution , since there may be several solutions that achieve the optimal value .
Dynamic programming can be effectively applied to solve the longest common subsequence ( LCS ) problem .
The problem is stated as following : given two sequences ( or strings ) x and y find a maximum - length common subsequence ( substring ) of x and y .
For example , given two sequences x = " ABCBDAB " and y = " BDCABA " , the LCS ( x , y ) = { " BCBA " , " BDAB " , " BCAB " } .
As you can see there are several optimal solutions .
Lecture fifteen introduces dynamic programming via this longest common subsequence problem .
It first gives a brute - force , exponential time algorithm for solving it .
The idea of algorithm is to check every subequence of x [ 1..m ] ( m is the length of sequence x ) to see if it is also a subsequence of y [ 1..n ] ( n is the length of sequence y ) .
Checking takes O( n ) time , and there are 2 m subsequences of x .
The running time thus is exponential O ( n· 2 m ) .
It is no good for large sequences and the lecture continues with a simplification - let 's look at the length of a longest - common subseq and then extend this algorithm to find the LCS itself .
The simplified algorithm is recursive in nature and computes the same subproblems .
At this moment two dynamic programming hallmarks are stated :
1. Optimal substructure : an optimal solution to a problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems .
: an optimal solution to a problem contains optimal solutions to subproblems .
2 . Overlapping subproblems : a recursive solution contains a " small " number of distinct subproblems repeated many times .
As the subproblems are overlapping , the lecture introduces concept of memoization algorithm ( note that it 's not memorization ) .
A better known word for memoization is caching .
The subproblems are cached ( memoized ) so that they are not recomputed over and over again .
The lecture ends with constructing a dynamic programming table for LCS problem and explains how to find a LCS from this table .

Well , thanks to one company , RFID 's are growing in range .
GAO
Tek had developed an RFID with an impressively long read - range of up to eight meters .
The device can be easily attached to any metal surface either mechanically or by using industrial adhesives .
Of course , as you probably guessed by that statement , you are more likely to find this device on Fido 's tag then in his body .
After all , you need to be safe when you are inserting things into any living being .
There are also several other version of the tag in development which can be attached to non-metal surfaces .
All of them were developed for commercial applications and not human use .
Those models are still in the lab versions .
The game has changed .
Every day that passes brings more evidence of a rapid slowdown in the world economy .
To meet that there will , and should be , a strong policy response not just from the main developed world economies but from the emerging markets too .
So there will be tax cuts here and elsewhere , and there will be further cuts in interest rates around the world too .
There is no dispute about any of that .
There is however a serious debate about the scale of what should be done .
You can always puff up economies for a few months with such policies , but the more you artificially boost them in the short term , the greater the problems a few years down the line .
You can buy growth now but have to pay for it later .
You can see this most clearly by looking at the US during the two Bush administrations .
The US bought its way out of the early 2000s downturn by cutting interest rates below the rate of inflation and giving large tax breaks .
For a while the economy did fine , or so it seemed .
But it was at the cost of creating an unsustainable housing boom and the build - up of huge debts by individuals and government alike .
The private sector misbehaved of course , but it was the administrations that created the circumstances for it to do so .
The US as a whole is weaker as a result .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
We are in somewhat of that position here right now .
There will be tax cuts and additional spending , to be announced in the pre-Budget report next Monday , but the scale and detail of the package is apparently not yet fixed .
It seems that Alistair Darling is resisting pressure from Gordon Brown for a bigger boost , financed by yet more borrowing .
This can be played up into a clash between Chancellor and Prime Minister and there doubtless is some tension .
But then there should be some tension between the two offices .
The custodian of the nation 's finances has a different constitutional role from that of the leader of the government .
My instinct here is that the judgement of the Chancellor is likely to be more right than that of the Prime Minister .
The Treasury has , after all , to find the money and given the record of Gordon Brown over the past few years , I suspect that he would be more trusted than his predecessor by the world 's financial markets .
There are at least three different reasons for concern about the scale of the boost that the Government is preparing .
The first is international .
Trust is vital and there is a danger of a systemic loss of confidence in British financial management .
Already sterling has fallen by as much as it did in 1992 when it was ejected from the ERM .
We are going into this downturn with an exceptionally high budget deficit of around 4 per cent of GDP and that could rise to 6 per cent or more in the next financial year .
It is plausible that the deficit could be even greater proportionately than the deficit run up by the Tories in the early 1990s .
The money has to be borrowed from the international financial community – there are not enough savings in Britain to do it .
At some price a sovereign state ( with the possible exception of Iceland ) can always borrow , but the rates will reflect the risk , and the danger is long - term sterling rates rise sharply .
Second , there is the practical need to keep something in reserve .
If you fire all your shots now , you are out of ammunition if they do n't hit the target .
Imagine a situation in the autumn of next year .
We will be in the pits of the downturn .
Interest rates will be down to 2 per cent or below .
There will have been a temporary tax hand - back but the end of that will be in sight .
House prices will still be falling and the economy will still be shrinking .
And there will be nothing else that the Government can do .
We may not get there and let 's all hope we do n't but we cannot be certain that this recession will be short , or that there wo n't be a second leg to it after the initial downturn .
That is what happened to Japan in the early 1990s .
It cut rates to near zero and had a huge public spending programme .
Initially it did avoid a recession but at the cost of a deep one in the late 1990s and another in the early 2000s .
Now it has debts of 180 per cent of GDP ( against our 40 - 50 per cent ) and is back in recession again .
Third , we do n't want to make the mistake of America in the early 2000s of failing to make the essential adjustments that a recession forces on us .
We have to save more .
As individuals we have to do it , and people actually are making quite a bit of progress to that end .
We are no longer , for example , taking out the equity of our homes and using it to support consumption .
That change has been forced on us by the mortgage famine but makes sense anyway .
Companies are having to cut back , savagely in financial services and other vulnerable industries , including newspapers .
And yesterday 's statement by the Leader of the Opposition acknowledges that government will have to drive up its efficiency too .
It sounds harsh to say it and I do n't mean it to be so , but recessions , slowdowns , squeezes , however you describe them , do serve a purpose .
They force efficiency .
They force our whole society to figure out simpler and more effective ways of doing things .
Increasing efficiency is the only way our whole society – not just a few talented or cunning individuals – gets richer .
Why is Germany the world 's largest goods exporter ?
Because its companies have lived through the fire , first of a high deutschemark and then joining the euro at too high a rate .
Again and again the pressure on them has forced them to lift their game .
In an ideal world such pressure would be gradual and continuous .
In the real world it comes from periods of harsh economic competition such as occur during a recession .
It wo n't be a bundle of fun and people who are caught in the headwinds need to be supported by society as a whole .
But the reward from the harsh period we are now entering is that we will emerge as a more efficient society , and I would hope a more equitable one too .

( CNN ) --
A severely disfigured woman received the nose , cheeks , upper jaw and facial tissue from a female cadaver in the first near - total face transplant in the United States , the woman 's surgeon said Wednesday .
Cleveland Clinic doctors replaced 80 percent of a woman 's face two weeks ago in the first such U.S. surgery .
The 22 - hour face surgery was completed two weeks ago by a team of eight surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic .
The patient had severe deformity in the middle of her face and was missing her right eye and upper jaw , the Cleveland Clinic doctors said .
She could not taste or smell , and she had trouble speaking .
Dr. Maria Siemionow , the head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland , Ohio , hospital , said many people are " hiding from society because they 're afraid to walk to the grocery stores ; they 're afraid to go to streets because they 're called names and humiliated . "
" Our patient was called names , and our patient was humiliated , " she said .
" We very much hope for this special group of patients , there is hope , and one day they will be able to go comfortably from their houses and enjoy the things which we take for granted . "
The patient is doing well , the doctors said .
Interactive : More details of the surgery »
Details about the recipient , including her name and age , were withheld at her request .
In the surgery , 80 percent of the woman 's face was transplanted .
The forehead and chin were left intact .
In this transplant , tissue from the donor 's face was shaped and fitted into position .
Multiple layers of tissue , bone , muscles and blood vessels , nerve grafts and each artery and vein were connected .
Watch an explanation about face transplants »
" Our hope is she should be able to smile again , " said Dr. Frank A. Papay , chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the Cleveland Clinic .
With physical therapy , surgeons hope the patient will regain her ability to smell and blink and will have other facial functions .
Larry King Live Dr. Maria Siemionow , the surgeon who transplanted a woman 's face , joins Larry tonight .
Tonight , 9 ET see full schedule »
Siemionow said the patient never saw a photo of the donor and said , " the donor never looks like the recipient .
The recipient never looks like the donor . "
Siemionow had medical and ethical clearance for a full facial transplant since 2004 .
She said it has taken 20 years of research and four years to find the right patient who understood the risks involved .
The doctors ' approach from the beginning was to consider " only patients who are the most disfigured " and had " exhausted all existing procedures , " Siemionow said .
" This patient exhausted all conventional means of reconstruction and is the right patient , " she said .
Watch Dr. Siemionow in the news conference . »
Dr. Eric Kodish , the professor and chairman of the Cleveland Clinic 's Department of Bioethics , said doctors thought she would adhere to medications after the surgery .
" This patient had very robust decision - making capacity , " he said .
Like with all transplants , there is a risk that the recipient 's body could reject the graft .
The doctors say they have n't seen any such signs .
The transplant recipient has to take immune - suppressing drugs for the rest of his or her life to prevent rejection of the donated tissue .
In the past three years , facial transplants have been completed in France and China , but these cases have raised medical and ethical questions .
Read about the first facial transplant
Some candidates for a face transplant are survivors of trauma , such as burn or accident victims , who have exhausted all other reconstructive possibilities .
The recipient in France , Isabelle Dinoire , had been mauled by a dog , and the Chinese man , Li Guoxing , was attacked by a bear .
Both received major facial disfigurements .
In 2007 , a French team performed the third partial facial transplant on a man who was disfigured by a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face .
Watch a 2006 report about China 's first face transplant
Guo Shuzhong , the face transplant doctor who handled Li's case , confirmed to CNN that he died in July of unknown causes .
Li last visited the hospital in summer 2007 , and he stayed in his hometown in Yunnan province .
The doctor told CNN that Li had a checkup in a small hospital in his hometown three weeks before his death but that no health problems had been found .
Watch an ITN report about the Li's case
The facial transplants in France and China generated much controversy as questions arose about whether the patients were adequately vetted and informed about the risks .
Those procedures have been " under an ethical cloud , " said David Young , a professor of plastic surgery at the University of California , San Francisco .
The current face transplant patient understood the risk of rejection and of immunosuppressants , doctors said .
Criticism of facial transplants
Critics such as Peter A. Clark , director of the Institute of Catholic Bioethics at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , said a facial transplant introduces unnecessary risks for a procedure that is not a matter of life and death .
" With something like a liver or kidney transplant , it 's a life or death transplant , " Clark said .
" Even with a kidney or liver [ transplant ] , you have to be put on immunosuppressants with serious side effects . "
Bioethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan , chairman of the University of Pennsylvania 's Medical Ethics Department , said Wednesday on CNN's " American Morning " that he initially had similar qualms about the facial transplant , which improves the quality of a life rather than saving it , but was gradually convinced .
People with major facial disfigurements " do n't come out and basically stay at home and have a huge suicide rate , " Caplan said .
" They 're really up against it . "
At the news conference Wednesday , Kodish said the transplant had " abundant moral justification " : the face as a personal embodiment as self .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Organ donation myths
He added that people with disfigurements are often isolated and suffer tremendously and that this case was " not cosmetic surgery in any sense . "
Patient 's reaction
Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic said that because the patient has limited vision after the surgery , she has yet to see herself .
" At this point she can't see herself but can feel her face , " Siemionow said .
" She was happy when she could go over her face " and could feel that " she has a nose , she has jaws and has a full face . "
After the surgery , the patient was heavily sedated from being on the breathing machine .
As she was slowly awakening , medical staff members asked her how she was feeling and whether she was comfortable .
" She gave a thumbs up , first indication she was comfortable , " said Dr. Chad Gordon , a fellow at the clinic 's department of plastic surgery .
" She has been speaking to us very slightly .
Most of communication has been through writing . "
Siemionow said the patient will need re-educate her facial motion and need three to six months of nerve regeneration .

Yahoo Inc. said Tuesday that it would lay off at least 10 % of its workforce over the next few months as it grapples with the deepening economic crisis , continuing the Internet pioneer ’s tough run since it spurned a buyout offer from Microsoft Corp .
this year .
With the online advertising market feeling the burn of a drop in consumer spending and tightening credit , Yahoo delivered a lackluster third - quarter report and lowered its revenue forecast for the rest of the year .
Executives said the company was taking steps to ride out a prolonged downturn .
About 1,500 employees will lose their jobs as part of Yahoo ’s plan to slash costs by $ 400 million from its annual expenses of $ 3.9 billion in the next few months .
Yahoo is based in Sunnyvale , Calif. , and also has offices in such cities as Santa Monica , San Francisco and New York .
It declined to say where the cuts would occur .
In addition to trimming its staff , the company is looking for lasting ways to make the company run leaner such as consolidating offices , sending more work overseas and flattening its management structure , Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang told analysts .

The company earned $ 54.3 million , or 4 cents a share , down 64 % from $ 151.3 million , or 11 cents , a year earlier .
Revenue rose 1 % to $ 1.79 billion .
Excluding commissions paid to ad partners , Yahoo ’s revenue was $ 1.32 billion , about $ 50 million below analyst estimates .
President Sue Decker said the company would continue to balance investing in new products with keeping a tight grip on costs .
Yahoo hired consulting firm Bain & Co. last month to evaluate expenses .
“ This is a top - to - bottom review , ” Decker said in an interview .
“ We are looking at everything . ”
This is the second time this year Yahoo has promised mass layoffs to reverse its sliding fortunes , which have dragged its stock price to a 5 1/2 - year low .
Analysts say Yahoo now seems more determined to cut costs than it did in February , when it jettisoned about 1,000 workers only to replace them -- and more -- within a few months .
Yahoo has increased its staff by 1,400 during the last two quarters to 15,200 .

Yahoo ’s shares gained 5 % to $ 12.70 in after - hours trading after the report .
They ended the regular session down 79 cents at $ 12.07 .
It ’s a far cry from the $ 33 a share Microsoft offered in May , points out Anthony Valencia , media analyst for TCW Group in Los Angeles .
Microsoft has since expressed interest in buying only Yahoo ’s search business .
Last week Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer again raised the possibility during remarks at an industry conference but said the two companies were not in discussions .
“ While the credit crisis and precipitous stock market declines are not the fault of Yahoo management , the fact of the matter is that over 1,000 employees who may have been retained by Microsoft are now losing their jobs while shareholders are stuck with a stock price that is 60 % less than what they could have received , ” Valencia said .
Also casting a dark shadow : years of disappointing profit and revenue growth , Motley Fool analyst Rick Munarriz said .
“ It ’s a company that has gotten too fat for its own good and too stagnant for anyone ’s good , ” he said .

Yahoo lowered its 2008 revenue estimate to a range of $ 7.18 billion to $ 7.38 billion , from its forecast three months ago of $ 7.35 billion to $ 7.85 billion .
Its troubles are the latest sign that the credit crunch has spread to Silicon Valley .
Online auctioneer EBay Inc. is cutting 1,600 jobs and a growing number of start - ups are following suit to conserve cash as venture capitalists pull tight the purse strings .
Even free - spending Google Inc. , which dominates the lucrative online advertising business and showers employees with perks such as free food , has reined in expenses .
But Yahoo is far more vulnerable than Google , the Internet search leader , which last week reported a 26 % increase in third - quarter profit .
Yahoo focuses on display advertising , which is harder to sell in an economic downturn than Google ’s text search ads .
Yahoo’s search advertising revenue rose 17 % while display increased just 3 % and ads on Yahoo partners ’ sites fell 10 % .
Yahoo is awaiting the outcome of a Justice Department review of its proposed search advertising partnership with Google , which Yahoo says could add hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue .

Yahoo also has discussed folding AOL into Yahoo with AOL parent Time Warner Inc. taking a minority stake .
Decker would not comment on the talks but said Yahoo would be opportunistic if it found “ the right opportunity . ”

Did you know that today only about 3 percent America ’s original rainforests remain ?
The fate of the world ’s rainforests is n’t much better .
Even though about half of the worlds plant and animal species live in rainforests , over 23 million acres of this land is destroyed each year , driving approximately 50,000 species to extinction every year .
Scientists project that at this rate – thirty acres of trees cut every minute ( the area the size of a football field cut every second ) – a quarter of the world ’s species will be exterminated in the next 50 years .
But the effects of deforestation do n’t stop there .
Here ’s a look at the major ways in which deforestation is impacting our world and our lives today .
Impact on Global Climate
The impact of rainforest deforestation on our climate is twofold .
For our part , deforestation accounts for a staggering 20 percent of all carbon emissions from human activities .
This means 1.5 billion tons of carbon released into the atmosphere each year and an estimated 87 – 130 billion tons by 2100 .
To put it into perspective , this figure is more than the emissions that would result in over 13 years of cumulative global fossil fuel combustion .
Furthermore , on the part of these natural rainforests , contrary to previous research that suggested that they emit a net positive of carbon into the atmosphere , they actually function as carbon sinks .
Slowing deforestation by 50 percent from current levels ( by 2050 ) could save approximately 50 billion tons of carbon from being emitted into the atmosphere – or the equivalent of six years of cumulative global fossil fuel emissions .
Impact on Biodiversity
A majority of the world ’s deforestation activity today takes place in tropical rainforests .
Incidentally , these rainforests are home to the world ’s largest and most diverse species , who , because of their local / endemic distributions will almost certainly be extinct if their habitat is lost .
Not only that , but these rainforests also contain millions of additional species that are either unknown or have yet to be documented , which is an immensly important fact since a substantial number of common but vital medicines and cures used today come from such plants ( many of which have become endangered ) .
Environment News
Service put the extinction rate at 1,000 times the background rate and warned that the rate may climb to 10,000 times the background rate in the next century if nothing is done to prevent deforestation .
Flash Floods , Drought , Land Slides , and Raging Fires
Trees in these rainforests play a vital role in regulating our ecosystem .
However , when they are removed , there are a multitude of largely irreversible consequences .
When the trees are no longer present , they ca n’t absorb the rain water through their roots and evaporate it back into the atmosphere , resulting in a much drier climate , leading most notably to drought .
Additionally , when trees are no longer present to anchor the soil , this causes erosion flooding and landslides .
Finally , these dried forests are much more succeptible to devastating large - scale fires such as the 1997 and 1998 fires that burned millions of acres through Indonesia , Brazil , Columbia , and other places .

Math Under Stress - The Working Memory Key
We 've all had it happen ; you 're sitting in class , hopelessly unprepared because you 've been writing a D&D campaign or plotting ways to take over the world when , out of nowhere , the teacher calls upon you to come to the front the room and solve a math problem .
In front of everyone .
How you respond to that says a lot about you , and ' math anxiety ' may be a real phenomenon , according to a new report in Current Directions in Psychological Science .
University of Chicago psychologist Sian L. Beilock examines some recent research looking at why being stressed about math can result in poor performance in solving problems .
Much of Beilock 's work suggests that working memory is a key component of math anxiety .
Working memory ( also known as short term memory ) , helps us to maintain a limited amount of information at one time , just what is necessary to solve the problem at hand .
Beilock 's findings suggest that worrying about a situation ( such as solving an arithmetic problem in front of a group of people ) takes up the working memory that is available for figuring out the math problem .
The type of working memory involved in solving math problems may be affected by the way the problems are presented .
When arithmetic problems are written horizontally , more working memory resources related to language are used ( solvers usually maintain problem steps by repeating them in their head ) .
However , when problems are written vertically , visuo - spatial ( or where things are located ) resources of working memory are used .
Individuals who solve vertical problems tend to solve them in a way similar to how they solve problems on paper .
Beilock wanted to know if stereotype - induced stress ( i.e. reminding women of the stereotype that " girls ca n't do math " ) would result in different results for solving vertical versus horizontal math problems .
The findings showed that the women who had been exposed to the negative stereotype performed poorly , although only on the horizontal problems ( which rely on verbal working memory ) .
Beilock suggests that the stereotype creates an inner monologue of worries , which relies heavily on verbal working memory .
Thus , there is insufficient verbal working memory available to solve the horizontal math problems .
It has generally been shown that the more working memory capacity a person has , the better their performance on academic tasks such as problem solving and reasoning .
To further explore this , Beilock and her colleagues compared math test scores in individuals who had higher levels of working memory with those who had less .
The subjects took a math test either in a high pressure situation or low pressure situation .
It turns out that the subjects with higher working memory levels performed very poorly during the high pressure testing situation — that is , the subjects with the greatest capacity for success were the most likely to " choke under pressure " .
Beilock surmises that individuals with higher levels of working memory have superior memory and computational capacity , which they use on a regular basis to excel in the classroom .
" However , if these resources are compromised , for example , by worries about the situation and its consequences , high working memory individuals ' advantage disappears , " Beilock explains .
As more schools start emphasizing state - exam based curricula , these studies will become increasingly relevant and important for the development of exams and training regimens that will ensure optimal performance , especially by the most promising students .
A man cut off his own head with a chainsaw in a carefully thought out suicide because he was " irrationally opposed " to leaving his repossessed home , an inquest heard today .
David Phyall , 50 , had consumed a small quantity of alcohol but no drugs , and arranged the chainsaw in such a way as to facilitate his suicide .

His elderly parents John and Jean Phyall raised the alarm when they could not contact their son in his ground floor housing association flat in Bishopstoke , Hampshire , on 5 July this year .
Police were called and they broke in asking the parents to stay outside .
Sergeant Mark Carter said he found Mr Phyall in the lounge with blood spattering the walls , floor and a cabinet .
Central Hampshire deputy coroner Simon Burge said to the officer : " It must have been a huge shock to you . "
Sgt Carter replied : " In some ways it was sir . "
The hearing heard that the block where Mr Phyall had his flat was to be demolished and despite great efforts from his housing association , he had refused 11 offers of alternative accommodation .
Eventually it had gone to court to repossess the property .
At the time of his death Mr Phyall , who had suffered from mental illness and attempted suicide before , was the only person living in the 1960s block with the rest of the properties boarded up .
Recording a verdict of suicide , Mr Burge said First Wessex Housing Group had done all they could to help Mr Phyall but he was " irrationally opposed to moving " .
" In the 15 years I have been sitting as a deputy coroner , this is the most bizarre case I can recall , " Mr Burge said .

America ’s state divisions are exceedingly important in national politics .
They determine presidents by their electoral votes .
Each gets two Senators regardless of their population , and larger divisions within the union are often seen as a “ red state / blue state ” dichotomy .
It is difficult to measure the political attitudes of an area like a state .
Major American polling organizations rarely if ever divide their national data up by state .
Trying to put together a patchwork of state polls is problematic as well , because the polls are done by different criteria in different places .
State legislation provides a hint to public attitudes , but individual laws vary wildly between states .
Also , American federalism tends to put more emphasis on national laws , or on local laws for other issues , so state laws often do n’t really determine an issue , or show what the state would do if there were not a federal statute already in place .
However , there is one clear way to see a state ’s political attitudes : their senators .
Senators are voted for directly in statewide fall elections .
They cast votes on any Congressional bills .
They also have six - year terms , and have a strong statistical trend of incumbents being re-elected , which makes them less susceptible to small shifts in the electorate and more representative of a state ’s long - term views .
Also , since each state gets two , a state with relatively equal Republican and Democratic blocs will tend to have a senator from each party , while states with a clear preference for a party tend to have two senators from that party .
Plotting all fifty states on - screen would be a visual mess .
However , using the controls below , you can pick any combination of states to display on the chart .
These readings are based on their senators ’ opinions , NOT on the general public opinion at any given time within the state .
This might make some of the readings seem surprising .
For instance , many states which are considered “ battleground ” states in the 2008 general election actually have two senators of the same party and / or two senators with similar voting records , pushing their reading away from the middle and toward a more “ red ” or “ blue ” position .
The senators ’ views ( the actual reading ) often correlate with the public opinion in the state , making this chart an interesting way to look at state opinions .
Bear in mind that this will not always be the case .
ROVER stares up at you , apparently yearning for a pat on the head .
But behind those endearing doggy eyes , his mind is whirring , recalling the excitement of yesterday ’s walk : long grass , a sloping field falling away into woodland and a rabbit running for safety .
With a gentle wag of his tail , he smiles at the memory , then wonders if he ’s got time for a nap before today ’s outing .
An animal could n’t do that , could it ?
For most of us , the instinctive answer is no : the ability to reconstruct past events in our mind and imagine ourselves in future scenarios is something we can do , but other creatures cannot .
And yet , while there is no evidence that dogs can think in this way , recent studies have suggested that some birds , great apes and a few species in between are not “ stuck in the present ” after all , but may be capable of thinking backwards and forwards in time .
 Some birds , great apes and a few species in between may not be stuck in the present 
The issue is getting researchers of human and animal minds rather hot under the collar .
Critics argue that what looks like memory or forward thinking is nothing more than instinct or learned behaviour , and insist that there is no convincing evidence that non-human animals can remember their past or contemplate the future .
As a result , every paper claiming to demonstrate the ability in animals is fiercely debated .
The idea builds on the work of renowned neuroscientist Endel Tulving , who pioneered the study of human episodic memory – the recall of our autobiographical past .
Tulving wrote in 1983 …
We probably should n’t have been surprised at Vice President Dick Cheney ’s blustering , obstinate insistence on ABC News on Monday that he ’s been right all along about virtually everything .
But that does n’t mean we have to agree .
In the interview , Cheney not only acknowledged that he was involved in approving the harsh interrogation methods used by the CIA on suspected terrorists , but said he still thinks that waterboarding was an appropriate way to extract information .
He said -- contradicting even President Bush -- that he believes the notorious American prison at Guantanamo Bay should remain open for the foreseeable future , and he reiterated that the U.S. invasion of Iraq was justified by , believe it or not , Saddam Hussein ’s weapons programs .
Maybe this was just a desperate , last - minute effort to rescue what appears to be a legacy in deep trouble , but it came across asnothing less than self - delusion .
Despite public opinion polls showing that only about a third of the country believes the U.S. should have invaded Iraq , undaunted by the irrefutable fact that America ’s prestige has plummeted around the world , notwithstanding the outcry by human rights advocates against torture and the fact that there is no meaningful peace in sight in Iraq or Afghanistan , Cheney soldiers on with the same cocky , we know what we ’re doing and laws be damned attitude that has come to define him .
Even though the American electorate rose up last month to sweep out the GOP in an extraordinary rejection of Bush administration policy , he persists in defending eight years of morally and legally disastrous decisions .
Cheney , of course , was a hawkish , self - righteous and , ultimately , malevolent figure in the Bush inner circle from day one .
In “ Angler , ” Barton Gellman ’s excellent analysis of his tenure , he emerges as a man willing to bend virtually any rule , a true believer with “ a sense of mission so acute it drove him to seek power without limit . ”
In Jane Mayer ’s “ The Dark Side , ” he ’s portrayed as pushing his colleagues into ever more morally questionable situations .
“ The most dangerous vice president we ’ve had probably in American history ” is how Vice President - elect Joe Biden accurately described him during the campaign .
Cheney likes to joke about himself that when he told his wife , Lynne , that he had been nicknamed “ Darth Vader , ” she did n’t get angry .
Instead , she responded : “ It humanizes you . ”
With that , we agree .

Abortion
An embryo has no rights .
Rights do not pertain to a potential , only to an actual being .
A child cannot acquire any rights until it is born .
The living take precedence over the not - yet - living ( or the unborn ) .
Abortion is a moral right — which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved ; morally , nothing other than her wish in the matter is to be considered .
Who can conceivably have the right to dictate to her what disposition she is to make of the functions of her own body ?
“ Of Living Death ”
The Voice of Reason , 58–59
Never mind the vicious nonsense of claiming that an embryo has a “ right to life . ”
A piece of protoplasm has no rights — and no life in the human sense of the term .
One may argue about the later stages of a pregnancy , but the essential issue concerns only the first three months .
To equate a potential with an actual , is vicious ; to advocate the sacrifice of the latter to the former , is unspeakable .
. . .
Observe that by ascribing rights to the unborn , i.e. , the nonliving , the anti-abortionists obliterate the rights of the living : the right of young people to set the course of their own lives .
The task of raising a child is a tremendous , lifelong responsibility , which no one should undertake unwittingly or unwillingly .
Procreation is not a duty : human beings are not stock - farm animals .
For conscientious persons , an unwanted pregnancy is a disaster ; to oppose its termination is to advocate sacrifice , not for the sake of anyone ’s benefit , but for the sake of misery qua misery , for the sake of forbidding happiness and fulfillment to living human beings .
“ A Last Survey ”
The Ayn Rand Letter , IV , 2 , 3
If any among you are confused or taken in by the argument that the cells of an embryo are living human cells , remember that so are all the cells of your body , including the cells of your skin , your tonsils , or your ruptured appendix — and that cutting them is murder , according to the notions of that proposed law .
Remember also that a potentiality is not the equivalent of an actuality — and that a human being ’s life begins at birth .
The question of abortion involves much more than the termination of a pregnancy : it is a question of the entire life of the parents .
As I have said before , parenthood is an enormous responsibility ; it is an impossible responsibility for young people who are ambitious and struggling , but poor ; particularly if they are intelligent and conscientious enough not to abandon their child on a doorstep nor to surrender it to adoption .
For such young people , pregnancy is a death sentence : parenthood would force them to give up their future , and condemn them to a life of hopeless drudgery , of slavery to a child ’s physical and financial needs .
The situation of an unwed mother , abandoned by her lover , is even worse .
I cannot quite imagine the state of mind of a person who would wish to condemn a fellow human being to such a horror .
I cannot project the degree of hatred required to make those women run around in crusades against abortion .
Hatred is what they certainly project , not love for the embryos , which is a piece of nonsense no one could experience , but hatred , a virulent hatred for an unnamed object .
Judging by the degree of those women ’s intensity , I would say that it is an issue of self - esteem and that their fear is metaphysical .
Their hatred is directed against human beings as such , against the mind , against reason , against ambition , against success , against love , against any value that brings happiness to human life .
In compliance with the dishonesty that dominates today ’s intellectual field , they call themselves “ pro-life . ”
By what right does anyone claim the power to dispose of the lives of others and to dictate their personal choices ?

The German car manufacturer Audi developed a prototype system that allows traffic lights to communicate with automobiles and with each other .
The invention helps drivers to successfully avoid rush - hour traffic and decrease the level of fuel spent .
The project manager of the Bavaria - based company with headquarters in Ingolstadt , Cornelius Menig stated : " The motivation behind the project is making inner city traffic more efficient .
There will be less waiting at lights , less fuel consumption and less noise . "
The main system is equipped with a module located inside the car as well as a communication unit stored inside the traffic light control .
The signal coming from the traffic light is received with the help of a wireless LAN technology .
Right before it turns green , the system estimates the average speed that is required to get through on that phase .
The process is shown to the driver on a dashboard multimedia interface .
" We show the driver a band between minimum and maximum optimal speed so he or she can ride the green wave .
There is no need to go at a certain speed , so the driver can adapt to the traffic flow .
We think that knowing the appropriate speed will reduce accidents caused by abrupt braking , " said Mr Menig .
It is worth mentioning that Travolution was developed by management experts in Ingolstadt .
To test the system , a network , consisting of 46 smart intelligent lights , has been set in the town .
The traffic lights use a software program that optimizes phasing in order to reduce stopping times .
Currently there are three traffic lights that run a full version of the software program which makes it possible to communicate with specially - modified A5 and A6 Audi Avant .
There 's no need to install the software in all vehicles .
The company considers that there will be considerable benefits in case its invention reaches an adoption level of about 10 percent .
The current estimations show that the intelligent traffic lights decreased stopping at intersections by 17 percent .
The EU Travolution project , estimated at 1.2 million euros ( about $ 1,627,000 ) , has the goal of avoiding the stop - start driving which increases the level of petrol spent and the amount of CO2 emissions .
[ In an impassioned opinion piece , recently published in Game Developer magazine , seminal Parappa co-creator and ' father of music games ' Masaya Matsuura talks about his hopes for the future of games as ' tangible experiences ' with positive feelings attached . ]
At the heart of my involvement with video games , I have always been strongly linked to the " music game " genre .
While this is often said of me , in reality at the end of the day I am first and foremost a musician looking for ways to expand my creative process , but I guess the end result is the same .
When PaRappa the Rapper was in development at the beginning of the 90s , there were hardly any individuals attempting similar things .
After the game 's release in ' 96 , similar titles started to become successful sales - wise , which led to greater variation to the extent that these days , " music games " are recognized as being in a genre of their own .
But I want to say that we are very far from realizing our potential in this industry .
The past 10 years have seen a number of transitions that have taken the sector to its present condition .
I 'm delighted to see that lately music games have seen a great surge of interest in the West , thanks to titles like Guitar Hero , Rock Band and SingStar .
I could n't verify this , but I was told that the Guitar Hero franchise accounted for 20 percent of all game sales in North America last year .
Even if that figure is n't accurate , the sales are still astronomical .
I can only say that this is an amazing thing .
Ten years ago , when PaRappa was big news , developers from Harmonix visited Japan and showed me some interactive music software that they were working on .
I strongly advised them that rather than interactive music software , it had to be a game .
Copycat Curse
The recent success of music games in the West has been based mostly on licensed music .
It is necessary to move beyond this .
The challenge is to discover the next paradigm in which music and games have a positive and complimentary relationship .
I cannot overstate the importance of this .
We are currently wasting our use of music .
Most games these days seem to use gorgeous orchestral soundtracks .
While these large - scale soundtracks may generally be lovely to listen to , if we really think about it , is n't it all a bit lacking in imagination ?
Thinking about it from a simplistic visual perspective , while films are basically just watched , games are interactive .
The duties involved and objectives set are also different , so film and games cannot really be the same .
And yet , music is basically the same in both .
Despite this wonderful opportunity to advance music with this new medium , it seems that new and bold ideas are not encouraged in the current climate .
It 's reasonable to think that unimaginative forms of expression will slowly die out as a new form of entertainment matures .
Just looking at the past 10 years we can see that there have been drastic changes in the way we use music , as the media becomes digital , mobile , and more accessible .
If we do not make great efforts to ensure progressive use of music in representative mediums , such as games , we could be faced with a steep decline .
The history of music games is still very young .
So what is required to ensure the growth of this category ?
Maybe collaborating with cool musicians would be a good start , and I mean really collaborating , not just licensing music from famous artists .
To all the cool musicians , please take note !
I would like you all to dig deep into your own musical expression , and collaborate with other forms in order to extend yourselves .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Stocks soared on Monday , capping the best two - day run since the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash , as the government ’s decision to rescue Citigroup spurred an enormous relief rally .
Dow component Citigroup , the second - largest U.S. bank , surged nearly 60 percent to $ 5.95 and gave one of the biggest lifts to the Dow as the bailout plan eased jittery investors ’ concerns regarding the financial sector .
Last week , Citigroup ’s stock tumbled to its lowest level in about 15 years amid uncertainty over the bank ’s future .
“ The markets love a bailout , ” said Brian Gendreau , investment strategist at ING Investment in New York .
“ It seems to have instilled a bit of confidence in the sector itself . ”
Adding to the optimism , President - elect Barack Obama named his team of economic advisors -- viewed as being favorable for Wall Street .
Obama appointed New York Fed President Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary and Lawrence Summers , who has previously held the Treasury post , as director of the National Economic Council .
The Dow Jones industrial average raced up 396.97 points , or 4.93 percent , to 8,443.39 .
The Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index
jumped 51.78 points , or 6.47 percent , to 851.81 .
The Nasdaq Composite Index leaped 87.67 points , or 6.33 percent , to 1,472.02 .
A RALLY TO REMEMBER
The Dow has advanced 11.8 percent , while the S&P gained 13.2 percent in their best two - day rally since the days following the October 1987 stock market crash .
The government ’s cash infusion for Citi represented the biggest U.S. bank bailout to date , lifting major financial stocks .
JPMorgan Chase rose 21.4 percent to $ 27.58 , while Bank of America surged 27.2 percent to $ 14.59 .
The S&P financial index climbed 18.8 percent in its best one - day percentage gain ever .
Wall Street briefly pared gains after President - elect Barack Obama named his economic team , as expected , but did not offer any specific dollar figures or other new details on a stimulus plan .

On the economic front , U.S. existing home sales fell 3.1 percent in October to an annual rate of 4.98 million units , while the median home price dropped to its lowest in more than four years , according to a report from the National Association of Realtors .
The 11.3 percent drop in the median home price from October 2007 was the largest price decline on record , the NAR said .
Citigroup ’s rescue followed the disappearance this year of major Wall Street firms Bear Stearns Cos and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc , as well as the failure of Washington Mutual Inc , the largest U.S. savings and loan .
In addition to the new capital , Washington effectively guaranteed most of Citi ’s $ 306 billion in losses on high - risk assets .
A Dow Jones index of U.S. home builders ’ stocks shot up 16.6 percent in late Monday afternoon trading .
Volume was active on the New York Stock Exchange , where about 2.04 billion shares changed hands , above last year ’s estimated daily average of 1.90 billion .
On the Nasdaq , about 2.56 billion shares traded , above last year ’s daily average of 2.17 billion .
Advancers outnumbered decliners by a ratio of almost 8 to 1 on the NYSE , while on the Nasdaq , about three stocks rose for every one that fell .
The core library of Udon is basically finished ( see my previous post for a sketch of what udon is ) .
It needs cleanup , documentation , and a quickcheck suite , but the functionality is there and working in my small tests .
I have begun udon - shell , which is a way you can interact with udon objects from the command line .
Mostly it ’s just a way to test things , but may become an integral helper tool for the more complex tools to come .
My favorite thing about the Udon core is that there is nary a mention of IO anywhere .
It is a purely functional core , the way I was told real software is written when I was a Haskell child . :-)
So , where to go from here ?
I have two projects in mind , which may just be one project .
One of them is to make a version control system which blurs the idea of a “ project ” , so I do n’t care whether it ’s one or two .
The beautiful thing about this library is that I can model these projects in a purely functional way ( as long as I do n’t reference any functions in my persistent data structures ) , and the persistence and distributedness comes for free .
Here is how I picture the “ cabal file ” for the package manager .
type PackageName = [ String ] -- list of components type ImportList = [ ( PackageName , PackageName ) ] -- use module Foo , name it Bar data Package = Package { name :: String , -- whatever you want , no thought involved , rename at will depends :: [ ( ExtRef Package , ImportList ) ] , ... }
Which is the essence .
That packages are referred two by reference rather than by name , and modules from a package are explicitly imported and can be renamed to avoid conflicts .
I ’m not worrying about how this interacts with the state of the ghc art ; it ’ll work out .
I ’ll come back to this in a bit .
First I want to talk about smart versioning .
Smart versioning has little to do with Udon , but as long as I ’m making a version control system I might as well play with it ( though I doubt I have the attention span to carry it to its full potential ) .
There are more types of content than just text and directories .
For example , one might write a “ Haskell source ” plugin which understands Haskell source code , rather than just seeing it as a collection of lines .
Then you could tell the plugin about the refactors you do , such as renaming a function .
If that change is merged with a version from before that change , any true references to that function will get renamed ( but shadows of that name would remain ) .
Taking this further , say there were a “ Haskell package ” content type .
Then if you broke backward compatibility between two versions , you would annotate how .
If it ’s something simple like a renaming , the package manager could automatically upgrade your project to work with the new version .
If it ’s something complex like the semantics of a function , it could see if you ever used that function and mark the locations in your code that needed to be updated .
Such patch abstractions , which are of course custom depending on the content type , could be the basis for the version contol system .
I think Darcs does this kind of thing too , I ’m not sure .
But I use git ’s “ object identity ” theory rather than Darcs ’s patch theory .
So , given smart versioning patches , what is a proper package spec ?
I want to support :
A package allowed to depend on multiple versions of another , with forward compatibility as I just described .
compatibility as I just described .
Splitting a package into two .
Merging two packages into one .
Renaming stuff ( of course ) .
A package can vary by any combination of its dependencies .
My hunch is that there should be a different object for each combination of dependencies ( together with versions ) .
But we do n’t store all of them .
Instead we store a root package , presumably depending on whatever precise versions of dependencies it was developed with , and then derive the package for other sets of dependencies using package diffs .
To ensure robustness , a test suite should be included in the package to make sure the derivations were correct ( though diffs ought to be pretty sure of themselves to begin with ) .
As scary as it might seem , this is already better than cabal .
With cabal , the package makes some wild declaration about which versions of its dependencies it can support .
And it can lie .
There is no automated test that checks whether it told the truth , there is no way to inform a package with dependencies too liberal that the semantics of a function changed while its type stayed the same ( thus introducing subtle bugs ) .
Basically for cabal to work , you should have checked a package against every dependency you declare .
But nobody does that .
Also , what of the case where a package needs modification between two versions of one of its dependencies .
You have to resort to gross conditional compilation stuff .
Hmm , a troublesome case comes to mind .
Suppose the case I just described happens , where foo depends on bar .
foo - A works with bar - A , and foo - B works with bar - B . Now I find a bug in foo .
I do n’t want to have to fix it twice .
So let ’s say I fix it in foo - A .
What happens to foo - B ?
How does it get the fix .
Well , this is a purely functional package manager , so I ca n’t really fix it in foo - A .
So let ’s say I fix foo - A and it becomes foo - A ’ .
Then what I need to do to foo - B to fix it is apply the patch foo - A’ / foo - A , to get foo - B ’ .
Hmm , I guess that ’s it .
It will be tricky for a package author to keep this dependency information coherent for other packages to use .
Okay , I need to get to bed .
Final sketch : packages do not refer to other versions of themselves .
They stand alone , referring to their dependencies by exact version .
Then edges ( noodles ? ) are published , together with a possible “ upgrade direction ” ( you always want the target of this edge if you can ) .
Then some clever algorithm tries to upgrade the package and packages that depend on it .
If one of the dependents fails , you can try it with an appropriate edge for the dependent ( if one exists ) .
Hmm , a nice thing this solves is the ability to resolve ( to some extent ) that horrid dependency on multiple versions of the same package , by renaming one of the versions to something else .
Then it is apparent and resolvable , at least , when you are treating two types from different versions as equal when they are not .
Joe Klein is very , very shrill and I have to say I agree with him .
Embarracuda
I 'm of two minds about how to deal with the McCain campaign 's further descent into ugliness .
Their strategy is simple : you throw crap against a wall and then giggle as the media try to analyze the putresence in a way that conveys a sense of balance : " Well , it is bull - pucky , but the splatter pattern is interesting ... " which , of course , only serves to get your perverse message out .
I really do n't want to be a part of that .
But ... every so often , we journalists have a duty to remind readers just how dingy the McCain campaign , and its right - wing acolytes in the media ( I 'm looking at you , Sean Hannity ) have become -- especially in their efforts to divert public attention from the economic crisis we 're facing .
And so inept at it : other campaigns have decided that their only shot is going negative , but usually they do n't announce it , as several McCain aides have in recent days -- there 's no way we can win on the economy , so we 're going to go sludge - diving .
But since we are dealing with manure here , I 'll put the rest of this post below the fold ... read on

The Hubble Space Telescope has managed to snap our first picture of a planet outside our solar system , only 25 light years away in the constellation Piscis Australis .
The planet Fomalhaut - B orbits the star Fomalhaut , and it's a balmy 260 degrees ( Fahrenheit ) , cooler than other exo-planets .
And meanwhile , Lawrence Livermore researchers believe they 've snapped pics of three other exo-planets , in the Pegasus constellation .
Click through for more pics .
That giant red ring , by the way , is a 21.5 billion mile debris disk surrounding Fomalhaut , which is Arabic for " mouth of the fish . "
The planet is a white speck over towards the right .
The three Pegasus planets are orbiting the star HR 8799 , which is just barely visible in the night sky using binoculars .
The Lawrence Livermore crew had found these planets in 2007 , but waited to confirm their findings .
Like Fomalhaut - B , the other three planets are gas giants , but they 're way hotter than Fomalhaut - B.
None of these planets is likely to support life , at least as we understand it .
Here 's an infrared picture of HR 8799 that shows its planets :

… For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head .
It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose .
" It is a question of cubic capacity , " said he ; " a man with so large a brain must have something in it .
" … Sherlock Holmes – The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle .
Not everyone is born with a big brain .
Not everyone can say things like ‘ Elementary , my dear Watson ’ with a straight face .
But that does n’t mean you ca n’t get an edge on the competition .
Remember that scene from the Matrix , where the machines are using humans as disposable AA batteries ?
That ’s not far off the mark .
With over 100 billion neurons , your brain produces about 100 Watts of raw energy .
The mind literally has a life of its own .
And like your other muscles , the more you use it , the bigger it gets , the better it works .
If you ’re looking to improve mental cognition , increase your memory , and enhance your alertness , here are 15 easy ways to give your brain a six - pack .
1. Exercise :
You knew it was good for your muscles , but the brain ?
Absolutely !
More than 20 % of the body ’s blood and oxygen go directly to the brain ( without passing GO or paying $ 200 ) .
Exercise , particularly cardio training , effectively increases the flow to the brain , keeping it a well - oiled machine .
But if you ’d like something a little more Zen , try Yoga .
Many of the Yoga poses , like Downward Facing Dog , are specifically engineered to get blood to your brain faster , by positioning the head below the heart .
But if you ’re really pressed for time , something as simple as opening a window and getting fresh air can give your brain the extra juice it needs .
2. Hydrate :
If you ’re looking for a little pick - me - up , do n’t reach for your usual double espresso .
Instead try drinking two glasses of water .
The caffeine in coffee and soda may temporarily make you feel more alert , but in the long run will make you even more tired by dehydrating your muscles and constricting your blood vessels .
And in large quantities , caffeine can send you running for the bathroom with a bad case of the trots , as it stimulates the spastic contractions of the intestine .
Water , on the other hand , is a simple way to keep the mind alert and refreshed .
And you ca n’t beat the price .
3. Find Stimulation : A friend of mine used to say , “ I do n’t need caffeine , I have Motorhead . ”
And he always got his papers in on time .
Now heavy metal may not be your thing , but listening to music can increase your productivity .
Just like the smell of dinner can bring on hunger pangs , engaging all five senses will stimulate brain activity .
For example , the color pink is a visual aphrodisiac .
The arousal will dilate your pupils , increase blood flow , and set off pleasure centers in the brain – all of which will make you more alert and focused .
By decorating your work area brightly or switching your font color to something more vivid , you can work through boredom and fatigue .
Aromatherapy can be enormously effective , as smell is the strongest of the senses .
Lemon , peppermint , and cypress are several scents known to stimulate the brain .
Or eating a peppermint candy will activate both scent and taste .
Taking notes by hand instead of typing them , will help you retain the information more effectively , as the pressure points activated by holding a pen are linked to the creative and memory centers of the brain .
4. Think Happy
Thoughts :
We ’ve all seen those Hitchcock thrillers , where a person does or witnesses something so terrible they completely block it from their mind .
Well , on a much smaller scale , that kind of memory loss is happening all the time .
The brain , particularly the memory , does n’t respond well to stress .
If you ’re tense , overwrought , or unhappy , you ’re much less likely to retain information or stay alert .
Try to eliminate stressful influences from your life and workplace .
Practice relaxation techniques , take a hot bath , or get a massage .
Or fry up some bacon .
I ’ve often found that happiness = bacon .
Anyway , your body is very tuned into your emotions , and it shows way more than you think .
5. Play Games : Not Hide n’ Seek .
Studies with dementia patients have shown that playing word games and puzzles can increase and even restore mental cognitive abilities .
The crossword , a pub quiz , or Soduku : all these fun activities can keep your grey matter in the pink .
And the best part is that you do n’t actually need to know anything .
This is one instance where winning does n’t matter , because your brain responds to the attempt to solve the problem , not the knowledge stored in your head .
Probably the best brain games are those with strategic goals like Chess , Risk , and Stratego , as the objectives are in a constant flux , and require more activity from the brain .
6. Watch Quality TV : Would n‘t it be nice if that were true .
Unfortunately , studies indicate that passively sitting in front of the tube is counterproductive .
But if that butt - shaped indention in your recliner calls out to you , choose a game or quiz shows like Jeopardy , and try to answer the questions .
Even if you have never heard of the Federalist Papers , your brain will be stimulated in the same way as if you were playing Trivial Pursuit with your friends .
7. Surf the Net : Net -addicts unite !
We ’ve known it all along , and now we ’ve been proven right .
A recent study at the University of California Los Angeles found that searching the web stimulated centers in the brain that controlled decision - making and complex reasoning .
A simple task like searching the web appears to enhance brain circuitry .
Brain scans showed that much more of the brain was activated by internet use than by simply reading a book .
Not to mention , there are all sorts of lovely online brain teasers and games on the web , just waiting to make you smarter .
And here ’s the clincher : the more you surf , the more your brain works .
8. Eat Brain Food : Do n’t go on one .
Depriving yourself of food literally starves the brain and makes you dumb dumb dumb .
But if you want to get peak mental performance from what you eat , here are a few things to remember .
Protein is the main source of fuel for the brain .
But do n’t automatically switch over to Atkins , cause your brain also needs foods rich in crucial vitamins and minerals .
It ’s always better to get these from food rather than taking pills .
Vitamin A , to protect brain cell membranes ; B Vitamins , essential for neuronal growth and vitality ; Vitamin C , so vital for brain function that its levels in the brain are fifteen times higher than anywhere outside the brain ; Vitamin E , to prevent and actually reverse brain deterioration ; Magnesium , to maintain the metabolic viability of neurons ; Zinc , rids the brain of impurities such as lead to improve cognitive function ; and Amino Acids , necessary to the growth and health of neurotransmitters .
9. Load Up On Fish Oil : “ Jeeves takes a size 14 hat , eats tons of fish , and works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform . ”
When creating his immortal , all - knowing valet Jeeves , author P.G. Wodehouse gave the character an enormous , bulging cranium and a steady diet of brain - enhancing fish .
It was no surprise when scientists proved what we knew all along : eating fish can make you brainy .
Actually , it ’s not the fish , but the Omega - 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) that do the trick .
These fatty acids keep the dopamine levels in the brain high , increase neuronal growth in the frontal cortex of the brain , and increase cerebral circulation .
Which is a complicated way of saying that fatty acids make your brain work at top efficiency , kinda like a tune - up .
But before you stockpile your pantry with tuna , remember that eating large amounts of fish can put you at risk to toxins and mercury poisoning .
So it ’s better to get EPA and DHA from alternative sources and supplements .
10 . Eat Weeds :
Not the kind you hide from your parents , but herbal remedies .
Eastern medicine is kicking ass and taking names where your brain is concerned .
There are about a dozen or so ‘ brain - boosting ’ herbs , but the two most important are Ginkgo Biloba and Ginseng .
As medicinal tonics go , it does n’t get more powerful than Ginkgo , by enhancing cerebral circulation , which freakishly boosts cognitive abilities .
Ginseng , regarded as the ‘ Cadillac ’ of Asian herbs , has astonishing neurological effects .
Once believed to re-harmonize the body ’s ‘ yang energy , ’ we now know that Ginseng helps the brain adapt to stress agents by heightening the productivity of the adrenal glands .
The result is a balanced stimulant , that achieves brain arousal and alertness without the nervous , jittery , guy - from - Shine response of most stimulants .
11 . Learn Something New :
This seems pretty obvious , right ?
But it ’s not that simple .
Very few people find the time to master new skills or even read a new book that is n‘t for work or class .
Learning a foreign language , a new handcraft or recipe , or challenging yourself with an unfamiliar subject all increase brain growth , stimulating parts of the brain that may have been stagnant and untapped til now .
But all this takes time , right ?
Wrong !
Try spending 15 minutes a day on your new discovery , about the same time as all the commercials in an hour - long TV show , and you ’ll be surprised how much you learn .
12 . Do n’t Waste Time :
If your brain were a computer , how many times a day would it be flashing the hourglass sign ?
Albert Einstein , one of the world ’s greatest thinkers , gave us the Theory of Relativity , and some very good advice : " Make everything as simple as possible . "
You can hardly expect your brain to perform at its best if it ’s cluttered with non-essentials .
The best way to organize your mind is to declutter your life .
Maximize your time with a few personal alterations .
Save time in the morning by deciding the night before what outfit you ’ll wear .
Make and keep a list of daily and long - term priorities , and do n’t let your focus wander .
Try multi-tasking .
If you ’re going to be in the bathroom awhile , take along a book or some work you need to finish ( you ’re not doing much else ! )
If you have a long commute or get stuck in traffic , make the most of the time by listening to an audio book .
If you have to stand in line at the bank or the shops , bring along some notes you need to review or flashcards for that new language you decided to learn .
Sure you may look funny , but you ’re getting smarter .
13 . Actively Improve Your Memory :
There ’s a new character on Grey ’s Anatomy who ’s been stunning us with her photographic memory , recalling obscure articles from turn of the century medical journals , railing off the periodic table without batting an eye .
For the actress playing this character to do so convincingly , I ’ll bet she had to find a more efficient way of memorizing data .
There are loads of different tricks and methods purporting to have the answer , but basically they all boil down to a few basic principles .
First , know how you learn .
There are three basic ways of learning : visual , auditory , kinetic .
You can figure out which one you are by listening , reading , and writing three different sentences to see which you remember the best .
Once you know how you learn , optimize that knowledge .
If you are visual , post -its will be a big help .
If you are auditory , invest in a hand - held recorder .
Second , the most effective way to remember facts is by forming multiple associations .
For example , you may remember the date of your dentist appointment , because that number was the age of your favorite singer when he died .
Or something a little more cheerful , but you get the idea .
If you ’re a visual person , try to form an effective mental image or snap shot .
For example , if you park your car in section 4b , you may remember that by taking a snap shot of four bumblebees hovering over the roof of your car .
Try forming an emotional association .
If your wife asks you to pick up something at the store , think for a minute how disappointed she ’ll be if you forget it , and most likely you wo n’t .
Third , rinse and repeat .
Repetition is a tried and true method of memorization .
Just for fun , pull out the old SAT prep book from high school and see how much vocabulary you still remember .
Give your memory a workout by re-learning these forgotten gems .
14 . Rest Almost nothing is as crucial to proper and efficient brain functioning as sleep .
Not everybody needs the same amount of sleep , but trying to think when you ’re tired literally hurts .
Here are some ways for your brain to get the most out of sleep .
If it takes you a long time to fall asleep , do n’t fight it or give up and take a pill .
Instead ease into sleep by reading a book .
But make sure it ’s fiction .
While you might think non-fiction would be more boring , studies show that non-fiction triggers forward thinking in the brain , which prevents sleep .
If you wake up tired , it might not be because you did n’t get enough sleep .
It could be because your brain is starved from fasting while you slept .
Trying eating a low sugar , 100 calorie snack before bed .
This wo n’t be enough to keep you awake , and it may prevent that tired - head in the morning .
If , despite your best efforts , you do n’t get enough Z’s , seriously consider a nap .
Naps are not childish or European , they are a perfectly natural way to buck up your brain .
A series of short naps ( 20 - 30 minutes ) throughout the day wo n’t repair hours of sleep debt , but it will stave off the exhaustion that leaves your brain utterly useless and you without a job .
15 . Have Sex : Women will go weak at the knees at the thought of the size of your … brain .
That ’s right .
A lot happens to the body during sex , and much of it goes on in your head .
Your brain , that is .
There is no activity that increases more blood flow to the brain , enhancing cognitive capabilities .
Having sex also produces hormones that dramatically improve brain functioning .
One example includes the ‘ trust ’ hormone Oxytocin , which is produced during sex .
This increases your ability to think of original solutions to a problem while serotonin and dopamine , which surge after sex , help a person ’s creative thinking and calm , logical decision - making .
And if you ’re having any trouble falling to sleep , to give your brain the rest it needs , look no further .
The world 's first radar breast imaging system developed at Bristol University that could revolutionise the way women are scanned for breast cancer , is being trialled at North Bristol NHS Trust ( NBT ) .
The world 's first radar breast imaging system developed at Bristol University that could revolutionise the way women are scanned for breast cancer , is being trialled at North Bristol NHS Trust ( NBT ) .
Professor Alan Preece and Dr Ian Craddock from the University of Bristol have been working for a number of years to develop a breast - imaging device which uses radio waves and therefore has no radiation risk unlike conventional mammograms .
The team began developing and researching a prototype around five years ago and have received funding from organisations including the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ( EPSRC ) , the trustees of the United Bristol Hospitals and the University of Bristol spin - out company , Micrima Ltd .
Dr Ian Craddock from the University 's Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering , said : " This new imaging technique works by transmitting radio waves of a very low energy and detecting reflected signals , it then uses these signals to make a 3D image of the breast .
This is basically the same as any radar system , such as the radars used for air traffic control at our airports . "
Mike Shere , Associate Specialist Breast Clinician at NBT , added : " Currently women are diagnosed in three ways : firstly by a clinician then by using imaging such as mammography and ultrasound and lastly by a needle biopsy .
" The radar breast imaging system came to Frenchay in September this year and so far around 60 women have been examined using it .
" It takes less time to operate than a mammogram approximately six minutes for both breasts compared with 30 - 45 minutes for an MRI , and like an MRI it provides a very detailed 3D digital image .
" Women love it as they compare it to a mammogram and find the whole experience much more comfortable . "
The radar breast imaging system is built using transmitters and receivers arranged around a ceramic cup , which the breast sits in .
These transmitters view the breast from several different angles .
In the initial stages of the study the team used mammogram images to compare similar abnormalities in the new 3D image produced from the radio breast imaging system .
Professor Preece from the University 's Medical Physics , said : " I started off looking at breast tumour imaging in 1990 using a hand held scanner similar to ultrasound however it did not have enough sensitivity and that 's when I got to know some people in engineering and together we approached the EPSRC to help .
" Using this engineering knowledge we built the machine using ground penetrating radar , a similar technique to land mine detection to take four hundred quarter of a second pictures of the breast to form a 3D image .
" Women do not feel any sensation and it equates to the same type of radiation exposure as speaking into a mobile phone at arms length which makes it much safer .
" We are extremely grateful for North Bristol NHS Trust help in getting the project underway with so much enthusiasm .
" We are constantly learning and adapting and it has been particularly easy to work with NBT , we have seen some very promising results so far . "
In the coming months the team plan on " testing blind " , this means looking at images taken by both machines and examining each independently to check whether the radio breast imaging system 's 3D image picks up the same abnormalities as a mammogram would and if anything else is identified in the new image .
They hope that if the results continue , further trials will be scheduled for the next 12 months .
These trials will focus specifically on young women as these can prove the most challenging .
They also hope that two new prototypes will be made for further trials in other hospitals around the country .
" This technology will ultimately only benefit the patient if it can be successfully commercialised " , said Roy Johnson , CEO of Micrima Ltd , " this new invention could provide a safe , more comfortable experience for women as well as giving clinicians a better image of the breast allowing them to pick up abnormalities at an earlier stage .
We particularly hope that it may work well in younger women who can pose a problem to conventional mammography . "
In this stage of the process the system provides an additional picture of the breast to complement the other imaging devices available , and also has the potential to be made cheaply en-mass .

For a moment , a tiny little moment , I actually had some hope for our entire system of government when I heard that the Congress had listened to the big 3 automakers and had rejected their plea for more of my money .
But that was short lived .
Apparently , the big 3 looters have until December 2 , 2008 to come up with some sort of report of what they need the money for and how they are going to use it .
Despite the fact that they were already hauled in front of Congress to answer these very questions and failed mightily , they are now being given a second chance to answer the questions better .
You can be sure that someone will write a better essay than these executives delivered and that Congress will hand them $ 25 billion ; that is 25,000 million dollars of your money and mine .
Here is the letter that two of the top democrats sent to the automakers .
Nice of them to set out exactly what they want the essays to say : Hard to fail that test .
What I find so disturbing , is that in all the reports about this issue , no one ever asks IF this money should be stolen from the American people .
They all assume that the answer is : of course .
But will someone show me where in any documentation we have regarding our government , where it says that Congress can steal our money to hand to struggling companies ?
And please , please , please , do n’t even begin to lie to me about how the taxpayer will get money back under some plan or another .
That is an all out fib .
You and I will never receive a dividend check .
We will never receive a check paying us back for all the money they stole from us .
If , and that is a big if , the U.S. Government ever does get any money back on some sort of stock deal or something , it will be the U.S. Government that keeps the money , not you and I .
We will never see anything , but a loss of our money .
It really does n’t matter if those companies are important to our economy .
If we give them money then we take it away from companies that are successful .
There will be layoffs ; you just wo n’t know they were directly connected to this theft .
Good companies will be crushed by the weight and a person here and another there will lose their jobs .
It will add up , but it will be spread out so that no one will see how this theft put all those people on the street .
If these companies cannot make money , then they should go out of business .
That is how things work .
That is how they used to work .
If the union contracts are too burdensome then perhaps someone should sit down with them and tell them that either these contracts go or you all lose your jobs ?
Nice jobs they have too .
According to Mark J. Perry , professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan , the big three pay out an average hourly compensation of $ 73.20 per hour .
I went to undergrad and law school and worked in a large firm and I never made that much money .
Do you make that much ?
No wonder these companies are drowning .
They do n’t need a hand out , they need a wake - up call and they wo n’t get it if they get saved .
They will continue with business as usual until that money is used up and then come back and ask for more .
They need to learn that spending too much money is bad for running a profitable business .
Of course it will hurt a lot of people , but so will supporting these giant failures and that pain is not so easily seen .
That pain is spread out , but does it make it any less worth avoiding ?
No , you and I deserve our money .
However , this time we have a chance to do something about this .
The deadline for this newest money - thieving atrocity is not until December 2 , 2008 .
That means that you have time to email every person you know and beg them to call their Congressmen and tell them to vote against the bailout .
You have time to make several calls a day yourself .
You have time to send out emails and letters and faxes and make calls and organize others to do the same .
Remember , however , that this is a short week with Thanksgiving coming up so do it quickly .
It is time that our representatives represent us .
It is time our voices are heard .
It is time that we start to count in this system of government .
It is time to SHOUT " no more giving my money away !
Should n’t the Congress be embarrassed enough as it is right now ?
After all , they voted for a $ 700 billion , TARP ( Toxic Asset Relief Program ) that turned out to be nothing but an early Christmas bonus for a few of the Secretary of the Treasury ’s closest friends .
As soon as was fashionable , Mr. Paulson announced that actually buying those toxic assets was not to his liking and abandoned the plan .
Now the money goes straight to the bankers to do whatever they like with it .
I wonder why they still keep using the initials TARP ; perhaps GIFT would fit more accurately .
So , until this representative system of government is officially dead , make those calls , make those emails , send those faxes and tell all you know to do it too .
Flood their lines .
Let them know that in the America you know , we all pay for our mistakes and do n’t go get some government thugs to steal the money to pay us back .
We learned in kindergarten that stealing is wrong .
How long will it take those in Congress to learn it ?
Since Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid seem to be heading this little brainchild , do n’t forget to include a nice note to each of them .
Stop stealing my money !
Or at least let me go down to their lots and pick out which car now belongs to me .
If I am going to pay for a new car , then should n’t I get one ?
It seems we are getting a very raw deal .
Here is a speech by Ron Paul back in 1979 when he opposed bailing out Chrysler the first time .
It is just as applicable today as it was back then .
It seems that truth is truth .
I urge anyone who is for these handouts to read that speech .
I urge those that are against it to read it too .
Ron Paul spells out the economic reasons why bailouts / handouts are so bad for the economy .
As he writes : " A vote for the Chrysler bailout is , simply put , a vote for further inflation . "
Regarding this current bailout he so brilliantly states : " An essential element of a healthy free market , is that both success and failure must be permitted to happen when they are earned , ” Mr. Paul said .
“ But instead with a bailout , rewards are reversed — the proceeds from successful entities are given to failing ones .
How this is supposed to be good for our economy is beyond me . ”
It is beyond me too .

Allium Cepa by Bambo
It is December and many of TheGardenLady ‘s readers are celebrating either Hanukah or Christmas .
The house is decorated in the appropriate way for the holiday you celebrate and food will be a main part of the festivities .
So this year TheGardenLady is suggesting that her readers try to cook with some of the herbs ( Bible herbs ) or foods that are mentioned in the Bible .
While friends and family are seated at the dinner table enjoying the special holiday treats , talking about the foods in the Bible might even add to your discussion – after all these celebrations are related to the Bible plus TheGardenLady ‘s readers are those who are interested in plants , even ancient ones .
And these dinner discussions might encourage some readers to grow the Biblical favorites in their own gardens .
Some of the Biblical foods mentioned are garlic and onions .
Onion , garlic or shallots are all in the allium family of plants , relatives of the Lily .
The common onion is the allium cepa ( see photo above ) , the garlic is allium sativum and the shallot is Allium ascalonicum named for the city , Ashkelon in Israel from which it was supposedly brought to Europe by the Crusaders .
( Alliums are now becoming a popular flowering plant for the garden ; Allium giganteum is a particular favorite in TheGardenLady ’s ornamental garden .
Though ornamental alliums are not for eating . )
Lentils – Lens culinaris is another food mentioned in the Bible .
Lentils are thought to be the oldest cultivated legume .
Some other foods mentioned in the Bible are honey , olive oil , and cinnamon .
This holiday you might try a Baked Honey Lentil Casserole as part of your menu .
This casserole is composed of herbs , spices and vegetables that were eaten during Biblical times .
Baked Honey Lentil Casserole for 6 as a side dish .
Cook 1/2lb red lentils as directed on the package .
( Do not add salt when cooking lentils . )
Make a mixture of 1 tsp. dry mustard ( optional ) , 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon , 1 small onion in small dice , 1 clove garlic minced , now add salt - 1 tsp or to taste .
All the above items are mentioned in the Bible .
( You can add ground black pepper to taste . )
Mix this mixture into the cooked lentils and taste to see if you want to add more of any herbs or spices .
Put 2 Tbsp
Olive oil on bottom of casserole - olives and olive oil were used in the time of the Bible .
Then pour the cooked lentil mixture into the casserole and pour 1 / 4 to 1/2 cup of honey on top .
It depends on your sweet tooth .
( Honey is another food that was used during Biblical times . )
Cover the casserole tightly with the lid or with aluminum foil .
Put casserole in a preheated 350 degree oven and bake until tender - start checking after 1 / 2 hour - it could take up to 1 1/2 hour .
When tender , take the lid off and let cook uncovered for another 10 minutes and serve .
Happy Holidays

Enlarge By Steve Ruark , AP The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops , which held a semi-annual meeting this month in Baltimore , says lifting a ban on funding for stem cell research would alienate millions .
WASHINGTON — President - elect Barack Obama could reignite an emotional national debate over the promise and the perils of medical research using cells taken from human embryos .
The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops is warning that Obama will alienate millions , and abortion opponents are bracing for a fight .
Medical researchers , meanwhile , are rejoicing at the prospect of freedom from a government policy they say has stymied efforts to develop life - saving treatments .
Like previous presidents , Obama is expected to issue a flurry of executive orders after he takes office Jan. 20 .
Some could reverse Bush administration policies ; others could promote his own .
Ending a ban on government funding for research using embryonic stem cells would be among the most controversial .
" The question is , does the Bush policy get replaced with the law of the jungle " where scientists can create and clone human embryos for the sole purpose of studying their cells and then destroying them , asks Richard Doerflinger , the bishops conference 's associate director of the Secretariat for Pro-Life Activities .
" We are very concerned about it as a moral issue . "
Samuel Casey of Advocates International , a Christian law firm that opposes abortion rights , says a change in the Bush policy " would give a green light to the kind of eugenic human experiments that people think of when they talk about cloning . "
Scientists say cells taken from human embryos offer the most promise of being used to develop therapies for Parkinson's , diabetes and other diseases .
Some scientists have found cells taken from adults also have lifesaving potential .
" Current policy has depressed the field " of research and caused an exodus of scientists from the United States to other countries where such research is flourishing , University of Iowa researcher Nicholas Zavazava says .
But " we are a big country ; we ought to be able to roll things back . "
States such as California have gone ahead and funded stem cell research on their own in the absence of federal money .
Obama 's campaign promised broad support for stem cell research .
His website says he " believes we owe it to the American public to explore the potential of stem cells . "
After the election , John Podesta , chief of Obama 's transition team , said aides are reviewing a host of areas where Obama might act fast , including on federal funding for research using embryonic stem cells .
Controversy surrounding the research has simmered since 2001 .
That 's when President Bush imposed the funding ban during his first prime - time televised address to the nation .
His decision , a month before the 9/11 attacks , was regarded at the time as likely to be one of the most important of his presidency .
Abortion opponents , Catholics and many political conservatives were elated .
Others , including former first lady Nancy Reagan and California 's Republican governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , support the research and have pushed for it ever since .
Twice during his presidency , Bush has vetoed bills passed by Congress that would have lifted restrictions on stem cell research .
If Obama issues an order reversing the ban , Congress will have to act again — and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested it will .
A law on the books since 1996 bans funding of research that harms embryos and would prevent funding for research even on cells from embryos slated to be discarded by fertility clinics .
Opponents of the research have no recourse against an executive order from the White House aimed at releasing tens of millions of dollars .
But they can do battle on Capitol Hill .

Ever since the election , partisans within the Republican Party and observers outside it have been speculating wildly about what direction the GOP will take to revive itself from its disaster .
Or , more specifically , which wing of the party will prevail in setting the new Republican course -- whether it will be what conservative writer Kathleen Parker has called the “ evangelical , right - wing , oogedy - boogedy ” branch or the more pragmatic , intellectual , centrist branch .
To determine the answer , it helps to understand exactly how Republicans arrived at this spot in the first place .
The creation myth of modern conservatism usually begins with Barry Goldwater , the Arizona senator who was the party ’s presidential standard - bearer in 1964 and who , even though he lost in one of the biggest landslides in American electoral history , nevertheless wrested the party from its Eastern establishment wing .
Then , Richard Nixon co-opted conservatism , talking like a conservative while governing like a moderate , and drawing the opprobrium of true believers .
But Ronald Reagan embraced it wholeheartedly , becoming the patron saint of conservatism and making it the dominant ideology in the country .
George W. Bush picked up Reagan ’s fallen standard and “ conservatized ” government even more thoroughly than Reagan had , cheering conservatives until his presidency came crashing down around him .
That ’s how the story goes .
But there is another rendition of the story of modern conservatism , one that does n’t begin with Goldwater and does n’t celebrate his libertarian orientation .
It is a less heroic story , and one that may go a much longer way toward really explaining the Republican Party ’s past electoral fortunes and its future .
In this tale , the real father of modern Republicanism is Sen .
Joe McCarthy , and the line does n’t run from Goldwater to Reagan to George W. Bush ; it runs from McCarthy to Nixon to Bush and possibly now to Sarah Palin .
It centralizes what one might call the McCarthy gene , something deep in the DNA of the Republican Party that determines how Republicans run for office , and because it is genetic , it is n’t likely to be expunged any time soon .
The basic problem with the Goldwater tale is that it focuses on ideology and movement building , which few voters have ever really cared about , while the McCarthy tale focuses on electoral strategy , which is where Republicans have excelled .
McCarthy , Wisconsin ’s junior senator , was the man who first energized conservatism and made it a force to reckon with .
When he burst on the national scene in 1950 waving his list of alleged communists who had supposedly infiltrated Harry Truman ’s State Department , conservatism was as bland , temperate and feckless as its primary congressional proponent , Ohio Sen .
Robert Taft , known fondly as “ Mister Conservative . ”
Taft was no flamethrower .
Though he was an isolationist and a vehement opponent of FDR , he supported America ’s involvement in the war after Pearl Harbor and had even grudgingly come to accept the basic institutions of the New Deal .
He was also no winner .
He had contested and lost the Republican presidential nomination to Wendell Willkie in 1940 , Thomas Dewey in 1948 and Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 , three men who were regarded as much more moderate than he .
McCarthy was another thing entirely .
What he lacked in ideology -- and he was no ideologue at all -- he made up for in aggression .
Establishment Republicans , even conservatives , were disdainful of his tactics , but when those same conservatives saw the support he elicited from the grass - roots and the press attention he got , many of them were impressed .
Taft , no slouch himself when it came to Red- baiting , decided to encourage McCarthy , secretly , sealing a Faustian bargain that would change conservatism and the Republican Party .
Henceforth , conservatism would be as much about electoral slash - and - burn as it would be about a policy agenda .
For the polite conservatives , McCarthy was useful .
That ’s because he was n’t only attacking alleged communists and the Democrats whom he accused of shielding them .
He was also attacking the entire centrist American establishment , the Eastern intellectuals and the power class , many of whom were Republicans themselves , albeit moderate ones .
When he began his investigation of the Army , he even set himself against his own Republican president , who had once commanded that service .
In the end , he was censured in 1954 , not for his recklessness about alleged communists but for his recklessness toward his fellow senators .
Moderate Republicans , not Democrats , led the fight against him .
His intemperance disgusted them as much as it emboldened his fans , Goldwater among them .
But if McCarthy had been vanquished -- he died three years later of cirrhosis from drinking -- McCarthyism was only just beginning .
McCarthyism is usually considered a virulent form of Red- baiting and character assassination .
But it is much more than that .
As historian Richard Hofstadter described it in his famous essay , “ The Paranoid Style in American Politics , ” McCarthyism is a way to build support by playing on the anxieties of Americans , actively convincing them of danger and conspiracy even where these do n’t exist .
McCarthy , a Catholic , was especially adept at nursing national resentments among the sorts of people that typically did not vote Republican .
He stumbled onto the fact that many of these people in postwar America were frightened and looking for scapegoats .
He provided them , and in doing so not only won millions of adherents but also bequeathed to his party a powerful electoral bludgeon that would eventually drive out the moderates from the GOP ( posthumous payback ) before it drove the Democrats from the White House .
In a way , Goldwater was less a fulfillment of McCarthy conservatism than a slight diversion from it .
Goldwater was ideological -- an economic individualist .
He hated government more than he loved winning , and though he was certainly not above using the McCarthy appeal to resentment or accusing his opponents of socialism , he lacked McCarthy ’s blood - lust .
McCarthy ’s real heir was Nixon , who mainstreamed McCarthyism in 1968 by substituting liberals , youth and minorities for communists and intellectuals , and fueling resentments as McCarthy had .
In his 1972 reelection , playing relentlessly on those resentments , Nixon effectively disassembled the old Roosevelt coalition , peeling off Catholics , evangelicals and working - class Democrats , and changed American politics far more than Goldwater ever would .
Today , these former liberals are known as Reagan Democrats , but they were Nixon voters before they were Reagan voters , and they were McCarthy supporters before they were either .
A good deal of McCarthy ’s support came from Catholics and evangelical Protestants who , along with Southerners , would form the basis of the new conservative coalition .
Nixon simply mastered what McCarthy had authored .
You demonize the opposition and polarize the electorate to win .
Reagan ’s sunny disposition and his willingness to compromise masked the McCarthyite elements of his appeal , but Reaganism as an electoral device was unique to Reagan and essentially died with the end of his presidency .
McCarthyism , on the other hand , which could be deployed by anyone , thrived .
McCarthyism was how Republicans won .
George H.W. Bush used it to get himself elected , terrifying voters with Willie Horton .
And his son , under the tutelage of strategist Karl Rove , not only got himself reelected by convincing voters that John Kerry was a coward and a liar and would hand the nation over to terrorists , which was pure McCarthyism , he governed by rousing McCarthyite resentments among his base .
Republicans continue to push the idea that this is a center - right country and that Americans have swooned for GOP anti-government posturing all these years , but the real electoral bait has been anger , recrimination and scapegoating .
That ’s why John McCain kept describing Barack Obama as some sort of alien and why Palin , taking a page right out of the McCarthy playbook , kept pushing Obama ’s relationship with onetime radical William Ayers .
And that is also why the Republican Party , despite the recent failure of McCarthyism , is likely to keep moving rightward , appeasing its more extreme elements and stoking their grievances for some time to come .
There may be assorted intellectuals and ideologues in the party , maybe even a few centrists , but there is no longer an intellectual or even ideological wing .
The party belongs to McCarthy and his heirs -- Rush Limbaugh , Sean Hannity , Bill O’Reilly and Palin .
It ’s in the genes .

The headline of an article on Bloomberg warns " Food Prices Will Rise , Causing Export Bans , Riots " .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Leading economist Nouriel Roubini warns of possible food riots .
The Financial Times points out that farmers rely on credit , and credit is drying up .
One of the top experts on derivatives , economist Nassim Nicholas Taleb , warns
that supermarkets may not be able to borrow against their inventory , and will thus be forced to shut down .
I hope they ’re wrong .
But when experts like Roubini and Taleb warn of a potential problem , I have to listen .

Man hat ja schon einige Unfassbarkeiten erlebt , wenn es um die oft fehlende Medienkompetenz politischer Stellen geht .
Das aber , was Alvar Freude mit seinem offenen Brief an die Bundesfamilienministerin Ursula von der Leyen bzgl .
der geplanten Internet - Filter gegen Kinderpornographie passiert ist … das würde als Satire niemand glauben .
Da schreibt Alvar Freude , der sich offenbar ganz gut auskennt , einen langen , freundlichen , bedachten , kompetenten und sachlich argumentierten Brief an das Familienministerium mit dem Hinweis , dass Internetsperren gegen Kinderpornografie wirkungslos sei und ungewollte Nebeneffekte habe , und er bietet sogar fachliche Hilfe an .
Immerhin : Er bekommt eine Antwort .
Dass diese Antwort den falschen , vermutlich noch aus der vorigen Antwort stammenden Adressaten - Namen enthält : Kann passieren .
Dass die Antwort nur marginal auf den ursprünglichen Brief und die Argumente des Absenders eingeht , sondern stattdessen vorformulierte Wiederholungen dessen beinhaltet , wogegen sich der ursprüngliche Brief richtete : Schlimm genug und mal wieder ein deutliches Zeichen dafür , wie sehr das politische Engagement von Privatleuten geschätzt wird .
Dass der elektronischen
Antwort jedoch ein PDF anhängt , dass den Scan (! ) einer ausgedruckten (!!)
Webseite ( !!! ) des Familienministeriums zeigt , auf der ein Interview mit Ursula von der Leyen aus dem Hamburger Abendblatt veröffentlicht wurde … das ist kein verzeihbarer Faux pas , sondern beweist eine derart Besorgnis erregende Medieninkompetenz , dass man als mündiger Bürger fragen muss :
Wie kann man diese Leute stoppen ?
Muss man dafür immer erst nach Karlsruhe ?
2008 came in two parts .
Part I , which ran through Bear Stearns , carried the vestiges of prior years , when we thought we could get away with everything , never anticipating that in actuality , everything would get away from us .
Some of the books on this list reflect that optimistic , braced mentality , when words like “ social networking ” still gave us more jitters than “ 401K . ”
Times have a’changed .
The sordid details do n’t bear recounting in this post , but some of the books on this list reflect issues more characteristic of 2008 ’s tarnished second half , when social networking became safe , and the 401K became a figment .
If these books do n’t cover every event of the year , they certainly cover the thought processes that trace through it :

By Jeff Howe
Howe argues that large interest communities –Wikipedia , for example–can , if given the right incentives , outperform traditional organizations in terms of cost and effectiveness .
Crowdsourcing allows people to concentrate their talents in one area , resulting in a talented , specialized , ultra - productive workforce where performance counts more than appearance or background .
Howe explains the implications and inevitability of this shift .

7. Outliers : The Story of Success
By Malcolm Gladwell
The brilliant Malcolm Gladwell strikes again , this time claiming that individual inspiration has little to do with success .
Instead , circumstance , luck , timing , and culture explain why some individuals , such as Bill Gates and Mozart , are able to rise above others with similar talents .
Gladwell ’s trademark refreshing style makes you realize your traditional perspectives may be cliched ; as in his other books , he deftly explores surfaces rather than digging into back - end methodologies .

6. Nudge : Improving Decisions About Health , Wealth and Happiness
By Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein
No , it ’s not another Gladwell book .
In fact , Nudge has more to do with Obama than underlying realities .
It delves into how governments and interest groups can become more effective by manipulating the “ status quo bias , ” which says that people wo n’t choose a new alternative to the situation that fits their status quo unless that alternative choice is attractive enough to risk foregoing what they are used to .
The authors offer ways to manipulate this “ choice architecture , ” nudging people towards more desirable outcomes through default choices or product arrangements that encourage people to behave in a certain way .
One example is making saving for retirement a default option for individuals rather than a secondary choice .
Nudge offers insight into both the existing mechanisms of human behavior and possible social engineering implications .
Rather than promoting government paternalism , the authors explain how things could be done while emphasizing that people should always be given a real choice .

Ariely uses experiments and everyday anecdotes to illustrate the biases that affect us every day .
This highly readable book promises to be a new business classic .

Atlantik Wall
Atlantik wall - this strategic line of coastal fortifications was constructed by the Germans during WWII to defend against allied attacks .
By the time the allied forces broke that line during D - day it stretched out along the atlantic coastline from the high nord of Norway till the spanish border south .
Today still a lot of those bunkers and batteries are untouched or maybe just sealed at the most .
This set of pictures was taken during the spring of 2007 between the belgian border and the coast of Normandy where it all happened on the 6th of June 1944 .
Where some of the places were touristic beehives , others were pure , untouched and rightfully in a phase of natural destruction .
A magical process and being there , alone , gives one a very surreal feeling .
it is indeed a very weird experience strolling around alone insuch places , knowing what happened .
The absurdity of war suddenly becomes crystal clear when your standing on top of the steep cliffs at Pointe de Hoc or Omaha beach .

Supporters of Mr McKinnon have held protests in his name
UK MPs are calling for hacker Gary McKinnon to serve any sentence he receives in a British jail .
Mr McKinnon faces extradition to the US for breaking into American military networks between February 2001 and March 2002 .
He trespassed on networks owned by Nasa , the US Army , Navy , Air Force , and Department of Defense .
If tried and convicted in a US court , Mr McKinnon could face decades of jail time , and millions of dollars in fines .
Medical notes
Despite taking his appeal to the House of Lords , Mr McKinnon lost a six - year legal battle to avoid extradition .
The European Court of Human Rights also declined to back Mr McKinnon 's case against extradition .
Mr McKinnon is currently awaiting a decision by Home Secretary Jacqui Smith as to when the extradition process will begin .
In the interim , 20 UK MPs have signed an Early Day Motion which calls for any sentence imposed by a US court to be served in a British jail .
Drawn up by Shadow justice minister David Burrowes , who is Mr McKinnon 's MP , the motion cites the practice of the Netherlands , and Israel , which routinely request that nationals suffering medical or mental problems are repatriated to serve their sentence .
It urged Jacqui Smith to delay extradition proceedings until she had won assurances from the US that Mr McKinnon , who has been diagnosed with Asperger 's Syndrome , would be sent back to the UK to serve his sentence .
Mr Burrowes tabled the motion after receiving word from the Government that Mr McKinnon 's diagnosis with Asperger 's was not sufficient grounds for refusing the extradition order .
Argonaut Liquor store in Denver recently built a new store right next to the old store , in what had been part of the old stores parking lot .
They jumped through all kinds of crazy hoops in an effort to meet the new zoning laws for Colfax
Ave that claim to try and create an “ old main street ” look and feel .
Now however , they are being told that they are not allowed to tear down the old building and build a parking lot in the space , because a parking lot does not meet the new zoning codes .
The ugly old building does n’t meet the new zoning codes either , but since it is an existing building it can stay .
This is an example of zoning laws that really serve no purpose in the first place completely becoming self defeating .
The stated goal of the zoning rules is to give Colfax a look and feel of an old style main street , but if the government does n’t back down on the no parking lot rule then they will have a new building without enough parking and an old eyesore , leaving nobody happy .

Before I was a writer and I was a happy systems administrator , PC Magazine was one of my favorite computer magazines .
After I started my tech .
journalism career , I was thrilled to start publishing there from time to time .
And , now , PC Magazine print will cease publication with the forthcoming January 2009 issue .
I ’ll miss it .
I think anyone who cared about PCs and technology from the 80s to the last few years will miss it .
PC Magazine , starting under Bill Machrone , defined what PC magazines were .
The comparative reviews , the use of benchmarks , colorful columnists , and the always coveted Editors ’
Choice awards , it was all there .
Personally , the demise of PC Magazine print will have little impact on me .
In the last few years , I ’d only publish a story there once every year or so .
Still , it just is n’t going to be the same looking at newsstands without PC Magazine front and center in the technology section .
Of course , there ’s no longer much of a technology section .
The day of print computer and technology magazines has been waning for years .
The current economy did n’t kill PC Magazine .
It , and all the other tech print publications have been dying for years .
Today , almost all of my work appears online first .
I ’m fine with that .
Still , I got my start with now long gone print publications like Byte and PC / Computing .
Seeing PC
Magazine , the most popular of all the print PC publications leave is like seeing an old friend moving to another country .
I know he ’ll still be alive out there online , but it just is n’t going to be the same .
Mr. Limbaugh , who is syndicated by Premiere , continues to command a much larger audience than any other radio host .
According to Arbitron ’s spring 2008 ratings report , he reached 3.58 million listeners during an average quarter - hour , while the No. 2 host , Mr. Hannity , averaged 1.65 million .
A middle tier of radio hosts helps fill the schedules of AM and FM stations .
“ Because you do n’t have a commodity like music to rely upon , it is all up to the host , ” said Carl Anderson , the senior vice president for programming and distribution at ABC Radio Networks .
“ They are on stage by themselves . ”
The talk - radio formula that Mr. Limbaugh pioneered two decades ago remains evident on the air today .
Syndicators look for hosts who are entertaining , have a point of view and , as Mr. Anderson put it , show an ability to “ connect with an audience . ”
Ask different syndicators and you will hear different claims about the “ fastest - growing hosts ” on talk radio .
Westwood One cites its “ Dennis Miller Show , ” which is syndicated in 200 markets and has a comedic bent .
ABC Radio cites the rapid rise of its two - year - old “ Mark Levin Show , ” which now counts 175 affiliates .
The shows are a less expensive alternative to the Limbaughs and Hannitys of the industry .
With more stations converting to news - talk formats  perhaps with the hope that live talk cannot be displaced by an iPod the way music can be  the middle tier is where most of the movement is .
The conservative commentator Monica Crowley is entering weekday syndication through the Talk Radio Network .
The CNN anchor Lou Dobbs is signing new affiliates for a three - hour afternoon show .
And Mr. Scarborough , the host of MSNBC ’s “ Morning Joe , ” is hosting a radio version on WABC in New York .
ABC Radio plans to syndicate it next year , beginning in Los Angeles at KABC .
Mr. Scarborough , the former Republican congressman , did not enjoy his brief stint with Westwood One in 2005 .
But his MSNBC morning program , which replaced the TV simulcast of “ Imus in the Morning ” when Don Imus was fired for using racially charged language in 2007 , resembles a radio show and attracted interest from radio networks earlier in the year .
Mr. Scarborough expects his program to provide more political balance than some others .
Yes .
Sadly .
The New York Post ’s “ @work ” special section describes the ways the Wall Street crisis is destroying your physical and mental health .
Here ’s a rundown of how you are falling apart .
You are over - eating .
“ Psychotherapist Tom Kersting , who works with many Wall Streeters , has a few clients who were successful dieters until recently - now they come home from work rattled by stress and climb into bed with a container of ice cream .
‘ They eat the whole thing , ’ Kersting says .
Needless to say , they wake up the next day not only with problems around job security and weight , but a whole lot of guilt and self - loathing . ”
You are dangerously slutty .
“ While Kersting 's clients reach for food , psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert has some clients who seek stress relief in other ways ; in his practice risky sexual conduct is near the top of the list .
Why the risky conduct ?
‘ Because sex [ within a committed relationship ] and stress are about as compatible as Joe Biden and Sarah Palin , ’ says Alpert , who says some of his married clients are visiting strip clubs and massage parlors and using escort services either for the very first time or far more often than usual .
You ’re a problem drinker .
“ ' For those who are prone toward , suffering from or recovering from substance abuse , fears of job loss and financial insecurity are an ‘ extra - loaded trigger , ’ says Steve Pasierb of the Partnership for a Drug Free America .
‘This is the moment when some drinkers become problem - drinkers , when some problem - drinkers become super - problem drinkers , and when casual drug use can turn to addiction , ’ he says .
So you are n't psychic .
Just psychotic .
One was convicted of seven felony counts just days before the election .
Another is under indictment for bribery after FBI agents found $ 90,000 cash in his freezer .
And seven others are facing ethics questions that range from ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff to failing to report taxable income on a Caribbean villa .
But that did n’t stop the members of Congress and the Senate from having successful election nights on Tuesday .
As we noted yesterday , Sen .
Ted Stevens ( R - AK ) appears to be on his way to back to Capitol Hill despite being convicted last week of failing to disclose gifts from an oil contractor .
Meanwhile , Rep. William Jefferson ( D - LA ) – whose “ cold ” cash was allegedly intended to bribe the vice president of Nigeria – easily won a Democratic runoff that was pushed back by Hurricane Gustav .
Jefferson appears poised to win re-election against “ four poorly financed opponents with scant name recognition . ”
( Jefferson ’s case has n’t gone to trial yet . )
So what causes the lawmakers to continue to win over voters ?
“ I ’ve got to believe that the reason why is that they ’ve developed this network of support that ’s based on bringing business opportunities and earmarks to the community , ” said Craig Holman , a campaign finance lobbyist for the watchdog group Public Citizen .
“ The more they develop a network in their communities , the more likelihood they can survive a criminal investigation or indictment . ”
Holman noted that congressmen facing corruption charges have often had trouble getting re-elected ; usually a shoe - in , Stevens is now “ in the race of a lifetime , ” he said .
ABC News has a roundup of how the suspect lawmakers fared on Election Day .
Not all of them won .
Rep. Tim Mahoney ( D - FL ) , accused of paying off a mistress , lost his seat while Rep. Charlie Rangel ( D - NY ) – facing questions about the villa , rent - stabilized apartments , free parking and donations – held onto his by a landslide .
Of the baker ’s dozen that the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington reported being under investigation in its 2008 annual report , “ Most Corrupt Members of Congress , ” nine appear headed for re-election .
( While Jefferson has a run-off in a month , the Times - Picayune calls him the hands - down favorite . )
Of the four others in the baker ’s dozen , three resigned .
And just one lost .
Update :
Here are the winners :
NOT long after Nicole Caldwell became editor in chief of Playgirl magazine , she realized that looking at photos of naked men all day was not everything she had imagined it would be .
When she would meet them , there was often a curious vapidity to the men , who Ms. Caldwell took to describing as “ mimbos . ”
Readers , Ms. Caldwell decided , deserved more .
So she and her fellow editors , all women in their 20s and all relative neophytes to the world of magazines  and pornography  resolved to fill Playgirl with something different .
They aspired to bring Playgirl back to its roots , back to a time when the magazine covered issues like abortion and equal rights , interspersing sexy shots of men with work from writers like Raymond Carver and Joyce Carol Oates .
All the while , the editors juggled the demands of the publisher , Blue Horizon Media , which they said pushed to fill Playgirl with even more nudes and fewer words .
“ It always felt like this uphill battle , ” said Jessanne Collins , 29 , who was Playgirl ’s senior editor .
Bob Dylan ’s room at the Chelsea Hotel has gotten a reprieve .
The city Buildings Department issued a stop - work order on renovations to Room 211 – where in the 1970s Dylan wrote his famed “ Sad - Eyed Lady of the Lowlands ” – after The Post revealed that the hotel ’s new owners were ripping it apart .
The order said the hotel was doing work beyond its permit ’s scope – work a hotel spokesman said was shoring up an unstable wall .
The blog Living with Legends called it unlikely “ Dylan ’s room can be returned to its former glory ” but said “ at least these vandals should n’t be allowed to profit from their depraved act of destruction . ”
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
At the Hard Rock Café on Thursday , it was clear who won Palin Bingo .
Young voters play Palin Bingo during the vice presidential debate on Thursday in Atlanta , Georgia .
The game was the focus of a group of four friends , all in their 20s and early 30s , as they put Xs in boxes containing keywords they anticipated Gov. Sarah Palin might say during Thursday 's vice presidential debate .
Words like : Special needs , Wasilla , maverick , Main Street , Washington outsider .
" Special needs ... I won bingo ! " shouted Laura Butler , 30 .
Satisfied with her win , and a full hour into the debate between Republican Palin and Democrat Sen .
Joe Biden , she headed for the door .
" I thought it was entertaining and so , you know , it was fun , " she said , a White Stripes song blaring in the background .
" I 'm an [ Sen. Barack ]
Obama supporter , and I could n't see anything changing that , " said Butler 's 27 - year - old friend Ryan Carrabine .
The event was sponsored by the nonpartisan organization Rock the Vote , which registered 1.9 million voters ages 18 - 25 this year .
Tonight 's debate was the only vice presidential debate scheduled before the November 4 election .
Half his bingo card filled , Daryll Cordeiro , 30 , said he was unimpressed with both candidates ' responses on nearly every topic from health care to Iraq .
He said he 'll probably vote for a third - party candidate .
Watch how the debate left some young voters wanting more substance »
Many in the room could n't point to specific issues they felt went unanswered .
Rather , they said they wanted to be moved , they wanted to feel something .
They wanted to see some genuine fire behind the podiums , not hear another campaign pitch .
" Biden 's response to gay marriage was more PC because he was saying he did n't feel like it should be the government 's choice and that it should be left up to the individual 's choice , " said Aaronica Merritt , 25 .
She thought the debate was engaging , but said Palin is not ready for the White House .
" The only reason why she was prepared for this debate was because she had a script , " she said .
" I think that Biden made really good arguments about health care and about the war in Iraq by bringing up that McCain voted against funding the troops just as Obama did . "
Merritt is torn because she is adamantly anti-abortion , which aligns with Palin and McCain 's platform , but is for gay marriage , which attracts her to the Obama - Biden side .
This year will mark the first time she has voted in a presidential election , she said .
Previous elections made her yawn , says Merritt .
" I just did n't think there was a strong enough difference between John Kerry and George Bush , " Merritt said .
" Now , there is a huge difference , and there 's just a much higher degree of interest overall , and you feel energized .
You feel like , for once , I 'm being addressed ; for once my generation might count for something when it comes to deciding who is our president . "
Others were less impressed .
" I 'm disgusted by the whole process because I do n't see a difference between either of them : Obama , McCain , Palin or Biden , " Cordeiro said .
" [ Biden and Palin ] are agreeing on so much .
You take tax reform , for instance .
What did they say that was different , really ?
They are n't speaking to me .
There 's all this talk about change , change , change .
It 's all gimmicks . "
But Georgia State University student Bryan Lariscy , who was leaning toward voting for Obama , said Palin did a great job taking on Biden .
" She took some cheap shots , but it worked for her , and I think she 's doing really , really well , " he said .
" Biden is not doing so well .
He 's holding back way too much .
He should be saying a lot more to her , taking her on more . "
When Palin took a shot at the mainstream media , several in the crowd looked at each other and chuckled .
" If it really mattered , if it was really close between Obama and McCain , I would go with Obama , " Butler said , sipping a tall peach drink .
" But that 's not because I like him or that he speaks to me .
He does n't .
They are all the same .
But I do n't like McCain .
It 's a matter , to me , of who you do n't want . "
The Rock the Vote event was intended to register new voters .
But no one registered to vote during the debate , according to volunteer Demarcus Peters , and most of the tables cleared out before the debate was over .
Peters , 31 , owns a nonprofit community development business in Atlanta .
" I think people in this room really cared what was going on in this debate , " he said .
" People were holding their breath waiting for Palin to make a big mistake .
I think this event was fairly successful .
But I could see the excitement here .
No one can say that overall young people do n't care what 's going on . "

Five things to watch in Georgia 's runoff
The prospect of a 60 - seat , filibuster - resistant Senate majority rests on the outcome of Tuesday ’s runoff between Georgia Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss and Democratic challenger Jim Martin .
With Democrats holding at 58 seats and just two Senate races still to be decided , if Chambliss manages to win a second term , the too - close - to - call Minnesota Senate contest between GOP Sen .
Norm Coleman and Democrat Al Franken suddenly loses much of its national relevance .

Here are five things to watch in Georgia ’s Senate runoff .
Turnout
Forget about the issues .
Only one thing matters in this runoff — turning out voters .
The party that does a better job of mobilizing its base will capture this seat .
Turnout is expected to be considerably lighter than a month ago , when John McCain carried Georgia by a surprisingly narrow 52 percent to 47 percent over Barack Obama .
Obama ’s solid performance was powered by a record African - American turnout , with black voters accounting for over 30 percent of the votes cast — about five percentage points higher than in the 2004 presidential campaign .
Democrat Jim Martin will need a comparably high African - American turnout to have a shot at winning , but there are signs he may fall short .
Through Monday , African - Americans made up only 22.5 percent of the 492,000 voters who cast early ballots — a far lower share than either the 35 percent who cast early ballots for the Nov. 4 election or who voted on Election Day .
If black turnout is in the low 20 percent range , there ’s almost no way Martin can win .
DeKalb County
Home to one of the most affluent African - American suburban communities in the nation , majority - black DeKalb County is the most heavily Democratic large county in Georgia — it delivered more votes to John Kerry in 2004 than any other in the state , including Atlanta ’s Fulton County .
This year , Obama won more total votes in Fulton County , but he won a greater percentage in neighboring DeKalb .
By winning a staggering 79 percent of the DeKalb vote , Obama took a 189,000 - vote margin out of the county .
Likewise , Martin crushed Chambliss in DeKalb County , 76 percent to 21 percent , to win by a 168,000 - vote margin .
So if Martin pulls off a win in the runoff , chances are it will be anchored in DeKalb County .
" DeKalb is key — if [ Democrats ] turned African - Americans out there , it points to a larger , good strategy , ” said Nick Ayers , the executive director of the Republican Governors Association and a former campaign manager for Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue .
“ If they fail to do so , there is nowhere else they can make it up , period . "
The GOP ’s suburban and exurban firewall
Republicans do n’t have any single stronghold comparable in size to DeKalb County .
But they do have a suburban and exurban firewall in the metro Atlanta area that begins with populous Gwinnett and Cobb counties .
In his 2002 win , Chambliss won both with 60 percent of the vote or more .
But this year , his performance in these counties dropped to 53 percent .
Some of that was due to the strength of the Obama field effort , and some of it can be attributed to demographic changes in Cobb and Gwinnett .
Either way , Chambliss needs to amp up his ground game in both places if he hopes to win .
What the polls say
On Election Day , Chambliss won 49.8 percent of the vote to Martin ’s 46.8 percent , not far off the RealClearPolitics polling average for the race .
Since then , the GOP senator has led in every poll taken during the runoff campaign , and Martin has n’t broken 47 percent in any of them .
Still , there is a great deal of uncertainty in the polling since even pollsters admit the difficulty of projecting black turnout .
Obama vs. Palin
The runoff post - mortems will invariably mention the roles played by President - elect Obama and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin .
While Obama chose not to campaign for the Democratic challenger , he cut a one - minute radio ad for Martin , and more than 100 Obama field organizers assisted with get - out - the - vote efforts .
Martin , meanwhile , has done everything possible to connect himself to the president - elect .
As a result , a Martin victory will almost certainly burnish Obama ’s reputation , despite the fact that Obama chose not to expend much political capital , and a loss will be hard to pin on the president - elect since he avoided any direct , high - profile involvement .
Palin , the unsuccessful GOP vice presidential nominee , also stands to gain , no matter the outcome .
By making a handful of well - attended appearances with Chambliss on the eve of the runoff , she reminded other aspiring Republican politicians of her ability to excite the base — which could make her a hot property during the 2010 election cycle .
She also managed to collect a few political chits that could prove helpful in 2012 , and once again proved her status as cable television news catnip , as evidenced by extensive coverage of her Georgia visit .

When guide dogs are retired from service , it is common for them to enter a state best described as old - aged adolescence .
As they begin to understand that they 're no longer responsible for the safety of their owner , the dogs can become almost puppyish , amazed by the unfamiliar freedom of irresponsibility .
It 's now 12 years since the first ever female , publicly named director general of MI5 retired from duty , and when we meet this week she is unrecognisable from then .
The severe - looking woman with the brutally sensible crop and the dry , institutionalised reserve has softened into velvety folds of laughter , and a warmly engaging ease .
Stella Rimington has just published her fourth novel , Dead Line , an elegantly pacy thriller starring a female MI5 agent , and at 73 she gives the impression of someone enjoying the novelty of speaking her mind .
The effect is not strident so much as touching .
Usually when people are being interviewed , you can see them telling themselves not to say too much , but before Rimington answers a question she often seems to be reminding herself that she really can let go .
" Yes , it is a gradual process , " she agrees , smiling .
" The shades of one 's former existence do hang around for quite a long time .
It takes a long time to get rid of that .
And I still have n't entirely got rid of it . "
She is n't doing badly though .
She spoke out against 42 - day detention last month , and this week welcomes the government 's climb - down unequivocally .
" We should n't introduce new intrusions into our civil liberties unless they are absolutely necessary - and nobody had demonstrated that they were necessary .
If there is n't any need , then do n't move the boundaries . "
She argues that we should " treat terrorism as a crime , and deal with it under the law - not as something extra , that you have to invent new rules to deal with . "
She is opposed to ID cards , because she can't see how they could be " a significant counter - terrorist measure " , and although she admits she 's " had more time to think about it since I left the service " , she says her attitude to civil liberties has always been liberal .
The big change , she argues , has been not her position , but the politicisation of the issue .
" One of the things I have observed in the last few years , since I left , is that national security has become much more of a political issue .
And that parties are tending to use it as a way of trying to get at the other side .
You know , " she adopts a mocking playground tone , " ' We 're more tough on terrorism than you are . '
I think that 's a bad move , quite frankly .
" After the vote in the House of Lords , one heard the home secretary saying something like , ' Well nobody can say I 'm not tough on terrorism ' .
As though the implication was there are people who are n't .
Which strikes me as very odd .
Because most of the people in the House of Lords whose contributions to that debate I 'd read were serious people , who 'd possibly spent a life , as I have , trying to protect the country from serious threats .
So the implication that , you know , a politician was going to say ' I 'm tougher on terrorism than you are ' struck me as ... " and she flicks a wrist , batting away the boast with the back of her hand like a fly .
" And it 's happened broadly since 9/11 . "
The response to 9/11 was " a huge overreaction " , she says .
" You know , it was another terrorist incident .
It was huge , and horrible , and seemed worse because we all watched it unfold on television .
So yes , 9/11 was bigger , but not ... not ... "
Not qualitatively different ?
" No .
That 's not how it struck me .
I suppose I 'd lived with terrorist events for a good part of my working life , and this was , as far as I was concerned , another one . "
Rimington hopes President Bush 's successor will stop using the phrase " war on terror " .
" It got us off on the wrong foot , because it made people think terrorism was something you could deal with by force of arms primarily .
And from that flowed Guantánamo , and extraordinary rendition , and ... "
And Iraq , I suggest .
" Well yes , " she says drily .
" Iraq . "
Jacqui Smith gave a speech this week on international terrorism which rather remarkably failed to mention the war in Iraq at all .
I ask Rimington what importance she would place on the war , in terms of its impact on the terrorist threat .
She pauses for a second , then replies quietly but firmly : " Look at what those people who 've been arrested or have left suicide videos say about their motivation .
And most of them , as far as I 'm aware , say that the war in Iraq played a significant part in persuading them that this is the right course of action to take .
So I think you can't write the war in Iraq out of history .
If what we 're looking at is groups of disaffected young men born in this country who turn to terrorism , then I think to ignore the effect of the war in Iraq is misleading . "
These might not be unremarkable views for most Guardian readers - of whom Rimington is one .
But according to Rimington , they are widely held within the intelligence service - much more so than most members of the public , and perhaps particularly Guardian readers , ever suspect .
" I do n't think I 'm unusual , frankly .
It 's the general public 's , or whoever 's it is , view that 's out of date . "
She points out that Baroness Manningham - Buller , another former head of MI5 , has been " saying broadly the same things .
I think what that reflects is that the caricature of the service is out of date now .
" People [ in the intelligence service ] are very conscious of the possibility of intrusions into civil liberties - and therefore the importance of restricting that to the extent of what 's strictly necessary .
I think people are fully aware that the more you intrude into people 's civil liberties , the more you set up grievances for people to , you know , encourage people to do all the unpleasant things that are going on . "
At times the picture Rimington paints of MI5 seems almost too good to be true .
She has always said she never carried a gun ; none of her agents were ever killed ; MI5 does not kill people ; it does not spy on the prime minister - not even Harold Wilson - or even vet BBC journalists ( even though the BBC has admitted submitting names for vetting ) .
As I run through the list , she anticipates the next question , and grins : " So what do we do ? "
No , I say .
My point was going to be that , well , you would say that , would n't you ?
What I mean is that we all know she 's not at liberty to tell the whole , unedited truth about her old job - so how can we know how much of her account to trust ?
She looks hurt , and then insulted .
" Why would I wish to engage in this and tell you a load of garbage ?
It would be a waste of everyone 's time , including my own .
Maybe what you ought to be looking at is , are you pursuing a myth about what British intelligence does ?
Are you still back in the days when people thought that we were like the Stasi ?
If that 's where you 're coming from then you should n't be surprised when my answer to your questions is no that does n't happen .
Because it does n't .
" The point I 'm making is that if journalists ask me certain questions and get the answer no , could it be that they 're asking the wrong questions ?
You 're assuming if you get the answer no , I 'm saying we do n't do anything - so I must be lying .
But the thing is subtle .
If the answer 's no , it 's because the question is n't the right question . "
Has she ever given an untrue answer to a question ?
" I 'm not in the business of giving untrue answers , " she says coolly .
" I do n't think it 's helpful . "
Rimington has herself , though , been on the receiving end of some deliberate unpleasantness from her old service , and admits it shook her .
In 2001 she wrote her autobiography , infuriating her former employer - and when she submitted the manuscript for clearance , someone put it in a taxi and sent it to the Sun .
Suddenly , she discovered what it felt like to be on the wrong side .
I ask if the experience had ever made her reconsider or doubt anything she 'd done in office .
" I do n't think I doubted anything we 'd done , " she says quickly .
" But - well , I think I maybe did think more about people 's reaction to the secret state .
When you 're in the secret state you are , hopefully , pretty confident of the probity of everything you 're doing , and the reason for it .
And perhaps you do n't think that much about how it looks to people outside .
Not that I think you necessarily should be thinking that - because it 's not your role .
" But I think I had this sense suddenly that , having been in the heart of it , here I was on the outside submitting this manuscript to the system and I had no control or knowledge of what was going on in that system .
And I thought , hmm , I think this must be how people feel when they 're dealing with the state machine in many of its manifestations - this Kafka - esque thing . "
Apple 's plans for its new recruit from IBM , Mark Papermaster , have been dealt an at least temporary setback as a federal judge has ordered him to halt any work at his new employer .
US Federal District Judge Kenneth Karas late on Friday ordered the new executive to " immediately cease " work with Apple until the court had come to a decision on whether his employment there breaches the non-compete clause in his contract with IBM that prompted a lawsuit .
The ruling sets back Apple 's plans to have Papermaster replace long - serving senior official Tony Fadell , who is leaving the elevated position at the consumer electronics maker for personal reasons .
Apple and Papermaster 's lawyers have already mounted a defense in the legal filings meant to avert trouble for the candidate , arguing that his top spot in the division handling the iPhone and iPod touch carries too narrow a scope to risk trade secrets leaking out .
Lawyers for Papermaster also claim that requiring him to obey the non-compete clause , regardless of its particular relevance , would be " incredibly damaging " to his career as it would keep him out of touch with the industry .
IBM disagrees and contends that the nature of processors , regardless of whether they belong in the servers Papermaster would have dealt with or the ARM chips that Papermaster may see , makes it too dangerous to allow one of its senior staffers to switch hands .

Yesterday ’s big news included the fact that Americans lost two trillion dollars in housing wealth last year .
That ’s one heck of a big number – except that like most of the big numbers we actually see in the news these days , it radically understates the reality .
You see 2 trillion is just the amount that they claim you could have sold your house for in 2007 vs. 2008 .
But that does n’t really tell the whole story .
Because , of course , this assumes that most of us could access the value of our homes if we wanted to .
But for many people , that ’s no longer possible at all .
For example , for many thousands of people who plan to stay in their homes and would like to access the equity in their homes through home equity lines have seen them revoked .
Millions of people cannot sell their homes at any price , because they are now underwater , and the banks will not permit a short sale , or because they ca n’t afford to lose their downpayment , but can afford to keep paying the mortgage .
Still more simply could not sell their homes at any price they are willing to accept , because nothing at all is selling , and they cannot find a buyer who can get credit .
The functional value of many homes in the US is very low or negative – that is , the house will continue to cost you mortgage payments and taxes , but you cannot functionally extract any value from them .
Realistically , many , many trillions are now tied up in housing as functionally “ lost ” value .
For many aging folks who had relied on their housing as an “ investment , ” and for the many elderly who had most of their wealth tied up in their houses , they will find that not only can they not cash out , they may no longer be able to trade their housing for care in their old age – assisted living depends on high valuation of homes – right now , it seems that few companies wish to take this in trade .
Is the whole story of home ownership unremittingly bleak , however ?
If you are underwater , is that the end of home ownership for you ?
My own take is that it is n’t , that there are several ways to shift the economic situation so that homes move from the debit column to the asset column .
The first is to shift your thinking .
Until not too long ago , people rarely thought of their homes , primarily as assets .
Your home is , well , your home .
Its value lies not in its potential sale price , or your ability to trade it for something , its value lies in its function .
Now only you can evaluate whether you will be paying too high a price for that home – and this is something we all need to think through .
But if your house is worth the price to you , too tight a focus on its “ official ” value distracts from the reality – one ’s home is one ’s home .
But that ’s not all there is to it .
Right now most of us with mortgages are pouring money into our houses .
None of us can afford a money pit right now – we might as well at least pay rent , and receive basic services and allow others to take the economic risk and make the repairs if we are simply going to pay out ( please do not mistake me , I do n’t think renting is a bad idea , in fact – but this post my primary focus is on the present homeowning majority ) .
So your house has to not just shelter you , but either help you produce money or enable you to reduce other costs .
That means that you need to evaluate your home for what else it can do for you .
Can you grow a garden , and reduce food costs ?
Plant fruit trees , nuts and berries ?
Raise chickens , rabbits or bees to provide food and fertility ?
Raise larger livestock ?
Produce some of your home heating or cooking energy in the form of anything from coppiced firewood to twigs and dried grasses for a tiny hot rocket fire to stir fry over ?
Could extra rooms in your home enable you to produce additional income or reduce total costs .
Could you rent out a room , make an apartment and rent that , or take in a housemate ?
Could you consolidate with your family or with friends ?
Do you really need all the space you have ?
Do you have a workshop that would enable you to do home repairs , fix your own appliances and otherwise cut back on new purchases and hired labor ( you may have already done this , but if you do n’t , it is time ? ) .
Do you have the equipment to mend and repair your own clothing , rather than replace it , or perhaps even make new ?
Could any of these things ( or something else ) be adapted into an income stream ?
That is can you make , build , repair , mend , cook , tend or do something else that is needed in your neighborhood ?
There are hundreds of small businesses that can be run from your home part time – everything from small scale programming to selling bulk foods , from daycare to mending and handyman work .
These have the dual effect of offering you an economic fallback position , making your home into an asset ( and potentially reducing your tax burden in some cases ) , and also by engaging with the people immediately around you , improving local economies and communities .
Suburban and rural garages and barns offer the possibility of even more than cottage industry – a business that might eventually employ others in your neighborhood .
Think about what you depend on , and what will be needed in your community - is it possible that your garage might be the new general store ?
That your small greenhouse operation might employ your neighbors eventually ?
That yours might be the neighborhood bakery or restaurant ?
Those of us who live in areas away from commerce might start thinking in terms of establishing local businesses – these may need to stay under the table until enforcement of restrictive regulations is reduced – that is , you might start baking for a couple of neighbors by barter , while also gradually working on finding the equipment to expand eventually .
What about community as an asset .
If you stay put in a place where you have ties ( and this presumes we have done the work of making those ties ) , can they provide a measure of security , of safety , of assistance that we once relied on economic assets for – that is , the neighbors who watch out for you , who help out during illness , who will work with you , who send over a pot of soup when they have extras – those are assets of economic value as well , and must be considered in the calculation .
Staying put can enable us to keep those assets in place .
In many cases , if you are committed to keeping your home – because it is near your family , because it has an ideal yard to grow food in , because you are tied to your community – you will need several of these strategies .
And they may be hard to enact at first – for example , it may be hard to decided who gets to keep their house when the need for family consolidation comes up .
Who moves in with who , and how do we protect the interests of those who do n’t own ?
How do we handle multiple parties working out of the same house ?
How do we get used to less privacy and less personal space ?
The other calculation we need to make is the truly long term value of these homes .
Wealth in the US is disproportionally concentrated in the hands of older people – high housing prices and rapidly inflating educational costs along with stagnant real wages mean that those who bought into markets decades ago got most of the actual wealth .
Older people and younger ones have a shared crisis – the elderly and aging baby boomers who relied on financial investments and housing to ensure security in their old age no longer can rely on either of those things .
Younger people who could n’t get into the markets , or could n’t do it without extortionate rates and minimal downpayments have either had no opportunity to own a house or will lose that option rapidly .
So we have older folks with houses , but with declining investment income and a declining number of years of employment , and younger people who can work , but who ca n’t get into the housing market , who ca n’t afford a mortgage and who soon , by defaulting on student loans and mortgages , wo n’t be able to for a long time .
You may not be able to trade a house for assisted living anymore , but you might be able to trade a future in your home for help in your old age – it might be as bluntly mercenary as that , but in most cases , it wo n’t be , it will be a familial relationship .
But aging baby boomers and the elderly in the US are facing an economic crisis – and they are going to have to start thinking of their homes as a long term asset to be passed down to children and grandchildren – and those children are going to have to start seeing themselves as stewards of a resource , the people who care for the family home , so that their own posterity can inherit it , and who in turn , care for their own parents and relations so that someone will do the same for them .
The shift of housing from a salable asset to something worth holding , a source of income and reduced costs , the place where you live out your life , and the place where your children grow up , come to adulthood , and come home to is going to be the great psychological and economic shift of our times , I suspect .
And any calculation of the value of our homes must begin from this complex question of what our homes are worth – as I say above , I think many of us will find that the answer is both less and more than we ever expected .

Iberdrola Adopts Wind Industry 's First Company - Wide Avian and Bat Protection Plan
December 2nd , 2008 by Timothy B. Hurst
[ social_buttons ]
Oregon - based Iberdrola Renewables has adopted what is arguably the most holistic policy to protect avian and bat populations in the wind energy industry .
The plan is modeled in part after the 2005 avian protection plan template ( pdf ) developed by the Edison Institute and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to address the impacts of transmission and distribution lines on birds .
Currently , 836 species of migratory birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act .
Many birds and bats are also protected by the Endangered Species Act and other federal and state wildlife statutes .
The Iberdrola Renewables ’ plan establishes internal processes that will help the company responsibly develop wind energy while addressing wildlife concerns .
What exactly does the plan do ?
According to the release :
“ IBERDROLA RENEWABLES ’ plan contains a corporate policy about wildlife protection and establishes a process for contact with agencies and non-governmental organizations early in the site assessment stage of project evaluation .
It also sets up internal policies for pre- and post - construction monitoring and proper site design , impact assessment , permit compliance , nest management , training , mortality reduction measures and mitigation .
It supports IBERDROLA RENEWABLES ’ efforts on research and includes sections on quality control , public awareness , cost and implementation . ”
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service commended Iberdrola Renewables for seeking ways to minimize bird and bat deaths at their wind turbine facilities .
USFWS Director H. Dale
Hall says the plan ’s principles “ will reduce risk to birds and liability under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act . ”
The plan is designed to mitigate or eliminate avian - collision problems that plague projects like the ones at California ’s Altamont Pass .
Altamont Pass is both home to and provides migration territory for many sensitive avian species including golden eagles , the red - tailed hawk and others .
According to The Center for Biological Diversity , wind turbines at Altamont Pass kill ( pdf ) an estimated 880 to 1,300 birds of prey each year , including up to 116 golden eagles , 300 red - tailed hawks , 380 burrowing owls , and additional hundreds of other raptors including kestrels , falcons , vultures , and other owl species .
Iberdrola ’s plan moves beyond mitigating for migratory birds , it also considers wind farm effects on bat populations .
Bats in Colorado , Minnesota , Oregon , Wisconsin and Wyoming have been found dead due to collisions with the turbine blades and support structure .
However , bat related fatalities were not raised as a serious concern until 2004 , when hundreds of bats turned up dead at wind farms in West Virginia and Pennsylvania .
Further research at these and other sites has found that localized changes in air pressure caused by wind turbines were killing bats without even hitting them .
“ Environmental protection is integral to how we conduct company business , ” said Terry Hudgens , CEO of Iberdola .
“ Implementing this plan will help us reduce our impacts on birds and bats and help us do a better job of expanding wind energy as an important source of electricity in the United States . ”
This is not the first time Iberdrola has made headlines concerning the company ’s ecologically - sensitive approach to wind farm development .
Back in June , the company delayed a wind farm in New York until the devastating impacts of white nose syndrome on bat populations could be better understood .

WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators have accused billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban of insider trading for allegedly using confidential information on a stock sale to avoid more than $ 750,000 in losses .
The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil lawsuit against Cuban on Monday in federal court in Dallas .
The agency said that in June 2004 , Cuban was invited to get in on the coming stock offering by Mamma.com Inc. after he agreed to keep the information private .
The SEC said Cuban knew his stake -- pegged at 600,000 shares , or 6 percent ownership in the company -- would be sold below the current market price after learning that Mamma.com was raising money through a private investment in a public entity ( also known as a PIPE ) .
A few hours after receiving the information , Cuban told his broker to sell all shares in the search engine company , according to the suit .
It seems Dr. Phil likes to capitalize on transgender misunderstanding and hatred on his show .
" You fool me once shame on you , you fool me twice shame on me "
We must commit to no longer stand idly by as Dr. Phil continues his knack and enjoyment for stigmatizing trans folks .
He previously held a program on " Gender Confused Kids " even going so low as to bring in an " expert " from the queerphobic , anti-science & psychology Focus on the Family .
He has two upcoming shows that deal with transsexuality , and they are currently looking for guests .
One titled " Is It Wrong For a Little Boy To Wear Pink ? "
" Do you think parents who allow their children to dress in opposite sex clothes are wrong ?
That boys should not be allowed to play with dolls ?
Girls should n't be into super heroes ?
Or do you have a child who wanted to play with something of the opposite sex but you would not allow it ?
Do you feel that boundaries should be set so that young girls play with Barbies and should love the color pink while boys should like sports , action figures , and playing rough ? "
" Does your child seem confused about his / her gender ?
Do you feel your daughter is a tomboy ?
Does she love sports , hanging with the boys or despise the color pink ?
Or does your son dress up in your clothes , wear your shoes or even put on your make - up ?
Does he play with dolls instead of action figures ?
Are you concerned about your child and worried this may end up being more than just a phase ?
Is it even causing tension in your marriage ?
OR , are you someone who used to cross - dress as a child but now you 've outgrown it ? "
Just the wording of this show is offensive and plays into gender stereotyping .
Why is n't there a call for parents and real experts who are supportive of their trans children , or is this only to have a one sided view on people who want to express trans - bigotry .
The other show once again plays on the so called " abnormality " of trans people .
The title is called " Gender Confused Child ?
This show is once again asserting that transgender behavior is confusion , sick , and somehow can be " cured " .
These shows are offensive , transphobic , and Dr. Phil is continuing to put out misinformation in the name of psychology .

Adding an Online Savings Account as Part of Your Investment Strategy
That ’s right .
The old and boring online savings account should be part of anyone ’s investment strategy because it ’s highly liquid and there ’s not much investment vehicles safer than a FDIC insured savings account .
When we think of investing , CDs or saving accounts usually do n’t come to mind because of :
The perception of low returns Saving accounts are often categorized for the highly conservative None of the investment media ( websites , newspapers , radio , TV etc ) seldom talk about it
Instead , they talk about money markets , treasury bills and the like to make it seem like sophisticated investors never put money in saving accounts .
As a consequence , many people have a misconception that saving accounts are just bad and if you ever want to get ahead , cash should be in money market or treasury bills .
FDIC Insurance and High Yield
What CNBC and the like do n’t tell you is that big investors do n’t put money in saving accounts because they cannot get the same deal as retail investors like us .
Since the FDIC has traditionally insured up to $ 100,000 ( recently increased to $ 250,000 ) per account holder , it does n’t really help money managers with hundreds of millions of dollars .
Instead , they put their money in treasury bills which currently offers negative returns for exchange that the government will protect its principle !
On the other hand , we ( those of us that do n’t have cash of more than $ 250,000 sitting around ) have an open offer for 100 % of the money insured plus about 3 % annually in interests with absolutely no obligations in online savings accounts !
I bet that if the same deal is offered to any money manager with their millions , they would jump on it immediately !
A Look at Different Options
There are many offers online so it ’s important to make sure that the online bank is FDIC insured having a trusted name .
Here are a few to consider :
HSBC Direct Online Savings – Many people who came from UK or Hong Kong loves HSBC and trust this bank .
With its 1.55 % interest at its online savings account and the ability to transfer funds within its own accounts with ease ( even between across accounts opened in different countries ) , this option is a solid offering for those who can take advantage .
WTDirect – Currently , WTDirect is offering 1.76 % annual interest rate when you open an account with them , one of the best rates available today .
E*Trade Max Yield Savings Account –
This is a must have for those that have a E* Trade brokerage account because you can easily transfer money from the online savings account to and from the savings and use it to buy and sell securities on the same day !
The current yield is 0.95 % which is not bad at all !
Discover Bank –
This online savings account is backed by the highly profitable credit card business and offers one of the highest rate in the industry today .
How Do You Use It
For the high yield alone , I ’ve switched to using only online savings accounts for my cash a few years ago .
In fact , I have an account with all of the above institutions and will transfer money to the one that offers the highest yield at the time .
Even though there ’s a limit on 6 withdrawals per month on each account , it does n’t bother me at all because I never even get close to that many withdrawals .
Conclusion
If you ’ve never opened an online savings account before , please do n’t follow my strategy and open all 4 savings accounts above .
Instead , pick one that you like and open just one account and try to learn the interface and get comfortable with managing your cash this way before adding others .
The last thing you want to do is over complicate your finances and investments .
However , if you have an online savings account already and see that one of the bank above offers a higher yield , take advantage right away because not going for the highest yield is almost just like giving up free money !
Putting your money in online savings accounts might not get you hot dates but it will sure help your wealth building strategy !

2008 may have been a bad year for just about everything else , but it was a great year for cookbooks .
Honestly , I ca n’t remember the last time this many gorgeous , fascinating and downright inspiring books hit the shelves in one year .
A couple of people I know have suggested that the worse the economy gets , the better the cookbook market will fare , since more people will turn to cooking both out of necessity and as a substitute for more expensive pleasures .
I do n’t know how true that is ( particularly since I know other people who are convinced of the opposite ) , but I ’d like to believe it ; in fact I ’d like to think that no matter what happens we ’ll never have a shortage of beautiful books to inform and inspire us , to help us get dinner on the table , and to provide us a window into countries and cultures we can only dream about visiting .
This year , for the first time , I ’ve assembled a list of my favorite books to hit the shelves .
My criteria for inclusion were simple : that they have been published in 2008 , that they ’re worth the precious space they occupy on my living room shelf , and that they get me completely , irrationally excited each time I pick them up .
Oh yeah , and that they have really good food inside . 🙂
Enjoy !
Beyond the Great Wall : Recipes and Travels in the Other China by Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid
I ’d been eagerly awaiting the release of this book , the third in the Asian trilogy by husband - and - wife team Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid , since I first caught wind of it two years ago .
The wait was worth it : it is stunning , every bit as beautiful and fascinating as their previous two ( which already feature on my ‘ top books of all time ’ list ) .
Like all their books , Beyond the Great Wall is as much a cultural exploration as a cookbook , in this case giving us insight into the people living physically and metaphorically ‘ beyond the great wall ’ of China – including the Tibetans , Mongolians , Uighurs , Miao , Kui , Dong and Dai – and as per usual with these authors , is illustrated with their own gorgeous location photographs ( as well as breathtaking studio photos by Richard Jung ) .
Food , of course , is the fabric that binds this journey together , and the recipes alone would be worth the cost of the book – things like Grasslands Herb Salsa , Silk Road Chickpea - Carrot Fritters , Kazakh Noodles with Goat Broth – but just as interesting and valuable are the sections on language , culture and history , as well as the authors ’ own travel stories , which span a time period of nearly thirty years .
And somewhat surprisingly for a cookbook , Alford and Duguid do n’t make any attempt to shy away from politically sensitive issues , freely giving their own views on the plight of minorities in China , which has predictably attracted some criticism .
Whether you agree with their views or not , however , this is most definitely a book to savor .
Turquoise : A Chef ’s Travels in Turkey by Greg and Lucy Malouf
I honestly did n’t think Australians Greg and Lucy Malouf would be able to top their previous ( and widely celebrated ) book Saha , a luscious homage to the cuisines of Syria and Lebanon , but somehow they pulled it off .
Turquoise – much in the vein of Beyond the Great Wall – is a knockout of a book exploring the culture and cuisine of Turkey , as seen through the eyes of chef Greg and writer Lucy as they travel through the country for the first time .
Lucy ’s wonderful stories and essays open each chapter , setting the stage for Greg ’s recipes – some carefully authentic , others more imaginative – and the whole thing is brought to vivid , full - color life with an abundance of gorgeous photos .
Honestly , this book seems to have people bewitched ; while I was browsing it at a local bookstore a few weeks ago , a girl walked by me , noticed what I was reading , and exclaimed , “ is n’t that just the most beautiful book you ’ve ever seen ? ”
Some books feel like no matter how much you pay for them they ’re still worth more , and this is one of those .
A Platter of Figs and Other Recipes by David Tanis
What can I possibly say about this book that you have n’t already read a dozen other places ?
I do n’t know , but I know I ca n’t leave it off my list .
Chef David Tanis has put together a true gem with this book : imaginative , seasonal recipes that effortlessly straddle the line between sophistication and simplicity , a strong personal voice to put them in context , and a collection of photographs so lovely I ’ve been tempted more than once to rip some out and stick them on the wall .
The soul of David ’s recipes is firmly rooted in his Chez Panisse background , though his influences are all over the map : Thai , Vietnamese , Mexican , Catalan , Moroccan , French …
Ultimately , though , this is a book about letting the food speak for itself and trusting your own instincts , something we can all use a reminder about from time to time .
Ottolenghi : The Cookbook by Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi
One of my biggest regrets about leaving the UK is that I never found the chance to visit Ottolenghi before I did , but now that I have their cookbook I guess I can postpone that return trip a little bit longer .
Ottolenghi is a small chain of London delicatessens run by Israeli expats Ottolenghi and Tamimi , who have won a devoted following for their generous , rustic , explosively - flavored food .
Hailing from the Mediterranean as they do , their recipes are of course heavily influenced by it ; things like garlic , lemon , pomegranate and za’atar are used with abandon , and fresh herbs , dried fruits and grains show up in all kinds of guises .
They ’re far from purists , though , and when all is said and done , whatever tastes best is what makes it into their dishes .
Whatever your style of cooking , you ’ll find some great inspiration here .
Note :
There has n’t been an American version of the book issued yet , so what you ’ll get from both amazon.com and amazon.
co.uk is the same edition – if you ’re looking to get a copy relatively quickly I ’d recommend ordering from the latter .
The Art of Mexican Cooking by Diana Kennedy
Let me just start by saying that if I had to choose just one Mexican cookbook to have in my collection , this would probably be it .
A re-issue of Diana Kennedy ’s 1989 classic , this has just about everything you could ever want to know about Mexican food inside , from dozens of variations on moles , enchiladas and salsas to things less familiar like moronga ( blood sausage ) , vitualla ( beef , rice and fruit stew ) , and minguichi ( cheese fried with chiles and cream ) , everything accompanied by in - depth cultural and geographical explanations .
Kennedy is famously abhorrent of shortcuts in Mexican cooking , and some might find many of her recipes on the labor - intensive side , but if what matters to you most is comprehensiveness and authenticity , I doubt you ’ll find a better compendium of south - of - the - border recipes anywhere .
The only gripe I have with the re-issue is that they still did n’t include any photos , but hey , that just leaves more room for recipes .
The Flavor Bible : The Essential Guide to Culinary Creativity by Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg
Are you an improvisational cook ?
Do you ever stand in front of a fridge full of ingredients and wonder how on earth you might assemble the contents into something edible ?
Do you dream at night about titillating new flavor combinations ?
Do you want to better understand the mechanisms of taste and learn how great chefs construct their dishes ?
If any of these apply to you , you ’ll want to have this book on your shelf tomorrow .
This is a self - described ‘ new breed of cookbook ’ , one that delivers not recipes , but inspiration .
I would call it more of an encyclopedia of taste , cataloging just about every ingredient under the sun and cross-referencing it with other complimentary ingredients , cuisines and cooking characteristics .
You ’ll learn that fennel pollen is a ‘ quiet ’ flavor , should be used only to finish a dish , and is complemented by things like fish , lemon and pistachios .
You ’ll learn that Chilean cuisine typically includes the flavors of corn , cumin , garlic , oregano and raisins .
You ’ll learn the different flavors and uses of piquillo , guindilla , ñora and choricero peppers in Spain .
You ’ll even learn how to compose an entire menu around flavor affinities .
I ’ve only begun to scratch the surface of what this book offers , but already I can tell that it ’s one of the most useful books I ’ve run across in a long time .
Cooking with Les Dames d’Escoffier : At Home with the Women Who Shape the Way We Eat and Drink by Pat Mozersky and Marcella Rosene
I was pleased to see that Epicurious gave honorable mention status to this book in their own top books lineup .
Published right here in Seattle by Sasquatch , this is a wonderful compendium of favorite recipes from a truly notable group of cooks , namely members of Les Dames d’Escoffier , the country ’s premier culinary association for women .
Among the dozens of chefs , farmers , winemakers , restaurateurs and instructors represented in this volume are many familiar names – Julia Child , Alice Waters , M.F.K .
Fisher , Marcella Hazan , Alice Medrich , Dorie Greenspan – and their contributions run the gamut from simple to spectacular while criss - crossing the globe several times : Piedmontese Wedding Soup , Catalan Pasta with Garlic Sauce , Texas Chile Rellenos , Jumbo Shrimp with Armenian Pesto , Tuxedo Philly Cheese Steak …
Is your mouth watering yet ?
Mine sure is .
Culinaria by Various
I know , I know , this is n’t one book , nor is it anything new – in fact , the Culinaria series has been around for years .
This year , however , the publisher has finally done exactly what I ’ve been waiting for : they ’ve started releasing the series in small paperback format .
Yes , rub your eyes and read that again .
Small and paperback .
Okay , small is relative ; these are now the size of most ‘ normal ’ hardback cookbooks , but if you ’re familiar with the size and heft of the originals , you know what a difference this is .
The content , luckily , has n’t been altered one bit .
Each of these books still contains some of the most in - depth explorations of national food landscapes ever published – from dishes both classic and obscure to regional products to festivals and celebrations , their breadth is encyclopedic and their information accurate .
If there ’s any drawback to these books it ’s that there ’s just too much information to digest – rather than sit down and read one all the way through you ’ll probably end up dipping in from time to time to learn about , say , chorizo - making in Spain or olive harvesting in Greece .
And I must admit I ’ve never been terribly tempted by the recipes , but in these books they seem kind of like an afterthought anyway .
So far , the ones to be released in this new format are Spain , France , Italy , Greece , Germany , Hungary , Russia and Southeast Asia .
Hopefully the rest will be coming soon !
Although thinking hard often feels like a workout , you do n’t actually burn more calories like you do when you break a sweat .
But you might feel hungrier anyway , according to a study published in the September issue of Psychosomatic Medicine .
Researchers from Canada ’s Université Laval found that strenuous mental activities , such as concentrating on an exam , may lead people to consume more calories than they burn during the task .
Subjects completed one of three assignments of varying difficulty — relaxing , reading a text and completing an intense task on a computer — then ate a buffet lunch .
Although the groups burned around the same amount of energy , students who performed the strenuous mental tasks , particularly the one on the computer , consumed significantly more calories than those who relaxed .
The researchers hypothesized that this discrepancy could lead to weight gain .
“ Computer - related activities represent a sedentary activity that is stressful and biologically demanding , ” says Dr. Jean - Philippe Chaput , a lead author on the study .
The students who had just finished the harder intellectual tasks ate around 200 more calories than did subjects who relaxed .
This heartier appetite may be due to the increase of glucose levels in the blood that occurs after completing the arduous assignments , but not after relaxing .
Brain processes such as thinking are fueled by glucose , a simple sugar found in food .
Prolonged thought requires more insulin , which may explain why completing the hardest task made subjects hungrier .
Chaput and his team proposed that this dependence on glucose causes deep concentration to boost energy intake , since the brain quickly burns glucose stores and needs replenishment from food .
“ Variations in glucose [ in the bloodstream ] may trigger episodes of hunger and higher food intake ” in order to re-establish the balance of glucose in the bloodstream and keep it from rapidly increasing and decreasing , says Chaput .
Roller coaster glucose levels can lead to obesity .
When the body releases insulin to mop up excess sugar in the bloodstream , blood sugar plunges .
This fast drop increases appetite in an effort to bring blood sugar levels back up .
After eating , the body releases even more insulin to get rid of extra glucose , and over time , this cycle of high and low blood sugar levels can impact metabolism , according to Loren Greene , an endocrinologist and obesity expert at New York University ’s Langone Medical Center .
“ People who are very stressed and studying for an exam might be up more hours to munch , ” says Greene .
The lack of sleep that often accompanies being overworked can also change the body ’s normal secretion of hormones , she says , increasing hunger and leading to cravings .
This new study explains the inclination to eat more when completing mentally difficult tasks and hopefully will give employees even more reason to exercise , according to Chaput .
“ [ Mental work ] deserves to be counterbalanced by an adequate physical activity regimen , ” he says .
So if night after night you ’ve been up until the sun rises studying for exams and your pants seem tighter , you may have your brain to blame .

American Humanist Association plays negative attention game with anti-Christmas message .
SCROOGE ALERT LEVEL : HIGH
This from AP :
WASHINGTON , D.C. —
You better watch out .
There is a new combatant in the Christmas wars .
Ads proclaiming , “ Why believe in a god ?
Just be good for goodness ’ sake , ” will appear on Washington , D.C. , buses starting next week and running through December .
The American Humanist Association unveiled the provocative $ 40,000 holiday ad campaign Tuesday .
In lifting lyrics from “ Santa Claus is Coming to Town , ” the Washington - based group is wading into what has become a perennial debate over commercialism , religion in the public square and the meaning of Christmas .
“ We are trying to reach our audience , and sometimes in order to reach an audience , everybody has to hear you , ” said Fred Edwords , spokesman for the humanist group .
“ Our reason for doing it during the holidays is there are an awful lot of agnostics , atheists and other types of non-theists who feel a little alone during the holidays because of its association with traditional religion . ”

Story / Blog Opinions
“ Rational thought ” ??
So as with almost all atheists , these elitist see religious people as irrational ( or crazy as the case may be ) .
If they were truly interested in just collecting like minded people together for Christmas , they would have titled their advertisement “ So You Do n’t Believe in God ?
Us Too ” not “ Why Believe in God ? ” – Jesus is Lord blog
_______________
“ It is the ultimate ‘ grinch ’ to suggest there is no God during a holiday where millions of people around the world celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ .
It is insensitive and mean , ” remarked Mathew D. Staver , founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel , a conservative Christian legal group that has defended the rights of cities and schools to display nativity scenes and Christmas decorations .
“ Christmas is a time of joy and hope , not a time for hate , ” added Staver .
“ Why believe in God ? – Because Santa is not the only one coming to town . ” – The Christian Post
_______________
But American Family Association President Tim Wildmon is calling the ad “ stupid ” : “ How do we define ‘ good ’ if we do n’t believe in God ?
God in his word , the Bible , tells us what ’s good and bad and right and wrong .
If we are each ourselves defining what ’s good , it ’s going to be a crazy world . ”

Humanists ’ ad ignites thoughts of God
… But Ray Comfort , founder of Living Waters Ministries and co host of The Way of the Master television show , says Christians can use the ad ’s admonition to “ be good ” to explain how everyone falls short when compared with God ’s perfect law .
“ Good in [ the Bible ] means moral perfection in thought , word , and deed — and only God is good , ” Comfort points out .
But everyone has their own idea of what good is , says the evangelist .
“ You ask anybody if they think they ’re a good person and they ’re going to come back and say — as the Bible says they will — ‘ I ’m a good person , ' ” Comfort comments .
“ I guarantee you if we had Adolf Hitler on the phone and we [ asked ] , “ Adolf ?
Are you a good person ? ’ — he would say , ‘ Yes .
I cleaned up Germany , provided full employment , and got rid of riff raff . ’
He ’d think he ’s a good person because he measured himself by his own standards .
“ What we ’ve got to do on Judgment Day is stand before the moral perfection of God ’s Holy Law — and that ’s why we each need a Savior , ” he concludes .
According to Comfort , the ad campaign is backfiring for the humanist group because it is making more people think about God. – OneNewsNow.com

Goodness has no meaning without religion
People mistakenly think ( as these AHA ads assume ) that goodness is pursued by frightened Christians seeking to pacify a capricious and angry God .
But goodness is not pursued to earn God ’s love .
The pursuit of goodness is the appreciative response to the love of God who sent his son to die for sinners .
In a healthy parent - child relationship , the child does n’t do chores to win his parent ’s love but in response to his parent ’s love .

Their goal is ” to plant a seed of rational thought and critical thinking and questioning in people ’s minds . ”
This assumes we have n’t done that already , of course .
Countless Christians have been asking tough questions and thinking carefully for millennia .

A new build of Apple 's forthcoming Mac OS X 10.5.6 update for Leopard has hit the streets .
Detailed in a leaked copy of release notes are what amount to 103 fixes across a wide gamut of components .
HMBT is once again bustin ' NDAs , taking names , and ensuring it gets scratched off Apple 's Christmas card list by posting ( again ) what appears to be the full copy of changes and bug fixes in this latest build , version 9G52 .
The first developer test build of 10.5.6 appeared at the end of October and contained over 50 fixes .
A subsequent build early in November brought that number to 90 , and a third build a week later brought 97 fixes and " no known issues " remaining .
Due to 10.5.5 's release in September a week after a developer build was also found to have no issues , some speculated that 10.5.6 could ship around mid-November .
Obviously , we are still 10.5.6 - free , as Apple apparently decided it still had a little more work to do .
In the spotlight ( ha ! ) of 9G52 are MobileMe syncing and Mail .
Apple is asking developers to bang on MobileMe 's automatic syncing feature with portable Macs and on networks with medium - to - high latency or constrained bandwidth .
Apple wants to hear from developers who work behind firewalls and corporate proxies , and it's also interested in hearing if changes sync between Macs and the MobileMe website within " a reasonable amount of time " when automatic syncing is turned on .
Until Exchange support arrives in Snow Leopard , though , " automatic " syncing means " 15 minutes at the most " with MobileMe , so we 're curious as to what Apple 's definition of " reasonable " is .
Additionally , Apple wants to hear from Mail users who send messages entirely in non-Latin languages like Hangul , Kotoeri , and Traditional Chinese .
Cyrillic , Hebrew , and Arabic are " good sets of writing systems to pound on " as well .
Sounds like we 'll need to wait a bit longer for 10.5.6 to arrive , but any improvements to MobileMe syncing reliability and speed are definitely worth it .
We 'll keep you posted .

I was just reading an article in PC World about “ geek cuisine , ” which apparently means caffeinated drinks / candy .
I ’m not sure why geeks are the only ones who have trouble staying awake ; I know just as many law students as programmers who are chugging red bulls at 2am .
In any case , I am a big supporter of , in particular , caffeinated mints .
Every few months I put in an order at Chemical Evolution and it ’ll last me for quite a while .
There ’s just nothing quite as convenient as a cup of coffee the size of a dime that tastes like an altoid ( though for some reason caffeine sometimes scares people in this form …
I ’ve had a co-worker berate me that I may as well just be doing speed as she drank her third cup of coffee ) .
In this last order , however , I decided to try something new and different : caffeinated chapstick .
I think that I ’ve seen at least one other brand at some point , but the kind I ’ve tried is Spazzstick , apparently developed by an Alaskan police officer .
It comes infused with caffeine and in a variety of flavors .
The problem is , I have no idea if it works .
It ’s sort of like that cold prevention stuff that you take when you feel the first signs of illness–does it really make your cold shorter or is that just how long it would have been anyway ?
It ’s not as if I ’m going to replace my morning coffee with lip balm , so I ’m really not sure if it ’s giving me an extra buzz or not .
So have any of you tried any unconventional forms of caffeination ?
I know that there ’s soap as well , but I ’ve never tried it .
It seems like that might be even more effective than chapstick , given sheer surface area of coverage .
The All India Sikh Students Federation ( AISSF ) has urged the clergy to take action against actor - producer Ajay .
In a letter to Akal Takht ( the highest temporal seat of the Sikh religion ) head Gurbachan Singh , AISSF president Karnail Singh demanded action against Ajay for hurting the religious sentiments of Sikhs .
The AISSF chief had said that the film has lines such as " If Sikhs were n't there , then who would have invented abuses " and " If Sardar were n't there , then on whom would the jokes be made " , are very demeaning .
" My film ' Son of Sardaar ' does not hurt anybody 's sentiments .
I 'm from Punjab and I have a lot of respect for the community and culture as everyone else and the last thing I would do is to hurt anyone .
In fact , I 'm very proud of the community , " Ajay said in a statement .
The 43 - year - old actor , whose roots are in Amritsar , insists that the film has been made under the guidance of knowledgeable people .
" At no point you will find any element of disrespect .
The protagonist of the film is a Sardaar , so the film will showcase a very positive projection of the community .
If you could just wait for the release and then come up with your comments and opinion .
Trust me , we all will be proud of the film , " Ajay said .
Punjab and Haryana High Court advocate Navkiran
Singh had also issued a legal notice in this regard to the makers of the film on August 16 and had asked them to delete objectionable portions from the movie .
The film , directed by Ashwini Dhir and starring Sonakshi Sinha , Sanjay Dutt and Juhi Chawla releases on November 13 .

The River Of Fire
Alexander Kalomiros
INTRODUCTION
" The River of Fire " was the keynote address delivered at the Orthodox Youth Conference sponsored by the parish of St. Nectarios American Orthodox Church at Seattle , Washington during July 22 - 25 , 1980 .
The address was delivered in English and well received .
The Most Reverend Archbishop of Canada , Vitaly , expressed his admiration not only when he said that " seldom does one read such texts which breathe forth the fragrance both of true knowledge and of personal experience , " but even more when he personally ordered the address to be translated and printed in Russian and French editions .
Dr. Kalomiros has been known and respected in the English - speaking Orthodox world since the publication of Against False Union translated into English from the Greek by George Gabriel and published by Holy Transfiguration Monastery .
This book , which has gone into a fourth printing , published by our parish , has been admired for its clarity in demonstrating Orthodox ecclesiology and analyzing and refuting the fundamental spiritual motivation of the Ecumenical movement .
The impact of this book alone would been enough to gain Dr. Kalomiros a respected place in the ranks of true and dedicated theologians .
However , his Figures of Things Celestial , which not only expounded the theological foundation of the Church 's use of iconography , but revealed a devotional understanding which impinges on Mystery , verified to the English - speaking world that he was a man who had transcended lifeless academic theology and propounded the living , experiential theology of the Holy Fathers .
The famed reviver of Byzantine iconography in Greece , the Master Iconographer Fotis Kontoglou , through personal correspondence with Dr. Kalomiros while he was yet a medical student in Switzerland , understood his caliber and encouraged him in his patristic studies .
Kontoglou wrote an introduction to the first Greek edition of Against False Union , published in 1964 , in which he expresses his admiration for the author and describes him as a true Orthodox theologian .
Indeed , Dr. Kalomiros reminds one of that other physician who turned his hand to theology , Eustratios Argentis , in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , who was a luminous guide and apologist for the beleaguered Orthodox of those times .
His writings were commissioned and printed by the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Patriarchate of Alexandria .
He was often called upon by them to publicly defend the Orthodox Faith .
Apparently , " a prophet is not without honor except in his own country , " for in spite of the commendation by Kontoglou and the value of Dr. Kalomiros ' other writings , the " River of Fire " had had no Greek edition whatsoever , although it existed in several foreign languages , having been , as we said , originally written in English .
Finally , in 1992 , a Greek translation by Petros Botsis was published by Zaphyros publishers in Greece .
It seems that the initial publication of this talk , along with the other addresses of our 1980 Orthodox Youth Conference , published originally by our parish , has found its way not only into the homes of many of the faithful on this continent , but even in far - away corners of the world .
Just recently , the present paper by Dr. Kalomiros appeared in a Serbian translation , published , apparently , by the Theological Academy of Belgrade .
The " River of Fire " is not only an analysis of Orthodox soteriology , of the workings of God 's dispensation and our Redemption , demonstrating that Orthodox theology has a unique understanding through the revelation of God .
It speaks even more to the driven soul , tormented by trials , who asks in desperation : How can God Who is good permit such evil ?
How can
He condemn me when these temptations and trials surpass by strength to resist ?
If He is merciful and loving , how can
He condemn me to such suffering here and in the life to come ?
The present publication is our offering to those many wounded souls , those known to us and those unknown , who can only find consolation for their sorrows in the bosom of the loving Father .

A reply to the questions : ( 1 ) Is God really good ?
( 2 ) Did God create hell ?
+ In the Name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Spirit .
Reverend Fathers , dear Brothers and Sisters :
There is no doubt that we are living in the age of apostasy predicted for the last days .
In practice , most people are atheists , although many of them theoretically still believe .
Indifference and the spirit of this world prevail everywhere .
What is the reason for this state ?
The reason is the cooling of love .
Love for God no more burns in human hearts , and in consequence , love between us is dead , too .
What is the cause of this waning of men's love for God ?
The answer , certainly , is sin .
Sin is the dark cloud which does not permit God 's light to reach our eyes .
But sin always did exist .
So how did we arrive at the point of not simply ignoring God , but of actually hating Him ?
Man 's attitude toward God today is not really ignorance , or really indifference .
If you examine men carefully you will notice that their ignorance or indifference is tainted by a deep hate .
But nobody hates anything that does not exist .
I have the suspicion that men today believe in God more than at any other time in human history .
Men know the gospel , the teaching of the Church , and God 's creation better than at any other time .
They have a profound consciousness of His existence .
Their atheism is not a real disbelief .
It is rather an aversion toward somebody we know very well but whom we hate with all our heart , exactly as the demons do .
We hate God , that is why we ignore Him , overlooking Him as if we did not see Him , and pretending to be atheists .
In reality we consider Him our enemy par excellence .
Our negation is our vengeance , our atheism is our revenge .
But why do men hate God ?
They hate
Him not only because their deeds are dark while God is light , but also because they consider Him as a menace , as an imminent and eternal danger , as an adversary in court , as an opponent at law , as a public prosecutor and an eternal persecutor .
To them , God is no more the almighty physician who came to save them from illness and death , but rather a cruel judge and a vengeful inquisitor .
You see , the devil managed to make men believe that God does not really love us , that He really only loves Himself , and that He accepts us only if we behave as He wants us to behave ; that He hates us if we do not behave as He ordered us to behave , and is offended by our insubordination to such a degree that we must pay for it by eternal tortures , created by Him for that purpose .
Who can love a torturer ?
Even those who try hard to save themselves from the wrath of God cannot really love Him .
They love only themselves , trying to escape God 's vengeance and to achieve eternal bliss by managing to please this fearsome and extremely dangerous Creator .
Do you perceive the devil 's slander of our all loving , all kind , and absolutely good God ?
That is why in Greek the devil was given the name DIABOLOS , " the slanderer " .
-- II --
But what was the instrument of the devil 's slandering of God ?
What means did he use in order to convince humanity , in order to pervert human thought ?
He used " theology " .
He first introduced a slight alteration in theology which , once it was accepted , he managed to increase more and more to the degree that Christianity became completely unrecognizable .
This is what we call " Western theology " .
Did you ever try to pinpoint what is the principal characteristic of Western theology ?
Well , its principal characteristic is that it considers God as the real cause of all evil .
What is evil ?
Is it not the estrangement from God Who is Life ?
1
Is it not death ?
What does Western theology teach about death ?
All Roman Catholics and most Protestants consider death as a punishment from God .
God considered all men guilty of Adam 's sin and punished them by death , that is by cutting them away from Himself ; depriving them of His life - giving energy , and so killing them spiritually at first and later bodily , by some sort of spiritual starvation .
Augustine interprets the passage in Genesis " If you eat of the fruit of this tree , you will die the death " as " If you eat of the fruit of this tree , I will kill you " .
Some Protestants consider death not as a punishment but as something natural .
But. is not God the creator of all natural things ?
So in both cases , God -- for them -- is the real cause of death .
And this is true not only for the death of the body .
It is equally true for the death of the soul .
Do not Western theologians consider hell , the eternal spiritual death of man , as a punishment from God ?
And do they not consider the devil as a minister of God for the eternal punishment of men in hell ?
The " God " of the West is an offended and angry God , full of wrath for the disobedience of men , who desires in His destructive passion to torment all humanity unto eternity for their sins , unless
He receives an infinite satisfaction for His offended pride .
What is the Western dogma of salvation ?
Did not God kill God in order to satisfy
His pride , which the Westerners euphemistically call justice ?
And is it not by this infinite satisfaction that He deigns to accept the salvation of some of us ?
What is salvation for Western theology ?
Is it not salvation from the wrath of God ?
2
Do you see , then , that Western theology teaches that our real danger and our real enemy is our Creator and God ?
Salvation , for Westerners , is to be saved from the hands of God !
How can one love such a God ?
How can we have faith in someone we detest ?
Faith in its deeper essence is a product of love , therefore , it would be our desire that one who threatens us not even exist , especially when this threat is eternal .
Even if there exists a means of escaping the eternal wrath of this omnipotent but wicked Being ( the death of His Son in our stead ) , it would be much better if this Being did not exist .
This was the most logical conclusion of the mind and of the heart of the Western peoples , because even eternal Paradise would be abhorrent with such a cruel God .
Thus was atheisrn born , and this is why the West was its birthplace .
Atheism was unknown in Eastern Christianity until Western theology was introduced there , too .
Atheism is the consequence of Western theology .
3
Atheism is the denial , the negation of an evil God .
Men became atheists in order to be saved from God , hiding their head and closing their eyes like an ostrich .
Atheism , my brothers , is the negation of the Roman Catholic and Protestant God .
Atheism is not our real enemy .
The real enemy is that falsified and distorted " Christianity " .
-- III --
Westerners speak frequently of the " Good God " ( E.g. , in France le bon dieu is almost always used when speaking of God. ) .
Western Europe and America , however , were never convinced that such a Good God existed .
On the contrary , they were calling God good in the way Greeks called the curse and malediction of smallpox , EULOGIA , that is , a blessing , a benediction , in order to exorcise it and charm it away .
For the same reason , the Black Sea was called -- the hospitable sea -- although it was , in fact , a dreadful and treacherous sea .
Deep inside the Western soul , God was felt to be the wicked Judge , Who never forgot even the smallest offense done to Him in our transgressions of His laws .
This juridical conception of God , this completely distorted interpretation of God 's justice , was nothing else than the projection of human passions on theology .
It was a return to the pagan process of humanizing God and deifying man .
Men are vexed and angered when not taken seriously and consider it a humiliation which only vengeance can remove , whether it is by crime or by duel .
This was the worldly , passionate conception of justice prevailing in the minds of a so - called " Christian " society .
Western Christians thought about God 's justice in the same way also ; God , the infinite Being , was infinitely insulted by Adam 's disobedience .
He decided that the guilt of Adam 's disobedience descended equally to all His children , and that all were to be sentenced to death for Adam 's sin , which they did not commit .
God 's justice for Westerners operated like a vendetta .
Not only the man who insulted you , but also all his family must die .
And what was tragic for men , to the point of hopelessness , was that no man , nor even all humanity , could appease God 's insulted dignity , even if all men in history were to be sacrificed .
God 's dignity could be saved only if He could punish someone of the same dignity as He .
So in order to save both God 's dignity and mankind , there was no other solution than the incarnation of His Son , so that a man of godly dignity could be sacrificed to save God 's honor .
-- IV --
This paganistic conception of God 's justice which demands infinite sacrifices in order to be appeased clearly makes
God our real enemy and the cause of all our misfortunes .
Moreover , it is a justice which is not at all just since it punishes and demands satisfaction from persons which were not at all responsible for the sin of their forefathers 4
In other words , what Westerners call justice ought rather to be called resentment and vengeance of the worst kind .
Even Christ 's love and sacrifice loses its significance and logic in this schizoid notion of a God who kills God in order to satisfy the so - called justice of God .
Does this conception of justice have anything to do with the justice that God revealed to us ?
Does the phrase " justice of God " have this meaning in the Old and New Testaments ?
Perhaps the beginning of the mistaken interpretation of the word justice in the Holy Scriptures was its translation by the Greek word DIKAIWSUNH .
Not that it is a mistaken translation , but because this word , being a word of the pagan , humanistic , Greek civilization , was charged with human notions which could easily lead to misunderstandings .
First of all , the word DIKAIWSUNH brings to mind an equal distribution .
This is why it is represented by a balance .
The good are rewarded and the bad are punished by human society in a fair way .
This is human justice , the one which takes place in court .
Is this the meaning of God 's justice , however ?
The word DIKAIWSUNH , " justice " , is a translation of the Hebraic word tsedaka .
This word means " the divine energy which accomplishes man 's salvation " .
It is parallel and almost synonymous to the other Hebraic word , hesed which means " mercy " , " compassion " , " love " , and to the word , emeth which means " fidelity " , " truth " .
This , as you see , gives a completely other dimension to what we usually conceive as justice .
5
This is how the Church understood God 's justice .
This is what the Fathers of the Church taught of it .
" How can you call God just " , writes Saint Isaac the Syrian , " when you read the passage on the wage given to the workers ?
' Friend , I do thee no wrong ; I will give unto this last even as unto thee who worked for me from the first hour .
Is thine eye evil , because I am good ? ' "
" How can a man call God just " , continues Saint Isaac , " when he comes across the passage on the prodigal son , who wasted his wealth in riotous living , and yet only for the contrition which he showed , the father ran and fell upon his neck , and gave him authority over all his wealth ?
None other but His very Son said these things concerning Him lest we doubt it , and thus He bare witness concerning Him .
Where , then , is God 's justice , for whilst we were sinners , Christ died for us ! "
6
So we see that God is not just , with the human meaning of this word , but we see that His justice means
His goodness and love , which are given in an unjust manner , that is , God always gives without taking anything in return , and He gives to persons like us who are not worthy of receiving .
That is why Saint Isaac teaches us : " Do not call God just , for His justice is not manifest in the things concerning you .
And if David calls
Him just and upright , His Son revealed to us that He is good and kind .
' He is good , ' He says , ' to the evil and impious ' " .
7
God is good , loving , and kind toward those who disregard , disobey , and ignore Him .8
He never returns evil for evil , He never takes vengeance .
9
His punishments are loving means of correction , as long as anything can be corrected and healed in this life .
10 They never extend to eternity .
He created everything good .
11
The wild beasts recognize as their master the Christian who through humility has gained the likeness of God .
They draw near to him , not with fear , but with joy , in grateful and loving submission ; they wag their heads and lick his hands and serve him with gratitude .
The irrational beasts know that their Master and God is not evil and wicked and vengeful , but rather full of love .
( See also St. Isaac of Syria , SWZOMENA ASKHTIKA [ Athens , 1871 ] , pp. 95-96 . )
He protected and saved us when we fell .
The eternally evil has nothing to do with God .
It comes rather from the will of His free , logical creatures , and this will He respects .
12
Death was not inflicted upon us by God 13
We fell into it by our revolt .
God is Life and Life is God .
We revolted against God , we closed our gates to His life - giving grace .
14 " For as much as he departed from life " , wrote Saint Basil , " by so much did he draw nearer to death .
For God is Life , deprivation of life is death " .
15 " God did not create death " , continues Saint Basil , " but we brought it upon ourselves " .
" Not at all , however , did He hinder the dissolution ... so that He would not make the infirmity immortal in us " .
16 As Saint Irenaeus puts it : " Separation from God is death , separation from light is darkness ... and it is not the light which brings upon them the punishment of blindness " .
17
" Death " , says Saint Maximus the Confessor , " is principally the separation from God , from which followed necessarily the death of the body .
Life is principally
He who said , ' I am the Life ' " .
18
And why did death come upon the whole of humanity ?
Why did those who did not sin with Adam die as did Adam ?
Here is the reply of Saint Anastasius the Sinaite : " We became the inheritors of the curse in Adam .
We were not punished as if we had disobeyed that divine commandment along with Adam ; but because Adam became mortal , he transmitted sin to his posterity .
We became mortal since we were born from a mortal " .
19 And Saint Gregory Palamas makes this point : " [ God ] did not say to Adam : return to whence thou wast taken ; but He said to him : Earth thou art and unto the earth thou shall return ....
He did not say : ' in whatsoever day ye shall eat of it , die ! ' but , 'in whatsoever day ye shall eat of it , ye shall surely die . '
Nor did
He afterwards say : ' return now unto the earth , ' but He said , ' thou shalt return , ' in this manner forewarning , justly permitting and not obstructing what shall come to pass " .
20
We see that death did not come at the behest of God but as a consequence of Adam 's severing his relations with the source of Life , by his disobedience ; and God in His kindness did only warn him of it .
" The tree of knowledge itself , " says Theophilus of Antic , " was good , and its fruit was good .
For it was not the tree , as some think , that had death in it , but the disobedience which had death in it ; for there was nothing else in the fruit but knowledge alone , and knowledge is good when one uses it properly . "
21 The Fathers teach us that the prohibition to taste the tree of knowledge was not absolute but temporary .
Adam was a spiritual infant .
Not all foods are good for infants .
Some foods may even kill them although adults would find them wholesome .
The tree of knowledge was planted by God for man .
It was good and nourishing .
But it was solid food , while Adam was able to digest only milk .
-- V --
So in the language of the Holy Scriptures , " just " means good and loving .
We speak of the just men of the Old Testament .
That does not mean that they were good judges but that they were kind and God-loving people .
When we say that God is just , we do not mean that He is a good judge
Who knows how to punish men equitably according to the gravity of their crimes , but on the contrary , we mean that He is kind and loving , forgiving all transgressions and disobediences , and that He wants to save us by all means , and never requites evil for evil .
22
In the first volume of the Philokalia there is a magnificent text of Saint Anthony which I must read to you here : " God is good , dispassionate , and immutable .
Now someone who thinks it reasonable and true to affirm that God does not change , may well ask how , in that case , it is possible to speak of God as rejoicing over those who are good and showing mercy to those who honor Him , and as turning away from the wicked and being angry with sinners .
To this it must be answered that God neither rejoices nor grows angry , for to rejoice and to be offended are passions ; nor is He won over by the gifts of those who honor Him , for that would mean
He is swayed by pleasure .
It is not right that the Divinity feel pleasure or displeasure from human conditions .
He is good , and He only bestows blessings and never does harm , remaining always the same .
We men , on the other hand , if we remain good through resembling God , are united to Him , but if we become evil through not resembling God , we are separated from Him .
By living in holiness we cleave to God ; but by becoming wicked we make Him our enemy .
It is not that He grows angry with us in an arbitrary way , but it is our own sins that prevent God from shining within us and expose us to demons who torture us .
And if through prayer and acts of compassion we gain release from our sins , this does not mean that we have won God over and made
Him to change , but that through our actions and our turning to the Divinity , we have cured our wickedness and so once more have enjoyment of God 's goodness .
Thus to say that God turns away from the wicked is like saying that the sun hides itself from the blind .
23 [ Chap. 150 ] "
-- VI --
You see now , I hope , how God was slandered by Western theology .
Augustine , Anselm , Thomas Aquinas and all their pupils contributed to this " theological " calumny .
And they are the foundations of Western theology , whether Papist or Protestant .
Certainly these theologians do not say expressly and clearly that God is a wicked and passionate being .
They rather consider God as being chained by a superior force , by a gloomy and implacable Necessity like the one which governed the pagan gods .
This Necessity obliges
Him to return evil for evil and does not permit Him to pardon and to forget the evil done against His will , unless an infinite satisfaction is offered to Him .
We open here the great question of pagan , Greek influence on Christianity .
The pagan mentality was in the foundation of all heresies .
It was very strong in the East , because the East was the crossroad of all philosophical and religious currents .
But as we read in the New Testament , " where sin abounded , grace did much more abound " .
So when heresies flourished , Orthodoxy flourished also , and although it was persecuted by the mighty of this world , it always survived victorious .
In the West , on the contrary , the pagan Greek mentality entered in unobtrusively , without taking the aspect of heresy .
It entered in through the multitude of Latin texts dictated by Augustine , bishop of Hippo .
Saint John Cassian who was living then in the West understood the poison that was in Augustine 's teachings , and fought against it .
But the fact that Augustine 's books were written in Latin and the fact that they were extremely lengthy did not permit their study by the other Fathers of the Church , and so they were never condemned as Origen 's works were condemned in the East .
This fact permitted them to exercise a strong influence later in Western thought and theology .
In the West , little by little knowledge of the Greek language vanished , and Augustine 's texts were the only books available dating from ancient times in a language understood there .
So the West received as Christian a teaching which was in many of its aspects pagan .
Caesaro - papist developments in Rome did not permit any healthy reaction to this state of affairs , and so the West was drowned in the humanistic , pagan thought which prevails to this day .
24
So we have the East on the one side which , speaking and writing Greek , remained essentially the New Israel with Israelitic thought and sacred tradition , and the West on the other side which having forgotten the Greek language and having been cut off from the Eastern state , inherited pagan Greek thought and its mentality , and formed with it an adulterated Christian teaching .
In reality , the opposition between Orthodoxy and Western Christianity is nothing else but the perpetuation of the opposition between Israel and Hellas .
We must never forget that the Fathers of the Church considered themselves to be the true spiritual children of Abraham , that the Church considered itself to be the New Israel , and that the Orthodox peoples , whether Greek , Russian , Bulgarian , Serbian , Romanian , etc. , were conscious of being like Nathaniel , true Israelites , the People of God .
And while this was the real consciousness of Eastern Christianity , the West became more and more a child of pagan , humanistic Greece and Rome .
-- VII --
What were the principal characteristics of this difference of thought between Israel and paganism ?
I call your attention to this very important matter .
Israel believes in God .
Paganism believes in creation .
That is to say , in paganism creation is deified .
For the pagans , God and creation are one and the same thing .
God is impersonal , personified in a multitude of gods .
Israel ( and when we speak of Israel we mean the true Israel , the spiritual sons of Abraham , those who have the faith given by God to His chosen people , not those who have abandoned this faith , The real sons of Abraham are the Church of Christ , and not those carnal descendants , the Jewish race ) , Israel knows that God and creation are two radically different kinds of existence .
God is self existent , personal , eternal , immortal , Life and the Source of life , Existence and the Source of existence ;
God is the only real Existence : O WN the Existing , the Only Existing ; this is the meaning of the article ' O. 25
Creation , on the contrary , has no self - existence .
It is totally dependent on the will of God .
It exists only so long as God wants it to exist .
It is not eternal .
It had no existence .
It was null , it was completely nothing .
It was created out of nothingness .
26
By itself it has no force of existence ; it is kept in existence by God 's Energy .
If this loving Energy of God ever stops , creation and all created beings , intellectual or non-intellectual , rational or irrational will vanish into non-existence .
We know that God 's love for His creation is eternal .
We know from Him that He will never let us fall into non-existence , from which He brought us into being .
This is our hope and God is true in His promises .
We , created beings , angels , and men , will live in eternity , not because we have in us the power of eternity , but because this is the will of God Who loves us .
By ourselves we are nothing .
We have not the least energy of life and of existence in our nature ; that which we have comes entirely from God ; nothing is ours .
We are dirt of the earth , and when we forgot it , God in His mercy permitted that we return to what we are , in order that we remain humble and have exact knowledge of our nothingness .
27 " God , " says Saint John Damascene elsewhere , " can do all that He wills , even though He does not will all things that He can do -- for He can destroy creation , but He does not will to do so .
( Ibid .
I , 14 ) 28
In the Great Euchologion ( Venice , 1862 ) , a fundamental liturgical book of the Church , we read : " O God , the great and most high , Thou Who alone hast immortality "
[ 7th prayer of Vespers , p. 15 ] " Thou Who alone art life - giving by nature ... O only immortal "
[ Ode5 , Funeral Canon for Laymen , p. 410 ]
" Thou art the only immortal " [ p. 410 ]
" The only One Who is immortal because of His godly nature "
[ Ode 1 , Funeral Canon for Laymen , p. 471 ]
This is the faith of Israel .
What is the teaching of paganism ?
Paganism is the consequence of the loss of contact with God .
The multitude of the sins of humanity made men incapable of receiving the divine light and of having any union with the Living God .
The consequence was to consider as something divine the creation which they saw before them every day .
Paganism considers creation as being something self - existent and immortal , something that always existed and will always exist .
In paganism the gods are part of creation .
They did not create it from nothingness , they only formed the existing matter .
Matter can take different forms .
Forms come into existence and vanish , but matter itself is eternal .
Angels , demons , and the souls of men are the real gods .
Eternal by their nature , as is matter itself , they are , however , higher than matter .
They might take different material forms in a sequence of material existences but they remain essentially spiritual .
So in paganism we see two fundamental characteristics : ( 1 ) An attributing of the characteristics of godhood to the whole of creation , that is : eternity , immortality , self - existence . ( 2 ) A distinction between the spiritual and the material and an antagonism between the two as between something higher and something lower .
Paganism and humanism are one and the same thing .
In paganism , man is god because he is eternal by nature .
This is why paganism is always haughty .
It is narcissism .
It is self - adoration .
In Greece , the gods had human characteristics .
Greek religion was the pagan adoration of man .
The soul of man was considered his real being , and was immortal by nature .
So we see that in paganism the devil succeeded in creating a universal belief that men were gods and so did not need God .
This is why pride was so high in Greece and why humility was inconceivable .
In his work The Nichomachean Ethics , Aristotle writes the following words : " Not to resent offenses is the mark of a base and slavish man . "
The man who is convinced by the devil to believe in the error that his soul is eternal by nature , can never be humble and can never really believe in God , because he does not need God , being God himself , as his error makes him believe .
This is why , from the very first , the Fathers of the Church , understanding the danger of this stupid error , warned the Christians of the fact that , as Saint Irenaeus puts it : " The teaching that the human soul is naturally immortal is from the devil " ( Proof of the Apostolic Preaching , III , 20 . 1 ) .
We find the same warning in Saint Justin ( Dialogue with Trypho 6 . 1 - 2 ) , in Theophilus of Antioch ( To Autolycus 2 . 97 ) , in Tatian ( To the Greeks 13 ) , etc .
Saint Justin explains the fundamental atheism which exists in the belief of the natural eternity and immortality of the human soul .
He writes : " There are some others who , having supposed that the soul is immortal and immaterial , believe though they have committed evil they will not suffer punishment ( for that which is immaterial is also insensible ) , and that the soul , in consequence of its immorality needs nothing from God " ( Dialogue with Trypho 1 ) .
Paganism is ignorance of the true God , an erroneous belief that His creation is divine , really a god .
This god , however , who is Nature , is impersonal , a blind force , above all personal gods , and is called Necessity ( anagkh ) .
In reality , this Necessity is the projection of human reason , as a mathematical necessity governing the world , It is a projection of rationalism upon nature .
This rationalistic Necessity is the true , supreme blind god of the pagans .
The pagan gods are parts of the world , and they are immortal because of the immortality of nature which is their essence .
In this pagan mentality , man is also god like the others , because for the pagans the real man is only his soul , 29 and they believe that man 's soul is immortal in itself , since it is part of the essence of the universe , which is considered immortal in itself and self - existent .
So man also is god and a measure of all things .
But the gods are not free .
They are governed by Necessity which is impersonal .
-- VII --
It is this pagan way of thought that was mixed with the Christian teaching by the various heresies .
This is what happened in the West , too .
They began to distinguish not between God and His creation , but between spirit and matter .
30 They began to think of the soul of man as of something eternal in itself , and began to consider the condition of man after death not as a sleep in the hands of God , but as the real life of man , 31 to which the resurrection of the dead had nothing to add and even the need of the resurrection was doubtful .
The feast of the Resurrection of our Lord , which is the culmination of all feasts in Orthodoxy , began to fall into second place , because its need was as incomprehensible to the Western Christians as it was to the Athenians who heard the sermon of the Apostle Paul .
But what is more important for our subject , they began to feel that God was subject to Necessity , to this rationalistic Necessity which was nothing else but human logic .
They declared Him incapable of coming into contact with inferior beings like men , because their rationalistic , philosophical conceptions did not permit it , and it was this belief which was the foundation of the hesychast disputes ; it had already begun with Augustine who taught that it was not God Who spoke to Moses but an angel instead .
It is in this context of Necessity , which even gods obey , that we must understand the Western juridical conception of God 's justice .
It was necessary for God to punish man 's disobedience .
It was impossible for Him to pardon ; a superior Necessity demanded vengeance .
Even if God was in reality good and loving , He was not able to act lovingly .
He was obliged to act contrary to His love ; the only thing
He could do , in order to save humanity , was to punish His Son in the place of men , and by this means was Necessity satisfied .
-- IX --
This is the triumph of Hellenistic thought in Christianity .
As a Hellenist , Origen had arrived at the same conclusions .
God was a judge by necessity .
He was obliged to punish , to avenge , to send people to hell .
Hell was God 's creation .
It was a punishment demanded by justice .
This demand of justice was a necessity .
God was obliged to submit to it .
He was not permitted to forgive .
There was a superior force , a Necessity which did not permit Him to love unconditionally .
However , Origen was also a Christian and he knew that God was full of love .
How is it possible to acknowledge a loving God Who keeps people in torment eternally ?
If God is the cause of hell , by necessity then there must be an end to it , otherwise we cannot concede that God is good and loving .
This juridical conception of God as a instrument of a superior , impersonal force or deity named Necessity , leads logically to apokatastasis , " the restoration of all things and the destruction of hell , " otherwise we must admit that God is cruel .
The pagan Greek mentality could not comprehend that the cause of hell was not God but His logical creatures .
If God was not really free , since He was governed by Necessity , how could His creatures be free ?
God could not give something which He did not possess Himself .
Moreover , the pagan Greek mentality could not conceive of disinterested love .
Freedom , however , is the highest gift that God could give to a creature , because freedom makes the logical creatures like God .
This was an inconceivable gift for pagan Greeks .
They could not imagine a creature which could say " no " to an almighty God .
If God was almighty , creatures could not say " no " to Him .
So if God gave men
His grace , men could not reject it .
Otherwise God would not be almighty .
If we admit that God is almighty , then His grace must be irresistible .
Men can not escape from it .
That means that those men who are deprived of God 's grace are deprived because God did not give
His grace to them .
So the loss of God s grace , which is eternal , spiritual death , in other words , hell , is in reality an act totally dependent on God .
It is God Who is punishing these people by depriving them of His grace , by not permitting it to shine upon them .
So God is the cause of the eternal , spiritual death of those who are damned .
Damnation is an act of God , an act of God 's justice , an act of necessity or cruelty .
As a result , Origen thought that if we are to remain Christians , if we are to continue to believe that God is really good , we must believe that hell is not eternal , but will have an end , in spite of all that is written in the Holy Scriptures and of what the Church believes .
This is the fatal , perfectly logical conclusion .
If God is the cause of hell , hell must have an end , or else God is an evil God .
-- X --
Origen , and all rationalists who are like him , was not able to understand that the acceptance or the rejection of God 's grace depends entirely on the rational creatures ; that God , like the sun , never stops shining on good or wicked alike ; that rational creatures are , however , entirely free to accept or reject this grace and love ; and that God in His genuine love does not force
His creatures to accept Him , but respects absolutely their free decision .
32 He does not withdraw
His grace and love , but the attitude of the logical creatures toward this unceasing grace and love is the difference between paradise and hell .
Those who love God are happy with Him , those who hate
Him are extremely miserable by being obliged to live in His presence , and there is no place where one can escape the loving omnipresence of God .
Paradise or hell depends on how we will accept God 's love .
Will we return love for love , or will we respond to His love with hate ?
This is the critical difference .
And this difference depends entirely on us , on our freedom , on our innermost free choice , on a perfectly free attitude which is not influenced by external conditions or internal factors of our material and psychological nature , because it is not an external act but an interior attitude coming from the bottom of our heart , conditioning not our sins , but the way we think about our sins , as it is clearly seen in the case of the publican and the Pharisee and in the case of the two robbers crucified with Christ .
This freedom , this choice , this inner attitude toward our Creator is the innermost core of our eternal personality , it is the most profound of our characteristics , it is what makes us that which we are , it is our eternal face -- bright or dark , loving or hating .
No , my brothers , unhappily for us , paradise or hell does not depend on God .
If it depended on God , we would have nothing to fear .
We have nothing to fear from Love .
But it does not depend on God .
It depends entirely upon us , and this is the whole tragedy .
God wants us to be in His image , eternally free .
He respects us absolutely .
This is love .
Without respect , we can not speak of love .
We are men because we are free .
If we were not free , we would be clever animals , not men .
God will never take back this gift of freedom which renders us what we are .
This means that we will always be what we want to be , friends or enemies of God , and there is no changing in this our deepest self .
In this life , there are profound or superficial changes in our life , in our character , in our beliefs , but all these changes are only the expression in time of our deepest eternal self .
This deep eternal self is eternal , with all the meaning of the word .
This is why paradise and hell are also eternal .
There is no changing in what we really are .
Our temporal characteristics and our history in life depend on many superficial things ' which vanish with death , but our real personality is not superficial and does not depend on changing and vanishing things .
It is our real self .
It remains with us when we sleep in the grave , and will be our real face in the resurrection .
It is eternal .

Saint John of the Ladder says somewhere in his work that " before our fall the demons say to us that God is a friend of man ; but after our fall , they say that He is inexorable . "
This is the cunning lie of the devil : to convince us that any harm in our life has as its cause God 's disposition ; that it is God Who will forgive us or Who will punish us .
Wishing to throw us into sin and then to make us lose any hope of freeing ourselves from it , they seek to present God as sometimes forgiving all sins , and sometimes as inexorable .
Most Christians , even Orthodox Christians , have fallen into this pit .
They consider God responsible for our being pardoned or our being punished .
This , my brothers , is a terrible falsehood which makes most men lose eternal life , principally because in considering God s love , they convince themselves that God , in His love , will pardon them .
God is always loving , He is always pardoning , He is always a friend of man .
However , that which never pardons , that which never is a friend of man , is sin , and we never think of it as we ought to .
Sin destroys our soul independently of the love of God , because sin is precisely the road which leads away from God , because sin erects a wall which separates us from God , because sin destroys our spiritual eyes and makes us unable to see God 's light .
The demons want to make us always think of our salvation or our eternal spiritual death in juridical terms .
They want us to think that either salvation or eternal death is a question of God 's decision .
No , my brothers , we must awaken in order not to be lost .
Our salvation or our eternal death is not a question of God 's decision , but it is a question of our decision , it is a question of the decision of our free will which God respects absolutely .
Let us not fool ourselves with confidence in God 's love .
The danger does not come from God ; it comes from our own self .

Many will say : " Does not Holy Scripture itself often speak about the anger of God ?
Is it not God Himself who says that He will punish us or that He will pardon us ?
Is it not written that ' He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him ' ( Heb. 11:6 ) ?
33 Does
He not say that vengeance is His and that He will requite the wickedness done to us ?
Is it not written that it is fearful to fall into the hands of the living God ? " 34
In his discourse entitled That God is not the Cause of Evil , Saint Basil the Great writes the following : " But one may say , if God is not responsible for evil things , why is it said in the book of Esaias , ' I am He that prepared light and Who formed darkness , Who makes peace and Who creates evils ' ( 45:7 ) . "
And again , " There came down evils from the Lord upon the gates of Jerusalem " ( Mich. 1:12 ) .
And , " Shall there be evil in the city which the Lord hath not wrought ? " ( Amos 3:6 ) .
And in the great Ode of Moses , " Behold , I am and there is no god beside Me . I will slay , and I will make to live ; I will smite , and I will heal " ( Deut. 32:39 ) .
But none of these citations , to him who understands the deeper meaning of the Holy Scriptures , casts any blame on God , as if He were the cause of evils and their creator , for He Who said , " I am the One Who makes light and darkness , " shows Himself as the Creator of the universe , not that He is the creator of any evil ....
" He creates evils , " that means , " He fashions them again and brings them to a betterment , so that they leave their evilness , to take on the nature of good . "
35
As Saint Isaac the Syrian writes , " Very often many things are said by the Holy Scriptures and in it many names are used not in a literal sense ... those who have a mind understand this " ( Homily 83 , p. 317 ) .
Saint Basil in the same discourse 36 gives the explanation of these expressions of the Holy Scriptures : " It is because fear , " says he , " edifies simpler people , " and this is true not only for simple people but for all of us .
After our fall , we need fear in order to do any profitable thing and any good to ourselves or to others .
In order to understand the Holy Scriptures , say the Fathers , we must have in mind their purpose which is to save us , and to bring us little by little to an understanding of our Creator God and of our wretched condition .
But the same Holy Scriptures in other places explain to us more accurately who is the real cause of our evils .
In Jeremias 2:17 - 19 we read : " Hath not thy forsaking Me brought these things upon thee ?
saith the Lord thy God ....
Thine apostasy shall chastise thee and thy wickedness shall reprove thee ; know then , and see that thy forsaking Me hath been bitter to thee , saith the Lord thy God . "
The Holy Scriptures speak our language , the language which we understand in our fallen state .
As Saint Gregory the Theologian says , " For according to our own comprehension , we have given names from our own attributes to those of God . "
37 And Saint John Damascene explains further that what in the Holy Scriptures " is said of God as if He had a body , is said symbolically ... [ it contains ] some hidden meaning , which through things corresponding to our nature , teaches us things which exceed our nature . "
38

However , there are punishments imposed upon us by God , or rather evils done to us by the devil and permitted by God .
But these punishments are what we call pedagogical punishments .
They have as their aim our correction in this life , or at least the correction of others who would take a lesson from our example and correct themselves by fear .
There are also punishments which do not have the purpose of correcting anybody but simply put an end to evil by putting an end to those who are propagating it , so that the earth may be saved from perpetual corruption and total destruction ; such was the case in the flood during Noe 's time , and in Sodom 's destruction .
39
All these punishments operate and have their purpose in this corrupted state of things ; they do not extend beyond this corrupted life .
Their purpose is to correct what can be corrected , and to change things toward a better condition , while things can still change in this changing world .
After the Common Resurrection no change whatever can take place .
Eternity and incorruptibility are the state of unchangeable things ; no alterations whatever happen then , only developments in the state chosen by free personalities ; eternal and infinite developments but no changing , no alteration of direction , no going back .
The changing world we see around us is changing because it is corruptible .
The eternal New Heavens and New Earth which God will bring about in His Second Coming are incorruptible , that means , not changing .
So in this New World there can be no correction whatever ; therefore , pedagogical punishments are no longer necessary .
Any punishment from God in this New World of Resurrection would be clearly and without a doubt a revengeful act , inappropriate and motivated by hate , without any good intention or purpose .
If we consider hell as a punishment from God , we must admit that it is a senseless punishment , unless we admit that God is an infinitely wicked being .
As Saint Isaac the Syrian says : " He who applies pedagogical punishments in order to give health , is punishing with love , but he who is looking for vengeance , is devoid of love .
God punishes with love , not defending Himself -- far be it -- but He wants to heal His image , and He does not keep His wrath for long .
This way of love is the way of uprightness , and it does not change with passion to a defense .
A man who is just and wise is like God because he never chastises a man in revenge for wickedness , but only in order to correct him or that others be afraid " ( Homily 73 ) .
So we see that God punishes as long as there is hope for correction .
After the Common Resurrection there is no question of any punishment from God .
Hell is not a punishment from God but a self condemnation .
As Saint Basil the Great says , " The evils in hell do not have God as their cause , but ourselves . "

One could insist , however , that the Sacred Scriptures and the Fathers always speak of God as the Great Judge who will reward those who were obedient to Him and will punish those who were disobedient , in the day of the Great Judgment ( II Tim. 4:6-8 ) .
How are we to understand this judgment if we are to understand the divine words not in a human but in a divine manner ' ?
What is God 's judgment ?
God is Truth and Light .
God 's judgment is nothing else than our coming into contact with truth and light .
In the day of the Great Judgment all men will appear naked before this penetrating light of truth .
The " books " will be opened .
What are these " books " ?
They are our hearts .
Our hearts will be opened by the penetrating light of God , and what is in these hearts will be revealed .
If in those hearts there is love for God , those hearts will rejoice seeing God 's light .
If , on the contrary , there is hatred for God in those hearts , these men will suffer by receiving on their opened hearts this penetrating light of truth which they detested all their life .
So that which will differentiate between one man and another will not be a decision of God , a reward or a punishment from Him , but that which was in each one 's heart ; what was there during all our life will be revealed in the Day of Judgment .
If there is a reward and a punishment in this revelation -- and there really is -- it does not come from God but from the love or hate which reigns in our heart .
Love has bliss in it , hatred has despair , bitterness , grief , affliction , wickedness , agitation , confusion , darkness , and all the other interior conditions which compose hell ( I Cor. 4:6 ) .
The Light of Truth , God 's Energy , God 's grace which will fall on men unhindered by corrupt conditions in the Day of Judgment , will be the same to all men .
There will be no distinction whatever .
All the difference lies in those who receive , not in Him Who gives .
The sun shines on healthy and diseased eyes alike , without any distinction .
Healthy eyes enjoy light and because of it see clearly the beauty which surrounds them .
Diseased eyes feel pain , they hurt , suffer , and want to hide from this same light which brings such great happiness to those who have healthy eyes .
But alas , there is no longer any possibility of escaping God 's light .
During this life there was .
In the New Creation of the Resurrection , God will be everywhere and in everything .
His light and love will embrace all .
There will be no place hidden from God , as was the case during our corrupt life in the kingdom of the prince of this world .
41 The devil 's kingdom will be despoiled by the Common Resurrection and God will take possession again of His creation .
42 Love will enrobe everything with its sacred Fire which will flow like a river from the throne of God and will irrigate paradise .
But this same river of Love -- for those who have hate in their hearts -- will suffocate and burn .
" For our God is a consuming fire " , ( Heb. 12:29 ) .
The very fire which purifies gold , also consumes wood .
Precious metals shine in it like the sun , rubbish burns with black smoke .
All are in the same fire of Love .
Some shine and others become black and dark .
In the same furnace steel shines like the sun , whereas clay turns dark and is hardened like stone .
The difference is in man , not in God .
The difference is conditioned by the free choice of man , which God respects absolutely .
God 's judgment is the revelation of the reality which is in man .

Thus Saint Macarius writes , " And as the kingdom of darkness , and sin , are hidden in the soul until the Day of Resurrection , when the bodies also of sinners shall be covered with the darkness that is now hidden in the soul , so also the Kingdom of Light , and the Heavenly Image , Jesus Christ , now mystically enlighten the soul , and reign in the soul of the saints , but are hidden from the eyes of men ... until the Day of Resurrection ; but then the body also shall be covered and glorified with the Light of the Lord , which is now in the man 's soul [ from this earthly life ] , that the body also may reign with the soul which from now receives the Kingdom of Christ and rests and is enlightened with eternal light " ( Homily 2 ) .
Saint Symeon the New Theologian says that it is not what man does which counts in eternal life but what he is , whether he is like Jesus Christ our Lord , or whether he is different and unlike Him .
He says , " In the future life the Christian is not examined if he has renounced the whole world for Christ 's love , or if he has distributed his riches to the poor or if he fasted or kept vigil or prayed , or if he wept and lamented for his sins , or if he has done any other good in this life , but he is examined attentively if he has any similitude with Christ , as a son does with his father . "

Saint Peter the Damascene writes : " We all receive God 's blessings equally .
But some of us , receiving God 's fire , that is , His word , become soft like beeswax , while the others like clay become hard as stone .
And if we do not want Him ,
He does not force any of us , but like the sun He sends
His rays and illuminates the whole world , and he who wants to see Him , sees Him , whereas the one who does not want to see Him , is not forced by Him .
And no one is responsible for this privation of light except the one who does not want to have it .
God created the sun and the eye .
Man is free to receive the sun 's light or not .
The same is true here .
God sends the light of knowledge like rays to all , but He also gave us faith like an eye .
The one who wants to receive knowledge through faith , keeps it by his works , and so God gives him more willingness , knowledge , and power " ( Philokalia , vol. 3 , p. 8 ) .
-- XVII --
I think that by now we have reached the point of understanding correctly what eternal hell and eternal paradise really are , and who is in reality responsible for the difference .
In the icon of the Last Judgment we see Our Lord Jesus Christ seated on a throne .
On His right we see His friends , the blessed men and women who lived by His love .
On His left we see
His enemies , all those who passed their life hating Him , even if they appeared to be pious and reverent .
And there , in the midst of the two , springing from Christ 's throne , we see a river of fire coming toward us .
What is this river of fire ?
Is it an instrument of torture ?
Is it an energy of vengeance coming out from God in order to vanquish His enemies ?
No , nothing of the sort .
This river of fire is the river which " came out from Eden to water the paradise " of old ( Gen. 2:10 ) .
It is the river of the grace of God which irrigated God 's saints from the beginning .
In a word , it is the out - pouring of God 's love for His creatures .
Love is fire .
Anyone who loves knows this .
God is Love , so God is Fire .
And fire consumes all those who are not fire themselves , and renders bright and shining all those who are fire themselves ( Heb. 12:29 ) .
God many times appeared as fire : To Abraham , to Moses in the burning bush , to the people of Israel showing them the way in the desert as a column of fire by night and as a shining cloud by day when He covered the tabernacle with His glory ( Exod. 40:28 , 32 ) , and when He rained fire on the summit of Mount Sinai .
God was revealed as fire on the mountain of Transfiguration , and He said that He came " to put fire upon the earth " ( Luke 12:49 ) , that is to say , love , because as Saint John of the Ladder says , " Love is the source of fire " ( Step 30 , 18 ) .
The Greek writer , Fotis Kontoglou said somewhere that " Faith is fire , and gives warmth to the heart .
The Holy Spirit came down upon the heads of the apostles in the form of tongues of fire .
The two disciples , when the Lord was revealed to them , said ' Did not our heart burn within us , while He talked with us in the way ? '
Christ compares faith to a ' burning candle . '
Saint John the Forerunner said in his sermons that Christ will baptize men ' in the Holy Spirit and fire . '
And truly , the Lord said , ' I am come to send fire on the earth and what will I if it be already kindled ?
Well , the most tangible characteristic of faith is warmth ; this is why they speak about ' warm faith , ' or ' faith provoking warmth . '
And even as the distinctive mark of faith is warmth , the sure mark of unbelief is coldness .
" Do you want to know how to understand if a man has faith or unbelief ?
If you feel warmth coming out of him -- from his eyes , from his words , from his manners -- be certain that he has faith in his heart .
If again you feel cold coming out of his whole being , that means that he has not faith , whatever he may say .
He may kneel down , he may bend his head humbly , he may utter all sorts of moral teachings with a humble voice , but all these will breathe forth a chilling breath which falls upon you to numb you with cold . "
43 Saint Isaac the Syrian says that " Paradise is the love of God , in which the bliss of all the beatitudes is contained , " and that " the tree of life is the love of God " ( Homily 72 ) .
" Do not deceive yourself , " says Saint Symeon the New Theologian , " God is fire and when He came into the world , and became man , He sent fire on the earth , as He Himself says ; this fire turns about searching to find material -- that is a disposition and an intention that is good -- to fall into and to kindle ; and for those in whom this fire will ignite , it becomes a great flame , which reaches Heaven .... this flame at first purifies us from the pollution of passions and then it becomes in us food and drink and light and joy , and renders us light ourselves because we participate in His light " ( Discourse 78 ) .
God is a loving fire , and He is a loving fire for all : good or bad .
There is , however , a great difference in the way people receive this loving fire of God.
Saint Basil says that " the sword of fire was placed at the gate of paradise to guard the approach to the tree of life ; it was terrible and burning toward infidels , but kindly accessible toward the faithful , bringing to them the light of day . "
44
The same loving fire brings the day to those who respond to love with love , and burns those who respond to love with hatred .
Paradise and hell are one and the same River of God , a loving fire which embraces and covers all with the same beneficial will , without any difference or discrimination .
The same vivifying water is life eternal for the faithful and death eternal for the infidels ; for the first it is their element of life , for the second it is the instrument of their eternal suffocation ; paradise for the one is hell for the other .
Do not consider this strange .
The son who loves his father will feel happy in his father 's arms , but if he does not love him , his father 's loving embrace will be a torment to him .
This also is why when we love the man who hates us , it is likened to pouring lighted coals and hot embers on his head .
" I say , " writes Saint Isaac the Syrian , " that those who are suffering in hell , are suffering in being scourged by love ....
It is totally false to think that the sinners in hell are deprived of God 's love .
Love is a child of the knowledge of truth , and is unquestionably given commonly to all .
But love 's power acts in two ways : it torments sinners , while at the same time it delights those who have lived in accord with it " ( Homily 84 ) .
God is love .
If we really believe this truth , we know that God never hates , never punishes , never takes vengeance .
As Abba Ammonas says , " Love never hates anyone , never reproves anyone , never condemns anyone , never grieves anyone , never abhors anyone , neither faithful nor infidel nor stranger nor sinner nor fornicator , nor anyone impure , but instead it is precisely sinners , and weak and negligent souls that it loves more , and feels pain for them and grieves and laments , and it feels sympathy for the wicked and sinners , more than for the good , imitating Christ Who called sinners , and ate and drank with them .
For this reason , showing what real love is , He taught saying , ' Become good and merciful like your Father in Heaven , ' and as He rains on bad and good and makes the sun to rise on just and unjust alike , so also is the one who has real love , and has compassion , and prays for all . "

Now if anyone is perplexed and does not understand how it is possible for God 's love to render anyone pitifully wretched and miserable and even burning as it were in flames , let him consider the elder brother of the prodigal son .
Was he not in his father 's estate ?
Did not everything in it belong to him ?
Did he not have his father 's love ?
Did his father not come himself to entreat and beseech him to come and take part in the joyous banquet ?
What rendered him miserable and burned him with inner bitterness and hate ?
Who refused him anything ?
Why was he not joyous at his brother 's return ?
Why did he not have love either toward his father or toward his brother ?
Was it not because of his wicked , inner disposition ?
Did he not remain in hell because of that ?
And what was this hell ?
Was it any separate place ?
Were there any instruments of torture ?
Did he not continue to live in his father 's house ?
What separated him from all the joyous people in the house if not his own hate and his own bitterness ?
Did his father , or even his brother , stop loving him ?
Was it not precisely this very love which hardened his heart more and more ?
Was it not the joy that made him sad ?
Was not hatred burning in his heart , hatred for his father and his brother , hatred for the love of his father toward his brother and for the love of his brother toward his father ?
This is hell : the negation of love ; the return of hate for love ; bitterness at seeing innocent joy ; to be surrounded by love and to have hate in one 's heart .
This is the eternal condition of all the damned .
They are all dearly loved .
They are all invited to the joyous banquet .
They are all living in God 's Kingdom , in the New Earth and the New Heavens .
No one expels them .
Even if they wanted to go away they could not flee from God 's New Creation , nor hide from God 's tenderly loving omnipresence .
Their only alternative would be , perhaps , to go away from their brothers and search for a bitter isolation from them , but they could never depart from God and His love .
And what is more terrible is that in this eternal life , in this New Creation , God is everything to His creatures .
As Saint Gregory of Nyssa says , " In the present life the things we have relations with are numerous , for instance : time , air , locality , food and drink , clothing , sunlight , lamplight , and other necessities of life , none of which , many though they be , are God ; that blessed state which we hope for is in need of none of these things , but the Divine Being will become all , and in the stead of all to us , distributing Himself proportionately to every need of that existence .
It is plain , too , from the Holy Scriptures that God becomes to those who deserve it , locality and home and clothing and food and drink and light and riches and kingdom , and everything that can be thought of and named that goes to make our life happy " ( On the Soul and the Resurrection ) .
46
In the new eternal life , God will be everything to His creatures , not only to the good but also to the wicked , not only to those who love Him , but likewise to those who hate Him .
But how will those who hate
Him endure to have everything from the hands of Him Whom they detest ?
Oh , what an eternal torment is this , what an eternal fire , what a gnashing of teeth !
Depart from
Me , ye cursed , into the everlasting inner fire of hatred , " 47 saith the Lord , because I was thirsty for your love and you did not give it to Me , I was hungry for your blessedness and you did not offer it to Me , I was imprisoned in My human nature and you did not come to visit Me in My church ; you are free to go where your wicked desire wishes , away from Me , in the torturing hatred of your hearts which is foreign to My loving heart which knows no hatred for anyone .
Depart freely from love to the everlasting torture of hate , unknown and foreign to Me and to those who are with Me , but prepared by freedom for the devil , from the days I created My free , rational creatures .
But wherever you go in the darkness of your hating hearts ,
My love will follow you like a river of fire , because no matter what your heart has chosen , you are and you will eternally continue to be , My children .
Amen .

3 " Truly foolish , therefore , and lacking all understanding and mind is he who says there is no God .
Alongside him no less in this madness is he who says that God is the cause of evils .
I consider their sins to be of equal gravity because each one similarly denies the good ; the former denies that He exists at all , while the latter defines
Him as not being good ; for if he is the cause of evils , He is clearly not good ; so from both sides there is a denial of God . "
St. Basil the Great , EPE , op .
cit. , 7 , 90 .
4 " But someone will say , verily Adam fell , and by disregarding the divine commandment he was condemned to corruption and death , but how were the many made sinful on his account ?
What do his transgressions have to do with us ?
How is it that we who were not even born were condemned along with him , and yet God says , ' The fathers shall not be put to death for the children and the sons shall not be put to death for the fathers ; everyone shall die in his own sin ' ?
( Deut. 24:18 ) .
Surely , then , that soul that sins shall die ; but we became sinners through the disobedience of Adam in this way :
For Adam was created for incorruption and life , and his life in the Paradise of delight was holy , his whole mind was continually caught up in divine visions , and his body was tranquil and serene , since every shameful pleasure was calmed , for there was no disturbance of intemperate emotions in him .
However , since he fell under sin and sank into corruption , thence pleasures and pollutions penetrated into the nature of the flesh , and so there was planted in our members a savage law .
Nature became diseased with sin through the disobedience of the one , i.e. , Adam ; thus the many also became sinners , not as transgressing together with Adam ?
for they did not exist at all ?
but as being from his nature which had fallen under the law of sin ... because of disobedience , human nature in Adam became infirm with corruption , and so the passions were introduced into it .... "
St. Cyril of Alexandria Interpretation of the Epistle to the Romans ( PG 74 . 788-789 ) .
" And furthermore , if they who were born from Adam became sinners on account of his sinning , in all justice , they are not liable , for they did not become sinners of themselves ; therefore the term " sinners " is used instead of " mortals " because death is the penalty of sin .
Since in the first - fashioned man nature became mortal , all they who share in the nature of the forefather consequently share mortality also . "
Euthymios Zigabenos , Interpretation of the Epistle to the Romans , 5:19 .
5 It means something totally different from what we customarily mean by the term " justice . "
This ignorance has caused us to consider as touchstones of Orthodoxy some very strange theories , most particularly the juridical conception of salvation which is based upon a justice that resembles the Necessity ( ANAGKH ) of the ancients , and oppresses not only man but God also , and gives a gloomy aspect to Christianity .
See the relevant study of S. Lynonnett " La Soteriologie Paulienne , " Introduction a la Bible Il , ( Belgium : Desclees Bc Bower ) , p. 840 .
6 " If a man readily and joyfully accepts a loss for the sake of God , he is inwardly pure .
And if he does not look down upon any man because of his defects , in very truth he is free .
If a man is not pleased with someone who honors him , nor displeased with someone who dishonors him , he is dead to the world and to this life .
The watchfulness of discernment is superior to every discipline of men accomplished in any way to any degree .
" Do not hate the sinner .
For we are all laden with guilt .
If for the sake of God you are moved to oppose him , weep over him .
Why do you hate him ?
Hate his sins md pray for him , that you may imitate Christ Who was not wroth with sinners , but interceded for them .
Do you not see how He wept over Jerusalem ?
We are mocked by the devil in many instances , so why should we hate the man who is mocked by him who mocks us also ?
Why , O man , do you hate the sinner ?
Could it be because he is not so righteous as you ?
But where is your righteousness when you have no love ?
Why do you not shed tears over him ?
But you persecute him .
In ignorance some are moved with anger , presuming themselves to be discerners of the works of sinners .
" Be a herald of God 's goodness , for God rules over you , unworthy though you are ; for although your debt to Him is so great , yet He is not seen exacting payment from you , and from the small works you do , He bestows great rewards upon you .
Do not call God just , for His justice is not manifest in the things concerning you .
And if David calls
Him just and upright ( cf. Ps. 24:8 , 144:17 ) , His Son revealed to us that He is good and kind .
' He is good , ' He says , ' to the evil and to the impious ' ( cf. Luke 6:35 ) .
How can you call God just when you come across the Scriptural passage on the wage given to the workers ?
' Friend , I do thee no wrong : I will give unto this last even as unto thee .
Is thine eye evil because I am good ? ' ( Matt. 20:12-15 ) .
How can a man call God just when he comes across the passage on the prodigal son who wasted his wealth with riotous living , how for the compunction alone which he showed , the father ran and fell upon his neck and gave him authority over all his wealth ?
( Luke 15:11 ff. ) .
None other but His very Son said these things concerning Him , lest we doubt it ; and thus He bare witness concern-ing Him .
Where , then , is God 's justice , for whilst we are sinners Christ died for us !
( cf. Rom. 5:8 ) .
But if here
He is merciful , we may believe that He will not change [ i.e. , as regards the state after death , which St. Isaac mentions again a little below ] .
" Far be it that we should ever think such an iniquity that God could become unmerciful !
For the property of Divinity does not change as do mortals .
God does not acquire something which
He does not have , nor lose what He has , nor supplement what He does have , as do created beings .
But what God has from the beginning , He will have and has until the [ uneoding ] end , as the blest Cyril wrote in his commentary on Genesis .
Fear God , he says , out of love for Him , and not for the austere name that He has been given .
Love Him as you ought to love Him ; not for what He will give you in the future , but for what we have received , and for this world alone which He has created for us .
Who is the man that can repay Him ?
Where is
His repayment to be found in our works ?
Who persuaded Him in the beginning to bring us into being
Who intercedes for us before Him , when we shall possess no [ faculty of ] memory , as though we never existed ?
Who will awake this our body [ Syriac : our corruption ] for that life ?
Again , whence descends the notion of knowledge into dust ?
O the wondrous mercy of God !
O the astonishment at the bounty of our God and Creator !
O might for which all is possible !
O the immeasurable goodness that brings our nature again , sinners though we be , to His regeneration and rest !
Who is sufficient to glorify Him ?
He raises up the transgressor and blasphemer , he renews dust unendowed with reason , making it rational and comprehending and the scattered and insensible dust and the scattered senses
He makes a rational nature worthy of thought .
The sinner is unable to comprehend the grace of His resurrection .
Where is gehenna , that can afflict us ?
Where is perdition , that terrifies us in many ways and quenches the joy of His love ?
And what is gehenna as compared with the grace of His resurrection , when He will raise us from Hades and cause our corruptible nature to be clad in incorruption , and raise up in glory him that has fallen into Hades ?
" Come , men of discernment , and be filled with wonder !
Whose mind is sufficiently wise and marvelous to wonder worthily at the bounty of our Creator ?
His recompense of sinners is , that instead of a just recompense , He rewards them with resurrection , and instead of those bodies with which they trampled upon
His law , He enrobes them with perfect glory and incorruption .
[ St. Isaac speaks here of those who have repented , as is evident from other similar passages in his book . )
That grace whereby we are resurrected after we have sinned is greater than the grace which brought us into being when we were not .
Glory be to Thine immeasurable grace , O Lord !
Behold , Lord , the waves of Thy grace close my mouth with silence , and there is not a thought left in me before the face of Thy thanksgiving .
What mouths can confess
Thy praise , O good King , Thou Who lovest our life ?
Glory be to Thee for the two worlds which
Thou hast created for our growth and delight , leading us by all things which Thou didst fashion to the knowledge of Thy glory , from now and unto the ages .
Amen . " St. Isaac the Syrian , Homily 60 .

8 " ' For God so loved the world as to give His Only - begotten Son unto death for it . '
Not that He could not have redeemed us by another means , but He wished to manifest to us His boundless love , and to draw us near Him through the death of His Only - begotten Son. Indeed , if He had anything more precious than His Son , He would have given it for our sakes , in order that through it our race would be found nigh to Him .
Out of His abundant love ,
He was not pleased to do violence to our freedom , although it was possible for Him to do so ; but He let it be in order that we would draw nigh to Him with the love and volition of our own will . "

20 " Man 's transgression against the Creator 's righteousness brought the soul 's death sentence into effect ; for when our forefathers forsook God and chose to do their own will , He abandoned them , not subjecting them to constraint .
And for the reasons we have stated above , God lovingly forewarned them of this sentence .
But he forbore and delayed in executing the sentence of death upon the body ; and while He pronounced it , He relegated its fruition to the future in the abyss of His wisdom and the superabundance of His love for man .
He did not say to Adam : ' return to whence thou wast taken , ' but ' earth thou art , and unto earth thou shalt return ' ( Gen. 3:19 ) .
Those who hear this with understanding can also comprehend from these words that God ' did not make death ' ( Wisdom 1:13 ) , either the soul 's or the body's .
For when
He first gave the command , He did not say : ' in whatsoever day ye shall eat of it , die ! , ' but ' In whatsoever day ye shall eat of it , ye shall surely die ' ( Gen. 2:17 ) .
Nor did
He afterwards say : ' return now unto earth , ' but " Thou shalt return ' ( Gen. 3:19 ) , in his manner forewarning , justly permitting and not obstructing what should come to pass . "

21 " The tree of knowledge itself was good , and its fruit was good .

Theophilus of Antioch To Autolycus 2 . 25 .
" The tree did not engender death , for God did not create death ; but death was the consequence of disobedience . "

22 " ' And what is a merciful heart ? '
It is the heart 's burning for the sake of the entire creation , for men , for birds , for animals , for demons and for every created thing ; and by the recollection and sight of them the eyes of a merciful man pour forth abundant tears .
From the strong and vehement mercy which grips his heart and from his great compassion , his heart is humbled and he cannot bear to hear or to see any injury or slight sorrow in creation .
For this reason he continually offers up tearful prayer , even for irrational beasts , for the enemies of the truth and for those who harm him , that they be protected and receive mercy .
And in like manner he even prays for the family of reptiles because of the great compassion that burns in his heart without measure in the likeness of God . "

He pleases ;
Maker of all things both visible and invisible , holding together all things and conserving them , Provider for all , governing and dominating and ruling over all in unending and immortal reign ; without contradiction , filling all things , contained by nothing , but Himself containing all things , being their Conserver and first Possessor ; pervading all substances without being defiled , removed far beyond all things and every substance as being supersubstantial and surpassing all , super - eminently divine and good and replete ; appointing all the principalities and orders , set above every principality and order , above essence and life and speech and concept ; light itself and goodness and being insofar as having neither being , nor anything else that is derived from any other ; the very source of being for all things that are , of life to the living , of speech to the articulate , and the cause of all good things for all ; knowing all things before they begin to be ; one substance , one godhead , one virtue , one will , one operation , one principality , one power , one domination , one kingdom ; known in three perfect Persons and adored with one adoration , believed in and worshipped by every rational creature , united without confusion and distinct without separation , which is beyond understanding .

34 " For if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth , there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins , but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation , which shall devour the adversaries , He that despised Moses ' law died without mercy under two or three witnesses :
Of how much sorer punishment , suppose ye , shall he be thought worthy , who hath trodden under foot the Son of God , and hath counted the blood of the covenant , wherewith he was sanctified , an unholy thing , and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace ?
For we know him that hath said , Vengeance belongeth unto me , I will recompense , saith the Lord .
And again , The Lord shall judge his people .
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Hebrews 10:26 -31 .
35 St. Basil the Great , op .
cit. 7 , 94-96 .
In this particular passage , St. Basil carefully makes a distinction between the Greek verbs ktizw and dhmiourgew , both of which are generally translated into English as " create . "
However , ktizw has a long history , beginning with the Sanskrit kshi , which , as in early Greek , meant " to people a country , " " to build houses and cities , " " to colonize . "
Later , in Greek , the word came to mean " to establish , " " to build up and develop , " and finally , " to produce , " " create , " " bring about . "
Having in mind these other connotations of the verb ktizw , St. Basil discerned the proper implication of the word in this context and hence made a point of emphasizing this distinction .

39 " Famines and droughts and floods are common plagues of cities and nations which check the excess of evil .
Therefore , just as the physician is a benefactor even if he should cause pain or suffering to the body ( for he strives with the disease , and not with the sufferer ) , so in the same manner God is good Who administers salvation to everyone through the means of particular chastisements .
But you , not only do you not speak evilly of the physician who cuts some members , cauterizes others , and excises others again completely from the body , but you even give him money and address him as savior because he confines the disease to a small area before the infirmity can claim the whole body .
However , when you see a city crushing its inhabitants in an earthquake , or a ship going down at sea with all hands , you do not shrink from wagging a blasphemous tongue against the true Physician and Savior . "
St. Basil the Great , op .
cit. 7 , 94 .
" And you may accept the phrase ' I kill and I will make to live ' ( Deut. 32:39 ) literally , if you wish , since fear edifies the more simple .
' I will smite and I will heal ' ( Deut. 32:39 ) .
It is profitable to also understand this phrase literally ; for the smiting engenders fear , while the healing incites to love .
It is permitted you , nonetheless , to attain to a loftier understanding of the utterance .
I will slay through sin and make to live through righteousness .
' But though our outward man perish , yet the inward man is renewed day by day ' ( II Cor. 4:16 ) .
Therefore ,
He does not slay one , and give life to another , but through the means which He slays , He gives life to a man , and He heals a man with that which He smites him , according to the proverb which says , ' For thou shalt beat him with the rod , and shalt deliver his soul from death ' ( Prov. 23:14 ) .
So the flesh is chastised for the soul to be healed , and sin is put to death for righteousness to live ....
When you hear ' There shall be no evil in a city which the Lord hath not wrought ' ( cf. Amos 3:6 ) , understand by the noun ' evil ' that the word intimates the tribulation brought upon sinners for the correction of offenses .
For Scripture says , ' For I afflicted thee and straitened thee , to do good to thee ' ( cf. Deut . 8:3 ) ; so too is evil terminated before it spills out unhindered , as a strong dike or wall holds back a river .
" For these reasons , diseases of cities and nations , droughts , barrenness of the earth , and the more difficult conditions in the life of each , cut off the increase of wickedness .
Thus , such evils come from God so as to uproot the true evils , for the tribulations of the body and all painful things from without have been devised for the restraining of sin .
God , therefore , excises evil ; never is evil from God ....
The razing of cities , earthquakes and floods , the destruction of armies , shipwrecks and all catastrophes with many casualties which occur from earth or sea or air or fire or whatever cause , happen for the sobering of the survivors , because God chastises public evil with general scourges .
" The principal evil , therefore , which is sin , and which is especially worthy of the appellation of evil , depends upon our disposition ; it depends upon us either to abstain from evil or to be in misery .
" Of the other evils , some are shown to be struggles for the proving of courage ... while some are for the healing of sins ... and some are for an example to make other men sober . "

Everything will be transformed suddenly , in the twinkling of an eye ....

They will sound in the soul and conscience !
All will become clear to the human conscience .
The Prophet Daniel , speaking of the Last Judgment , relates how the Ancient of Days , the Judge , sits on His throne , and before Him is a fiery stream ( Dan. 7:9-10 ) .
Fire is a purifying element ; it burns sins .
Woe to a man if sin has become a part of his nature : then the fire will burn the man himself .
This fire will be kindled within a man ; seeing the Cross , some will rejoice , but others will fall into confusion , terror , and despair .
Thus will men be divided instantly .
The very state of a man 's soul casts him to one side or the other , to right or to left .
" The more consciously and persistently a man strives toward God in his life , the greater will be his joy when he hears : ' Come unto Me , ye blessed . '
And conversely : the same words will call the fire of horror and torture on those who did not desire Him , who fled and fought or blasphemed Him during their lifetime !
" The Last Judgment knows of no witnesses or written protocols !
Everything is inscribed in the souls of men and these records , these ' books ' , are opened at the Judgment .
Everything becomes clear to all and to oneself .
" And some will go to joy , while others -- to horror .
" When ' the books are opened , ' it will become clear that the roots of all vices lie in the human soul .
Here is a drunkard or a lecher : when the body has died , some may think that sin is dead too .
No !
There was an inclination to sin in the soul , and that sin was sweet to the soul , and if the soul has not repented of the sin and has not freed itself from it , it will come to the Last Judgment also with the same desire for sin .
It will never satisfy that desire and in that soul there will be the suffering of hatred .
It will accuse everyone and everything in its tortured condition , it will hate everyone and everything .
' There will be gnashing of teeth ' of powerless malice and the unquenchable fire of hatred .
" A ' fiery gehenna ' -- such is the inner fire .
' Here there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth . '
Such is the state of hell . "

Quantum of Solace is a shitpile .
If you do n't have time to read this entire review , here 's all you need to know about Quantum of Solace : the second - in - command to the super villain is named Elvis , and is played by this guy :
This summer , terror has a new name : Elvis .
Imagine finding out you got rejected from community college , then finding out that your alcoholic father got arrested for domestic abuse , you lost all your life savings in a Ponzi scheme , and all of this happens to you while you 're on the space shuttle Challenger .
Then you wake up and it's all a bad dream , except you realize that you 're at work without clothes on , and work is NASA and you 're really on the space shuttle Challenger .
That 's what this movie is like , only infinitely worse .
Everything about this movie pissed me off , save for the lesbian finger bang scene .
Except even that sucked because it was n't in the movie .
Here 's the premise :
Bolivia .
That 's what 's at stake in the new James Bond movie .
Except not the entire country , just the public utilities .
And not all public utilities , just 60 % of the water ...
Yes , if a certain evil villain gets his way , 60 % of the water in Bolivia will cost more .
JESUS NO !
Only James
Bond the secret agent who foiled a plot to destroy London with nuclear missiles can make water more affordable for Bolivians !
This is easily the stupidest James Bond movie since the last one .
I do n't know what Hollywood 's obsession is with making jerk - off movies where the bad guys are " realistic . "
You know what 's another word for realistic ?
Boring .
If I wanted realism , I 'd walk down the street to get Mexican food , and maybe stop by a Borders and pick up some magazines .
You know why they do n't make movies about me shopping for magazines ?
That 's because nobody gives a shit .
And that 's what Quantum of Solace is : me shopping for magazines , with no Mexican food .
I do n't see movies for realism , and if I did , I sure as hell would n't watch one made by some asshole who thinks " reality " can best be represented with the aid of 219 special effects artists .
Which leads me to this movie 's biggest problem :
Marc Forster is an idiot .
If Marc Forster was an X - man , his super power would be ruining brands .
Question : what 's the difference between Oscar winning director Marc Forster , and a first - year film - school student ?
Nothing apparently , because his movie is wrought with compromise and stupid film - school gimmicks .
There was a scene in the movie shot in Siena where Forster agreed to conditions which forbade him from using helicopter shots or showing any violence " involving people or animals . "
That 's why when a gunshot was fired into a crowd of thousands of people , you do n't see a single limb explode .
Emphasis on you and not me because I imagined a scene where the bullet not only kills people , but is sentient and kills every single person in the stadium , starting with grandmas and horses , then when the last person is killed , the bullet turns into a hot alien babe who then proceeds to make love to my junk , orally .
Except my wiener is really a shotgun , and I blow her head off .
Too bad , hottie !
As for the film - school gimmicks , Forster cram - packed this movie with symbolism .
There 's a scene where some chick gets inexplicably drowned in oil , and it 's supposed to parallel an iconic scene from Goldfinger .
There 's another scene in an opera house that " pays homage " to the Hitchcock movie The Man Who Knew Too Much , and a planefight that pays homage to yet another Hitchcock movie , North by Northwest .
Then Forster made all the action sequences in the movie revolve around earth , water , air and fire .
HOLY SHIT WE GET IT , YOU LIKE TO USE SYMBOLISM IN YOUR MOVIES :
Everyone always thinks that directors are super smart if they use symbolism , like somehow conveying something visually gives the movie some validity it would n't have had if the same message was conveyed through dialogue alone .
But nobody ever asks : why ?
Why do pretentious artsy dipshits think symbolism is the holy grail of filmmaking ?
And yes , I know Forster was trying to say that oil is more precious than gold ( it 's not ) , and even if it was , that message has nothing to do with the movie because THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT WATER .
Does anyone other than James Bond nerds care that some chick was arbitrarily made to look like some other chick from an old movie ?
If you took the symbolism out of the movie , would it make any difference ?
That 's a rhetorical question , and the answer is my fist .
Nobody cares about artsy gimmicks .
Focus on making the movie not suck instead , assholes .
Marc Forster : part - time director , full - time idiot .
Characters from foreign countries usually speak english in a foreign accent instead of their native tongue in movies , because subtitles do n't sit well with audiences .
It 's sort of a cop out , but not a big deal because there 's an unspoken agreement between audiences and directors that states : " we , the audience , do n't want to read and in return , we promise not to make a big fuss about you dumbing down society and culture . "
Well Marc Forster has done the seemingly impossible , and found an analogue to " english with an accent , " only visually .
Every time there 's a location change in the movie , the name of the country flashes up on the screen , but instead of using plain type , Forster uses a different font for every country .
So when there 's a scene in Russia , they use a font that looks kind of Russian , but is still in english .
Not only is it unnecessary and condescending , but it shows just how much contempt Forster has for his audience .
Hey Forster , you know why we do n't need ethnic - looking fonts to illustrate the fact that we 're in another country ?
Because letters placed in close proximity to each other spell words that represent the names of those countries .
That , and the obvious change in scenery .
Where 's your artsy visual symbolism now , asshole ?
I mean , this is some Windows movie maker shit .
Even my mom who 's a total / b/ tard and sucks at non-linear editing knows that using fancy fonts makes her a lameass .
Hey , guess who 's still an idiot ?
Marc Forster .
The decision to set this movie in Bolivia was puzzling , because based on my knowledge of the geopolitical influence of Latin American countries , I posit the following : Bolivia does n't matter .
In fact , none of the scenes in the movie were even shot in Bolivia ( shot in Chile instead ) .
But what makes this plot industrial - strength stupid is that it 's based on a true story .
Only they forgot to tell you that .
What 's it called when you borrow a story without giving credit ?
Oh yeah , theft .
But to be fair , they did change the story by making it duller :
In 1999 , Bechtel corporation signed a contract with the president of Bolivia to privatize the water supply in the 3rd - largest city , and shortly thereafter tripled the water rates ( source - new window ) .
Yeah , that 's right , they tripled the rates in real life ... so when the bad guy in James Bond threatens to double the rates , it 's like the producers are challenging you to give less of a shit .
They took a non-interesting real - life story and somehow made it less interesting than real life .
And finally , no review of Quantum of Solace can be complete without talking about how extraordinarily stupid the title is .
I know people all over the world jumped all over it as soon as it was announced , but I do n't think anyone truly realizes how literally the title is meant to be taken .
So do n't email crying about how I 'm not the first person to point this out , because I am , and frankly I 'm writing this as a gesture of charity by sharing my genius with the world , so shut your fat mouth .
Here 's what each word of the subtitle means :
Quantum : Noun 1 .
A discrete amount of something that is analogous to the quantities in quantum theory .
Solace : Noun 1 .
The comfort you feel when consoled in times of sadness or misery .
So the title literally translates to " James Bond : A discrete amount of comfort felt when consoled during a time of sadness . "
In the final scene of the movie , James Bond finally catches some dude he was chasing for revenge , and then Bond ( Daniel Craig ) shows off his acting chops by showing the tiniest glimmer of a smirk , an almost infinitesimally small , but measurable amount of consolation .
It 's hard to describe how incomprehensibly stupid this scene was with mere words , so here 's what it looked like :
A literal quantum of solace .
Man , this review is like 10 pages long already and I have n't even started talking about the stupid boat scene ( basically there 's a 2 - hour long boat scene where Bond gets chased by 3 boats , and it ends when Bond just decides to drive off ) , or how Bond spies on the super villain by driving his motorcycle up to a chainlink fence on a sunny afternoon and just listens to them talk .
Quantum of Solace is a shit pastry .
Avoid :
I hope Transporter 3 does n't suck !
