Lolita
3 x Lolita
Von Nabokov über Kubrick zu Lyne
1
Es ist ein fatales System von Übermalungen und Bezügen , das Filme wie Adrian Lynes LOLITA nicht für sich selbst , sondern immer nur im Vergleich zu anderem , zur Literatur , zu einem anderen Film , zu einer aufgebrochenen Wunde im Fleisch der sexuellen Ökonomie , zu einer medialen Verhandlung öffentlicher Moral sprechen lassen kann .
Eigentlich gibt es nur zwei Möglichkeiten , auf einen solchen Film zu reagieren , nämlich in der Halbnaheinstellung auf seine eigenen Bilder , oder im Panoramaschwenk über eine bizarre Landschaft der Mythen und Phantasien .
Man könnte also alle seine Abbildungen , Imitationen , Korrekturen und Beziehungen ausblenden , um nur von dem Film selbst zu sprechen , so wie wir bei einem Genrefilm nur wenig Interesse für die literarische Vorlage und fast gar keine dafür entwickeln , welche sozialen und moralischen Widersprüche er möglicherweise vertiefen oder beschleunigen könnte .
Dann könnte man sagen , daß LOLITA Adrian Lynes bislang bester Film ist , was ihn indes noch lange zu keinem Meisterstück macht , und daß er hinter das kleine Genre der Jeremy - Irons - Filme ( Mann in der Lebenskrise verliebt sich in junge Frau , die Liaison zersetzt seine Familie , seine Karriere , seinen sozialen Ort , und am Ende ist der Held mehr oder weniger tot ) so etwas wie einen passablen Schlußpunkt setzen könnte .
In Lynes Film funktioniert freilich , anders als in Wayne Wangs Irons - Film CHINESE BOX , die Projektion dieser Genregeschichte auf einen konkreten sozialen Ort , genau gesagt auf ein provinzielles Amerika der Nachkriegszeit .
Die locations sind zu einer romantisch - satirischen Reise durch die USA der fünfziger Jahre arrangiert , und auch der Regisseur ist offensichtlich dort am inspiriertesten , wo er seine so kompakte wie berechenbare Geschichte an nostalgischen americana bricht , mehr noch dort , wo er die tragische Geschichte mit unerwartet ironischen , ja komischen Aspekten bereichert .
Wohl gemerkt :
Es handelt sich um eine Tragödie , und aus ihr kein Melodram gemacht zu haben , ist schon ein kleines Verdienst des Regisseurs .
Die andere Art , sich diesem
Film zu nähern , die schwierigere und vielleicht auch ein bißchen ungerechtere , ist , sich auf das System der Übermalungen und Beziehungen einzulassen .
Dann geht es nicht nur um Lynes Film , sondern auch um Vladimir Nabokovs Roman , um einen erotischen Mythos ( nebst Erinnerungen an die Wirklichkeit der sexuellen Ökonomie des Kapitalismus in den Vereinigten Staaten und anderswo ) , um den grandiosen Film von Stanley Kubrick ( der gerade auf Video wieder veröffentlich wurde ) und schließlich um die Verhandlung jener Schuld , die sich im Mythos aufheben möchte .
Denn in „ Lolita " geht es um nichts anderes als um einen alten Mann , der ein elfjähriges Mädchen mißbraucht , erpreßt und erniedrigt .

Vladimir Nabokovs Roman „ Lolita " ist eine Aufzeichnung aus dem Gefängnis .
Diese Perspektive , die keine der beiden Verfilmungen übernimmt , unterlegt dem Geschehen den Ton verzweifelter Klaustrophobie .
Das Begehren und die Schuld kreisen end - und ausweglos umeinander .
Und schon bevor man sich auf die gerade in ihrer Mehrdeutigkeit so präzise Sprache des Autors eingestimmt hat , weiß man schon , daß da ein Mann zur Selbstrechtfertigung und zugleich zur Selbstbefriedigung lügt .
Der Literaturprofessor Humbert Humbert , ein europäischer Immigrant im Amerika der ausklingenden vierziger Jahre , ist seit einem Jugenderlebnis der unerreichbaren , „ dämonischen " erotischen Faszination des Mädchens zwischen neun und 14 verfallen , deren furchtbare Anziehungskraft , wie Humbert meint , nur „ Künstler und Wahnsinnige " erkennen .
Als Humbert auf Dolores ( „ Lolita " )
Haze trifft , scheint sich sein Ideal vollständig zu erfüllen .
Um ihr
nahe zu sein , heiratet er ihre verwitwete , ein wenig vulgäre Mutter Charlotte .
Als die bemerkt , was sich zwischen ihrem neuen Mann und ihrer Tochter abspielt , bricht sie mit Humbert , kommt jedoch gleich darauf bei einem Verkehrsunfall ums Leben - ein dummer Zufall , der Humbert vor den Mühen bewahrt , seine Frau selbst umzubringen .
Nun holt sich Humbert das Kind aus dem Sommercamp ; Lolita gibt sich Humberts Begehren hin , aber seine hörige Liebe ist ihr schnell Mittel zum Zweck :
Sie erpreßt ihn , so wie er sie immer wieder mit Drohungen gefügig macht .
Um vermeintlichen oder tatsächlichen Nachstellungen zu entgehen , begibt sich Humbert Humbert mit ihr auf eine lange Reise quer durch die USA .
Nach einem Jahr von Lehrtätigkeit und Seßhaftigkelt fühlt er sich wieder verfolgt , und die Reise beginnt erneut .
Der Verfolger nimmt nach und nach Gestalt an : Quilty , der „ dekadente " Bühnenautor ; und es wird klar , daß dieser längst mit Lolita Kontakt aufgenommen und ihre Entführung / Befreiung geplant hat .
Nach einem Aufenthalt im Krankenhaus bleibt Lolita spurlos verschwunden , alle Nachforschungen verlaufen ergebnislos .
Erst drei Jahre später erreicht Humbert wieder eine Nachricht von ihr : Sie ist verheiratet , erwartet ein Kind , und sie braucht Geld .
Nach einer letzten Begegnung macht sich Humbert auf , den vermeintlichen Peiniger Clare Quilty zu richten .
Im fiktiven Vorwort eines „ Herausgebers " vom Humberts Lebensbeichte heißt es , Humbert sei vor Beginn seines Mordprozesses an Herzversagen und Lolita bei der Geburt ihres Kindes gestorben .
Zunächst schildert Nabokov in seinem Roman aus dem Jahr 1954 die Verwandlung des Begehrens in eine Manie .
Humbert Humberts Sehnsucht nach den „ Nymphettes " ist eine erotische Verrücktheit , aber zugleich ist es eine fast schon mathematische , kalte , von furchtbarer Planung bestimmte Manie , die weder das eigene Glück , noch gar das der begehrten Kindfrauen umfaßt .
Deshalb treibt es ihn in die Waisenhäuser und Erziehungheime , wo er die Objekte seiner Begierde „ straffrei anstarren " kann .
Humbert träumt sich diese Nymphen zu den Komplizen seiner Wolllust , indem er einen Teil seiner Schuld auf sie projiziert .
Es ist durchaus möglich , daß sich die Fremdheit des äußeren oder inneren Exilanten in dieser Manie spiegelt , die das Objekt der Begierde konstruieren muß , weil das Subjekt in der erotischen Mythologie einer Gesellschaft nicht zu Hause ist .
Der entfremdetste aller Männer , der exilierte Intellektuelle , der aus den Mythen und Territorien gefallene , alternde Mann , begehrt sein scheinbares Gegenteil , das Mädchen .
In der Tiefenstruktur des Stoffes geht es also um eine Wechselbeziehung von Fremdheit und Begehren .
Doch diese Struktur ist nun freilich gleichsam unendlich perspektivisch zu verändern ; das Begehren des „ falschen " Objekts will die Fremdheit zugleich überwinden und erklären und verstärkt sie dadurch noch .
Humbert Humbert kommt nicht nur über das Kindliche in seiner Annäherung an die Frau nicht hinaus , er kommt über das Kindliche an Amerika nicht heraus .
Darin übrigens unterscheiden sich Kubrick und Lyne in ihren Film - Versionen radikal : Während Kubricks
Held gerade die - kalten - Zeichen der Kindlichkeit begehrt , wird Lynes Humbert Humbert beständig von ihnen provoziert .
Kubricks
Held , zumindest darin näher am Roman , sehnt sich nach dem Kind in der Frau , Lynes Held dagegen sehnt sich nach der Frau in dem Kind .
Und das ergibt ein neues Problem : „ Lolita " ist nämlich vielleicht gar nicht so sehr eine literarische Figur von Obsession und Entfremdung - sie ist auch ein amerikanischer Mythos .
Das Mädchen steht im Zentrum aller sozialen Gewalt : Zu ihrem Schutz ist beinahe alles erlaubt , und es in Frage zu stellen , läßt den Mythos implodieren .
Es ist zugleich Rechtfertigung und Problem des patriarchalen Mannes , der ständig hin - und hergerissen ist zwischen seinem Begehren und seinem Impuls , an ihrer Unschuld ins Unermeßliche zu „ wachsen " .
Dieses Begehren ist weder „ natürlich “ noch ..dämonisch " , es ist vielmehr konsequenter Ausdruck einer radikalen Abwehr der Frau .
Jeder Satz von Humbert Humberts Lebensbericht , jedes Kapitel in der Rekonstruktion seines Mythos , spricht von seinem Haß auf die Frau , die er stets schneller abzuwerten versucht , als diese in der Lage ist , ihn zu enttäuschen .
Nicht zufällig steht ganz am Anfang die Schilderung der grotesken Situation , in der Humberts Ehefrau ihre Liebschaft mit einem zaristischen Taxifahrer in Paris offenbart .
„ Und Humbert der Schreckliche beriet sich mit Humbert dem Kleinen , ob Humbert Humbert sie oder ihren Liebhaber ermorden solle oder beide oder keinen . "
- Erwähnte ich schon , daß „ Lolita " eines der komischsten Bücher der Weltliteratur ist ?
Die Untreue der Frau im alten Europa also treibt Professor Humbert in die Neue Welt , in der er seine Manie für die Nymphettes ausbildet , die neben vielem anderen auch die heftigsten Bilder der amerikanischen Kultur benutzen , all die unterschwelligen Symbole , die sich eine puritanische Gesellschaft für ihre unterdrückten Wünsche schafft : die Hula - Hoop - Reifen , die die Becken zum Kreisen bringen , die Lollipops und Sonnenbrillen in Herzform .
Humbert Humbert ist in eine Kultur gekommen , in der kleine Mädchen sich kleiden und sich geben wie erwachsene Frauen .
Seine Empfindung ist nicht codiert auf dieses semantische Imitationsspiel : Er nimmt die Zeichen beim Wort .
Der Mythos der Kindfrau und der ewigen Reise ist freilich auch tief in die Western - Zivilisation eingeschrieben .
Jeder einsame Cowboy sucht das Mädchen , das allein in der Lage wäre , auf die vollständige Zivilisierung ( die vollständige Kastration ) des Mannes zu verzichten .
Aber auch nur sie verspricht , keine unerfüllbaren Ansprüche an den Mann zu stellen .
Es ist der Puritaner - Kapitalismus , der den Mythos von „ Lolita " hervorbringen muß .
Und Humbert Humbert versucht lange , ihn zu erfüllen , ohne ihn zu zerstören : „ Das Kind wittert nichts . "
Doch dieser
Mythos ist nicht nur aus dem Blickwinkel Humbert Humberts zu lesen , des Mannes , der seinem eingekerkerten , seriellen Begehren verfallen ist , sondern auch aus der Perspektive von Lolita , die ihr Gegenüber nicht minder als Doppelgestalt wahrnimmt : als Liebhaber und als Vater ( oder auch : als Objekt der Ausbeutung und Subjekt des Schutzes ) .
In dieser Perspektive scheint sie keineswegs als die berechnende Kindfrau , die sich den ihr hörigen Mann zum willigen Werkzeug macht , sondern im Gegenteil als das verängstigte , gepeinigte Mädchen , das alle ihre Fähigkeiten mobilisieren muß , um die Gefangenschaft in den Händen eines larmoyanten Sadisten zu überleben .
Auch Lolita muß an der Unauflöslichkeit dieses Widerspruchs zugrunde gehen .
Nabokov spricht ihre Qual und ihren Ekel nur allzu deutlich aus , und es ist offenkundig nicht so sehr eine Frage des Textes als eine Frage der gesellschaftlichen Lesart , daß man die Tragödie des lüsternen alten Mannes , und nicht die Tragödie des mißbrauchten Kindes darin gesehen hat .
„ Lolita " ist nicht nur die Geschichte eines alternden Mannes , der einer Kindfrau verfällt , sondern es ist auch die Geschichte eines Mädchens , das in seiner Suche nach dem Mann an ein wahres Ungeheuer gerät : an Humbert Humbert , der seine Angst , für sein falsches Begehren bestraft zu werden , unbarmherzig an sein menschliches Objekt weitergibt und Lolita unter vielem anderen damit an sich bindet , daß er droht , sie in ein Erziehungsheim zu geben .
Dieses männliche Ungeheuer , das das Schlimmste von beidem , vom Vater und vom Liebhaber vereint , eine Gestalt reiner Hoffnungslosigkeit , tritt gleich zweimal an die Stelle eines anderen , verschwindenden Mannes : an die Stelle des verschwundenen Vaters und an die Stelle von Charlie , Dolores ' erstem Lover .
Aber der Ursupator wird selbst von einem Double gejagt , vom nächsten Stadium der Ausbeutung .
Befreien möchte sich Humbert im Mord an Quilty ( dem Gespenst seiner Schuld ) von der Widernatur seines Begehrens , vom dekadenten , homosexuellen und zuhälterischen anderen , der ihm freilich viel ähnlicher ist als er wahrhaben will .
Beide leben in einer künstlichen
Welt , in der sie ihr Interesse auf ein je „ drittes Geschlecht " richten , wie Humbert einmal die Nymphettes bezeichnet .
So wird , zumindest im Roman , ziemlich deutlich , daß die Manie für die Nymphe noch einen ganz anderen Aspekt hat , nämlich Humberts Flucht vor der eigenen Homosexualität .
Männer und Frauen , die er nur in abwertenden Bildern voller Sarkasmus und Ekel beschreiben kann , voller Mordlust , scheinen sich gegen ihn verschworen zu haben .
Nur die Nymphe , dieses dritte Geschlecht , soll sein exklusiver Besitz sein , vor der Welt verborgen und gegen eine Weiblichkeit gerichtet , die ihn verstoßen hat .
Selbst noch in seiner Gerichtsverhandlung beleidigt er die Frauen unter den Geschworenen , indem er sie als „ Sehr frigide " statt „ verehrte Damen " anredet - es hat sich also nichts in ihm geklärt .
Dolores schließlich ist , weil sie die Erfüllung der erotischen Manie scheint , gerade ihre Zerstörung .
Sie entheiligt die Manie , weil sie den Mythos der Unschuld entlarvt , ja sie ist nicht einmal mehr Jungfrau , aber zugleich verlangt sie Humbert einen Transformationsprozeß ab .
Am Ende , als Lolita ganz und gar aus ihrem Mythos getreten ist , ist Humbert endgültig davon überzeugt , daß er sie liebt .
Beide Filme glauben ihm dabei bedingungslos , mit der Konsequenz , diesem lächerlichen Mann die Tragödie zu überlassen .
Aber von welcher Art diese Liebe war und ist , schildert Nabokov mit boshafter Beiläufigkeit im 33 .
und letzten Kapitel des ersten Teils von „ Lolita " .
„ Im fröhlichen Lepingville kaufte ich ihr vier Comic - Hefte , eine Schachtel Süßzeug , eine Schachtel Binden , zwei Colas , ein Manikür - Etui , einen Reisewecker mit Leuchtziffern , einen Ring mit einem echten Topas , einen Tennisschläger , Rollschuhe mit hohen weißen Schnürstiefeln , einen Feldstecher , ein Kofferradio , Kaugummi , eine Regenhaut , eine Sonnenbrille , noch ein paar Kleidungsstücke - Charmis , Shorts , alle möglichen Sommerfummel .
Im Hotel hatten wir getrennte Zimmer , aber mitten in der Nacht kam sie schluchzend zu mir , und sehr sanft machten wir es wieder gut .
Verstehen Sie , sie hatte sonst ja auch niemanden , zu dem sie hätte gehen können . "
Immerhin ist Humbert Humbert am Ende amerikanischer Mann genug , um anders als in Europa tatsächlich zum Mord zu schreiten .
Er muß sich von seinem polymorph perversen Widerschein in Clare Quilty ( in diesem Namen spukt ja , neben der guilt als Schuld , auch der quill , der „ Federkiel " eines Autors , und nicht zuletzt der quilt als das Zusammengesetzte ) befreien , und dessen Vorname hat nicht nur einen weiblichen Klang , sondern auch eine Klarheit , die für Humbert Humbert , den schon in sich Verdoppelten , nicht zu haben ist und der zu allem Übel mit einem „ affektierten britischen Akzent “ spricht .
Der Hinweis , daß es sich bei Quilty ja um einen „ praktisch impotenten " Theaterautor handelt , bleibt bei Lyne unklar , während es bei Kubrick Anlaß eines makabren Rollenspiels wird .
Eine Rivalität der Autoren also ( des Lyrikers und des Dramatikers ) gibt dem Todesspiel eine irrwitzige literarische Komponente , und am Ende wälzen sich die beiden nicht nur mehr oder minder nackt am Boden , sondern Humbert zwingt Quilty auch , laut sein Gedicht zu lesen , das zugleich sein Todesurteil ist und das endet : „ Für alles was du tatest , für alles was ich nicht tat mußt du sterben . "

Daß der Roman schlechterdings unverfilmbar ist , liegt nicht nur an seinem gewagten
Thema , es ist vielmehr die literarische Methode , die sich nicht ins Filmbild übertragen läßt .
Von Nabokovs
Erzähler wissen wir nämlich bald , daß wir ihm nicht trauen dürfen , er maskiert sich , führt uns und vielleicht sich selbst in die Irre .
Ihn verrät nur seine Sprache .
Das Filmbild , zumindest in der linearen Erzählweise , kann solche Irritation nicht erzeugen - mehr noch : Nur jemand , der seinen Helden so durchschaut wie Nabokov , könnte in einem „ Erzählfilm " Zweifel an der „ objektiven " Wahrheit der Erzählung aufkommen lassen .
Nicht umsonst hat Nabokov einmal erklärt , „ Lolita " gebe seine frühe Liebesgeschichte mit der englischen Sprache wieder .
Trotzdem schrieb er zur ersten Verfilmung seines Romans selbst ein detailliertes Drehbuch , das , so heißt es , für einen etwa siebenstündigen Film gereicht hätte .
Zusammen mit dem Regisseur Stanley Kubrick überarbeitete der Autor das Script , doch auch von dieser Neufassung ging , so heißt es , weniger als ein Viertel in den fertigen Film in .
Die englische Produktion LOLITA ( 1961 ) entspricht also eher Kubricks Lektüre des Romans vor dem Hintergrund einer zögerlich sich ihren eigenen Wünschen und Ängsten öffnenden Gesellschaft als einer filmischen Relektüre Nabokovs .
Es ist kein Zufall , daß David Lynch Kubricks LOLITA als seinen Lieblingsfilm bezeichnet hat : Auf den Spuren von Humbert Humbert und Lolita Haze kommt der Regisseur - schwarz / weiß und Breitwand , das heißt : hyperreal - in eine amerikanische Provinz , in der der Keim zu Lumberton und Twin Peaks gelegt ist .
Anders aIs Lynes Film geht Kubricks Arbeit weder psychologisch noch mythisch wirklich auf .
Denn wenigstens insofern bleibt der Regisseur seiner literarischen Vorlage treu , daß er von Anbeginn an ein Spiel der Täuschungen durchführt , wenngleich er wahrhaft radikal die Rollen von Täuschern und Getäuschten auf den Kopf stellt .
Kubricks LOLITA ist wahrhaft eine „ Aufführung " , nicht nur , weil die Schulaufführung eine Schlüsselrolle spielt und Peter Sellers einmal mehr seine Verkleidungskünste einsetzt .
Schon Humberts
Mord an Quilty , den Kubrick an den Beginn stellt , ist eine theatralische Inszenierung , und deutlicher als bei Lyne wird bei Kubrick die Richtung der Passion von Humbert : die Tötung der Frau ( der Weiblichkeit ) im Zeichen der Nymphette , Humberts Kugeln treffen Quilty durch das Gemälde einer Frau hindurch .
Quiltys Aufspaltung und Rollenspiele als immer neue Doubles von Humbert ist der Schlüssel zu einer Satire auf Amerika .
Auf den ersten Blick hat er sozusagen die Fronten klargestellt , die falsche , die Humbert - Leseart des Textes übernommen , freilich um den Preis , daß seine Lolita ( Sue Lyon ) nur noch Reste von Kindlichkeit an sich hat , von denen wir nicht einmal wissen , wie weit sie gespielt sind .
So ist ihre Tragödie von vornherein ausgeblendet , und Humbert Humberts Nymphen - Mythos scheint eine reine Schimäre , die sich folgerichtig auch in einem System der Täuschungen und Verdoppelungen auflöst .
James Mason , Kapitän Nemo und Fliegender Holländer , ist auch hier auf einer romantischen Weltfluchtreise : Seine Lolita ist eine Begleiterin , die ihn immer wieder in die Wirklichkeit zieht , das scheint Strafe genug .
Doch aus dem Hintergrund greift da immer dieser Quilty in mannigfachen Verkleidungen ein und taucht immer als eine Person , die Angst und Schuldgefühle auslöst , auf , als Psychologe , als Polizist , als Beamter : der Abgesandte eines fernen Über - Ichs , eine männliche Seele , die nicht erwachsen werden , die nicht erwachen will , aber vielleicht auch einer , der , wie so häufig bei Kubrick , heimlich die Fäden zieht , das Spiel manipuliert , es zum Teil erst erfindet .
Und je mehr dieses
Thema in den Vordergrund rückt , desto weniger hat Kubricks Film eigentlich noch mit Nabokovs Text zu tun .
Nicht wer oder was Lolita ist , hat in diesem Zusammenhang Bedeutung , sondern nur , daß Humberts Beziehung zu ihr etwas Verbotenes hat , daß sie nicht geheuer ist .
Und wie so oft bei Kubrick geht auch mit Humbert Humbert eine Verwandlung vor ; er wird zu einem nur noch mechanisch funktionierenden Double seiner selbst .
Kubrick hat mit dem Mord an Quilty begonnen , um Spannung zu erzeugen .
Dadurch aber gerät Lolita sozusagen durch eine narrative Klammer in neuerliche Gefangenschaft , als wäre sie nur der McGuffin für einen Kampf eines Mannes mit seinem Doppelgänger .
Kubricks LOLITA , bei seiner Erstaufführung von kaum einer Kritik angenommen , ist ein philosophischer Essay in Bildern .
Natürlich ergibt Sue Lyon nicht das Bild einer Nymphette , wie sie Nabokov beschreibt .
Dadurch rückt Humberts Manie in den Hintergrund , im Vordergrund dagegen steht eine sehr detaillierte Schilderung der Beziehungen von Kaufen , Drohen und Begehren in der amerikanischen Zeichenwelt .
4
Lyne hat einen etwas anderen Zugang zum Thema .
Humbert Humberts Abrechnung mit Quilty am Schluß zum Beispiel ist eine
Art blutige Groteske , die ihresgleichen sucht und tatsächlich der Geschichte eine ganz eigene Wendung gibt - sie ist , endlich , näher an Nabokov denn an Kubrick , wenngleich weit entfernt von der Splatter - Komik des Autors : „ Ich konnte mich nicht überwinden , ihn anzurühren , mich zu vergewissern , daß er wirklich tot war .
Er sah danach aus : Ein Viertel seines Gesichts war weg , und zwei Fliegen brummten darüber , außer sich bei der Witterung eines unglaublichen Glücks . "
Andererseits ist man selbst dort noch schnell bei den Vergleichen : Was Stanley Kubrick in einem einzigen Bild ausdrückt - Humbert Humberts Schüsse auf Quilty durch das Gemälde einer Frau hindurch - dazu braucht es bei Lyne reichlich Zeit und Symbolspiel .
Schon deshalb wahrscheinlich beginnt er nicht mit dem Mord , sondern mit dem ( vorweggenommenen ) Sterben Humberts .
Sexualität , sagt Rachel Abramowitz zu Lynes Werk , ist für ihn kein Akt der Intimität , sondern ein gnadenloser Kampf der Geschlechter .
9 I/2 WOCHEN , EINE VERHÄNGNISVOLLE AFFÄRE und EIN UNMORALISCHES ANGEBOT - es ist immer die Frage nach der sexuellen Gewalt und Korruption , nicht nur in den Narrationen , sondern in den „ skandalösen " Bildern .
Und auch LOLITA leidet unter diesem reaktionären Geist und fällt damit weit hinter Nabokovs Text , aber auch hinter Kubricks sarkastische Satire zurück .
Der Film ist so unwissend , daß er seinem Helden jedes
Wort zu glauben scheint , daß er nicht anders sehen kann als durch dessen Augen .
Lyne , dieser Tropf , hat nicht Nabokov , sondern Humbert Humbert verfilmt .
Unbeirrbar erzählt er , anders als Kubrick und anders gewiß als Nabokov , eine Liebesgeschichte , bei der die Manie allenfalls marginale Bedeutung hat .
Die Gewalt in dieser Geschichte gehört nur so dazu .
Der Film betont vielmehr den klassischen Mythos der verlorenen Liebe : Humbert liebte als Junge Annabelle , die so früh sterben mußte , und erschafft sich in den Nymphettes immer wieder neu das Bild der toten Geliebten .
So als wäre Lolita zur jungen Statue eines unter der Last seiner Gier bebenden Pygmalion versteinert .
Eine ausgesprochen romantische Phantasie , die nichts mit der sexuellen Kälte bei Kubrick zu tun hat .
Und Lolita ist nicht nur die begehrende Begehrte in der Manie , sondern auch die Wiederkehr der verbotenen Liebe .
Lolita hat sein Begehren angenommen , bevor sie ihn zum Abschied küßt , als sie ausgerechnet zum Lake Climax in die Ferien fährt .
Zurücknehmen kann sie das in Lynes Welt nicht mehr .
5
Kommen wir darum herum , LOLITA und ihre Übermalungen mit dem in Beziehung zu setzen , was als „ Kinderpornographie " neuester Ausdruck des Bösen in der spätkapitalistischen Gesellschaft
scheint ?
Daß Nabokovs „ Lolita " einem Untergenre der Pornographie den Namen gegeben hat , ist dem Autor nicht anzulasten ( der schon die erste Veröffentlichung des Werks bei Olympia Press in Paris als „ Mißgriff “ empfand ) , aber auch nicht ungeschehen zu machen .
„ Kinderpornographie " beschäftigt uns , einmal abgesehen von den medizinischen , forensischen und kriminalistischen Aspekten ( und weil der Schmerz der Kinder gegen die Vernunft , gegen die Natur , gegen Gott spricht ) , weil sie auf eine besonders heftige und besonders brutale Art die Diskurse von Macht und Sexualität zusammenbringt .
Wie jede Krankheit , so ist auch jedes Verbrechen , das für eine Zeit besonders in Gerede kommt ( selbst wenn es nicht in Wirklichkeit zunimmt ) , vor allem als Metapher wirksam .
Es ist Ausdruck der sexuellen Ausbeutung in einer deregulierten Gesellschaft , gleichsam letzte Bastion von Scham und Schuld in einem Zusammenhang , der zugleich von Scham und Schuld entfernt scheint , und mit der Körperlichkeit und dem Bild der Körperlichkeit immer weniger umzugehen versteht .
Der Mythos der kindlichen Unschuld wird , paradoxerweise , in der bürgerlichen Gesellschaft durch seine Schändung rekonstruiert , so wie alle Zustände von Natürlichkeit zuvor in der kolonialistischen Mythologie nur durch ihre Schändung rekonstruiert werden konnten .
Und die Furcht vor der allfälligen „ Kinderpornographie " entspricht nicht nur der Angst vor der unkontrollierten Kraft des barbarischen ( vornehmlich , aber keineswegs ausschließlich : des männlichen )
Begehrens , sondern auch der vor der moralischen Grenzenlosigkeit der spätkapitalistischen Bereicherungsethik .
Die sich konservativ verstehende Kritik , stellvertretend etwa Norman Podhoretz ’ Aufsatz in „ Commentary " , der die Diskussion vom Film erneut auf das Buch lenkte , versteht den Stoff gerade deswegen als „ Verführung " , weil er künstlerisch so gelungen sei .
Einmal davon abgesehen , ob in Nabokovs Roman wirklich so etwas wie eine Verführung zur Pädophilie auszumachen ist ( und ob es so etwas überhaupt geben kann ) , geht diese Konstruktion von einer gesellschaftlichen ( zumindest männlichen ) Gesamtschuld aus .
Der Impuls der Pädophilie müßte in diesem Modell allgemein verbreitet und nur durch Verbot und Zensur gezügelt sein .
Wenn wir indes diesen Gedanken zu Ende denken , so müßte letztlich jedes erotische Bild , jede erotische Phantasie ob ihres Potentials an Verführung gefährlich und zu verbieten sein .
Mit anderen Worten : Der seltsame Konflikt um „ Lolita " betrifft nicht nur die Konstruktion oder Rekonstruktion öffentlicher Repräsentanz von Moral , sondern auch das Verhältnis zwischen Bild und Wirklichkeit .
Wir haben offensichtlich nicht nur , wie die „ FAZ " formuliert , „ Lolita " früher „ robuster " lesen können , wir haben auch noch einfacher zu unterscheiden gewußt zwischen den Sinnbildern der Kunst , den Abbildern der Medien und den Zeichen der Wirklichkeit .
Vielleicht ist uns diese Wirklichkeit ja auch schon so weit entzogen , daß wir gar nicht mehr anders können , als unsere Strafgerichte und Bußprozessionen stellvertretend vor literarischen und cineastischen Bilder abzuhalten .
Der Mythos der Kindfrau funktioniert einerseits paradoxerweise nur in einer Gesellschaft , die aus politischen und ökonomischen Gründen keine mythische Lösung für den Wandel anzubieten hat .
In ihm schließt sich auf sonderbare Weise der Kreis zwischen Barbarei und Dekadenz , zwischen Natur und Entfremdung .
Andererseits ist er selbst ganz offensichtlich Ausdruck der Krise , er taucht in den Zerfallphasen der Zivilisation auf ( und ist im übrigen nur unvollkommen in der „ sauberen " faschistischen Phantasie vom „ Mädel " verborgen ) .
Die Großartigkeit von Nabokovs Roman begründet sich unter anderem darin , daß viel mehr als in Lewis Carrolls „ Alice " und Wedekinds , ; Lulu " die Revolte im Mythos beschrieben wird .
„ Lolita " offeriert keine Lösung , sie ist keine Erklärung - und tückischerweise -: Sie ist nicht einmal ein Geheimnis .
Aber wir wissen am Ende des Romans sehr viel über den Autor , über Humbert Humbert , über die Innenausstattung sexueller Macht .
In den sechziger und siebziger Jahren war die Vorstellung von der Kindfrau in sich gewiß unschuldiger , Melanie Griffith , die in Lynes Film die Mutter Lolitas spielt , hatte als 14 jährige in Arthur Penns NIGHT MOVE eine Nacktszene , die heute keinen Code mehr passieren könnte .
Doch auch weniger deutlich hat sich der Film immer wieder mit der „ Nymphe " beschäftigt , nicht bloß in den Softsex - Filmen des Fotografen David Hamilton .
Louis Malle zeigte Brooke Shields in PRETTY BABY als kindliche Hure .
Ansonsten geht es um das Drama , wie in TAXI DRIVER ( Jodie Foster ) oder CAPE FEAR ( Juliette Lewis ) , um ein vampirisches Verkleiden ( nekrophilen ) Begehrens wie in INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE .
Und Verkleidung steckt auch in Lynes Film mehr als ihm guttut .
Unter dem Eindruck des „ US Child Pornography Prevention Act " von 1996 , das jede Andeutung von erotischer Anziehung zwischen Kindern und Erwachsenen verbietet , hat er den Film immer wieder bearbeitet .
Es verschwindet dabei freilich nicht nur das Skandalöse und die Ambiguität , es verschwindet ( beinahe ) gleich ein ganzes Thema , nämlich das Nebeneinander von Kind und Frau in einer Gestalt , versinnbildlicht etwa in der geschnittenen Szene , in der Lolita zugleich sexuelle Ekstase und das Vergnügen an der Comic - Seite der Zeitung ausdrückt .
Eben diese „ radikale " Gegenüberstellung freilich hätte erst die Ambivalenz der Erzählung wiedergegeben , die Frage nämlich , über welche von beiden Seiten Humbert phantasiert / lügt .
So nähert sich der Film , gerade indem er sie zu vermeiden versucht , einer neuen Mythisierung , indem er gerade jene Szenen schneidet , in denen der Mythos auseinanderbricht ; die Widersprüche grausam und komisch zugleich Fragen stellen .
Auch die liebevolle Zeichnung der amerikanischen Provinz , diese sanften Töne und schönen , melancholischen Bauten und Natur , lassen die Geschichte beinahe versinken in einer wohligen Nostalgie , auch sie scheinen den Skandal , die Herausforderung verkleiden zu wollen .
Eine Herbstphantasie .
Aus einem durchaus ironischen Versuch über die Sprechbarkeit von Verhältnissen wird bei Lyne eine bittere Romanze .
Sein Film führt , wenn man so will , den Stoff in die Mainstream - Mythologie zurück .
Lynes Obsession ist die Frage nach Macht und Besitz in einer Beziehung , die sich auf eine simple Dialektik reduziert : Lolita und Humbert besitzen einander gleich stark , aber auf völlig unterschiedliche Weise .
Wieder einmal , wie in 9 1/2 WOCHEN oder EINE VERHÄNGNISVOLLE AFFÄRE , ist die Liebe die Konstruktion eines Gefängnisses , einer bedingungslosen Abhängigkeit , und in LOLITA macht Humbert das Mädchen zu seiner Gefangenen , weil er fühlt , daß er ihr Gefangener ist .
Wie in allen seinen Filmen konstruiert Lyne auch hier eine Mitschuld des Zuschauers , der Lolita mit Humbert Humberts Augen sieht : gierig und schuldbewußt .
Wenn sein Humbert den anderen , den wirklich bösen Kinderschänder tötet , dann tötet er damit nicht nur den einen
Teil seiner selbst , sondern er opfert auch den Schurken , um nicht die wahren Objekte seiner Aggression zu treffen : Lolita , die ganz normal schwanger von einem ganz normalen Mann ist , in einem ganz normal schäbigen
Heim lebt , zukunfts - und traumlos .
Lyne hat mit seinen Filmen wie 9 1/2 WOCHEN , EINE VERHÄNGNISVOLLE AFFÄRE oder EIN UNMORALISCHES ANGEBOT sozusagen die Mainstream - Moral versucht und immer wieder bestätigt , nun ist er im Zentrum der Versuchung selbst .
Daß er in den USA keinen Verleih fand , auch nachdem der Film nach Deutschland , Frankreich , Italien und Großbritannien verkauft war , spricht davon , daß sich in den Machtzentren auch der Traumfabrik moralische Obsessionen mittlerweile verbreiten wie ein Virus .
Daß LOLITA für die Hollywood - Mogule ein Stolperstein wird - wenn vielleicht auch nicht in der Größenordnung von Michael Ciminos HEAVEN'S GATE - , ist eigentlich schon sicher , selbst dann , wenn der Film schließlich noch einen Verleiher finden sollte , der ihn immerhin an der Peripherie des amerikanischen Mainstream - Kinos vermarkten könnte .
Er löste zum einen einen vermutlich nicht vollkommen unberechtigten Warnschrei vor der Reaktion der moralischen Mehrheit aus .
Man könnte vermuten , daß die rechtspopulistischen Politiker geradezu auf eine Gelegenheit wie diese warteten , um erneut einen Kreuzzug gegen das sündige und „ liberale " Hollywood zu führen , nicht zuletzt , um eine auch ökonomische Einflußmöglichkeit zu bekommen .
Zum anderen erscheint es fast aussichtslos , daß ein Film mit 50 Millionen Dollar Produktionskosten seinen Einsatz im beschränkten Zirkel der „ Arthouse " - Kinos wird einspielen können .
Aber letztendlich fehlt auch das Vertrauen in den Film selbst .
Wenn Hollywood an den Erfolg des Films glauben würde , dann würde es auch einen
Weg finden , ihn profitabel zu vermarkten .
So aber scheint es , daß man die Verantwortung erst einmal nach Europa verschieben möchte .
Schließlich durchsuchte im Juli 1997 die Polizei Videotheken , um Kassetten von Volker Schlöndorffs DIE BLECHTROMMEL zu beschlagnahmen .
Am Ende mag neben solchen allzu offensichtlich hinterwäldlerischen Manövern der Fall LOLITA so etwas wie ein strategisches Opfer werden , um die große Konsensmaschine Kino nicht zu gefährden .
Und wie es bei solchen Fällen zumeist der Fall ist , trifft es das falsche Objekt : Lynes Film ist nicht obszön , nicht besonders verführerisch und vermutlich kein bißchen gefährlich .
Aber er ist ziemlich dumm .
Und Lolitas
Film ist noch nicht gedreht .
Ihr Text ist noch nicht geschrieben .

In the winter of 1973 , the men and women of the British Interplanetary Society convened in London to engage in some lively interstellar discourse .
The members ’ intent was to draw up a workable design for an extremely ambitious unmanned space probe , one capable of reaching a neighboring star system within fifty years .
Moreover , they limited themselves to using only current and near - future technology , as this would allow the theories to be translated into practice one day if the concept proved feasible .
In order to reach even the nearest stars within the allotted fifty - year window , the thirteen scientists and engineers of the research group had a formidable task ahead of them .
Their space probe would be required to accelerate to astonishing speeds , and it would need to weather the constant battering of particles from the soup of space debris known as the Interstellar Medium .
In spite of these problems , in 1978 the organization presented a highly developed spaceship concept which may yet prove to be the model for future interstellar travel .
It was called Project Daedalus .
Decades before Project Daedalus began , astronomer Peter van de Kamp began using photographic plates to measure extremely small variations in the position of one of our sun ’s nearest astronomical neighbors : Barnard ’s Star .
In 1963 he announced that he had detected a perturbation in the star ’s movement , a wobble imparted on a star due to the tug of orbiting planets .
Because of this distinction , the relatively close star⁠ — only 5.9 lightyears away⁠— was selected as the destination for the Interplanetary Society ’s theoretical unmanned spaceship .
The project had three clearly stated guidelines :
The spacecraft must use current or near - future technology .
The spacecraft must reach its destination within a human lifetime .
The spacecraft must be designed to allow for a variety of target stars .
When the Society began their study , the fastest vehicle in existence was the Pioneer 10 , a probe which was zipping through space at a brisk 51,810 kilometers per hour .
Pioneer ’s journey to Jupiter was to last over a year and a half , but if it were to travel to Bernard ’s Star at such a speed , it would spend approximately 123,000 years in transit .
Clearly the Daedalus would require an extraordinary propulsion system far beyond even the best technology of the time .
In order to accelerate sufficiently , the researchers envisioned the use of a two - stage nuclear pulse rocket .
Similar to chemical rockets in basic principle , such rockets would create thrust by causing a very small explosions in a rapid series .
Pellets comprised of deuterium and helium - 3 would be bombarded by high - powered electron beams , thus triggering fusion and detonating the mass like a tiny nuclear bomb .
These explosions would be repeated at a rate of two hundred and fifty per second , using a powerful magnetic field as the rocket ’s nozzle .
Using this principle , the Daedalus ’s first rocket stage would fire for two full years , consuming 46,000 tons of fuel to accelerate to about 76.6 million kilometers per hour .
The Daedalus would then jettison the exhausted primary stage , shrugging off much of its size and weight as the second stage takes over .
Just shy of four years after departure , the spaceship would expend the last of its fuel , and coast for the remaining distance at the ludicrous speed of 135 million kilometers per hour⁠ — about 1/8 of the speed of light .
By way of comparison , a vehicle traveling at that velocity could reach Jupiter from Earth in under five hours , or reach New York City from Paris in 0.156 seconds .

Though the scant , slow - moving particles of the Interstellar Medium are seldom larger than grains of rice , the millions of tiny , high - speed impacts would have a sandblaster effect upon the Daedalus .
To combat this erosion damage , the Society members incorporated a beryllium deflection dome on the nose of the probe .
Beryllium is a very lightweight metal with excellent thermal conductivity , making it ideal for the task .
In addition , the Daedalus would be escorted by its own protective particle cloud , which would precede the spaceship at the same extreme speed , sweeping most larger objects out of the path .
Any damage which occurred in spite of the protection would be repaired by a small army of “ wardens , ” remote - controlled robots which serve the Daedalus master computer .
On approaching the halfway point , the Daedalus master computer would direct its pair of five - meter - wide optical telescopes towards the Barnardian System to take photographs to send back home .
The massive , 40 - meter - wide engine bell of the second stage would double as a radio dish , transmitting imagery and data towards our solar system⁠ — the relatively bright star directly behind the ship .
About two years later⁠ — approximately twenty - seven years after the probe ’s departure⁠ — the first close - up photos of Barnard ’s Star would finally reach the Earth .
These images would reveal the exact positions of any attendant planets , allowing mission control to select points of interest .
Several years before completing the fifty - year journey to the star , the master computer would arouse its slumbering robotic passengers , and assign each a route based on earlier photographic findings .
These eighteen sub - probes would then spring into action , breaking away from the mothership and darting off to their destinations powered by independent ion drives .
Their cameras , spectrometers , polarimeters , and other instruments would make as many pictures and readings as possible while flying past planets at high speeds .
As the sub - probes chatter away by radio , all data would be relayed back to Earth using the powerful transmitter on the mothership .
Naturally many instruments would be tuned to search for evidence of life - harboring climates .
Slowing down or stopping would be impossible since the fuel for braking rockets would increase the mission ’s weight budget too drastically , so the Daedalus and probes would have a relatively short time to make observations before zipping past the star system at over a million kilometers per hour .
Due to the Daedalus ’s massive size and environmentally hazardous fuel , it would almost certainly need to be constructed in orbit if the project were ever undertaken .
The Helium - 3 component of its fuel is scarce on Earth , but it is thought to be abundant in Jupiter ’s atmosphere .
Therefore the Interplanetary Society suggested that the starship might first make a detour there in order to scoop up and store sufficient Helium - 3 for the journey .

More recent data indicates that there are in fact no planets orbiting Barnard ’s Star , but the Daedalus design is flexible enough to apply to many other interstellar destinations .
To this day , NASA considers the thirty - six year old research as a useful baseline study which addresses the problem somewhat effectively .
The researchers at the British Interplanetary Society optimistically estimated that such a craft would be possible by the late 1990s , though they acknowledged that such a starship would still be prohibitively expensive without unprecedented international cooperation .
Technologies are gradually appearing and evolving which could one day bring Daedalus⁠ — or something like it⁠— to fruition .
But at some point in the 1980s , our culture ’s when - and - how optimism was smothered by why , and respectable scientists were urged to shelve their absurd ambitions for more practical pursuits .
I say let the sticks have their mud … I want a massive interstellar space probe .

CRESCENT CITY --
Government officials said today that the Pacific Coast tsunami warning system worked exactly as it should Wednesday , when strong surges hit this small Northern California port city .
But harbor officials in Crescent City said this morning that they were caught by surprise by Wednesday 's tsunami , even though the National Weather Service had had notified them of the possibility about two hours earlier .
" We were surprised , " said Richard Young , harbormaster of the small Northern California fishing port 's harbor .
" I do n't know if it 's our fault or their fault but we need to get tied into the warning system better , we had that one warning in the morning but we did n't know about the warnings in the afternoon . "
Troy Nicolini , warning coordination meteorologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Weather Service , said the government has to balance the need to prepare people with the consideration that the public will ignore their warnings if they are sent out too often .
In June , his agency notified the entire West Coast of the possibility of a tsunami , following a earthquake off the coast of Eureka ; that was a mistake , he said .
Overall , Nicolini said , officials believe the system worked well on Wednesday .
" The one think I wish we did differently was really stress how long this could last , but overall I think the notification went well , " he said .
" It 's the cry wolf system ; it 's something we wrestle with all the time . "
Locals are n't convinced .
Young said he received a warning at about 11 a.m. of the possibility of a tsunami around 11:40 a.m. , when the National Weather Service reported a possible 3 - to 5 - foot surge resulting from an 8.1 magnitude quake near Japan .
Young said harbor officials went down and told people to tie up their boats , but nothing happened so they assumed the danger was over .
Harbor facilities manager Paul McAndrews said he and Young were finishing lunch in the harbor office around 1 p.m. when they looked outside and saw a sudden surge .
" We ran out and started securing boats , but the waves got bigger and started coming over docks so we got worried , " said Young , who said a dozen or more boats broke lose during the surges .
" We were looking over at the end of the jetty , " McAndrews added .
" I thought it was bad when I saw the seals try to swim out , then they gave up and came back into harbor .
It just started getting bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger . "
The surges , which were a little larger than three feet at their peak , continued until about 7 p.m. , Young said .
Nicolini said initial reports put the surges at between five to six feet , but they actually were smaller .
The surges look larger , he explained , because all of the water is sucked out between surges .
This morning , most of the boats were secure but the harbor was still in a state of disarray , with debris floating in the water and one sail boat still sitting on top of a pier , where it was knocked on Wednesday .
Big chunks of concrete were broken off portions of the dock , and barnacles were visible on the bottoms of pieces of pier that had been tossed upside down by the surges .
Young estimated the damage to the docks and boats at around $ 700,000 .
Crescent City residents are particularly sensitive to tsunami threats .
The town was struck by a 21 - foot - high tsunami in 1964 that killed 11 people and destroyed most of the town center .
Bill Steven , a commander with the Del Norte County Sheriff 's Department , said the surges came at a particularly inopportune time for the close - knit , isolated fishing community .
" Everybody was just getting warmed up for the Dungeness crab season , " he said .
" Unfortunately , this could really slow things down . "
Steven , who was born the year after the killer waves hit the town in 1964 , said his father often reminisced about the event .
" He was especially amazed by the tremendous field of debris it left , " he said .
" It 's still a major topic of conversation in this town . "
Residents also said Wednesday that the tsunami warning system failed to alert them to Wednesday 's surges .
" We hear sirens all the time , but we did n't hear anything for this thing , " said Don Thomsen , the manager of the Curly Redwood Lodge .
Thomsen said there are three stages to a tsunami alert .
" First you have a warning , then a watch , and then it 's get the hell out of town , " he said .
Thomsen said he was not aware of Wednesday 's tsunami until he heard about it from other townspeople .
" We 're only three blocks from the harbor , " he said .
" We did n't know it was coming . "
Wednesday 's quake struck an area claimed by both Russia and Japan , but the waves near Japan did not swell higher than 23 inches .
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage .
Six hours later , tsunami waves up to nearly 4 feet caused by the quake crashed into Hawaii 's shores , civil defense officials said .
There was no serious damage .

60 % of the brain is formed of fats
A study of 9,000 mothers and children in Avon suggested those who consumed less of the essential fatty acid Omega - 3 had children with lower IQs .
These children also had poorer motor skills and hand - to - eye co-ordination , research in the Economist said .
The Food Standards Agency says pregnant women should consume only one or two portions of oily fish a week .
A team from the National Institutes of Health in the US analysed data from a long - term study done in Avon , UK .
' Frightening data '
Looking at the effects of Omega - 3 intake on 9,000 mothers and their children , the team found mothers with the lowest intake of the essential fatty acid had children with a verbal IQ six points lower than the average .
While those with the highest consumption of mackerel and sardines and other sources of Omega - 3 had children , at age three - and - a - half , with the best measures of fine - motor performance , researchers said .
Low intake of the crucial fatty acid also appeared to lead to more problems of social interactions - such as an inability to make friends .
Research leader Dr Joseph Hibbeln said " frightening data " showed 14 % of 17 - year - olds whose mother had eaten small quantities of Omega - 3 during pregnancy demonstrated this sort of behaviour .
This compared with 8 % of those born to the group with the highest intake , he said .
Dr Hibbeln said : " The findings of poor social development and poor motor control in children indicate that these children may be on a developmental trajectory towards lifelong disruptive and poorly - socialised behaviour as they grow up . "
It 's absolutely essential that pregnant women take in enough Omega - 3 and that children in early infancy take in enough Omega -3
Patrick Holford
Nutritional expert
Professor Jean Golding of Bristol University set up the original research - the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children - 15 years ago to look at the predisposition to disease .
She told the BBC : " The baby 's brain needs Omega - 3 fatty acids .
It does n't create its own fatty acids so it needs to be something that the mother will eat . "
The new research also builds on earlier work in the US which suggests pregnant mothers will develop children with better language and communication skills if they regularly consume oily fish .
Nutritional expert Patrick Holford , director of the Brain Bio Centre , said Omega - 3 was key to children 's intelligence because the brain is formed of 60 % fat - 30 % of which is essential fats .
Successive studies have shown clear links between intelligence and consumption of this essential fatty acid , he added .
Seed option
" It 's absolutely essential that pregnant women take in enough Omega - 3 and that children in early infancy take in enough Omega - 3 . "
The richest sources of Omega - 3 are larger fish which eat other fish , but research shows that the larger the fish the more pollutants , such as mercury , they contain .
For this reason Mr Holford recommends women consume two portions of wild or organic salmon , trout or sardines weekly .
Seeds such as flax , pumpkin and hemp are good sources of Omega - 3 for vegetarians , but large quantities need to be consumed to gain the same effect .
This might translate to two tablespoons of seeds daily , Mr Holford said , but women can also use a high quality Omega - 3 supplements .
Story Highlights • NEW : Venezuelan president says he wants to pursue nuclear technology
• Hugo Chavez tells the U.N. he can smell the stink of Bush , " the devil "
• U.S. says it wo n't address " comic - strip approach " to international affairs

Adjust font size :
UNITED NATIONS ( CNN ) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez tore into his U.S. counterpart and his U.N. hosts Wednesday , likening President Bush to the devil and telling the General Assembly that its system is " worthless . "
" The devil came here yesterday , " Chavez said , referring to Bush , who addressed the world body during its annual meeting Tuesday .
" And it smells of sulfur still today . "
Chavez accused Bush of having spoken " as if he owned the world " and said a psychiatrist could be called to analyze the statement .
( Watch Hugo Chavez cross himself as he tells world leaders he can smell the devil -- 1:06 )
" As the spokesman of imperialism , he came to share his nostrums to try to preserve the current pattern of domination , exploitation and pillage of the peoples of the world .
An Alfred Hitchcock movie could use it as a scenario .
I would even propose a title : ' The Devil 's Recipe . ' "
Chavez held up a book by Noam Chomsky on imperialism and said it encapsulated his arguments : " The American empire is doing all it can to consolidate its hegemonistic system of domination , and we cannot allow him to do that .
We cannot allow world dictatorship to be consolidated . "
' No way to save ' U.N .
Chavez also blasted the United Nations , calling the General Assembly " merely a deliberative organ " that meets once a year .
" We have no power , no power to make any impact on the terrible situation in the world , " he said .
Chavez called the veto power shared by the five permanent members of the Security Council " anti-democratic , " and cited the U.S. veto of a resolution that would have demanded the Israelis halt their bombing of Lebanon this summer .
That move " allowed the Israelis with impunity to destroy Lebanon in front of us all as we stood there watching , " Chavez said .
He recommended that the world body 's headquarters be moved to another country and offered Venezuela as a possible new home .
He noted that he recently returned from a summit of more than 50 heads of state from nonaligned nations in Havana , Cuba , and urged his audience to support their efforts for " a world of peace . "
At a news conference after the speech , he further lambasted the United States and U.N. , saying of the latter , " There is no way to save it . "
The U.N. was founded in an era of two superpowers , he said .
" The Soviet Union collapsed .
The United States empire is on the way down and it will be finished in the near future , for the good of all mankind . "
He also said the U.S. government was the " first enemy " of its people .
" Their freedoms are restricted through the Patriot Act .
They are sent to die in Iraq for no reason .
The people of the United States are being deceived , " he said .
Nuclear Venezuela ?
The day after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defiantly expressed to the General Assembly his country 's determination to pursue nuclear technology , Chavez told reporters he , too , would like to explore nuclear energy .
All countries should dispose of their nuclear bombs , he said , but he would like to tap the technology for energy purposes because Venezuela 's oil reserves are nonrenewable and finite .
He ended the news conference by saying , " I have a meeting with the axis of evil somewhere around here , so I have to go . "
Oil supplies loom large in any discussion of U.S. - Venezuela relations .
Venezuela was the world 's ninth - largest oil producer in 2004 and the fourth - largest supplier of oil to the United States , accounting for 11.2 percent of U.S. imports in 2005 , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
John Bolton , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , dismissed the speech , saying , " I think that [ Chavez 's ] rhetoric today shows exactly what kind of man he is . "
Bolton said : " We 're not going to address that sort of comic - strip approach to international affairs .
" The real issue here is he knows he can exercise freedom of speech on that podium and , as I say , he could exercise it in Central Park , too .
He 's not giving the same freedom to the people of Venezuela . "
Chavez 's tirades against Bush have become common .
In May , he accused Bush of committing genocide and said the U.S. president should be imprisoned by an international criminal court .
( Full story )
Chavez also alleged during the U.N. speech that the United States is planning , financing and setting in motion a coup to overthrow him .
The U.S. has denied such accusations in the past .
As he was exiting the U.N. building in New York , Chavez told reporters that Bush is not a legitimate president because he " stole the elections . "
" He is therefore a dictator , " Chavez said .
( Watch Chavez call Bush a dictator , express his love of America -- :57 )
In an interview later with CNN en Español , Chavez said he had good relations with President Clinton , but of Bush he said , " With this cowboy you can't even talk ... the Texan who walks around shooting from the hip . "

Wiki seems to use the term static typing to mean the same thing as explicit and strong typing .
I prefer that the term static means that it does n't change .
The same wiki seems to use the term dynamic typing to mean the same thing as implicit and strong typing .
It includes the possibility that a program is what I would call strongly , statically and implicitly typed : the checking is done at run time but the types of variables never change .
The commentary suggests the phrasefor the quality of dynamic typing that encompasses dynamic meta-programming .
If you like these terms , please substitute " semantic dynamic typing " for " dynamic typing " above .
p.p.s .
And there 's another argument that dynamic meta- programming , like macros , should be considered harmful .
I 'm saving my reply for a rainy day .
I recently read a post where the author said he does not care for Ruby 's dynamic typing .
When people start talking about types in programming languages , the terms fly around in a rather fast and loose manner .
Here 's a rather extensive and balanced discussion : the article on Type Systems in Wikipedia .
Notice that Ruby is ( it 's types are determined at run time and can change at run time ) , ( it does not allow an operation to succeed on arguments which have the wrong type ) , and ( it does not allow operations or conversions which lead to erronous conditions ) .
( There 's another school of thought about how to name the properties of type systems .
More on that at the bottom . )
Proponents ofmay say that Ruby is not type safe because it is possible to compile programs that contain errors which will not be detected until the program is run and the erroneous condition is detected .
Statically typed languages such as C# can detect a class of such errors at compile time .
Some Ruby enthusiasts argue that they do not like the boilerplate associated with explicit typing and feel that the extra error checking does not outweigh the additional overhead .
Both arguments are mistaken .
Sorry about that .
If Explicit and Implicit were the issues , we could add Type Inference to Ruby and it would have the low overhead of implicit types as well as some extra error - checking ( work on Soft Typing for languages like Scheme and Erlang aims to provide compile - time checking for implicitly typed languages ) .
However , type inference is a feature oftyped languages .
The trouble is that Ruby istyped .
Specifically , Ruby contains extensiveconstructs .
Type inference works with statically typed languages .
The compiler must be able to infer the type or set of types possible for any variable .
Consider a Ruby application that modifies classes and objects at run time .
The simplest example is Ruby 's built - in accessor methods : is a class method that actually creates two instance methods at run time , and .
What happens when attr_accessor is called with aas its argument , likeIf the type inference engine later looks at a call such as , how does it know whether attribute_accessor was ever called with ' blitz ' or : blitz as an argument ?
Dynamic meta- programming makes the type inference problem undecidable .
A lucid argument is that Ruby 's dynamic typing makes it difficult to detect type errors statically .
Thecounter - argument is that Ruby 's style of dynamic typing makes it possible to use dynamic meta- programming , such as Ruby on Rails ' ActiveRecord , not that Ruby 's implicit typing is more productive .
Once you 've made these arguments , you can decide for yourself whether the benefits of dynamic meta - programming do or do not outweigh the advantages of static type checking .

Find out how Nigerian scammers try their luck
This Nigerian scammers story was inspired by a real , hilarious event .
My name is Andrew .
I work in a bank in North London .
And you simply would n’t believe the number of times people ask me to give them money .
Not just small amounts of money either .
I ’m talking about entire mortgage repayments , or refinancing of companies .
I ’ve been asked on occasions if I could allow strangers access to our accounts department ’s records when the building has been closed for the weekend !
I understand that at least some of those enquirers have since been questioned by our local police force .
But you just would n’t believe the things that people ask you when they find out that you run a bank .
So , anyway , I was n’t at all surprised when I received a letter from Nigeria asking for access to one of my accounts .
It appeared , or so the author claimed , that he was the son of the deposed Nigerian leader General Aducha Swame .
And , so he went on to explain , the Swame family had tens of million pounds in several Lagos bank accounts which they seemed eager to share with me .
How delightful , I thought .
And , considering the fact that I ’d never heard of Obi Swame before , I also thought how kind !
I was a little tired on that day , and most fed up .
My wife had recently left me , for the second time , and , on this occasion , I saw no prospect of her returning .
I was sitting in my study fiddling and feeling morose .
Ordinarily Obi’s letter would have been ripped into pieces by that stage .
But this was n’t an ordinary occasion .
I looked again at the Nigerian man ’s clumsy phraseology .
YOU MUST REPLY IMMEDIATELY .
I WAIT FOR YOU … and on and on in went .
All in capital letters and promising greater riches with each and every sentence .
Obi , I thought , you ’ve caught me at a bad time in my life .
And I ’m afraid I ’m going to have to make you suffer for it !
My aunt Grace was old .
She had just returned home after a kidney operation .
I ’d remembered visiting her in hospital and smelling un-emptied bed -pans .
It was n’t a pleasant recollection , but it gave me an immediate idea .
I ca n’t send you any money , I wrote , I ’m in hospital having a kidney operation .
But , when I get released I ’ll wire several hundreds of pounds to any Nigerian bank that you ’d care to mention .
I must confess that I had a little chuckle as I licked my airmail envelope .
I knew that I had some old , Dutch Guilders somewhere .
They ’d be perfectly useless now , after the introduction of the Euro .
But it pleased me greatly to imagine the expression on Obi Swame ’s face when he received my useless money !
It took me ages to find the Guilders .
I even had to make several trips up into the attic .
Eventually I discovered them in a suitcase at the back of my garage .
It worried me to be sending money in the regular mail .
Even the inclusion of deprecated bank notes made me feel uneasy .
I know it sounds silly .
After - all , here I was posting my cash to a swindler in Lagos , and fretting about the British postal system .
But , I ’m not saying that it made any sense .
I ’m just saying that that ’s how I felt .
So that ’s how a dishonest man in Lagos City came to receive four hundred useless Dutch Guilders from me .
I ’M SORY TO HEET YOU SICK , Obi wrote .
PLESE SEND ENGLIISH MOONEY .
I can’t send you any English money , I replied .
I ’m in hospital .
I ca n’t send you the money .
MOOMEY MOONI .
GIVE OBI MONEY , the West African insisted .
OBI MUST HAVE MONI .
Well , Obi , I thought .
You ’re very rude and insistent .
OK , I agreed .
I ’ll give you money .
But , before I do , there ’s something that you must do for me .
Are you a handsome chap ?
VERI GOOD LOOKI , Obi assured me .
I ’m sorry , Obi , I explained .
I just ca n’t take your word for it .
You see , my wife ’s left me , and I ’ve met a new woman online .
She wants to see my photograph .
And I ca n’t send her pictures of me , lying in a hospital bed with my wee running through a plastic tube , now , can I ?
WAT YU DOO ?
Obi asked .
What am I going to do ?
I replied .
Well , Obi , old friend , I typed .
If you really are a nice looking fellow , would you be good enough to send me a photograph which I could use instead ?
So Obi obligingly posted me a photograph of himself , dressed in a suit , and holding a bunch of flowers .
YOU VERY SEXI WOMAN , he ’d written .
ILOVE YU VERI MUCH .
I must say , Obi did look quite fetching .
And I felt almost sorry for the act of deception that I ’d carried out .
But , Obi himself had started our correspondence , and my pangs of guilt soon passed .
Obi , I wrote .
You are a handsome devil , but I ’m afraid the woman that I ’ve met is rather a frisky filly , and she wants a picture of me utterly in the all - together .
If it would n’t be too much trouble for you , could you send me one of those ?
Now , by this point , I was n’t expecting a reply .
Naked photographs of Nigerians are n’t my regular stock - in - trade , and I had no great hopes that that fact would change .
But I was wrong .
In the middle of the following week I received a note from my new pen-pal .
ME VERI NAKED , he wrote .
ME FRONT ME BACK .
And , accordingly , Obi Swame had posted me several images of him posing , without a stitch of clothing on , but still clutching his bunch of flowers .
Now , I know that the political situation in Nigeria is unstable .
The Nigerians seem forever to be changing one dictatorial figurehead with another .
And , it seems to me , that such leaders are mindful that nothing should damage their reputation .
It did n’t take me long to work out that the present incumbent called himself General Fuga .
The new general , it appeared , was without a sense of humour when it came to matters of his personal appearance .
As I ’ve found to be commonplace in dictatorships the world over , the man at the top of society plastered his likeness on billboards all over town .
Now this , I thought , was far too good an opportunity to miss .
Obi , I wrote , the woman I ’ve met was most pleased with your photograph .
But , unfortunately , like many women , she ’s greatly turned on by the notion of power and influence .
I think she would be stimulated by the sight of you , pretending to be me , of course , with no clothes on , standing in front of an enlarged photograph of General Fuga .
NO PROBLE , Obi replied .
And rapidly he dispatched the requested scene .
That ’s fantastic , I enthused .
But there does appear to be something of a distance between you and the great man in the background .
Would it be at all possible for you to find an image of him with an extended hand ?
And then stretch out your manhood , and pose so that your pride - and - joy appears to be being supported by the general himself ?
And that ’s how I came to have an image of a naked Nigerian ’s errection being held out by a man in a military uniform .
Now , I bet there are n’t many people who can boast of ownership of one of those !
It does n’t take long to look up the postal address of the Nigerian Presidential Palace .
By the time I ’d received Obi ’s letter I ’d already addressed my own missive to General Fuga .
Being a newspaper reporter , I lied , I ’m about to publish a photograph of you holding Obi Swame ’s willy .
The phonecall which I promptly received from the Nigerian High Commissioner was extraordinarily polite .
“ We ’re very sorry to trouble you , ” Doctor Ugama assured me .
“ But , do you think it would be at all possible for us to enquire as to how you came by this most curious of depictions of our president ? ”
“ Why certainly you may ! ” I replied .
“ Obi Swame sent it to me in a letter , whilst he was attempting to swindle me out of enormous sums of money ! ”
And that ’s the least thing that I heard from Obi Swame .
I understand that in Lagos City there is a newspaper called The Telegraph .
Someone did send me a clipping from it which reported the fact that one Obi Swame had been arrested on account of the fact that he ’d been making disrespectful images of important people .
But the article failed to mention the names of the dignitaries that Obi had upset .

The inspiration for this Nigerian scammers story : Turning the Tables on Nigeria ’s 419 Scammers
Everybody knows that millions of bogus emails are sent from Nigeria every day .
Most of these Nigerian scammers claim to have come from the son of a wealthy and formerly powerful West - African politician .
These messages all contain instructions about how to obtain fabulous wealth , quickly and illicitly .
They say “ if you allow us access to your bank account , in return we will deposit millions of pounds into it , which you can keep . ”
Any gullible victims soon lose any savings which they had accumulated .
Some frustrated dupes even travel to Lagos in an attempt to recover their missing cash .
On arrival in Nigeria they are often beaten and sometimes killed .
This type of scam has its own technical term even : Nigerian 419 scam – 419 being the section of the Nigerian Criminal code that deals with fraud .
Nigerian scammers became famous in the 1980s when they contacted gullible people in the West mentioning a Nigerian prince seeking to transfer a large amount of money .
But apparently some of the targets of these Nigerian scammers have started to turn the tables on them .
One such true story of a conned con-artist is told here by the BBC .
Nigerian scammers , we love you !

Subject : [ Caml - list ] opaque polymorphism
A feature that would be nice would be to hide the polymorphism of a type in a module signature : foo.ml : type ( 'a , 'b , ' c ) t = { ... } foo.mli : type ( ' a , ' c ) t Thus , clients of Foo would be unaware of the polymorphism in 'b .
This would require that type variables in signatures and structures be matched on their names , obviously .
Can any of the type experts out there tell me if this is possible ?

My current contract is coming towards its natural conclusion which means I ’m about to be blessed with that most joyous of experiences – dealing with recruitment agencies .
I ’m not a huge fan of recruitment agencies but I do n’t have a huge amount of choice .
For whatever reason , the Australian IT market seems to regard recruiters as necessary ; about 75 % of permanent placements are found through agencies and about 95 % of contracts are placed through agencies .
So we ’re in “ necessary evil ” territory here , especially given that I ’m looking for another contract role .
On the plus side , when you take into account that recruitment agencies are so central to the IT job market you can rest assured that they ’re good at what they do , right ?
Yeah , right .
One of the enduring mysteries of life for me is : why is IT recruitment handled so badly so often ?
The first question I ’d like to see answered is why use agencies at all .
The idea that they ’re professionals who are the best at this sort of thing simply does n’t hold up to scrutiny .
They ’re more often than not poorly paid , poorly motivated and with a limited ( at best ) understanding of what qualifies someone to work in IT .
After all , if they knew anything about IT they ’d be earning decent money working in IT rather than being in a dead - end recruiting job .
The only honest answer I can come up with is nobody at the company who hires the agency can be bothered putting in the work of finding suitable candidates themselves .
So recruitment agencies are a time - saver for HR departments .
And I had this crazy idea that who you actually employ might be one of the most important decisions a company could make .
I do n’t know what else HR departments do to justify their existence .
Even the “ time saver ” response is giving HR departments too much credibility in my book .
I ’ve had enough experience to form an alternate theory : recruitment agencies exist to give HR departments plausible deniability .
Nobody want to take responsibility for decisions – on the off chance a hire does n’t work out , the HR department does n’t want to take the blame .
The involvement of an agency gives them the ability to say “ it is n’t our fault , the agency said s/he was the best available candidate . ”
Yeah , god forbid the HR department would actually do their job .
The second question I ’d like to see answered is : why are candidates so often measured against some cookie cutter template of requirements ?
Yes , there has to be some sort of baseline for competence but setting a series of arbitrary measures ( x years experience in discipline y ) is again replacing actually doing your job with a “ plausible deniability ” safety net .
Anyone with any significant experience in IT who ’s willing to be honest knows that a checklist approach is often no help at all in identifying suitable candidates and if you enforce the “ ticks in boxes ” approach arbitrarily you ’re in very real danger of excluding some very good potential recruits .
So why does this approach persist ?
Again , my cynical mind tell me that it ’s to allow an escape route for an HR department that does n’t want to take responsibility for their job .
“ But he had 10 years experience with Ruby on Rails – that was heaps more than anyone else , he should have been great . ”
Using a wishlist of attributes as a starting point is fine but refusing to think beyond the boundaries it sets is a recipe for disaster .
Occasionally when I end up in an interview where they are obsessing over experience in a particular area ( especially if it ’s something as nebulous as a methodology ) I try to point out the shortcomings in their thinking .
Not in the hope of changing their minds , I do it for fun .
I am a strong believer in many of the hiring principles espoused by Joel Spolsky ( he ’s just published version 3.0 of his Guerilla Guide to Interviewing ) which can be summarised as “ hire someone who ’s intelligent and knows how to get things done . ”
When I try to illustrate the benefits of this approach to someone insisting on five years experience with use case methodology , I do it by pointing out where their strict requirement could turn around and bite them .
It goes a little like this …
“ Say you are down to two people , one with five years use case experience and one without the requisite experience but they ’re smart , flexible and know how to get things done .
It seems like you should go with ‘ Ms. Five Years ’ but the problem is use cases are done in very different ways in different workplaces and she may be totally locked into her version of use case methodology which conflicts with yours .
You end up wasting a huge amount of time arguing on the right way to execute .
On the other hand , Mr Smart and Flexible is far more open to working with you to get the results you want without obsessing over how the methodology is executed .
So , many years experience does n’t necessarily mean the best result for you . ”
Another obvious ( to me ) point that these obsessive types do n’t seem to think of is you can have ten years “ experience ” with something and still suck .
Experience alone is not a measurement of competence , let alone excellence .
Someone might be a better programmer straight out of university than someone who ’s spent half their lifetime coasting along .
Pointing out these flaws in the recruiting approach can be a lot of fun .
Not because you get to achieve some breakthrough that turns the whole recruiting process on its head but because you get to watch as the drone ’s eyes glaze over because you ’ve introduced enough cognitive dissonance to make their brains shut down .
Life would be much simpler if the recruitment pitch went : “ We ’re going to need you to successfully complete this sort of task in this sort of timeframe to this level of competence .
We ’ll check with your references about your previous performance and what sort of person you are .
In the interview we ’re going to ask you to complete the following tasks to try and get a handle on your competence .
If that all goes well and we think we could stand working with you then you might just have yourself a job . ”
But I do n’t expect a massive turnaround in this area any time soon .
I ’m occasionally guilty of being an optimist but I ’m not stupid .
Working with CSS on my own site ’s redesign , freelance work , and my job made me start thinking about the best way to standardize and organize the way I write my CSS .
So , I proposed the question to my 9rules friends to collect the best tips from the best designers .
1 ) This tip is perhaps the most useful because it can apply to both formats of CSS organization that I will describe later .
I first saw this on Mike Rundle ’s latest redesign of 9rules where he indents descendant and related rules .
For example :
#main_side { width : 392 px ; padding : 0 ; float : right ; } #main_side # featured_articles { background : # fff ; } #main_side # frontpageads { background : # fff ; margin : 8 px 0 ; }
This structure makes it easier to define page areas and how they relate to each other .
Also , the technique can be used when styling specific areas even if the base requires no rules .
This can best be seen in the headlines :
h2 { } #snapshot_box h2 { padding : 0 0 6px 0 ; font : bold 14 px / 14px “ Verdana ” , sans - serif ; } #main_side h2 { color : # 444 ; font : bold 14 px / 14px “ Verdana ” , sans - serif ; } .sidetagselection h2 { color : # fff ; font : bold 14 px / 14px “ Verdana ” , sans - serif ; }
2 ) The second tip is to use shorthand properties to keep all parts of a style type on a single line .
For example :
margin : 5 px 0 4px 10 px ;
Is much more efficient than :
margin - top : 5 px ; margin - right:0 ; margin - bottom : 4 px ; margin - left:10 px ;
Combining properties onto a single line using shorthand properties means that your CSS will be easier to understand and edit .
# test { margin - top : 2 px ; margin - right : 3 px ; margin - bottom : 5 px ; margin - left : 9 px ; font - weight : bold ; font - size : 12 px ; line - height : 14 px ; font - family : Arial , Verdana , sans - serif ; border - width : 1 px ; border - style : solid ; border - color : # 000000 ; background - color : # fff ; background - image : url ( bg.gif ) ; background - repeat : no - repeat ; background - position : 0 15 px ; }
That is almost impossible to edit , but using a few shorthand properties , the chunk above can be reduced to a much more manageable four lines .
# test { margin : 2 px 3px 5 px 9px ; font : bold 12 px / 14px Arial , Verdana , sans - serif ; border : 1 px solid # 000 ; background : # fff url ( bg.gif ) 0 15 px no-repeat ; }
3 ) The third tip is to clearly divide your stylesheet into specific sections .
Also , by using a flag , you can get to the area you are looking for faster .
Before you divide up your styles , it is important to define an outline you are comfortable with as will as a separator format you can notice easily .
A sample format I try to stick to is this :
Global Styles – ( body , paragraphs , lists , etc )
Header
Page Structure
Headings
Text Styles
Navigation
Forms
Comments
Extras
And a sample separator that is most easily noticeable for me is :
/* -----------------------------------*/
/* ---------->>>
GLOBAL <<<-----------*/
/*
-----------------------------------*/
4 ) The fourth tip is difficult to get used to , but can be invaluable once perfected .
It is important that you define the basic rules for each area only once so that the same default value is not being rewritten in every rule .
If you know that all of the h2 ’s will not have a margin or padding , define that on the top level and let its effect cascade as it is supposed to .
This helps a great deal if the design requires frequent color changes or other non-structural modifications .
5 ) The fifth tip is more of a comparison between to major options of organizing your CSS , each with it ’s own merits and flaws .
On one hand , you can throw your CSS into a compressor to get a very polished and clean view of your entire CSS structure – each rule on a single line .
The advantage of this method is that you can get an easy view of your entire stylesheet without much scrolling .
The disadvantage is that it is difficult to edit because many rules will require you to scroll horizontally .
Using the more prevalent tabbing method for organization simply reverses the advantages and disadvantages .
The easiest method is to combine all of the tips above to move the base styles for all elements into a separate section of the stylesheet or a separate stylesheet altogether .
This leaves less rule - setting for the more specific elements and allows you to have a shorter stylesheet for your main design .

How to Solve the Rubik 's Cube in Seven Steps
The world 's most famous puzzle , simultaneously beloved and despised for it 's beautiful simple complexity , the Rubiks Cube has been frustrating gamers since Erno Rubik invented it back in 1974 .
Over the years many brave gamers have whole - heartedly taken up the challenge to restore a mixed Rubik 's cube to it 's colorful and perfect original configuration , only to find the solution lingering just out of their grasp time and time again .
After spending hours and days twisting and turning the vaunted cube in vain , many resorted to removing and replacing the multi-colored facelets of the cube in a dastardly attempt to cheat the seemingly infallible logic of the cube , while others simply tossed it to the side and dubbed it impossible .
The Rubik 's cube , it seemed , had defeated all .
Humanity required a solution , so intelligent gamers went to work to take down the so - called " frustration cube " .
Amazingly , not only did they discover a solution , they formulated many of them , ranging from beginner - level to advanced .
One of these bright bulbs was Denny Dedmore .
Not only did he discover an efficient and fool - proof solution for solving the cube , he also provided several amazing " algorithms " ( move- sequences ) which made following his talented solution very simple .
Mr. Dedmore completed his now easy - to - master solution by inventing the brilliant move notation found throughout the guide , which made explaining the various twists and turns necessary to solve the Rubiks cube visually understandable .
Follow @chessandpoker
Now spreading bad grammar and randomness via Twitter .
We are proud to bring you the stunning Rubiks cube strategy guide originally developed by Denny Dedmore , now optimized and refreshed by Chess and Poker Dot Com , that will allow all of us to claim vindication and defeat the previously unbeatable Rubik 's cube .
Take your time , work through all of the steps until you understand them and you 'll be able to successfully solve the rubik 's cube .
Finally !
Rubiks Cube Terminology and Move Notation
The terms used in the Rubiks cube strategy guide are well - known to the cubing world .
The squares that make up the Rubiks cube are known as Cubies .
The colored stickers on the fronts of all the Cubies are known as Facelets .
There are three types of Cubies : Corners , Edges and Center Cubies .
Corners have three facelets , edges have two and the center Cubies have only one facelet .
Notice that in our graphic there is also a label under one side of the cube that says " Front " .
Since all of the diagrams are shown at an angle , also showing the right and top sides of the cube , it 's important to always look at the cube from the front perspective when making your moves .
Showing the cube at an angle is necessary because you will have to make different sets of moves based on various arrangements of Cubies on both of these other two sides .
This group of notation graphics indicate which direction the various horizontal rows of the Rubiks cube should be turned .
There are 3 different rows .
This group of notation graphics indicate which direction the various vertical columns of the Rubiks cube should be turned .
There are 3 different columns .
These notation graphics indicate which direction the entire front face of the cube should be turned .
Now that you know the terminology used throughout the strategy guide , let 's learn how to understand the move notation graphics .
Utilizing the Rubik 's cube move notation chart , you can find the definitions of each tiny graphic .
The first two sets show which horizontal row or vertical column should be moved , and in which direction .
When looking at the front of the cube , the top three horizontal Cubies make up the top row .
The middle horizontal row of cubies ( from the top or bottom ) make up the middle row , and finally the bottom three horizontal cubies make up the bottom row .
So what about the columns ?
Still looking at the front of the cube , the three vertical cubies on the left make up the left column .
Then the next three vertical cubies make up the middle column and the last three vertical cubies make up the right column .
But what about the looping arrow notation graphics ?
When you are looking directly at the front of the cube , which you should always be doing , the nine Cubies with various facelets that you see are known as the front face of the cube .
When you see the " turning arrow " notation graphics from the third set , they are instructing you to turn all nine of these cubies at the same time to either the right ( clockwise ) or left ( counter - clockwise ) .
So instead of moving individual rows or columns , when you see these graphics you should turn the entire front face of the cube to the direction indicated .
Using these and the other notation graphics explained above you are now ready to begin solving the cube .
But before you begin , we suggest that you first play around with the cube for a while and try to understand these moves and how they move the various parts of the cube around .
Some of the moves can be a bit tricky for your fingers .
For example , when you are moving a middle row or column , you in fact must move two columns or rows , and then turn the non-middle one back to it 's previous spot .
This is because the middle rows or columns do not move independently .
Do n't forget to move the other row or column back !
Once you are comfortable with all of the moves , it 's time to solve .
The Seven - Step Guide to Solving a Rubiks cube
To begin the solution , we must first prime the cube .
To do so , simply pick a corner cubie and turn it so that it is the upper - right - hand corner cubie on the front of your cube .
It can be any color , but for our example we will be using the Blue - Red - White corner as shown , with the white facelet on the front , the red facelet on the right and the blue facelet on the top .
Then , you must turn the rest of the cube around until the top color of your selected first corner cubie also matches the center .
Our top color is blue so we must turn the blue center cubie around to the top of the cube .
You can move the Blue center around in any direction you want until it arrives at the correct top - center position as shown .
By priming the cube in this way , you have already solved two of the top row cubies .
We are now ready to solve the rest of the cube .
We used ( and pretty much destroyed ) our Collector 's Edition Rubik 's Cube when developing our Rubik 's cube guide .
Step One : Place the Top Row Corners
Since we have solved the first corner of our top row when we primed it , we are now ready to solve the other three .
To do so , you must turn the entire cube ( not any rows , columns or faces ) to the left so that your original corner cubie is now the upper - left - hand corner on the front of the cube .
In our example , you can see that the upper - left - hand corner is now the original blue - red - white corner with the blue and red facelets showing on the graphic ( since we turned the entire cube to the left ) .
We now need to solve the upper - right - hand corner again , so we must figure out which corner to put there .
In fact , this is quite easy .
Since the mystery cubie must have blue on it ( otherwise it wo n't match the rest of the top color ) , and it must also have red on it ( or it wo n't make a full - red side with the first red facelet there ) , we simply must find the other corner on the cube with blue and red on it .
On our cube , this would be the Blue - Red - Yellow cubie .
The next step is to maneuver this target cubie to the bottom - right - hand corner of the cube ( shown here in black to help demonstrate the target location ) .
The blue , red and yellow facelets on this cubie can be in any order and on any side as long as the cubie is in its proper spot .
Simply turn the bottom row around ( without disturbing the top row ) until your target cubie is in its place .
Once the cubie is at the bottom - right - hand corner on the front , depending on the location of the top color ( Blue ) we will choose one of the following algorithms to move it up to the top - right - hand corner and flip it around to line it up properly .
For example , if our Blue - Red - Yellow cubie happens to have the blue facelet showing on the right side of the cube ( position 1 ) we would use the first algorithm .
If instead it was on the front side ( position 2 ) we would use the second algorithm .
Finally , if the Blue facelet is on the bottom of the cubie ( position 3 , indicated by the hand pointing to the bottom ) you would use the third algorithm .
It may also happen that the target Blue - Red - Yellow Cubie is already in its proper top - row position but it is not facing the right way ( the red facelet is not on the same side as the original red facelet ) .
If the Blue facelet is on the front ( position 4 ) use the fourth algorithm , and of course if it is on the right side of the cubie ( position 5 ) use the fifth algorithm .
If your desired cubie is trapped in the middle layer , simply skip to another corner and once you solve it the target cubie will have been forced back into the top or bottom row .
When you are finished with the corners , your cube will have a Blue " X " on the top with all of the corner colors matching up horizontally with their partners .
Step Two : Place the Edges and Finish the Top Layer
Now that we know the general ideas on how to find the proper target cubie and then move it into position , we 're ready to finish the top layer .
Keeping the above concepts in mind , we must now find the target edge cubies ( those that will complete the top row ) and move them into the new target positions , again colored black here .
Simply turn the bottom and middle layers until the target cubie is in one of these spots , and based on which side the top color ( blue ) is on , select from the following algorithms to move it into its place .
When you are finished with step two , the entire top layer of the cube is solved .
Step Three : Align the Centers and Place the Middle Layer Edges
To begin step 3 , you must first turn the middle layer around so that the center cubies in the middle layer all match with their top layer counterparts .
In our example , you can see that the red center and yellow center match up with their respective colors above them .
This is known as forming the Half - T . Once you have the centers aligned , you 've already partially solved the middle layer .
The only thing left to do is place the remaining edges .
Now , turning only the bottom row , we will position the target cubie so that it will match up with its same - color center forming the Full - T .
In our example , we have turned the bottom row around so that we have formed a Full Red T on the front of the cube .
We may be ready to place this cube into position , but we must first check to make sure it is indeed the correct edge .
On our cube , we would need the bottom of the Red T cubie to be either Yellow ( which when moved to the right would match up with the Red and Yellow centers ) or the Red - White cubie ( which on our cube could be moved left , matching up with the Red and White centers ) .
If this edge cannot connect either of the two centers to the left or right , or it is upside down ( there is not a T formed , the Red facelet is improperly on the bottom ) you must move on to another T formation .
There will almost always be another T immediately possible .
Here are the algorithms you 'll use to move the target cubie to the left or right as needed :
Left Right
If you find that no T is possible , or that the correct edge is in the proper position but is turned around so that the colors do not match up , simply place a random cubie into its place by performing either of the algorithms once , which will force the proper cubie back to the bottom .
Occasionally , you will have to do this several times to get the positioning correct .
When you have finished , your cube will have both the top and middle layers fully solved .
Step Four : Turn the Cube Over and Arrange the Last Layer Corners
Now you 'll turn the entire cube upside down ( the Blue top now becomes the bottom ) and arrange the last unfinished layer ( Green ) corners into their correct positions , although not yet finished .
On our cube , the front face is the red side .
So the correct corners for the front ( labeled as 1 and 2 ) must both have Green and Red facelets on them so they 'll match up with the bottom two layers we 've already solved and also the Green top .
Using this logic , the back side of our cube is Orange so the back corners ( labeled as 3 and 4 ) must both then contain Green and Orange facelets .
Furthermore , all the final corners must also be on their correct sides .
For example , on our cube the Green - Red - White corner must be in position 1 and the Green - Red - Yellow corner must be in position 2 .
Once we are ready to finish them in the next step they must be ready to match up with all three colors .
Remember , we are n't trying to completely solve these final corners yet , just moving them into place to be finished in the next step .
As an example , on the mini-cube to the right you can see that the Green - Red - White corner is in the correct position but not yet finished ( the green facelet is on the front , the white facelet is on the top etc ) .
The Green - Orange - White cubie on the back right side is also in the correct position , but obviously not matching up correctly yet ( the orange facelet is on the white side ) .
However , that 's all you have to do for this step !
We 'll be flipping all of these corners around to finish them in Step Five .
Here are the maneuvers used to arrange the corners into their correct positions , although not yet solved :
Switch 1 and 2
Switch 1 and 3
Many times you can take a look around the unfinished top layer and find the two Red corners already side - by - side .
If that 's the case , just turn the top layer around so that both Red corners are on the Red front ( without disturbing the two finished layers below of course ) .
Then you 'll just have to use the " Switch One and Two " maneuver to move them back and forth to the proper sides .
Concerning the Orange corners , you must turn the entire cube around ( not moving any rows or columns ) so that the Orange side is now the front .
Then you can perform the switching maneuvers as needed .
If two Reds are diagonal from one another ( the red corners are currently at positions 2 and 3 ) , perform the " Switch One and Three " maneuver to bring them side - by - side .
When you have finished this step , your cube will have the corners arranged to their proper positions , but probably not yet finished .
Step Five : Completely Finish the Last Layer Corners
In this step , we will flip all of the last layer corners around into their final finished positions .
On our cube , Green is the last layer color .
To solve the corners , we will focus on three different configurations concerning the Green facelets .
Using the graphic to the left , hold your cube so that when you are looking at the front you can see any of these Green facelet configurations exactly as shown .
For this step , none of the other remaining facelets ( or the rest of the cube ) matter so they are not shown , including any other Green facelets on the last layer .
Once you 've located one of the three arrangements , perform the following algorithm :
Several times
Remember that while two of the configurations ( the middle and bottom ) require the green facelets be located on the right side of the cube , it 's still necessary to perform the algorithm above from the front .
You 'll have to perform this algorithm several times , and you 'll need to use at least two of the three different configurations to continue ( finding the same configuration over and over again will just get you stuck ) .
If you could n't find one of the starting configurations to begin this step , perform the algorithm once and then you 'll be able to find one of them .
Step Six : Completely Finish Two Edges and Prepare the Remaining Two
You should now find that you have also placed at least one of the remaining last layer edges into its final position , although not necessarily turned around correctly .
Turn the entire cube around so that the side with a correctly positioned edge is now the front ( in some cases , you 'll have a couple to choose from ) .
In our diagram , the side with the Green - White edge is the front because the edge is in its proper place ( just needing to be flipped over ) .
Then perform the following repositioning algorithm to move the rest of the edges into their proper places ( up to two times ) .
If you could n't find a correctly positioned edge to start with , perform the algorithm once from any front and then proceed as usual .
From the Correctly - Positioned Edge Side
Step Seven : Solve the Rubik's Cube
We are now ready to completely solve the Rubik 's cube .
At this point , only the last unfinished layer concerns us so the rest of the cube is not shown .
In almost all cases , there will be two edges completely solved after finishing step six above , and two edges unsolved .
The two unsolved edges , however , are now properly positioned on their correct sides and simply need to be turned around to be finished .
Turn the entire cube around until the last two unsolved edges match up to either of the graphics shown to the left when looking at the front of the cube .
In our graphic , the completely solved cubies of the last layer are shown in Pink , and the two unsolved edges are shown in Purple .
Once you are ready , perform the applicable last layer algorithm below to completely solve the cube .
The first is known as the " H " Pattern , and the second is known as the " Fish Pattern " .
If for some reason you had all four edges flipped ( instead of the usual two edges ) when you finished step six , simply perform the " H " Pattern once from any front .
You will then be able to find either of the two original patterns at that point .
Congratulations !
You 've solved the Rubiks Cube !

I ca n’t believe it ’s not XML !
As you may or may not have heard , JSON came to Dave Winer ’s attention today .
He is , quite obviously , of the opinion that this is just a reinvention of what people are already doing just fine with XML , thank you very much , so what ’s the point ?
Of course , this ignores the fact that the Lisp folks have been making the same argument for years , wondering why there was this great pressing need to go out and invent XML when s-expressions were just dandy .
But once you get past the egos and the attachments to this or that language or tool , the XML / s - expressions debate basically comes down to XML people saying , “ OK , you ’ve got s-expressions , and they ’re pretty cool and they solve your problems .
But they do n’t solve my problems , so I need something else . ”
Not coincidentally , once you get past the egos and the attachments to this or that language or tool , the JSON / XML debate basically comes down to JSON people saying , “ OK , you ’ve got XML , and it ’s pretty cool and it solves your problems .
But it does n’t solve my problems , so I need something else . ”
Simon has already made some excellent points to this effect .
Just as the Lisp guys could n’t understand XML — it ’s not even an s-expression ! — there seem to be a lot of XML folks who ca n’t understand JSON — yes , Dave , it ’s not even XML .
I have a theory on why that is , but to explain it I need to go into a couple other things first .
The big belly , revisited
You may remember this little image from the various times I ’ve used it ; in a very rough way , it represents the rate at which the complexity of your web infrastructure grows with the size and complexity of your web presence .
There ’s an important lesson in this graph , which I originally summarized like this :
But look at the middle .
The graph curves up sharply from the cat - pictures site , taking into account the needs of more complicated and dynamic sites .
And at the other end it curves up sharply again , representing the massive expenditure needed to sustain something on the scale of Google .
But in the middle it ’s almost flat , and it stays almost flat for a long time .
These days it ’s fashionable to talk about graphs that have a “ long tail ” , but this one does n’t : it has a big belly .
Nothing ’s changed on that front , really , in the last seven months , so it ’s still pretty valid : on one end you have simple flat HTML slapped up on a free hosting site somewhere .
On the other end you have mega-multinational corporations with “ enterprisey ” infrastructure .
In between , you have everybody else .
The initial spike represents the move from flat HTML to server - side includes or simple PHP or CGI scripts , and through into the belly .
In the belly of the graph , your request / response cycle basically looks like this :
Request comes in to the web server .
Web server passes the request along to your application .
Your application talks to the database for a bit .
Your application renders a response and kicks it back to the web server .
The web server passes the response on to the client .
Even as you keep scaling up to ever higher levels of traffic , this basically stays the same ; toward the end of the belly , a couple other steps often creep in — load balancing in front of the web server and replication or pooling of multiple database servers — but if you do that smartly it does n’t really increase your overall complexity that much .
And still , you ’re doing the same basic things : web server + application code + database .
Of course , eventually you come out into the second spike , where you have things like brokerage systems that run millions of concurrent transactions , or search engines which have to use massively parallel processing to look through ten billion database rows in milliseconds .
But most people never come out into that realm , or at least they never really need to but are told otherwise by consultants who ca n’t get away with charging a thousand bucks an hour just to say , “ um , yeah , just slap a load balancer up front , some pooling of DB connections out back and you ’re good to go . ”
Remove them from the picture , and most places that have a web presence will naturally end up in the big , mostly flat belly of the graph .
JSON also naturally fits into that big belly .
XML does , too , but it also does n’t , because I think a lot of this has to do with people using the name “ XML ” in different ways .
The XMLephant in the room
If the JSON / XML debate were really just about JSON and XML , Dave Winer would n’t have written that strange little blog entry .
JSON and XML are , after all , just two ways to describe data ; which one you use should boil down to mundane things like library support in your language of choice .
But Dave revealed what I think is the real source of the debate by mentioning SOAP and XML - RPC , which are hallmarks of the Enterprise Architecture world .
In that world it ’s just taken for granted that interoperability means implementing ( or pretending to implement ) about eight zillion different XML - based specifications .
So , not XML - the - data - description - format , but XML - the - protocol - stack , which is another beast entirely but which likes to confuse people by never mentioning its full name .
Now , I ’m not going to get into whether the folks on the extreme right edge of the graph really need all that stuff just to send text messages to each other ( since , really , that ’s what ’s going on ) because that ’s not my field ( thank heaven ) .
But it is extremely important to know about this and to realize two things :
A surprising percentage of the time , when people talk about “ XML ” , they ’re really talking about a protocol stack which just happens to use XML - based data formats .
The Enterprise Architecture world which has basically chained itself to that protocol stack is getting pretty badly shaken up right now by people who are patiently explaining how most of that stack can be replaced with simpler things .
This is the REST vs. Web Services debate , and I ’m incredibly glad that I do n’t have to deal with it .
So the XML - the - protocol - stack people are more than a little bit scared and defensive right now because of the REST folks .
And now here are these kids with their startup companies and their weblogs who are getting data exchange and even things that kind of look like API s out of … JavaScript arrays ?
The XML guys are sitting up on the mountaintop like the Grinch , with his pile of stolen presents , wondering how Christmas still managed to happen : it came without specs !
It came without hype !
It came without angle brackets , envelopes or types !
JSON , as a data format , runs fast and loose .
The entire format can be exhaustively defined on a single , short page ( in fact , it ’s exhaustively defined in a little sidebar ; everything else is just pretty pictures to make it easier to understand ) .
JSON has about a half - dozen data types , and you can do an awful lot of useful things using just two of them .
It does n’t place very many constraints on how you can use those types ; except for two basic rules ( the existence of a parent object , and use of strings as keys ) it ’ll let you stick pretty much anything pretty much anywhere .
JSON does n’t have a formal schema definition language .
JSON objects do n’t carry around any metadata about themselves .
This is all very frightening to an Enterprise Architect who ’s used to data formats which sometimes need as much space to describe the type of data they ’re carrying and how they ’re carrying it as they need to actually carry the data around .
“ Real ” data formats have specifications and schemas and type checking and gobs and gobs and gobs of metadata .
Otherwise , how could they ever work ?
The sweet spot
The answer is that JSON works because most people do n’t really need all that overhead , and because it ’s often possible to do really interesting things with really simple formats .
The World Wide Web has been churning along for over a decade with a markup language that originally had no standardized specification ; these days it has specs , but they ’re almost never enforced and are , in fact , usually thrown down to the ground and trampled upon .
And it still works .
My bank undoubtedly has a massively complex , strongly - typed system handling my financial transactions , but it shows those transactions to me in a web page which throws sixty - three validation errors if I hit it with a strict parser .
So HTML is a fast and loose format and it does n’t have any concept of data types that the average programmer would recognize ( though it does , in its own special way , have data types ) , and what rules it has with regards to what you can stick where are routinely ignored .
And yet it works .
It works really , really well .
It works because most people who are using it do n’t really need to do complex things with it .
Most people who need markup languages for use on the web just want to do simple things like display some text and pictures .
You do n’t need a 500 - page language specification to do that .
JSON is stricter than HTML in some ways ; it expects you to obey the rules , but in exchange it gives you fewer rules to follow .
And JSON works really , really well .
It works because most people who are using it do n’t really need to do complex things with it ; most people who need data formats for use on the web just want to do simple things like fetch some data from over there and drop it into this web page here .
You do n’t need the massive overhead of XML - the - protocol - stack to do that .
There are people who genuinely have more complex needs , and I ’m not going to try to say whether one thing or another will suit what they ’re doing .
But for the majority of us who are lounging around in the big belly of the web , JSON is just fine .
The root of the problem
The Enterprise Architecting , XML - as - protocol - stack guys do n’t work in the big belly , though .
They work , or at least they ’ve convinced everyone that they work , way over on the right - hand side of the graph , where the massive infrastructure and insanely complex requirements live .
They ’ve spent so much time in a highly specialized niche environment that they ’ve gotten out of touch with what most of the web is doing , and so they ’re having trouble understanding that something which seems to work just fine for them ( and I ’m being charitable with that description ) is n’t going to cut it for everyone else , or that something which would never do for them seems to be working for so many other people .
I think the same basic thing happened with XML and s-expressions ; the Lisp folks had gotten so highly specialized on particular problem domains that they were out of touch with what the larger programming world was doing , and so they did n’t realize that something which seemed to be working just fine for them was n’t going to cut it for everyone else .
And I think that ’s where responses like Dave Winer ’s come from ; JSON ’s been kicking around and gaining steam for quite a while now , but it ’s never really been on Dave ’s radar before .
That fact alone says to me that , whatever he ’s been up to over the last year or so ( I admit to not following Dave ’s doings all that closely ; I do n’t have the time and certain other people do a far better job of it ) , he ’s been in a specialized niche that ’s fallen out of touch with the big belly of the web .
Whatever he ’s doing , SOAP and XML - RPC apparently manage it just fine .
If so , good for him , and he should keep right on using them .
But they do n’t manage things just fine for me ( go back and re-read Simon ’s post to get hints of some of the problems ) and I suspect that they do n’t manage things just fine for most of the rest of the web .
JSON , on the other hand , does , and so we ’ll end up using it or something else in the same vein .
And probably , in time , something new will come along and a bunch of us will hear about it for the first time and sit up and yell , “ it ’s not even JSON ! ”
In fact , I ’m kind of looking forward to that .

TRIVIALIZING TERROR ….
Remember Jose Padilla , the “ dirty bomber ” ?
Last September , in a major victory for the Bush administration , the 4th Circuit Court ruled that the government could detain Padilla in a military brig indefinitely without charges even though he was a U.S. citizen arrested on U.S. soil .
It was an expansive ruling that gave the administration broad powers to treat suspected enemy combatants in virtually any way they wanted .
This should have made the government happy , right ?
Unfortunately , there was one hitch : this being the United States , wartime or no , Padilla could appeal his detention to the Supreme Court , and there was a chance that the Supremes might not be as accomodating as the conservative 4th Circuit .
So the Justice Department came up with a brainstorm : at the last minute , it asked the 4th Circuit to vacate the government ’s big victory and transfer Padilla to the civilian court system , where they planned to charge him not with being a dirty bomber , not even with planning to blow up apartment buildings , but with a humdrum variety of low - level conspiracy charges .
Today , the 4th Circuit announced that it was not amused :
The government has held Padilla militarily for three and a half years , steadfastly maintaining that it was imperative in the interest of national security that he be so held .
However , a short time after our decision issued on the government ?s representation that Padilla ?s military custody was indeed necessary in the interest of national security , the government determined that it was no longer necessary that Padilla be held militarily .
….
In a plea that was notable given that the government had held Padilla militarily for three and a half years and that the Supreme Court was expected within only days either to deny certiorari or to assume jurisdiction over the case for eventual disposition on the merits , the government urged that we act as expeditiously as possible to authorize the transfer [ to a civilian court ] .
The government styled its motion as an ?emergency application , ? but it provided no explanation as to what comprised the asserted exigency .
The opinion , which denied the transfer and sent the case to the Supreme Court , was written by conservative darling Michael Luttig , who until today was considered a possible contender for a spot on the Supreme Court .
Now , probably not .
In fact , he ’s probably not even a conservative darling anymore .
It ’s worth reading Luttig ’s whole opinion .
It ’s not very long and it pretty clearly indicates that Luttig and his colleagues were seriously pissed .
They want to know why the government claimed it was absolutely essential to national security that Padilla be detained indefinitely and then suddenly changed their minds without so much as an explanation .
They also want to know why this change of heart came only two business days before Padilla ’s appeal was scheduled to be filed with the Supreme Court .
And that ’s not all .
They want to know why the government provided them with a completely different set of facts than they provided to the civilian court in Miami .
They want to know why the government provided more information about the case to the media than they did to the court .
And finally , they want to know why the government did all these things even though they must have known that these actions rather obviously undermined their own public arguments about the importance of the war on terror :
They have left the impression that the government may even have come to the belief that the principle in reliance upon which it has detained Padilla for this time , that the President possesses the authority to detain enemy combatants who enter into this country for the purpose of attacking America and its citizens from within , can , in the end , yield to expediency with little or no cost to its conduct of the war against terror ?
an impression we would have thought the government likewise could ill afford to leave extant .
And these impressions have been left , we fear , at what may ultimately prove to be substantial cost to the government ?s credibility before the courts , to whom it will one day need to argue again in support of a principle of assertedly like importance and necessity to the one that it seems to abandon today .
While there could be an objective that could command such a price as all of this , it is difficult to imagine what that objective would be .
In other words , if the government ’s own actions make it clear that they consider the war on terror to be little more than a game designed to expand presidential power , how can they expect anyone else to take it seriously either ?
It ’s a good question .
No wonder Luttig was pissed .
He was one of the ones who thought the Bush administration took this stuff seriously .
World health authorities stepped up their fight against tobacco
The health ministry said it had already rejected a lower offer from the tobacco firms , though did not say what level of compensation it was seeking .
According to local data , Saudis spend 5 bn riyals ( £ 683 m ; $ 1.3 bn ) a year on tobacco and smoking - related goods .
Saudi Arabia has been stepping up its efforts to stop its population smoking .
A royal decree has banned smoking in all government and state buildings , while there is also a ban on advertising cigarettes in the local press or on television .
One out of every 10 Saudis smokes , the World Health Organization estimates , though some analysts and groups have questioned this figure , saying that it is closer to 30 % .
Reuters quoted the Anti-Smoking Society as saying that 22,000 Saudis died of smoking related diseases every year .
Health Minister Hamad al - Manie said : " Representatives of tobacco companies have to pay both the patients and the health ministry for the costs of treatment .
" Otherwise , the ministry will go ahead with the lawsuit . "

Juli 2005 veröffentlichte “ Bild ” eine halbseitige Geschichte , die mit dieser recht harmlos klingenden Schlagzeile überschrieben war :
Es ging in dem Artikel um einen Mann , der von seiner Ex-Freundin angezeigt und auf 200.000 Euro Schmerzensgeld verklagt worden war , weil er einen offenbar heimlich gedrehten Film im Internet veröffentlicht hatte .
Der Film zeigte ihn mit der Ex -Freundin beim Oralsex .
Die Anklage lautete auf Beleidigung , Verletzung der Rechte am eigenen Bild und Verbreitung pornographischer Schriften .
“ Bild ” illustriert die Geschichte u.a. mit einer Sequenz aus dem Film , die mit zwei nicht sehr großen schwarzen Balken versehen ist , und beschreibt das Foto so :
Szene aus dem privaten Sexfilm : Zärtlich verwöhnt Kerstin ihren Freund Dirk N.* ( 39 ) mit dem Mund
Man kann das als zynisch bezeichnen , einen
Text über diesen Strafprozess quasi mit dem corpus delicti selbst zu bebildern , aber darum soll es hier gar nicht gehen .
Sondern um das andere ziemlich große Foto , das “ Bild ” in diesem Zusammenhang zeigt .
Darauf ist eine Frau in Jeans zu sehen .
Sie trägt einen auffälligen Gürtel und ein nicht weniger auffälliges Oberteil .
Frisur , Ohren , Haaransatz und - farbe sind gut zu erkennen .
Lediglich das Gesicht ist verpixelt .
Die Bildunterzeile lautet :
Kerstin* ( 42 ) verklagt ihren Freund auf 200.000 Euro Schmerzensgeld
Soweit so schlimm .
Denn wer “ Kerstin ” kennt , dürfte keine Probleme gehabt haben , sie anhand des großen Fotos zu identifizieren .
Aber damit ist diese Geschichte noch lange nicht zuende .
Im Gegenteil .
Denn die Frau auf dem großen
Foto – nennen wir sie einfach weiter “ Kerstin ” – ist überhaupt nicht die 42 - jährige Frau aus dem Video , sondern deren 27 - jährige Nichte , die mit dem “ frivolen Prozeß ” aus der “ Bild ” - Zeitung rein gar nichts zu tun hat .
Da wundert es nicht , dass “ Kerstin ” die “ Bild ” - Zeitung aufforderte , in Zukunft keine Fotos mehr von ihr zu veröffentlichen und dabei zu behaupten , sie habe die dargestellten sexuellen Handlungen vorgenommen .
Sie forderte also die Abgabe einer strafbewehrten Unterlassungserklärung von “ Bild ” .
Doch “ Bild ” lehnte ab .
Deshalb musste sich das Landgericht Frankfurt / Main mit dem Fall beschäftigen .
Am 11 .
August 2005 erließ es eine einstweilige Verfügung , die es “ Bild ” untersagte , Fotos von “ Kerstin ” zu veröffentlichen und dabei zu behaupten , sie habe die dargestellten sexuellen Handlungen vorgenommen .
Bei Zuwiderhandlung hätte “ Bild ” 250.000 Euro zahlen müssen .
Doch “ Bild ” legte Widerspruch gegen die einstweilige Verfügung ein .
Also musste sich das Gericht wieder mit dem Fall beschäftigen .
Am 19 .
Januar dieses Jahres fand die mündliche Verhandlung statt .
Im Urteil [ PDF ] des Gerichts wird “ Kerstins ” Aussage so wiedergegeben :
Trotz gepixeltem Gesicht sei sie auf dem Bild erkennbar ( … ) .
Sie sei auch tatsächlich bundesweit von Freunden , Bekannten und Verwandten erkannt worden , insbesondere von einer Frau S. D. aus H , sowie von ihrem Bruder und dessen Arbeitskollegen .
(…)
Die verwandtschaftliche Verbindung zwischen den zwei Frauen hätte dazu geführt , daß der Artikel insbesondere die Aufmerksamkeit von Bekannten und Verwandten ( … ) auf sich gezogen hätte .
Das klingt plausibel .
Außer für “ Bild ” , bzw .
die beklagte Axel Springer AG , deren Aussage im Urteil so wiedergegeben wird :
Die Beklagte bestreitet mit Nichtwissen , dass es sich bei der ( …) Frau um die Klägerin handele und diese die Nichte von Frau B. sei .
Sie bestreitet des Weiteren , dass die Frau , die angeblich die Klägerin sein soll , für Dritte identifizierbar sei .
(…)
Aufgrund der Unkenntlichkeit sei es daher auch nicht möglich , daß die Beklagte tatsächlich von Freunden , Bekannten und Verwandten erkannt worden sei .
Auch spreche die Tatsache , daß der Bruder der Klägerin in L lebe und sie in Westfalen , dagegen , dass die Arbeitskollegen des Bruders die Schwester überhaupt kennen und damit erkennen können .
Um das mal kurz zusammenzufassen : “ Bild ” weiß nicht , wer auf dem von ihr gezeigten Foto zu sehen ist , bestreitet aber einfach mal , dass es die Frau sei , die behauptet , es zu sein , und bezichtigt sie auch sonst pauschal der Lüge .
“ Bild ” hatte also Kerstins Darstellung von Anfang an rein gar nichts entgegenzusetzen ( was übrigens auch die Entscheidungsgründe des Gerichts deutlich machen ) , weigerte sich aber trotzdem , die simple Erklärung abzugeben , dass sie es künftig unterlassen werde , das Persönlichkeitsrecht und das Recht am eigenen Bild der Klägerin zu verletzen .
Ach ja , “ Bild ” verlor natürlich den Prozeß .
Mit bestem Dank an Martin H. für den sachdienlichen Hinweis .

The Macintosh in 1984
There are a number of Macintosh history sites out there , but I wanted to post some early MacOS screen shots that I thought were interesting .
These screenshots were made using the vMac emulator running MacOS 1.1 , I would have used 1.0 , but it would n't run right under vMac .
Aside from a couple of menu items added under the " Special " menu , 1.1 reportedly looks the same as 1.0 which was released on January 1984 .
As the Macintosh boots up it displays a happy macintosh picture to let the user know everything is OK .
Typically , the Macintosh starts up the Finder application .
The Finder is the MacOS 's program for managing files and launching applications .
The Finder 's user interface is far superior to that of the " MS - DOS Executive " used in Microsoft 's Windows 1.x and 2.x or even the Program Manager / File Manager of Windows 3.x .
It was n't until Windows 95 ( 11 years later ) that Microsoft would even come close to the look and feel of the Finder - then they threw it all away and replaced it with a web browser in Windows 98 .
Disks , when inserted , appear directly on the desktop allowing for very easy access to files .
Double clicking the disk icon opens a file window .
Finder windows open with a zooming effect .
Finder windows can be dragged around the screen by " grabbing " the title bar with the mouse .
Clicking the small box in the upper left of the window closes the window .
Files and folders can be dragged to the desktop - although they do not actually exist there .
The item is not copied or moved to another location , only the icon is displaced from the folder where it really is and displayed on the desktop instead The Trash icon works in a similar manner , holding icons until the Empty Trash option is selected and the files are deleted .
Files can be renamed by clicking on the name underneath the file 's icon and typing the new name .
Files and folder can be moved or copied by dragging and dropping them in to folders or drives .
File folders can be viewed as icons ( default ) or as a list sorted by size , name , kind or date .
The list view is not quite as friendly as the icon view in this early version of MacOS as list items can not be dragged like regular icons .
The finder has a number of desktop accessories , including a rather visually compact control panel .
The control panel lets you adjust the volume ( sound in a 1984 IBM PC was unheard of , other than the beeper that could n't be shut off ) , mouse speed ( most 1984 PCs did n't even have anything to click at yet ) , the time ( already Y2 K compliant ! ) , keyboard repeat rates , cursor blink speed , the background pattern , double click speed , and the number of times a menu item blinks when you select it .
While the desktop accessories run windowed , other applications run using the entire screen ( newer MacOS allows multiple programs to share the screen ) .
They also get their own set of menus - there is always only one menu visible .
This works very well on small displays as it conserves valuable screen space , but in my opinion , on very large displays this could sometimes be an annoyance .
This is on a tour disk , and I found this particular option very interesting .
All of this was designed to run in 128 k of RAM .
Makes you really wonder why Windows 2000 requires 128 MEGS to run .
And the best thing about all of this is there is no stupid web " integration " !
They killed Macintosh !
You bastards !
I guess this is the Macintosh equivalent of the BSOD .
I got this while trying to exit one of the programs .
It could just be a problem with running under vMac. Back to The GUI Gallery

The answer to this question is a definite " Yes . "
Atheists are people who , whether they like it or not , have the law of God written on their hearts ( Rom. 2:15 ) .
They are subject to the same laws of our country ( and other countries ) , and they have a sense of right and wrong .
They often work with people who are religious and have ethical standards , as well as non-believers who do n't ; so they are exposed to all sorts of moral behavior .
In addition , they often form their own moral standards based on what suits them .
Besides , things ( like robbery , lying , stealing , etc. , ) can get you imprisoned ; so it is practical and logical for an atheist to be ethical and work within the norms of social behavior .
However you want to look at it , atheists , generally , are honest , hardworking people .
Nevertheless , some Christians raise the question , " What is to prevent an atheist from murdering and stealing ?
After all , they have no fear of God and no absolute moral code . "
The answer is simple : Atheists are capable of governing their own moral behavior and getting along in society the same as anyone else .
At the risk of labeling the atheist as self - centered , it does not serve the best interests of an atheist to murder and steal since it would not take long before he was imprisoned and / or killed for his actions .
Basically , society will only put up with so much if it is to function smoothly .
So , if an atheist wants to get along and have a nice life , murdering and stealing wo n't accomplish it .
It makes sense for him to be honest , work hard , pay his bills , and get along with others .
Basically , he has to adopt a set of ethics common to society in order to do that .
Belief in God is not a requirement for ethical behavior or an enjoyable life .
On the other hand
Atheists ' morals are not absolute .
They do not have a set of moral laws from an absolute God by which right and wrong are judged .
But , they do live in societies that have legal systems with a codified set of laws .
This would be the closest thing to moral absolutes for atheists .
However , since the legal system changes , the morals in a society can still change and their morals along with it .
At best , these codified morals are " temporary absolutes . "
In one century abortion is wrong ; in another , it is right .
So if we ask if it is or is n't right , the atheist can only tell us his opinion .
If there is a God , killing the unborn is wrong .
If there is no God , then who cares ?
If it serves the best interest of society and the individual , then kill .
This can be likened to something I call , " experimental ethics . "
In other words , whatever works best is right .
Society experiments with ethical behavior to determine which set of rules works best for it .
Hopefully , these experiments lead to better and better moral behavior .
But , as we see by looking into society , this is n't the case : crime is on the rise .
There are potential dangers in this kind of self - established / experimental ethical system .
If a totalitarian political system is instituted and a mandate is issued to kill all dissenters or Christians or mentally ill , what is to prevent the atheist from joining forces with the majority system and support the killings ?
It serves his self - interests -- so why not ?
Morality becomes a standard of convenience - - not absolutes .
But , to be fair , just because someone has an absolute ethical system based on the Bible , there is no guarantee that he will not also join forces in doing what is wrong .
People are often very inconsistent , but the issue here is the basis of moral beliefs and how they affect behavior .
That is why belief systems are so important , and absolutes are so necessary .
If morals are relative , then behavior will be , too .
That can be dangerous if everyone starts doing right in his own eyes .
A boat adrift without an anchor will eventually crash into the rocks .
The Bible teaches love , patience , and seeking the welfare of others even when it might harm the Christian .
In contrast , the atheists ' presuppositions must be constantly changing and subjective and do not demand love , patience , and the welfare of others .
Instead , since the great majority of atheists are evolutionists , their morality , like evolution , is the product of purely natural and random processes that become self - serving .
Basically , the atheist cannot claim any moral absolutes at all .
To an atheist , ethics must be variable and evolving .
This could be good or bad , but with human nature being what it is , I 'll opt for the moral absolutes -- based on God 's word -- and not on the subjective and changing morals that atheism offers .
For those of you that have been with us for a while , you ’ll probably remember that we blogged about data recovery issues we had to deal with on occasion .
Fortunately for us , we never ran into a situation where we absolutely had to have some critical data back , so all we ever did was to experiment with certain questionable techniques and software to recover data out of damaged hard drives .
Would we apply these techniques to drives containing precious or mission critical data ?
Certainly not !
The only thing to be done in those situations is to send your damaged medias to a professional recovery company .
I recently had the good fortune of stumbling upon David Mohyla , a professional who has been working in the data recovery industry for many years .
Here is our interview with him :
[ GAS ] : Hello David , and welcome to [ Geeks Are Sexy ] .
Could you please tell us about DTiData , your position in the company , and finally , its history and mission ?
David : Hi Kiltak , DTIdata is a data recovery company that recovers data lost due to physical or mechanical failures .
This includes hard drives , R.A.I.D arrays , servers , as well as most other types of storage media .
We also provide recovery software for less catastrophic failures such as deleted files or data lost due to format of media .
Our networking department provides maintenance and recovery of MS Exchange Server , as well as topology and deployment of most all types of network infrastructures .
I am the President of dtidata.com , Inc and I oversee the daily operations of all the divisions of the company .
Dtidata.com , Inc was founded as a company in 1998 .
However , the core group of technicians here has been working together since 1993 when " Disk Assist " , a hard drive handbook of specifications and jumper switch settings was deployed as a digital reference for technicians .
Not long after that two of the first data recovery software programs called " Fix for Disks " and " Drive Wizzard MBR " were deployed to recover from FAT 16 and 32 OS Failures .
As a natural progression to the data recovery software industry , we tended to the needs of many customers that had suffered more catastrophic physical failures .
We have become a trusted source for prompt and affordable data recovery for many large corporations such as Coca Cola , Pitney Bowes , Raymond James as well as home users and small businesses .
Our mission statement is straightforward and quite simple .
We provide our customers with prompt , affordable service .
In addition , we also want to help educate our customers and keep their data as safe as possible .
Data replication and backup policies are extremely important .
Of course , the data on the backups needs to be tested for integrity using fire drills .
Testing the integrity of backup sources is just as important as backing up the data .
[ GAS ] :
Your site mentions some technology called ' Adaptive Logic ' and that you 've seen an increase in the number of drives that other companies have attempted to recover .
How much of an increase has this been , and how is ' Adaptive Logic ' different than other data recovery technologies ?
David :
Yes , of course .
Adaptive Logic is a method of using proprietary tools to recover data from drives which other data recovery companies may have deemed un-recoverable .
The technology uses a database of exact drive firmware , which allows us to reference areas , or zones of a hard drive .
In addition , we are able to control what head (s ) are reading a certain area of the disk .
We utilize this technology when there may be extreme damage to the media or platters of a hard drive .
This allows us to control what head ( s ) we want to read and what head ( s ) we do not want to read .
We can also remove zones from the drive as well , thus avoiding the damaged area of the media .
Finally , we may need to recalculate certain physical to logical translations to have usable files again .
In this case , obviously we are referring to a situation where there is some damage to the platters .
The Read / Write head has caused the damage and also needs to be replaced .
Most data recovery companies will try to exchange the Read / Write heads and try to image the drive .
However , in a case where there is platter damage the Read / Write heads will go bad quickly .
The Read / Write heads are never supposed to touch the platters .
The lift necessary to keep the heads above the platters is provided by the velocity of the platter spinning at high RPM .
As soon as the Read / Write head floats over the score it will then drop slightly and cause damage to the Read / Write head and more damage to the platters .
This is where most data recovery companies give up .
Adaptive Logic is our own methodology to overcome such situations .
This is but one of many scenarios where an Adaptive Logic technique is applied .
[ GAS ] :
Your site also mentions some training opportunities .
What do these courses entail , and how do we sign up ?
David :
We are currently making our Logical data recovery classes available online .
An announcement will be made on our website in the coming month as to exactly when this will be available .
Logical data recovery includes recovering data from most all soft or logical data loss scenarios describing different techniques and tools along with explanations of file systems and RAID systems .
[ GAS ] :
What differentiates DTiData from the competition ?
David :
We provide flat rate pricing , a no data no charge policy and guarantee data .
We guarantee the data we recover will be in good working condition .
We do not range quote , we do not confuse consumers with a low bottom end quote and a high - end quote .
Most companies in the case of a clicking hard drive will give a quote from $ 700.00 to $ 2500.00 .
Unfortunately , the customer hopes for the best and usually gets charged the worst .
Our quotes are flat rate and up front .
Our technicians will provide flat rate quotes that will not vary depending upon your situation .
You will know before sending your drive to us the cost of our services .
[ GAS ] : Google results for data recovery keywords are swamped under with listings from fake companies that will try to rip you off at the first opportunity .
How can people in need of recovery services make an enlightened decision when deciding where to send their broken drive to ?
David : First , we are authorized to open all hard drive media without voiding the warranty .
Western Digital provides a list of companies that are authorized to open their products .
We are proud to be on this list !
All work is done in a bio-metrically secure class 100 clean room in order to ensure our customers ’ security .
In addition , we are n’t just amateurs with a website .
The internet is an amazing place .
It provides entertainment , a wealth of information and many other wonderful things .
But make no mistake ; the internet also has marketeers in almost every area .
Companies that are just out to make a buck without providing any real service .
Without a regulator body to police our industry , some bad apples are bound to appear .
If you find a company making statements such as , “ We recover any hard drive regardless of size for $ 399.00 . " , run screaming with your hands in the air .
This is impossible , unless you take only the soft or logical crashes and send the actual physically damaged ones out to another company in order to get a mark up or discount from the partner company actually doing the work .
The bogus companies routinely call you and say it is the worst crash they have seen ; furthermore , it is going to cost much more and take much longer .
In some cases , unscrupulous techs attempt to work on drives themselves in their garages , with disastrous results .
Lots of people can make beautiful websites with great content .
However , there are very few companies which can recover data consistently from various types of media .
Common sense must prevail , if it is too good to be true , it is .
Parts fees alone make the low ball recovery schemes not hold water !!!!
[ GAS ] :
While browsing your site , I noticed that dtidata offers a few free recovery utilities .
Can you tell our readers about when they should try to recover their files themselves , and when they should hire professionals to do the job .
David : First , if the media is physically damaged ; DO NOT RUN ANY UTILITIES !
That said , always save your recovered data to a drive other than the one you are recovering from !
Otherwise , you will overwrite data that may not have been recovered yet .
Finally , never save any new data to the drive where you lost data .
Once you have used another drive to save your data , you can then try to run software utilities without worry .
If the data is mission critical and you are not sure what you are doing then always consult with a professional .
[ GAS ] :
You also have paying versions of these software .
What is the main difference between your free and premium products ?
David :
Yes , our premium data recovery software provides our customers with tech support with a real live technician to guide our users through their recovery should they need help .
In addition , they are our latest releases made to deal with the most common failures reported by our support team .
[ GAS ] :
You sent us a picture autographed by Shaggy thanking you for your excellent service ; can you quickly explain to us what happened ?
David :
Yes , Shaggy ’s record label sent a drive in for recovery .
They had a lot of music more than 100GB of various genres , from various artists including Shaggy on this media .
They had used our services in the past .
They had suffered a catastrophic head crash .
They made it known that this drive was of great importance .
We had all their music back within 48 hours of receiving the drive .
I heard Shaggy said , “ It was n't me . ”
They were impressed and sent the autographed picture of Shaggy to us for a job well done . :-)
[ GAS ] : Before I let you go , is there anything else you want to tell to people that could be in need of data recovery services ?
David :
Yes , if your data is valuable back up early and often .
Back up not only to an external drive but also to CD , DVD or some other media not connected to your live data .
Always test your back up before restoring to your media .
Finally , if you are in a situation where you are in need of data recovery services , please choose wisely .
Cost is always a consideration ; however , it should not be the only consideration .
You do not have to pay outrageous amounts of money to recover data lost due to hard drive failure .
Conversely , it is not wise to choose the cheapest recovery company .
Steer clear of upfront fees or any type of charge unless the data is recovered to your satisfaction .
We are always here to help ! :
Yes , if your data is valuable back up early and often .
Back up not only to an external drive but also to CD , DVD or some other media not connected to your live data .
Always test your back up before restoring to your media .

From : Pastor Len Guini , FSM AustraliaTo : julie.bishop@dest.gov.au Cc : schoolchaplaincy@dest.gov.au Date : Oct 29 , 2006 5:59 PMSubject : Congratulations - Chaplains in schoolsAttn. Hon. Julie Bishop MPMinister for Education , Science and Training --------------Dear Minister BishopCongratulations on today 's announcement of the Chaplains in Schools program and , in particular , the government 's commitment of $ 90 million over three years to fund further exploration of religious values in our schools .
On behalf of Australia 's Pastafarian community , I welcome the Prime Minister 's assurance that the program will include funding chaplains to undertake work including " assisting students in exploring their spirituality ; ( and ) providing guidance on religious , values and ethical matters " .
We in no way seek to make light of the many serious issues faced by our young people .
We seek only to congratulate you on your commitment and resolve in devoting taxpayer 's money to the active promotion of religion in schools , government and non-government alike .
As you may be aware , Pastafarians believe the world was created by a Flying Spaghetti Monster .
While in the past year we have seen enormous growth in the number of Australians professing our faith , and greater interest yet in our beliefs and Holy writings , we continue to face a gap in awareness about our faith among the general community .
In particular , we are saddened that increasing numbers of school students are being taught about the Christian God in their science classrooms , but they have yet to be taught about the other main explanation for the creation of the universe : the intervention of the FSM , and the beneficient nudges of His Noodly Appendages .
Perhaps the placement of government - funded Pastafarian chaplains in schools may go some way towards rectifying this gap in their knowledge .
I would be only too pleased to answer the call , and I 'm sure Pastor Al Dente would be with me on this point , if the FSM should nudge us gently in this direction .
Given the regrettable but continuing discrimination faced by the Pastafarian community in this country , it is my hope that , in the event that a school community applies for funding for appointment of an FSM chaplain , your new Reference Group and officers of your Department will not attempt to prevent the appointment .
After all , as the Prime Minister noted , the " choice of chaplaincy services , including the religious affiliation and denomination , is entirely a decision for the school community " .
When it comes to our schools , and indeed the Australian community as a whole , we humbly pledge to put the ' pasta ' back into ' pastoral care ' .
Yours most sincerely Pastor Len GuiniDurum CathedralChurch of the FSM

After lighting up , she ran her cig hand through her hair .
Although there may not have been anything too flammable in there ( Love does n't exactly rock the hairspray look ) , we were still worried the fire department would need to be called in .

In this exclusive extract from The Revenge of Gaia , radical environmental scientist James Lovelock examines the myths that power our fear of nuclear reactors .
We must conquer our irrational fear of nuclear fission if we are to stop the catastrophic effects of global warming
Chernobyl and the safety of nuclear reactors
Franklin Roosevelt famously said on taking office in 1933 , ' We have nothing to fear but fear itself . '
Most of us have unreasoning fears which creep unwanted into the mind , and bring a shudder ; mine are about overwhelming torrents of muddy water , at seeing and hearing a towering wall of water bearing down on me ; something moving so fast that there is no chance of escape .
I tell myself it is a foolish fear ; we live high enough and far enough from the ocean that no conceivable tsunami would ever reach my home , and there are no great dams , filled with miles of water , upstream on our river .
But still this nightmare scene steals into my dreams .
I can well understand why many have similar fears of a nuclear catastrophe , fears that sensible explanation is never able to calm .
We need emission - free energy sources immediately , and there is no serious contender to nuclear fission .
So how can we overcome our fear of nuclear energy ?
Remembering my own inconsolable fear of overwhelming torrents , it might be useful to compare the dangers facing of two families - one living 100 miles downstream of the huge Yangtze Dam in China , a fine example of a powerful and effective source of renewable energy , and another living 100 miles downwind of the nuclear power station at Chernobyl , the worst example of the wrong kind of nuclear technology .
If the dam burst , perhaps as many as a million people would be killed in the wave of water roaring down the course of the Yangtze River .
When the Chernobyl nuclear power station suffered a steam explosion and subsequently caught fire , releasing a large proportion of its radioactivity into an easterly air stream , the products were carried by the wind across much of the Ukraine and Europe .
Many think that tens of thousands if not millions died as a result of the Chernobyl accident .
As we will soon see , it was no more than 75 .
I have never seen a dam burst or experienced in real life the terror that it would bring , but I have been in a cloud of radioactive nuclides escaping from a fire at a nuclear reactor .
It happened in 1956 , when the military reactor at Windscale in Cumbria caught fire and released a significant part of its accumulated activity into a northerly air stream , blowing down across England .
At the time I was working as a scientist at the National Institute for Medical Research in north London .
I was trying to discover , using the radioactive isotope iodine 131 , more about the nature of the membrane of the human red blood cell .
When I went to take my measurement I was annoyed to find that my primitive home - made Geiger counter was registering background beta radiation at a rate much higher than I expected of my samples , so measurement would be inaccurate if not impossible .
My first thought was that my temperamental electronics were misbehaving , and I was about to start checking them when a colleague , Dr Tata , entered my lab and asked if I was having trouble measuring I131 .
He and another scientist in the institute had found the background counts far above their usual level .
Iodine is a volatile element , and we wondered if one of the three of us had accidentally spilt some radioactive iodine or flushed it unwisely into the laboratory sink .
A few checks showed that I131 was everywhere throughout the building .
We were all of us somewhat chastened and felt an unattributable sense of guilt .
It was not until nearly twenty years later , on a visit to the Atomic Energy Authority 's institute at Harwell , near Oxford , that I heard about the Windscale fire and the cloud of radioactive debris that contaminated most of England .
In 1956 , the year of the fire , the Government was able to keep the bad news bottled tight .
They had the excuse that the reactor in question was part of the nuclear weapons programme and therefore steeped in official secrecy .
The fledgling green lobbies and the media missed the chance to scare us all , perhaps even to death .
So far as I am aware , no one has reported any deaths or morbidity that could have come from the exposure of many millions of people to the release of 740 trillion becquerels of I131 .
In the UK the National Health Service was a good record keeper and any significant rise in the incidence of cancers would have been noticed .
It was a real danger only to those at the scene itself , the fireman and the workers at the plant .
But that must be wrong you say .
Respectable media , for example the Times and the BBC , have more than once stated that 30,000 and more people have died in Europe and Russia as a result of exposure to radiation from the Chernobyl accident .
I prefer to believe the physicians and radiobiologists of the UN agency the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) .
They examined the health of those in the area polluted by the plume from Chernobyl fourteen and nineteen years after the accident , and they were able to find evidence of only forty - five and seventy - five people , respectively , who had died .
These were workers , firemen and others who bravely and successfully fought the fire in the burning reactor and carried out the cleanup afterwards .
So where do these false claims of a huge death from Chernobyl come from ?
They arise mostly from a perverse misinterpretation of the facts of radiobiology .
Careful and difficult observation and data gathering by epidemiologists have established a direct linear link between the dose of radiation received and death from cancer .
Their data comes from the experiences of Japanese people exposed to the radiation from the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima , from the use of radiation in medicine for both treatment and diagnosis , and from the life histories of radiologists and workers exposed to radiation during their working lives .
The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ( UNSCEAR ) issued a report in 2000 ; this summarises the evidence and concludes that the hypothesis of a direct and linear response between radiation and harm done best fits the data .
From the conclusions we could reasonably expect that the consequences of exposing the entire population of Europe to ten millisieverts of radiation , about as much as would come from 100 chest X - rays , would be 400,000 deaths .
Put like this it seems a terrible risk , but it is an amazingly naïve way of presenting the facts .
What matters is not whether we die but when we die .
If the 400,000 were to die the week after the irradiation it would indeed be terrible , but what if instead they lived out their normal lifespans but died a week earlier than expected ?
The facts of radiation biology are that ten millisieverts of radiation reduces human lifespan by about four days , a much less emotive conclusion .
Using the same calculations , the exposure of all those living in Northern Europe to Chernobyl 's radiation on average reduces their lifespan by one to three hours .
For comparison , a life - long smoker will lose seven years of life .
No wonder the media and the anti-nuclear activists prefer to talk of the risk of cancer death .
It makes a better story than the loss of a few hours of life expectation .
If a lie is defined as a statement that purposefully intends to deceive , the persistent repetition of the huge Chernobyl death toll is a powerful lie .
Chernobyl may well have cost some of those living in the Ukraine and Byelorussia even several weeks of their life expectancy .
How different it would have been had they lived on the flood plain of a river with a huge dam upstream that burst .
Then they would have lost their whole life expectancy ; this form of renewable energy can be much more deadly than nuclear .
A more solid and useful estimate of the comparative safety of the different energy sources comes from the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland , in their 2001 report .
They examined all of the large - scale energy sources of the world to compare their safety records .
I was astounded that they found nuclear energy to be the safest of all large - scale energy sources .
The Swiss record puts it about forty times safer than taking energy by burning coal or oil and it was safer even than the renewable hydro-electricity .
Yet so persistent have been the untruths about nuclear energy that we still regard taking energy from uranium in a reactor as more dangerous than burning carbon fuel in the oxygen of the air .
The persistent distortion of the truth about the health risks of nuclear energy should make us wonder if the other statements about nuclear energy are equally flawed .
I wonder about the statement in August 2005 from the nuclear decommissioning authority , that it would cost £ 6 billion to decommission the UK 's stocks of plutonium , as part of a £ 56 billion package for decommissioning the UK 's nuclear installations .
It is true that plutonium is a poisonous element and there is always of risk that it may be stolen to make nuclear weapons .
But the stocks of plutonium in the UK have the energy equivalent of several hundred million tons of coal or oil , enough to keep the nuclear power stations of the UK running for several years .
I find it incredible that our government and its advisers regard this abundant stock of nuclear fuel and our power stations as something to be decommissioned , written off ; and they are prepared to pay over £ 60 billion to do it .
Oil now costs $ 50 a barrel : at that price the UK stock of plutonium fuel alone is worth more than £ 100 billion in energy terms .
It is all being done with stealth and pretence ; we have never been asked if we were prepared to pay this huge cost .
Another flawed idea now circulating is that the world supply of uranium is so small that its use for energy would last only a few years .
It is true that if the whole world chose to use uranium as its sole fuel , supplies of easily mined uranium would soon be exhausted .
But there is a superabundance of low - grade uranium ore : most granite , for example , contains enough uranium to make its fuel capacity five times that of an equal mass of coal .
India is already preparing to use its abundant supplies of thorium , an alternative nuclear fuel , in place of uranium .
The right mix of energy sources
My strong pleas for nuclear energy comes from a growing sense that we have little time left in which to install a reliable and secure supply of electricity ; this is especially true in the United Kingdom and in several of the nations of Europe .
I do not see nuclear energy as a panacea but as an essential part of a portfolio of energy sources .
For the immediate future , and starting now , we need to exploit fission energy as much as we can as a temporary measure , while looking to a future when , having served our need , it can be replaced by clean energy from other sources .
These should include renewables , fusion and burning fossil fuel under conditions where the carbon dioxide effluent is safely sequestered , preferably in the form of an inert solid , such as magnesium carbonate .
The important and overriding consideration is time ; we have nuclear power now , and new nuclear building should be started immediately .
All of the alternatives , including fusion energy , require decades of development before they can be employed on a scale that would significantly reduce emissions .
In the next few years renewables will add an increment of emission - free energy , mainly from wind , but it is quite small when compared with the nuclear potential .
Until 2008 , when closures start , the UK nuclear generating capacity is 14,000 megawatts , and this is only 21 per cent of our total electricity production .
To replace the nuclear output with one megawatt wind turbines would require 56,000 of them , and they would need to be backed up by a capacity of 10,500 megawatts of fossil fuel generators for those frequent occasions when the wind is too weak or too strong .
Unless there are drastic changes in lifestyle we will have to go on using fossil fuel energy for several more decades ; 30 per cent of our energy use is now for transport , and there is little chance that the carbon dioxide effluent of cars , trucks , trains and aircraft will be sequestered and buried .
The virtual superpower of Europe , Franco - Germany , has made the best of both worlds with its French half all nuclear and its German half all green .
This would be a fine and sensible solution were it not for Germany trying to make the rest of us support their industry by buying their wind turbines .
Meanwhile at the world 's climate centres the barometer continues to fall and tell of the imminent danger of a climate storm whose severity the Earth has not endured for 55 m years .
But in the cities the party goes on ; how much longer before reality enters our minds ?

This is a long essay .
There is , however , no limit to how long I could have made it .
The subjects covered here are no less enormous than the Net and its future .
Even optimists agree that the Net 's future as a free and open environment for business and culture is facing many threats .
We can't begin to cover them all or cover all the ways we can fight them .
I believe , however , that there is one sure way to fight all of these threats at once , and without doing it the bad guys will win .
That 's what this essay is about .
Here 's a brief outline of the article .
If you want to go straight to the solution , skip to the third section : Scenario I : The Carriers Win
Scenario II : The Public Workaround
Scenario III : Fight with Words and Not Just Deeds
Scenario II : The Public Workaround
The deathblow comes from the muni Wi -Fi efforts .
It does n't matter whether they are viable or not -- all they need do is give local connectivity the moral high ground and represent a grass roots effort that the legislature not only can't ignore but can embrace .
-- Bob Frankston
In ancient telco lingo , " bypass " is anything that works around the phone system itself .
Susan Crawford wisely encourages bypassing not only the system but the whole notion of fixing it with " Network Neutrality " agreements or legislation .
In response to the questions , " What , if any , version of common carriage rules should govern Internet communications platforms ?
More specifically , can some concept of Network Neutrality be defined and enforced proactively in the form of prescriptive regulations ? " , she answers , I think this is the wrong question .
It assumes the limited world of online access providers we 've got , makes them into " communications platforms , " and then suggests we need to make rules about them .
Not very imaginative .
I have lost faith in our ability to write about code in words , and I 'm confident that any attempt at writing down network neutrality will be so qualified , gutted , eviscerated , and emptied that it will end up being worse than useless .
Besides , I 'm sure there are very good reasons to manage networks , and writing down the difference between management and incremental control of users ' experiences is an impossible task .
The only way around this issue is to avoid it by encouraging the development of alternative online access methods , and being careful not to let the incumbents call them illegal .
Let the dinosaurs huddle together in the snow , controlling and commoditizing to their hearts ' content .
We 're made of better stuff .
It should be no more illegal to have an open wireless network in your house than to practice the piano with the windows open .
And having an open wireless network can lead to a community mesh network and a host of devices that open immediately to others , connecting us to the world .
If that 's not possible , then the second best solution is structural separation , paying off the carriers for their stranded costs and moving to open utility platforms .
BT seems to think that 's a fine idea ; why could n't it work here ?
Muni Wi -Fi is a form of bypass .
So are other government - sponsored or assisted workarounds .
So are the private ones .
If Om Malik and Business 2.0 are sniffing the right trail , that 's what we 'll get from Google .
Here 's what Om said on August 25 , 2005 , in " Free Wi-Fi ? Get Ready for GoogleNet " :
What if Google wanted to give Wi-Fi access to everyone in America ?
And what if it had technology capable of targeting advertising to a user 's precise location ?
The gatekeeper of the world 's information could become one of the globe 's biggest Internet providers and one of its most powerful ad sellers , basically supplanting telecoms in one fell swoop .
Sounds crazy , but how might Google go about it ?
First it would build a national broadband network -- let 's call it the GoogleNet - - massive enough to rival even the country 's biggest Internet service providers .
Business 2.0 has learned from telecom insiders that Google is already building such a network , though ostensibly for many reasons .
For the past year , it has quietly been shopping for miles and miles of " dark " , or unused , fiber - optic cable across the country from wholesalers such as New York 's AboveNet .
It 's also acquiring superfast connections from Cogent Communications and WilTel , among others , between East Coast cities including Atlanta , Miami , and New York .
Such large - scale purchases are unprecedented for an Internet company , but Google 's timing is impeccable .
The rash of telecom bankruptcies has freed up a ton of bargain - priced capacity , which Google needs as it prepares to unleash a flood of new , bandwidth - hungry applications .
These offerings could include everything from a digital - video database to on - demand television programming .
One contact in a Position to Know tells me that Google 's purpose is n't bypass , but advertising .
That 's their revenue model , and if you follow the money -- as well as the company 's development and acquisition vectors -- you get to a place where highly targeted advertising pays for everything .
Should this be a problem ?
There are damn few large companies taking the Net 's side here .
If Google gets to be a major carrier as well as the major search engine and advertising pump it is today , that sure as hell beats the alternatives .
Especially when Google is fighting the incumbents on the battlefield we call Congress .
For example , there 's an Internet regulation bill working its way through the House of Representatives right now as part of a broad effort to replace the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 , which pretty much everybody agrees is in woeful need of an upgrade .
Naturally , lawmakers and the lobbyists who employ them want more laws , more regulation , more favoritism .
So , Brett Glass points out , " like earlier versions , it subjects all ISPs and VoIP providers to intensive Federal regulation and requires them to register before providing service .
It also preempts state and local control over rights of way " .
Google is n't merely against bills like this , it 's opposing them publicly .
Vint Cerf , Google 's Chief Internet Evangelist , sent an open letter this past Wednesday to the Energy and Commerce Committee , speaking out against this bill and others like it .
The key paragraphs :
The remarkable social impact and economic success of the Internet is in many ways directly attributable to the architectural characteristics that were part of its design .
The Internet was designed with no gatekeepers over new content or services .
The Internet is based on a layered , end - to - end model that allows people at each level of the network to innovate free of any central control .
By placing intelligence at the edges rather than control in the middle of the network , the Internet has created a platform for innovation .
This has led to an explosion of offerings -- from VOIP to 802.11 x wi- fi to blogging -- that might never have evolved had central control of the network been required by design .
My fear is that , as written , this bill would do great damage to the Internet as we know it .
Enshrining a rule that broadly permits network operators to discriminate in favor of certain kinds of services and to potentially interfere with others would place broadband operators in control of online activity .
Allowing broadband providers to segment their IP offerings and reserve huge amounts of bandwidth for their own services will not give consumers the broadband Internet our country and economy need .
Many people will have little or no choice among broadband operators for the foreseeable future , implying that such operators will have the power to exercise a great deal of control over any applications placed on the network .
As we move to a broadband environment and eliminate century - old non- discrimination requirements , a lightweight but enforceable neutrality rule is needed to ensure that the Internet continues to thrive .
Telephone companies cannot tell consumers who they can call ; network operators should not dictate what people can do online .
I am confident that we can build a broadband system that allows users to decide what websites they want to see and what applications they want to use -- and that also guarantees high quality service and network security .
That network model has and can continue to provide economic benefits to innovators and consumers -- and to the broadband operators who will reap the rewards for providing access to such a valued network .
We appreciate the efforts in your current draft to create at least a starting point for net neutrality principles .
Google looks forward to working with you and your staff to draft a bill that will maintain the revolutionary potential of the broadband Internet .
Significantly , Vint Cerf , often called " The father of the Net " , is the prime author of TCP / IP , the core protocol suite that the Net itself employs .
Bills such as this one travel through a pro-market Congress on the strength of " deregulation " claims by carriers , which are made on television as well as in the halls of Congressional office buildings .
As Lauren Weinstein reports : the telephone companies ' alliance has again been flooding the airwaves with " unleash the phone companies " advertising .
These follow their usual line :
We see happy consumers using futuristic communications devices and services and are told that our telecom laws are only slightly more recent than the invention of plumbing .
Allow for true market - based competition without all of those inconvenient regulations , the commercials say , and it'll truly be a wonderful world indeed !
And there 's not a phone bill in sight !
Of course , the carriers are plainly anti-market and have been for the duration .
Such is the nature of corporate species that have thrived exclusively in a highly controlled regulatory environment .
Regulatory habitats are by nature anti-market as well , regardless of the pro-market leanings of their top officials .
This is why regulatory reform itself is inherently nutty .
This point was made expertly last Wednesday by Susan Crawford : I want to persuade us that all of this talk about convergence over the last few years is not true .
Stepping away from interpretation of the 1996
Act itself , it seems to me that telephone services are fundamentally different from the internet , and the notion of carrying particular social policies over from the telephone world to the internet ( without taking into account what the internet is ) is already proving to be hopelessly wrongheaded , needlessly expensive , and shortsighted .
The question assumes that we need " an effective framework to govern the internet . "
There 's a lot of law that already applies online , and I have not seen a demonstration that more new law is needed -- and , in any event , it 's not the FCC that is in the best position to do it .
If we 're going to depart from the central Section 230 notion that the online world is unfettered by special - purpose federal or state laws , that should be a conscious choice .
Right now , it 's all ad hoc , backwards looking , and unprincipled .
And destructive .
E911 and CALEA certainly fit this description , and I have a feeling that universal service will too when it erupts from the Commission .
We need a sustained national conversation about all this -- maybe we 'll end up with this same approach , but I 'd like to think not .
Why can't we be both more hopeful and emphatic -- take the lead , around the world -- about the approach to the internet that we want ?...
What happened to our leadership on internet policy ?
When did we lose the ability to walk and slide back into the sea ?
We experimented and tugged and pulled and came up with the idea of linking machines together with a common language , making it possible for humans to interact in unprecedented ways .
Now we 're turning those machines back into the machines we thought we were escaping -- telephones , cable systems , and televisions - - using insiders ' language so that we can hide what 's going on from the general public .
What happened ?
Glad you asked , Susan .
I have the answer .
" A big thing I really like about the game is the queuing of tasks .
Pizza Frenzy was bad for that , as you 'd have click everything really fast , I 'm sure causing serious injury to my hand , though it 's true Pizza Frenzy would n't work with queuing .
Very nice . "

CNN , July 30 , 1996
Sen . Orrin Hatch , R - Utah , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , emerged from the meeting and said , " These are very controversial provisions that the [ Clinton ]
White House wants .
Some they 're not going to get . " ....[ Hatch ] also said he had some problems with the president 's proposals to expand wiretapping .
President Clinton urged Congress Tuesday to act swiftly in developing anti-terrorism legislation before its August recess .
" We need to keep this country together right now .
We need to focus on this terrorism issue , " Clinton said during a White House news conference .
But while the president pushed for quick legislation , Republican lawmakers hardened their stance against some of the proposed anti-terrorism measures .
So Bill Clinton , rather than just breaking the law as Bush did ( then again , perhaps this is why Bush broke the law - he knew from history that the Republicans controlling the congress would oppose his efforts to expand wiretapping ) , decided to go to the Republican congress in 1996 and ask them for increased authority to do more eavesdropping in order to stop the terrorists - stop September 11 .
Senior Republican Senator Orrin Hatch , one of the GOP 's top picks for the Supreme Court and a GOP committee chair , objected .
The Republicans stopped President Clinton from getting all the tools he needed to stop the next September 11 - well , no , actually they opposed giving President Clinton all the tools he needed to stop the actual September 11 .
Could September 11 have been stopped if the GOP had given President Clinton the tools he requested to stop Osama and Mohammad Atta from killing 3,000 people in New York , Pennsylvania and Washington ?
Maybe we need to ask the Republicans up for re-election why they wanted to appease the terrorists ?
There 's even an audio clip of President Clinton practically begging the Republicans to give him the tools he needed to stop Osama and the terrorists .
Trent Lott said no .
Orrin Hatch said no .
Do these men really deserve to run the Congress during a time of war ?
Our editors have compiled a list of five high - tech credit cards / credit card - sized devices you can’t apply for or buy .
If we happened to miss any , please leave us a comment .
“ Continue reading ” for the list .
AIO Credit Card Computer
Imagine being able to store a fully functional computer inside a thin plastic credit card .
This technology may not be too far off according to Chandanlong .
Be assured that it will come loaded with features like Bluetooth , GPS Receiver , Windows XP ( Vista ? ) , and have buit - in Wi-Fi despite its size .
AIO card is a thin client .
It is like a remote display on a card over wireless .
It means all its processing , and storage remains on a powerful server .
It uses the same thin client technology found in Sun Rays .
It only needs a small processor that does nothing but send the touch and other inputs to a server , and the server sends the display and sound back .
Since all the storage is on a server , it gives you virtually unlimited storage for your data , pictures and songs .
( unlikes iPods and mp3 players which have a limited memory )

Multifunctional Credit Card
Measuring 54 ×85,6 mm , this device boasts a video phone , built - in program that displays discounts , remote control for any device , GPS system , and even a gaming device with network support .
It uses biometric fingerprint technology to authorize users before performing any secure actions like payment , opening of a car door , etc. [ Source ]
Money Clip Credit Card
Roger Arquer has come up with a new concept that combines a credit card and money clip into one simple design .
The Visa Money Clip “ allows you to carry around your plastic and a wad of cash without any extra bulk at all . ” [ Source ]
Credit Card with Embedded Flexible Display
SiPix has partnered with SmartDisplayer to develop the world ’s “ first flexible display panel to be embedded into an ISO - compliant payment card . ”
The revolutionary One Time Password ( OTP ) Display Card enables cardholders to generate and display a dynamic passcode for one - time use … the cardholder obtains a new , unique number by pressing a button on the card

AMEX Butterfly Card
At first glance , this looks like your standard AMEX gold card , but what sets this one apart is that it actually folds in half and can be stored inside a “ svelte ” metallic case .
You can even leave the magnetic stripe side of the card sticking out so that it can be easily swiped without having to completely remove the card from the case .
The letter " X " soon may be banned in Saudi Arabia because it resembles the mother of all banned religious symbols in the oil kingdom : the cross .
The new development came with the issuing of another mind - bending fatwa , or religious edict , by the infamous Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice  the group of senior Islamic clergy that reigns supreme on all legal , civil , and governance matters in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia .
The commission 's damning of the letter " X " came in response to a Ministry of Trade query about whether it should grant trademark protection to a Saudi businessman for a new service carrying the English name " Explorer . "
" No ! Nein ! Nyet ! " was the commission 's categorical answer .
Why ?
Well , never mind that none of the so - called scholars manning the upper ranks of the religious outfit can speak or read a word of English .
But their experts who examined the English word " explorer " were struck by how suspicious that " X " appeared .
In a kingdom where Friday preachers routinely refer to Christians as pigs and infidel crusaders , even a twisted cross ranks as an abomination .
So after waiting a year , the Saudi businessman , Amru Mohammad Faisal , got his answer : No .
But , like so many other Saudi businessmen who suffer from the travesties of the commission , he seemed more baffled than angry .
He wrote letters to Saudi newspapers to criticize the cockamamie logic .
An article he wrote appeared with his photograph on some Arabian Web sites .
It sarcastically invited the commission to expand its edict to the " plus " sign in mathematics and accounting , in order " to prevent filthy Christian conspiracies from infiltrating our thoughts , our beliefs , and our feelings . "
This would have been funny had it not been so sinister .
The Saudi commission has shaped life and death : declared jihad against Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan , banished women from public life , and forced piety at the tip of the whip and the sword .
Its edicts have hindered business , education , travel , women 's rights , and life itself , creating a fertile ground for terrorism and producing the 15 Saudis who participated in the September 11 , 2001 , attacks  and many others like them .
Among the commission 's deeds is the famed 1974 fatwa  issued by its blind leader at the time , Sheik Abdul Aziz Ben Baz  which declared that the Earth was flat and immobile .
In a book issued by the Islamic University of Medina , the sheik argued : " If the earth is rotating , as they claim , the countries , the mountains , the trees , the rivers , and the oceans will have no bottom . "
Another bright light of the commission , Sheik Abdel - Aziz al - Sheikh , recently stopped a government reform proposal aimed at creating work for women by allowing them to replace male sales clerks in women 's clothing stores .
Sheik al - Sheikh damned the idea , saying it was a step " towards immorality and hellfire . "
The underlying logic is breathtaking : Women are more protected by buying their knickers from men !
Over the years , the commission has rendered Saudi Arabia a true kingdom of darkness .
Movie theaters are banned , as are sculptures , paintings , and music , and the mixing of sexes in public .
The commission really has it in for women .
They must don the all - enveloping veil , or niqab , in public ; they cannot drive themselves nor ride anywhere without a male guardian , and they cannot travel alone domestically or abroad .
The commission also excels at banning the construction of houses of worship  other than mosques  even though the majority of the 8 million expatriates working in the kingdom come from Christian , Hindu , and Buddhist faiths .
Indeed , celebrating a private Sunday Mass inside a home could lead to jail , public lashings , and expulsion .
One of the most criminal travesties committed by the commission 's foot soldiers , the Mutawaeen , or religious police , was dramatically reported by the muzzled Saudi press itself on Friday , March 15 , 2002 , when the Mutawaeen forcibly prevented girls fleeing a burning school from leaving the building because they were " improperly dressed . "
The day after , the Saudi Gazette newspaper quoted witnesses as saying the police stopped men who tried to help the girls , warning the men : " It is sinful to approach them . "
Of the 800 teenage pupils in Mecca , 15 burned to death and more than 50 were injured .
Yet , the commission and its royal enablers thrive .

JONESBORO , Ark. --
Arkansas State 's leading returning scorer is sitting out because he refuses to wear adidas shoes , which Indians players are obligated to wear because of a school contract .
Jerry Nichols , a 6 - 6 outside shooter who averaged 9.6 points per game last year , has had two knee operations and said he was wearing adidas shoes when he first hurt the knee .
The school says Nichols has to dress by its rules .
" We have a contractual agreement with [ adidas ] , and it 's not
any different than any number of other contracts with other
schools .
There is not any stipulation or any research that shows
any shoes are worse than any others , " Arkansas State athletic
director Dean Lee told The Jonesboro Sun newspaper .
Nichols , who last year shot 41.8 percent from 3 - point range , practiced over the weekend while wearing Nike shoes , placing tape to cover the brand 's insignia .
Nichols met with Lee on Monday , and
Nichols was told to wear adidas shoes or sit .
Nichols sat .
" We 've been producing outstanding quality equipment for years , " said Terrell Clark , an adidas spokesman .
" We take this very seriously and we are looking to handle this in a positive manner . "
Nichols said he was wearing adidas shoes when he suffered a knee
injury in 2001 while playing for Walters State Community College .
" I tore my ACL in adidas in junior college back in 2001 , and
I 'm not comfortable wearing adidas , " Nichols said .
Nichols has had two surgeries on his right knee , including one
in late March following last season .
ASU 's basketball team wore
Nike shoes last year but that contract has expired .
" Adidas shoes are part of our uniform , " Lee said .
Lee said there is no room for compromise and that the school is
obligated to put adidas shoes on the feet of athletes football ,
men 's and women 's basketball , baseball and track teams , along with
several other sports .
" This is not picking on any one student athlete .
This goes for
all student athletes that are under that contract , " Lee said .
Nichols said he may seek relief in court if the university does
not change policy .
" If I have to miss this whole senior season for some shoes , why
would n't I [ sue ] ? "
Nichols said .
" I have done too much this
summer , working out , staying up here all summer to waste a year .
So if it has to come to a legal issue then I will . "
ASU coach Dickey Nutt said he wants Nichols on the court ,
considering the team has its first exhibition in less than three
weeks .
" I need all my players to be at practice , but it 's out of my
hands .
That matter is in the administration 's hands , so I 'm just
referring all questions to them , " Nutt said .
The big disconnect on New Orleans
The official version ; then there 's the in - the - trenches version
NEW ORLEANS , Louisiana ( CNN ) --
Diverging views of a crumbling New Orleans emerged Thursday , with statements by some federal officials in contradiction with grittier , more desperate views from the streets .
By late Friday response to those stranded in the city was more visible .
But the conflicting views on Thursday came within hours , sometimes minutes of each of each other , as reflected in CNN 's transcripts .
The speakers include Michael Brown , chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency , Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff , New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin , evacuee Raymond Cooper , CNN correspondents and others .
Here 's what they had to say :
Conditions in the Convention Center
FEMA chief Brown :
We learned about that ( Thursday ) , so I have directed that we have all available resources to get that convention center to make sure that they have the food and water and medical care that they need .
( See video of Brown explaining how news reports alerted FEMA to convention center chaos .
-- 2:11 )
Mayor Nagin :
The convention center is unsanitary and unsafe , and we are running out of supplies for the 15,000 to 20,000 people .
( Hear Nagin 's angry demand for soldiers .
1:04 )
CNN Producer Kim Segal :
It was chaos .
There was nobody there , nobody in charge .
And there was nobody giving even water .
The children , you should see them , they 're all just in tears .
There are sick people .
We saw ... people who are dying in front of you .
Evacuee Raymond Cooper : Sir , you 've got about 3,000 people here in this -- in the Convention Center right now .
They 're hungry .
Do n't have any food .
We were told two - and - a - half days ago to make our way to the Superdome or the Convention Center by our mayor .
And which when we got here , was no one to tell us what to do , no one to direct us , no authority figure .
Uncollected corpses
Brown :
That 's not been reported to me , so I 'm not going to comment .
Until I actually get a report from my teams that say , " We have bodies located here or there , " I 'm just not going to speculate .
Segal :
We saw one body .
A person is in a wheelchair and someone had pushed ( her ) off to the side and draped just like a blanket over this person in the wheelchair .
And then there is another body next to that .
There were others they were willing to show us .
( See CNN report , ' People are dying in front of us ' -- 4:36 )
Evacuee Cooper :
They had a couple of policemen out here , sir , about six or seven policemen told me directly , when I went to tell them , hey , man , you got bodies in there .
You got two old ladies that just passed , just had died , people dragging the bodies into little corners .
One guy -- that 's how I found out .
The guy had actually , hey , man , anybody sleeping over here ?
I 'm like , no .
He dragged two bodies in there .
Now you just -- I just found out there was a lady and an old man , the lady went to nudge him .
He 's dead .
Hospital evacuations
Brown : I 've just learned today that we ... are in the process of completing the evacuations of the hospitals , that those are going very well .
CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta :
It 's gruesome .
I guess that is the best word for it .
If you think about a hospital , for example , the morgue is in the basement , and the basement is completely flooded .
So you can just imagine the scene down there .
But when patients die in the hospital , there is no place to put them , so they 're in the stairwells .
It is one of the most unbelievable situations I 've seen as a doctor , certainly as a journalist as well .
There is no electricity .
There is no water .
There 's over 200 patients still here remaining .
... We found our way in through a chopper and had to land at a landing strip and then take a boat .
And it is exactly ... where the boat was traveling where the snipers opened fire yesterday , halting all the evacuations .
( Watch the video report of corpses stacked in stairwells -- 4:45 )
Dr. Matthew Bellew , Charity Hospital :
We still have 200 patients in this hospital , many of them needing care that they just can't get .
The conditions are such that it 's very dangerous for the patients .
Just about all the patients in our services had fevers .
Our toilets are overflowing .
They are filled with stool and urine .
And the smell , if you can imagine , is so bad , you know , many of us had gagging and some people even threw up .
It 's pretty rough .
( Mayor 's video : Armed addicts fighting for a fix -- 1:03 )
Violence and civil unrest
Brown : I 've had no reports of unrest , if the connotation of the word unrest means that people are beginning to riot , or you know , they 're banging on walls and screaming and hollering or burning tires or whatever .
I 've had no reports of that .
CNN 's Chris Lawrence : From here and from talking to the police officers , they 're losing control of the city .
We 're now standing on the roof of one of the police stations .
The police officers came by and told us in very , very strong terms it was n't safe to be out on the street .
( Watch the video report on explosions and gunfire -- 2:12 )
The federal response :
Brown : Considering the dire circumstances that we have in New Orleans , virtually a city that has been destroyed , things are going relatively well .
Homeland Security Director Chertoff : Now , of course , a critical element of what we 're doing is the process of evacuation and securing New Orleans and other areas that are afflicted .
And here the Department of Defense has performed magnificently , as has the National Guard , in bringing enormous resources and capabilities to bear in the areas that are suffering .
Crowd chanting outside the Convention Center :
We want help .
Nagin :
They do n't have a clue what 's going on down there .
Phyllis Petrich , a tourist stranded at the Ritz - Carlton :
They are invisible .
We have no idea where they are .
We hear bits and pieces that the National Guard is around , but where ?
We have not seen them .
We have not seen FEMA officials .
We have seen no one .
Security
Brown : I actually think the security is pretty darn good .
There 's some really bad people out there that are causing some problems , and it seems to me that every time a bad person wants to scream of cause a problem , there 's somebody there with a camera to stick it in their face .
( See Jack Cafferty 's rant on the government 's ' bungled ' response -- 0:57 )
Chertoff :
In addition to local law enforcement , we have 2,800 National Guard in New Orleans as we speak today .
One thousand four hundred additional National Guard military police trained soldiers will be arriving every day : 1,400 today , 1,400 tomorrow and 1,400 the next day .
Nagin : I continue to hear that troops are on the way , but we are still protecting the city with only 1,500 New Orleans police officers , an additional 300 law enforcement personnel , 250 National Guard troops , and other military personnel who are primarily focused on evacuation .
Lawrence :
The police are very , very tense right now .
They 're literally riding around , full assault weapons , full tactical gear , in pickup trucks .
Five , six , seven , eight officers .
It is a very tense situation here .
“ There ’s obviously an advantage to having all three branches involved , ” said a senior Justice Department official , who briefed reporters on the decision on condition of anonymity .
“ This issue of the terrorist surveillance program is one that has been under intense public debate and scrutiny on the Hill , and just considering all these circumstances , the president determined that this is the appropriate course . ”
President Bush has authorized the continuation of the N.S.A. program every 45 days by executive order to allow the N.S.A. to conduct wiretaps on international communications without a court warrant .
When the current order expires , however , President Bush has decided not to reauthorize the program , officials said .
The Justice Department said Wednesday that it had obtained multiple orders , or warrants , a week ago from the FISA court allowing it to monitor international communications in cases where there was probable cause to believe one of the participants was linked to Al Qaeda or an affiliated terrorist group .
“ As a result of these orders , ” Mr. Gonzales told leaders of Congressional Intelligence and Judiciary Committees in a letter dated Wednesday , “ any electronic surveillance that was occurring as part of the Terrorist Surveillance Program will now be conducted subject to the approval of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court . ”
Justice Department officials said that the FISA court orders , which were not made public , were not a broad approval of the surveillance program as a whole , an idea that was proposed last year in Congressional debate over the program .
They strongly suggested that the orders secured from the court were for individual targets , but they refused to provide details of the process used to identify targets — or how court approval had been expedited — because they said it remained classified .
The senior Justice Department official said that discussing “ the mechanics of the orders ” could compromise intelligence activities .

Justice Department officials would not describe whether the court had agreed to new procedures to streamline the process of issuing orders or accepted new standards to make it easier for the government to get approval to monitor suspect e-mail and phone communications .

We 're constantly bombarded with images of shrinking A - list stars , but what 's the reality of being a size zero , a UK size four ?
With a 22 - inch waist the shape is striking - as are the health implications .
But how would you look ?
We manipulated the pictures of four ordinary women and STEPHANIE CLARKSON asked them - and their friends and boyfriends - how they thought they looked :
Name : MARIE - LOUISE DOE
Job : Shop assistant
Lives : Worcestershire
Size : Size 8
Height : 5ft 5in , Weight : 7st 7lb
Bust : 32B , Waist : 24.5in
Hips : 32in , Thighs : 19in
' Although I 'm slim , these photos show a world of difference between my current size and the infamous size zero .
I look healthy and slim in the first photo but I 'm horrified by the second one .
Why would anyone want to look like this ?
The way my ribs and collarbones jut out make me look ill - I hate it .'
Boyfriend Russell Collins says :
' In the past I 've teased Marie - Louise about being skinny , but having seen what " too thin " really looks like , I 'll lay off her .
If she lost that amount of weight I 'd have huge reservations about her sanity . '
Best friend Laura Collings says :
' I got such a shock when I saw the photo of Marie - Louise as a size zero .
Those scrawny thighs made me feel sick . '
Name : CHRISTIE LEWIS
Job : Physiotherapist
Lives : Cheshire
Size : 10
Height : 5ft 8in , Weight : 9st 4lbs
Bust : 34B , Waist : 27in
Hips : 35 in , Thighs : 21in
' Looking at the size zero picture , I think my face looks prettier and more sculpted .
But I 'd never want to be this thin - my chest looks completely emaciated .
But the more I flick between the two photos , the more I lose sight of what looks normal .
It really makes me appreciate the power of the image . '
Boyfriend Edd Arterton says :
' I think Christie looks dreadful as a size zero - her body is totally unfeminine .
I 'd never be attracted to her if she dieted to get this thin - she looks like an ironing board !'
Mum Sue Lewis says :
' I could n't find anything to like about the ' thin ' Christie .
She looks scrawny , disproportionate and anorexic - it 's horrible . '
Name : CASSANDRA HALL
Job : Royal Navy steward
Lives : Plymouth
Size : 12
Height : 5ft 6in , Weight : 9st 11lb
Bust : 34C , Waist : 30in
Hips : 34in , Thighs : 20in
' I'm an English pear shape and do n't like my legs and bum .
So , my first thought when I saw the size zero photo was : " If only I had those thighs . "
' They 're slender and do n't meet .
But it would also mean trading in my cleavage , which I love .
In the second photo , my chest looks awful , and I hate the twiggy arms . '
Husband Paul
Hall says :
' We got married recently and Cass tried to lose weight before , but if she 'd turned up looking like this waif , I 'd have keeled over at the altar . '
Friend Carly Robinson says :
' It was upsetting to hear Cass preferred her size zero thighs .
It look like there 's something wrong with the thin girl . '

' I 'm not happy with my current shape - I need to lose weight .
I do n't like either version of me but I prefer the torso of my size zero body - the way the smaller boobs fit into the bra rather than spill out of the sides as they do in real life .
' But I do n't like the way my body is just straight up and down in the picture .
' This has shown me that I need to work harder at the gym .
I may be fit but I 'm not my ideal weight . '
Mum Angie Riley says :
' Gemma has put on weight over the last couple of years and I do n't think it suits her .
But I do n't like her as a size zero - she needs to find a middle ground . '
Best friend Alison Quarnby says :
' I think Gemma looks OK as a size zero , except for the scrawny limbs .
If I 'm honest Gemma is slightly overweight , but the " real " photo shows she has curves in the right places . '

' I was always plump until I became bulimic aged 17 and lost four stone in eight months .
Although I 've recovered , my friends and family warned that doing this might cause me to relapse , but it 's achieved the opposite .
' As a size zero my arms look undernourished and my face looks sharp and mean - like my personality has been sucked out .
' It scares me that I was once killing myself to look like this - it 's served as a warning to stay on track . '
Fiance Kirk Bilby says :
' The thin version does n't even look like Beth - and I definitely could n't fancy anyone that bony .
' I hope she 's finally realised that , in her case , big is beautiful . '
Best friend Helen Whitehead says :
' In the first picture Beth looks beautiful and confident .
The second looks like a total stranger - and one who 's a complete bore . '
There may or may not be a Web 2.0 crash coming , as Steve Rubel has predicted , but there ’s certainly blood in the water , with Yahoo ’s earnings miss , Gather.com ’s bad reviews , the demise of SearchFox , and the gathering buzz about an impending crash .
Steve thinks a key factor is that “ online advertising is n’t growing as fast as we would all like to think or hope ” — online advertising is still on a steep upward curve , but Steve ’s probably right that there ’s not enough to go around , and the market will have to get rid of the Web 2.0 chafe .
I think another big problem is that Web 2.0 is driving Media 2.0 ( or “ New Media , ” the other term I ’ve been using ) .
I ’ve argued that if Media 2.0 / New Media is based on Web 2.0 applications , it ’s going to overwhelm the average person .
Web 2.0 is a great platform for building applications that make everyday tasks easier , e.g. Google ( search ) , eBay ( sell / buy ) , Amazon reviews / recommendations ( shop ) , and Flickr ( organize / share photos ) —
I think Flickr is the poster child for successful Web 2.0 applications .
** Here ’s the problem — Web 2.0 is not a great platform for helping the average person consume media . **
Consumer - created media is transforming the content landscape for the better , and consumer - controlled media is undoubtedly the new paradigm .
But the average person does not have much time ( if any ) to spend creating media and has patience for only a finite amount of choice .
Bloggers and others who put a lot of time and effort into media consumption and media creation are outliers — people may want something more customized than the morning paper , but they still want the simplicity and leisure feel .
Media based on Web 2.0 is just too hard .
Mitch Shapiro , over at IP & Democracy , understands the problem and has an interesting meditation on Memeorandum , in which he acknowledges that next generation of functionality ( e.g. highly - customized RSS feeds ) still “ would nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t reach the ‘ ease of use ’ levels provided by Media 1.0 publishers . ”
Static media is on its way out , but “ ease of use ” remains the currency .
That ’s why I ’m not jumping on the Newsvine bandwagon .
I think it ’s a great application for bloggers and other cybergeeks , but it ’s WAY too much work for the average person .
So is Digg , and so is del.icio.us — most people do n’t have time to do a lot of voting , tagging , saving , and commenting — there ’s already too much filing and sorting to do at work and with the monthly bills .
For the average person , media consumption consists of reading or viewing and then moving on to something else .
As happened with Wikipedia , a hardcore group of users may turn Newsvine into a successful site , but most people will just browse — they wo n’t participate .
And a lot of people will be bewildered and turned off .
Contrast these Web.20 media sites , which make the task at hand ( media consumption ) more difficult , with Flickr , which makes the task at hand ( organizing / sharing pictures ) easier .
Here are some numbers to consider .
First , compare the traffic curves for Flikr and Digg :
I would argue the difference here is that Flickr has broken through into the mainstream , while Digg is limited to the “ technorati ” ( to borrow an elitist term ) .
Compare Flickr to de.lici.us and you see the same thing :
No doubt I will get lectured on technology adoption rates , but before you lecture , think about whether your own experience with technology represents that of the average person — I use the term “ average person ” on purpose , because I think the media habits of those in the blogosphere ( which pretty much overlaps with power users of Web 2.0 ) are not representative of mainstream media consumers .
For bloggers and other people with the drive to create their own media , Web 2.0 media applications give them the infinite control they crave .
But for the average person , what pressing problem does Newsvine , Digg , or de.licious solve ?
( Do n’t get me started on RSS — I ’ll put on my body armor and do that in another article . )
What the average person needs from New Media is not infinite choice and infinite control , but rather a user - friendly way to get their arms around — and find the value in — the avalanche of new content being created .
They need more than aggregation — they need filtering , and even more , they need synthesis .
In another article , I ’ll go into the difference between synthesis and aggregation .
For now , I ’ll end with an observation about MySpace .
Here are the traffic curves for MySpace and Flickr :
I ’ll ask the same question — what problem does MySpace solve ?
It ’s not about media consumption , and it ’s not even about content creation — it ’s about what young people in particular want to do most — socialize .
MySpace makes it easier to hang out and be seen .
It makes it easy to create your own space — something that is difficult for teenagers , indie bands , etc .
The New Media revolution will happen when someone figures out a way to solve the problem that the average person has with media , the same way that Google , MySpace , and eBay solved problems for average people — which means we need to start with understanding the average person ’s problem , not with the techno - geek ’s solution .
Associated Press reports on Coulter plagiarism allegations as syndicator probes charges Ron Brynaert
Published : Saturday July 8 , 2006 Print This | Email
This " The syndicator of Ann Coulter 's newspaper column is looking into allegations that the right - wing pundit has lifted material from other sources , " reports Hillel Italie for the Associated Press .
Aside from two reports in the New York Post , this is the first major media article to note the allegations and report that Coulter 's syndicator is conducting a probe .
The A.P. also gave credit to the Websites that first reported on Coulter 's possible plagiarism .
" The New York Post and the Web sites Raw Story and the Rude Pundit have raised numerous questions about Coulter 's columns , and her best - selling ' Godless , ' " writes Italie .
A few months ago , the Associated Press based an article on a RAW STORY report but refused to credit the source .
John Barrie , a plagiarism expert who devised an " iThenticate " plagiarism - probing system , said that Coulter had likely plagiarized in her book and some of her syndicated columns in an article in last Sunday 's New York Post .
Some of the examples cited by Barrie and the Post were first discovered online nearly a year ago .
The Rude Pundit first blogged about the apparent plagiarism in a June 2005 column by Coulter last summer , and RAW STORY followed up on the blogger 's work , revealing that the column was little more that a cut- and - paste repetition of points authored by conservative religious groups in the early 1990s .
One of the three examples of " textbook plagiarism " in Godless cited by Barrie was also noted first by The Rude Pundit last month days after the book 's release .
RAW STORY then reported that Coulter " cribbed " a list of adult stem cell treatments from a Right To Life website for the seventh chapter of her book nearly word - for - word .
On Thursday , the spokesman for Universal Press Syndicate , the company that distributes Coulters column to over 100 newspapers , released a statement to Editor & Publisher indicating that theyd be looking into the plagiarism allegations , which TPM Muckraker brought to their attention a few days ago .
After receiving scant attention by the press since the allegations first surfaced last summer , the " confirmation " by plagiarism expert Barrie seems to be fueling the story further .
" Barrie , whose analysis of Coulter 's work was first reported by the New York Post on Sunday , has recently been contacted by the Today Show and Good Morning America , he told me , " writes Justin Rood for TPM Muckraker .
" In addition , AP , the New York Times and others have called him for stories they 're working on , and the New York Post is planning a follow - up piece , he said . "
In a statement released to Media Matters , a senior vice president for the company that published Coulter 's Godless characterizes previous plagiarism allegations as " trivial , " " meritless " and " irresponsible . "
" We have reviewed the allegations of plagiarism surrounding Godless and found them to be as trivial and meritless as they are irresponsible , " Crown Publishing Group 's Steve Ross wrote .
" Any author is entitled to do what Ann Coulter has done in the three snippets cited : research and report facts . "
" The number of words used by our author in these snippets is so minimal that there is no requirement for attribution , " added Ross .
" As an experienced author and attorney , Ms. Coulter knows when attribution is appropriate , as underscored by the nineteen pages of hundreds of endnotes contained in Godless . "
Coulter 's publisher only mentions " three snippets " but The Rude Pundit and RAW STORY found other examples which were reported on before the New York Post hired Barrie to check .
According to CNN correspondent Brian Todd , the Post investigated after reading about it online .
" Its editor in chief says the paper looked into it after seeing online rumors about alleged plagiarism by Ann Coulter , " said Todd .
TPMmuckraker compiled a list of all of the plagiarism allegations that have surfaced so far , and The Rude Pundit has a post that contains the dates each allegation surfaced .
' Godless ' examples found by Raw Story The seventh chapter of Godless : The Church of Liberalism is devoted to " the left 's war on science , " which - according to Coulter - includes lying about " the science that is working " so as " to elevate the science that has produced nothing . "
" In the August 24 , 2004 , New York Times , science writer Gina Kolata claimed that no one had succeeded in using adult stem cells ' to treat diseases , ' " writes Coulter .
To prove the Times science writer wrong , Coulter then provides a " short list " of sixteen " successful treatments achieved by adult stem cell research . "
But fifteen of Coulter 's examples ( listed at the end of this story ) are nearly identical to items in a longer list of seventeen compiled by the Illinois Right To Life website , that has been available since at least September of 2003 .
Illinois Right To Life : Spinal cord injury repair ( using stem cells from nasal and sinus regions )
Coulter : Repairing spinal cord injuries by using stem cells from nasal and sinus regions .
Illinois Right To Life : Complete reversal of juvenile diabetes in mice using adult spleen cells Coulter : Completely reversing Type 1 diabetes in mice using adult spleen cells Illinois Right To Life : Crohns Disease put into remission ( using patients blood stem cells ) Coulter : Putting Crohn 's disease into remission with the patient 's own blood stem cells Illinois Right To Life : Lupus put into remission ( using stem cells from patients bloodstream ) Coulter : Putting lupus into remission using stem cells from the patient 's bloodstream Illinois Right To Life : Repair heart muscle in cases of congestive heart failure ( using stem cells from bone marrow ) Coulter : Repairing the heart muscles in patients with congestive heart failure using adult stem cells from bone marrow .
Illinois Right To Life : Repair heart attack damage ( using the patients own blood stem cells ) Coulter : Repairing heart attack damage with the patients own blood stem cells Illinois Right To Life : Restore bone marrow in cancer patients ( using stem cells from umbilical cord blood )
Coulter : Restoring bone marrow in cancer patients using stem cells from umbilical cord blood .
Illinois Right To Life : Restore weak heart muscles ( using immature skeletal muscle cells ) Coulter : Restoring weak heart muscles using immature skeletal muscle cells Illinois Right To Life :
Put leukemia into remission ( using umbilical cord blood ) Coulter : Putting leukemia into remission using umbilical cord blood Illinois Right To Life : Heal bone fractures ( using bone marrow cells ) Coulter : Healing bone fractures with bone marrow cells .
Illinois Right To Life : Restore a blind mans sight ( using an ocular surface stem - cell transplant & a cornea transplant ) Coulter : Restoring sight in blind people using an ocular surface stem - cell transplant and a cornea transplant Illinois Right To Life :
Treat urinary incontinence ( using under arm muscle stem cells )
Coulter : Treating urinary incontinence using stem cells from underarm muscle Illinois Right To Life : Reverse severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) ( using genetically modified adult stem cells ) Coulter : Reversing severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) with genetically modified adult cells .
Illinois Right To Life : Restore blood circulation in legs ( using bone marrow stem cells ) Coulter : Restoring blood circulation in legs with bone marrow stem cells .
Illinois Right To Life : Treat sickle - cell anemia ( using stem cells from unbilical cord blood )
Coulter : Treating sickle - cell anemia using stem cells from umbilical cord blood .
( NOTE : RAW STORY has uncovered similiar examples from Coulter 's latest book and will be reporting on them shortly )
Worried about bodily decay ?
If you 're starting to notice the effects of beer , grease and couch - potatohood on your longevity potential , no need to wait around for human cloning .
Emaciated slum - dwellers the world over are eager to sell the body parts you need to maintain your gluttonous Western existence as long as humanly possible .
And thanks to the magic of warfare and endemic poverty , the cost to you can be less than treatment on a dialysis machine .
Sure , Turistas tells a morality tale of twisted Brazilian justice resulting from needs like yours , but hey — that 's just a dumb splatter flick .
Do n't let its terror and graphic violence sway you .
" What you can get is the cornea — and often the whole eyes are removed — you can get skin grafts , you can get heart valves that are used in various operations , you can get pituitary glands , whatever , " says Nancy Scheper - Hughes , a professor at the University of California , Berkeley , who studies the organ trade .
And that list only applies to corpses that are looted for organs in South Africa , Argentina and , most famously , China .
For other items , such as the much - coveted kidney , you 'll want to hook up with a live seller in Brazil , or even Iraq .
But the real heavyweight is that notorious cesspit of human organ - farming — India .
On January 5th , the Indian national paper The Hindu ran a cover story about the gruesome killing of young children for their kneecaps !
" [ T ] he bodies appeared to have been cut up by skilled hands .
The person who cut up the bodies may not necessarily be a doctor , but was skilled enough not to damage the vital parts , " Dr. Vinod Kumar was quoted as saying .
Nonetheless , do n't think your quest for fresh bits will be an easy one .
You 'll want to stay under the radar of American do - gooders such as Scheper - Hughes and her Berkeley compatriot Lawrence Cohen .
Staunch foes of the organ trade , they even try to put the kibosh on media reports they consider disrespectful .
Cohen once ordered a journalist not to " write one more groovy story about how gross India is .
" Unfortunately for Cohen , India really is gross .
The country became famous in the mid-90s for a vigorous organ trade patronized by wealthy Europeans , Middle Easterners and Asians .
In certain regions known as the " kidney belt , " poor villagers regularly sell that organ .
The Madras slum of Villivakkam is widely known as " Kidney - vakkam " due to the role organ sales play in the local economy .
India recently banned the organ trade , but that has n't kept an entrenched class of brokers from continuing their operations on the black market .
Visitors to Villivakkam can still see women with large , curving scars peeking out from under their sari tops .
Residents of the slum may not know how to read or write , but they 're savvy about blood types , tissue - matching factors and going rates .
Those rates are hard to pin down thanks to the black - market nature of such sales .
One estimate puts the profit at $ 10,000 - 20,000 , of which the broker takes a cut of about $ 6,000 .
Another puts the seller 's take at more like $ 1,000 .
One of the most common uses for the money is to fund that other emblem of Third - World backwardness , the dowry .
In many " kidney belt " villages , Cohen says , it 's common for girls to go under the knife in exchange for dowry money .
Still , it 's hard to peg the number of people selling organs .
The Voluntary Health Association of India estimates that more than 2,000 people in the country sell their organs each year , but that figure defines " sale " to mean " exchange for money . "
Countless other transactions are " soft barters , " with body parts being traded for some vaguely - defined reward .
" They are n't asking for a fixed fee , they 're asking , maybe , for help with getting a daughter married or help with buying a house or a down payment or some other form of exchange , " Scheper - Hughes says .
She encountered one case in which a woman donated a kidney to her wealthy uncle in exchange for a fancy suburban home .
So how is an out - of - towner supposed to hook up with a donor ?
The Internet might seem an obvious research source , but would - be online brokers — such as the individual who recently attempted to peddle his kidney on eBay — are quickly traced and shut down .
Instead , you 'll want to scan Brazilian newspapers for classified ads placed by people claiming they want to be of help .
" People say they 're willing to be anonymous donors and that they want to be helpful , " Scheper - Hughes says .
" That 's the language that 's used , but often what that really means is [ they want money ] .
Very few people who are poor really want to be anonymous donors .
"
In India , you can try a more direct route — simply visit a clinic and ask if the doctor knows anyone who can hook you up with a donor .
Throughout the '90s , journalists found that the most casual inquiries bore immediate fruit .
This method does n't work in Brazil , but you can at least rely on the transplanting surgeons not to ask too many questions about your donor .
Which is n't to say they wo n't wonder .
" I do n't want to know what kinds of private exchanges have taken place between my patients and their donors , " one Brazilian doctor told Scheper - Hughes .
" But obviously you do have to suspect something when the patient is a wealthy Rio socialite and her ' donor ' is a poor , barefoot ' cousin ' from the country . "

DIGG THIS
It ’s hard even to remember anymore the true state of the U.S. military as the Vietnam War ground toward its bloody end .
By the late 1960s , the statistics flowing back to Washington about the American war machine were enough to give any general nightmares .
Drug - taking was rampant .
( By 1971 , up to 60 % of returning soldiers admitted to some use . )
Desertions stood at seventy per thousand , a modern high ; small - scale mutinies or “ combat refusals ” were at critical levels ; incidents of racial conflict had soared ; and strife between officers ( “ lifers ” ) and soldiers ( “ grunts ” ) was at unprecedented levels ; reported “ fraggings ” — assassination attempts — against unpopular officers or NCOs had risen from an already startling 126 in 1969 to 333 in 1971 , despite declining troop strength in Vietnam .
According to military count , as many as 144 underground newspapers were then being published by , or aimed at , soldiers .
( “ In Vietnam , ” the Ft. Lewis - McChord Free Press typically wrote , “ the Lifers , the Brass , are the true Enemy , not the enemy . ” )
And the country was experiencing the largest political exodus of potential soldiers , AWOLs , and deserters since large numbers of Tories left the country two hundred years earlier , after the American Revolution .
In 1971 , Colonel Robert D. Heinl , Jr. reviewed the evidence for Armed Forces Journal in an article entitled “ The Collapse of the Armed Forces , ” and concluded : “ [ T ] he foregoing facts point to widespread conditions among American forces in Vietnam that have only been exceeded in this century by the French Army ’s Nivelle mutinies of 1917 and the collapse of the Tsarist armies [ of Russia ] in 1916 and 1917 . ”
Hardly less threatening to military cohesion at the time , active - duty soldiers in relatively small numbers as well as significant numbers of Vietnam veterans were by then beginning to organize against the war .
If you want part of the explanation for why the Vietnam War ended and all of the explanation for why the draft that once did result in a genuine citizen ’s army was abandoned for an all - volunteer military , look no further than this traumatic set of events .
And it ’s been true that , whatever the problems — and they ’ve been multifold — staffing an overstretched volunteer military to fight two increasingly unpopular wars without end in Iraq and Afghanistan , Vietnam - style unrest in the military has been slower to grow .
But there ’s nothing like a losing war in an alien land among an increasingly hostile populace to throw one ’s worst acts into strong relief .
So , despite the obstacles , small but growing numbers of American soldiers — like Lieut .
Ehren Watada , “ the Army ’s first commissioned officer to publicly refuse orders to fight in Iraq on grounds that the war is illegal ” — have stepped forward to challenge the Bush administration , its war - making , and the military .
Their often lonely acts of resistance reflect an extra degree of courage in comparison with the Vietnam era — and where it ’s been difficult for them military families as well as parents of the American dead in Iraq like Cindy Sheehan have heroically stepped into the void .
Former federal prosecutor , Elizabeth de la Vega , whose new book U.S. v. George W. Bush et al. will be published this December ( and highlighted at this site ) , considers one of these new military resisters in her own unique way .
If you want to look for “ profiles in courage ” in the age of Bush and Cheney , this is certainly a good place to start .

Move Over G.I. Joe and Han Solo : Sgt. Ricky Clousing , Peace Action Hero
By Elizabeth de la Vega
I look forward to the day when Mattel makes a Sgt. Ricky Clousing action figure .
As the mother of sons born eight years apart , I spent nearly half my adult life surrounded by — and stepping on — action figures .
They were everywhere : a phalanx of tiny knights in shining armor on the windowsill ; Batman and Robin frozen in an ice tray ; and GI Joe guys in camouflage among the hosta .
One Christmas , Luke Skywalker and Han Solo even ended up in the manger scene along with Jesus , Mary , and Joseph , two cows , three sheep , and several Ewoks .
My kids spent hours and hours in a fantasy world populated by villains and heroes of every description except one ; there were no peace heroes .
I met a peace hero at Camp Democracy in Washington , D.C. not too long ago : Sgt. Ricky Clousing .
He will not remember me , but I will not forget him .
On a brilliant , blessedly unhumid day , Ricky sat on a makeshift platform within shouting distance of the Lincoln Memorial and told a story that was simultaneously agonizing and inspiring to hear .
On September 11 , 2001 , Ricky was working in an orphanage and “ building some roads and stuff ” in Thailand .
When his stint as a volunteer ended , he made his way to Germany where he met American soldiers returning from Afghanistan .
Caught up in the wave of post - 9/11 patriotism , he decided he would join the Army rather than return to college in his native Seattle .
That way he could serve his country and have money for his education when he got out .
Two years later , having completed basic training and intensive language instruction at the Monterey Defense Language Institute , Sgt. Ricky Clousing found himself in Baghdad , an interrogator with the 82nd Airborne Division out of Ft. Bragg , North Carolina .
As a tactical interrogator assigned to question detainees at the scene of infantry raids , Ricky did not witness the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib .
What he did witness , however , was hardly less horrifying : American soldiers indoctrinated to view Iraqis as less than human , as “ ragheads ” or worse ; American soldiers out on the streets of the Iraqi capital ramming the cars of Iraqi civilians for sport ; American soldiers laughing as they slaughtered the livestock of local farmers ; and American soldiers shooting an Iraqi teenager who had simply made a wrong turn .
Ricky was on patrol when he saw a boy , “ probably 18 years old , a small maybe high - school age kid ” turn down a road his unit was attempting to secure .
The teenager , Ricky said , was quite visibly terrified at the sight of “ a whole bunch of Americans with big weapons ” staring him in the face .
He started turning the car around , but did n’t get very far .
This is how Ricky described what happened next :
“ One of the soldiers in the turret of the humvee behind me just opened up fire on the machine gun on the vehicle .
As the vehicle was turning away , all I heard above my head was “ pop , pop , pop , pop . ”
This was my first deployment , my first combat experience was that moment right then , and just the sound of machine guns going off over my head .
He popped about five or six rounds in the side of the vehicle .
Myself and two of the other guys ran over to the vehicle , smashed the window , and pulled the guy out to provide first aid on him …
I was looking down at this kid who had just been shot in the stomach for no reason really — he was trying to leave …
I was still just standing there in shock , looking down at this kid , and he looked right up at me .
And his mouth was foaming .
His stomach was falling out in his hands …
I was looking down at this kid , this young boy who was just trying to drive around town and took a wrong turn and tried to go the other direction , was shot at and killed , and I ’m looking down at him now .
And we made eye contact for about five seconds , and he just looked at me with the most empty , terrified look in his face that will never leave me in my whole life I ’m sure . ”
That Iraqi boy died on the way to the hospital .
I think the boy in Ricky Clousing died that day as well , but what an extraordinary man he has since become .
Deciding he would be haunted forever if he kept silent about such an egregious violation of the rules of engagement , Sgt. Clousing notified the unit ’s Platoon Sergeant , who did not “ take kindly ” to his advice .
Clousing continued to object to American war crimes for the rest of his time in Iraq , though no one ever took kindly to his objections .
When he returned to the U.S. , he talked to his commanding officers , to the chaplain , to mental health workers and anyone else who would listen to his problems with the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
He was told he could get out of the Army — if he said he was gay .
But he could n’t say that because he ’s not gay .
He was told to claim he had post - traumatic stress disorder , but he could n’t do that because he did n’t think he had PTSD .
He was told to file as a conscientious objector ; but he could n’t do that because he was n’t against all war .
He was told he could avoid going back to Iraq by taking an assignment in the United States .
He could n’t do that either because — and this is exactly what Ricky Clousing told us on that sunny afternoon in Washington :
“ I felt that my involvement in the army , whether it be directly or indirectly , whether in Iraq or training guys to go to Iraq , I was still that piece of machine in the system that was still allowing this war to take place and still supporting that .
My actions , whether or not they were on the front line or back safely at home , were still part of the body of the machine that ’s occupying [ Iraq ] .
So I ultimately felt that the only thing I could do was to leave , so I packed my stuff last June and I went AWOL . ”
On August 11 , 2006 , the day he turned himself in , Sgt. Clousing made a simple statement :
“ We have found ourselves in a pivotal era where we have traded humanity for patriotism .
Where we have traded our civil liberties for a sense of security .
I stand here before you sharing the same idea as Henry David Thoreau : as a soldier , as an American , and as a human being , we must n’t lend ourselves to that same evil which we condemn . ”
Ricky Clousing — now serving a three - month sentence in a military brig at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina — is not the only peace hero .
Others are making themselves known in growing numbers and you can read about them at the Courage to Resist website .
Although we have no way of assessing the numbers from here , I have no doubt that there are also soldiers trying to do the right thing in Iraq .
But when I read about a President who does n’t know the meaning of “ outrages upon human dignity ” because he so clearly does not consider the very people he claims to have liberated human ; when I read about a vice president who does not even have the courage to admit to the meaning of the words he uses ( “ dunk in the water , ” “ last throes “ ) ; when I read about a defense secretary who tells reporters to back off if the questions get too tough , then I think about Ricky Clousing .
Twenty - four years old , Clousing told the world in simple declarative sentences why he had to give up his college money , receive a dishonorable discharge , and go to jail to take a stand against the invasion and occupation of Iraq .
He ’d make a very cool action figure .
Come to think of it , Sgt. Ricky Clousing — tattooed arms , Laguna Beach t- shirt , and all — would make an awesome shepherd in that manger scene .
Han Solo and Luke Skywalker are just going to have to move over .

Carrying the beads did not slow the cells down
Harvard University experts say , in future , cells could be harnessed to perform micro-scale mechanical work .
The researchers attached a cargo of polystyrene beads to the backs of green algae cells and used light to guide them up and down the chambers .
Details of the work appear in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
We harness their motors to make them perform unconventional tasks
Douglas Weibel , Harvard University
" We have basically developed the system of moving objects with micro-organisms , " co-author Douglas Weibel , of Harvard University told the BBC News website .
" We harness their motors to make them perform unconventional tasks . "
The team have coined the term " microoxen " for the load - bearing microbes .
Nice motor
The Harvard researchers , led by Professor George Whitesides , used the single - celled photosynthetic algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii .
The algae are about 10 microns long and propel themselves by beating their two whip - like tails , or flagella , in an action similar to the breaststroke .
This action is driven by a type of molecular motor .
The researchers used chemical bonds to attach a cargo load of specially coated polystyrene beads to individual algal cells .
Then they used light of different intensities to guide them up and down the chamber .
High - intensity light repels the organisms while low - intensity light attracts them .
Load bearers
Attaching the cargoes seemed to have little or no effect on the speeds at which the cells moved .
The loads were unhitched by exposing the algae to ultraviolet light , which broke apart molecules in the coating on the beads .
Dr Weibel said the technique had many potential uses in areas such as molecular medicine .
" You could have a bead that picks up a toxin .
So you send them to swim off into a sample of liquid , and when they return , you can carry out analysis on the bead , " he said .
There is considerable interest in harnessing biological motors to perform micro-scale mechanical work .
However , most research in this area has focused on isolating the motors within cells and rebuilding them elsewhere , rather than using the living organism to perform the tasks required .
" It 's not something that can be run on autopilot , despite the use of computer models , " said Greg Carlson , an analyst at Morningstar , the mutual fund tracker .
" You have to have a research team that 's going to continue to look for new factors to add to the models because oftentimes the efficacy of a particular factor is either not recognized by the models or gets arbitraged away over time . "
Mr. Mortimer of Charles Schwab said human managers at the company halted purchases of Merck in 2004 during the Vioxx controversy even though their models were calling for purchases of the stock .
Merck 's shares declined roughly 25 percent from the beginning of the problems through the second quarter this year .
There is another possible drawback of quantitative funds : because of the high volume of buy and sell signals generated by the models , the funds have higher - than - average turnover ratios and are therefore not as tax - efficient as index funds .
This same factor also leads fund companies to limit the size of the funds .
Even though quant funds have performed well in recent years , Joel M. Dickson , head of Vanguard 's active quantitative equity group , said investors should be careful about jumping into such funds now .
" I'm a little concerned that investors may be chasing performance , " Mr. Dickson said .
The most recent three years have been very good for many quant funds , he said , but he cautioned that their fundamental strategy may become less effective : as their stocks become more accurately priced , it becomes harder for quant managers to beat their benchmarks .
One of the best - performing funds so far in 2006 is the Bridgeway Ultra - Small Company fund , which uses five quantitative models to fill out its holdings with an assortment of growth , value and momentum stocks .
The fund , now closed to new investment , gained 18 percent this year through June .
Still , it 's rare to see a quantitative fund at the top of the performance charts , since many funds of this type aim only to outperform a benchmark .
THEY say you can get anything on eBay .
Now it seems you can even discover a new marine species .
Sea urchin shells and spines are popular collectors ’ items on eBay , but buyers began to get confused when the shells they received did n’t look like anything else in their collections .
“ Every week I ’d get collectors contacting me and asking me to identify the species , ” says Simon Coppard at the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in London .
When he and colleague Heinke Schultze , an independent researcher , compared similar unidentified specimens from New Caledonia in the South Pacific with species records , they found nothing matched .
Instead , they realised that …
If you ask a software developer what they spend their time doing , they 'll tell you that they spend most of their time writing code .
However , if you actually observe what software developers spend their time doing , you 'll find that they spend most of their time trying to understand code :
Peter Hallam explains :
Why is 5 x more time spent modifying code than writing new code ?
New code becomes old code almost instantly .
Write some new code .
Go for coffee .
All of sudden you 've got old code .
Brand spanking new code reflects at most only the initial design however most design does n't happen up front .
Most development projects use the iterative development methodology .
Design , code , test , repeat .
Repeat a lot .
Only the coding in the first iteration qualifies as all new code .
After the first iteration coding quickly shifts to be more and more modifying rather than new coding .
Also , almost all code changes made while bug fixing falls into the modifying code category .
Look at [ the Visual Studio development team ] ; our stabilization ( aka bug fixing ) milestones are as long as our new feature milestones .
Modifying code consumes much more of a professional developer 's time than writing new code .
Why is 3 x more time spend understanding code than modifying code ?
Before modifying code , you must first understand what it does .
This is true of any refactoring of existing code - you must understand the behavior of the code so that you can guarantee that the refactoring did n't change anything unintended .
When debugging , much more time is spent understanding the problem than actually fixing it .
Once you 've fixed the problem , you need to understand the new code to ensure that the fix was valid .
Even when writing new code , you never start from scratch .
You 'll be calling existing code to do most of your work .
Either user written code or a library supplied by Microsoft , or a third party for which no source is available .
Before calling this existing code you must understand it in precise detail .
When writing my first XML enabled app , I spent much more time figuring out the details of the XML class libraries than I did actually writing code .
When adding new features you must understand the existing features so that you can reuse where appropriate .
Understanding code is by far the activity at which professional developers spend most of their time .
I think the way most developers " understand " code is to rewrite it .
Joel thinks rewriting code is always a bad idea .
I 'm not so sure it's that cut and dried .
According to The Universe in a Nutshell , here 's what was written on Richard Feynman 's blackboard at the time of his death :
What I cannot create , I do not understand .
It 's not that developers want to rewrite everything ; it 's that very few developers are smart enough to understand code without rewriting it .
And as much as I believe in the virtue of reading code , I 'm convinced that the only way to get better at writing code is to write code .
Lots of it .
Good , bad , and everything in between .
Nobody wants developers to reinvent the wheel ( again ) , but reading about how a wheel works is a poor substitute for the experience of driving around on a few wheels of your own creation .
Understanding someone else 's code -- really comprehending how it all fits together -- takes a herculean amount of mental effort .
And , even then , is source code truly the best way to understand an application ?
After reading Nate Comb 's thought provoking blog entry , I wonder :
Would Martians wishing to understand the rules of the World of Warcraft ( WoW ) be better off trying to read its source code or watching video of millions of hours of screen capture ?
The challenge of Reginald 's interview question is this : " If someone were to read the source code , do you think they could learn how to play [ Monopoly ] ? "
In some ways this challenge hints of the reward of " downhill synthesis " over an " uphill analysis " : who really knows what the rules of WoW are except by grace of the analysis of a million fan websites and trial and error .
Do the developers really know ?
I 've worked on plenty of applications where , even with the crutch of source code I wrote myself , I had trouble explaining exactly how the application works .
Imagine how difficult that explanation becomes with three , five , or twenty developers involved .
Does the source code really tell the story of the application ?
I 'm not so sure .
Maybe the best way to understand an application is , paradoxically , to ignore the source code altogether .
If you want to know how the application really works , observe carefully how users use it .
Then go write your own version .
The Nokia E62 Review - smartphone for the masses ?
Mobile productivity fanatics are having a good Fall 2006 - along with the Motorola Q and the Treo 680 , Nokia has also jumped into the game with a smartphone meant to reach more than just the average business consumer .
As first reported by SlashGear on September 12th , and regardless of their hopes , the Nokia E62 is another productivity - driven smartphone that is most suitable for business people on the go .
Released on September 29th and available exclusively through Cingular Wireless , the E62 is the U.S. version of the E61 , which has been available in Europe since earlier this year .
Nokia designed the E62 as an attempt to bridge the gap between corporate users and everyday people , and priced it at an affordable $ 199 with a 2 - year contract , and even as low as $ 150 with a mail - in rebate from Cingular .
Lots of pictures and an in - depth review after the jump …
First , let ’s discuss the fun stuff .
At a slim 0.7 inches , the E62 is thin enough to stash in a pocket , and its wide , high - resolution screen displays 16 million colors , making it an excellent choice for media playing and internet browsing .
Video was crystal - clear , and going back and forth between web pages was especially easy with a screen capture feature that you can scroll through to go back to the page of your choice .
IM was a breeze with the roomy QWERTY keyboard and software included for AIM , Yahoo ! and MSN messaging services .
Though surprisingly sophisticated , the audio player was unpleasant to listen to due to the lack of stereo speakers .
An included headset with two earbuds instead of one would have also helped lend the E62 more credibility as an MP3 player .
Viewing pictures was a breeze , but only after transferring pictures from my laptop with Nokia ’s included PC Suite software .
I was able to transfer photos and other data easily through an included USB 2.0 cable , Bluetooth and Infrared , but I think this model would have been complete with an onboard camera .
Productivity - wise , the E62 is ahead of the pack for its price point .
I was impressed to find the Symbian 9.1 OS was fully - equipped with applications designed to view , create and edit documents in Microsoft Office ( including Powerpoint presentations ) , a feature not available on the much - hyped Motorola Q .
The PDF reader was also a help , but let ’s talk about the number one reason to buy an E62 - complete mobile email support .
Setup is a breeze , an email hot key provides one touch access , and a light at the top right corner of the E62 notifies of incoming emails .
Though still not the ultimate combo of media , internet and productivity support , the E62 is a powerful contender even up against Blackberrys at double the price .
Reasons to Buy :
* Instant , painless access to a full range of personal and corporate email accounts
* Large , easily readable screen - even in sunlight !
* Light ( only 5.08 oz ) and Slim ( 0.7 ” )
* Globally Accessible ( Quadband EGSM 850 , 900 , 1800 & 1900 )
* Great choice for transitioning from standard cell phones to smartphones
Reasons to Wait :
* No Touchscreen
* No Camera
* Low Memory ( 80 MB , expandable with miniSD card )
* Voice Recorder Button too close to Volume Buttons
* Too wide and unwieldy for everyday personal use

Minutemen ' expose ' Bush 's ' shadow government ' Ron Brynaert
Published : Wednesday October 25 , 2006 Print This Email
This A major anti-immigration group is accusing the Bush Administration of creating a " shadow government , " by " engaging in collaborative relations with Mexico and Canada outside the U.S. Constitution , " RAW STORY has learned .
The Minuteman Project sent out a press release late Tuesday evening hyping their Web site , which is showcasing 1,000 documents allegedly obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request to the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America ( SPP ) by World Net Daily columnist Jerome Corsi .
Most widely known for his longtime attacks on Democratic Senator John Kerry 's military record , Corsi also co-authored a book about the Minuteman " battle " to secure America 's borders .
SPP was launched in March of 2005 as a trilateral effort by the United States , Canada and Mexico to increase the security and improve the quality of life of North Americans through greater cooperation and information sharing .
Many conservative critics view the trilateral initiative as a threat to U.S. sovereignty .
" The documents give clear evidence that the Bush administration has created a ' shadow government , ' " Corsi said in the press release .
Corsi claims to have " hundreds of pages of e-mails from U.S. executive branch administrators who are copying the e-mail to somewhere between 25 to 100 people , a third of whom are in the U.S. bureaucracy , a third of whom are in the Mexican bureaucracy and a third of whom are in the Canadian bureaucracy . "
" They are sharing their laws and regulations so we can ' harmonize ' and ' integrate ' our laws into a North American structure , not a USA structure , " Corsi said .
The documents can be viewed on the Minuteman Project 's Stop the Security and Prosperity Project page , but there 's no mention of any particular " smoking gun " which could proves the contention that the White House has created a shadow government .
The anti-immigration group appears to consider the mere existence of communications among bureaucrats from the three countries as proof of their assertions .
One series of letters show U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez writing to North American Steel Association leaders in all three countries thanking them for their " suggestions on enhancing the competitiveness of the steel industry " in North America ( pdf file ) .
" The North American industries ' recommendations for launching a North American steel strategy were well received and formed the basis for the Committee 's discussions on a program of work going forward , " Gutierrez wrote to assorted Steel Association chairmen and presidents .
A RAW STORY examination of documents related to the " steel strategy " as presented at the Minuteman Web site did not turn up anything untoward .
But Corsi maintains that the " documentation he received is missing key pieces . "
" We received very few actual agreements , though many are referenced , " Corsi said .
" Many of the work plans described lack the work products which the groups say they produced . "
Swapping job security for a startup
Why did Toni Schneider leave a good job at Yahoo to dive back into the fray with blog - software maker Automattic ?
Once an entrepreneur , always an entrepreneur .
( Business 2.0 Magazine ) --
Open - source is a great idea for users -- they typically get a decent product for free .
But it 's a far trickier proposition for companies trying to make a buck from an open - source application .
That did n't deter Toni Schneider from quitting Yahoo , where he was a vice president , and joining Automattic in January .
The startup , based in San Francisco , is named after 22 - year - old co-founder Matt Mullenweg - - the " Matt " in " Automattic " and the developer of WordPress , an increasingly popular open - source blogging tool .
Launched six months ago , the company already claims 150,000 users .
Schneider , 36 , is now aiming to build a real business on top of Mullenweg 's creation .
This is Schneider 's third turn at the helm of a startup .
His first was as CEO of Uplister , an online music - playlist service that shut down in 2002 .
He then took the helm of Oddpost , a Web - based e-mail software company that Yahoo snapped up for $ 29 million in 2004 .
At Oddpost , Schneider 's challenge was to improve on a product that Google , Microsoft , and Yahoo give away .
At Automattic , he has a similar task : Figure out a way to charge users for a product they can download for free .
Ironically , the fact that WordPress is open - source gives Schneider some advantages .
He already has a user base to sell new products to , and he knows exactly who to hire -- the developers who 've already worked on the software for free .
Business 2.0 caught up with Schneider to ask how he found his startup - CEO niche and to hear his plans for Automattic .
So you 've left Yahoo , with thousands of employees , to run a company with -- how many people ?
" There 's five of us . "
In the Valley , some entrepreneurs like to build things and run them .
Others like to build them and hand them off once they get to a certain size .
Where do you fit ?
" I found that my sweet spot is in taking something at the prototype stage , where there 's proof of concept but there is n't market validation yet .
It can then be handed to somebody whose business is to take it to the mass market .
It takes a different skill set to just start from scratch and say , ' I 'm just going to sit there for a year and work on this thing , and maybe it'll work and maybe it wo n't . '
That 's more of an inventor . "
Is n't that where you were with Oddpost ?
" I came in very early , but there was a prototype of the software .
Oddpost had the initial glimmer of greatness , but there was still a lot to do .
We looked back at that first version , and it looked really impressive , but there was so much missing .
Like spam filtering !
People signed up for it and paid anyway , but we said , " Maybe we should have had a spam filter ... "
You 've joined Automattic to help it capitalize on WordPress .
Why ?
" Word Press is an interesting new challenge because it's not like most startups , where the world still has n't heard of you .
WordPress is way past that stage .
On the other hand , there is no business yet .
Until Automattic came along , there was nobody working for it .
It was all volunteers .
So taking that product momentum and somehow turning that into a business will be really interesting .
I also really like the virtual - company aspect of it , how teams all over the world come together based on shared interests .
You have this selection process of people who want to work together .
That to me is a lot better than interviewing people , looking at resumes , and deciding if a person is going to work out .
It 's a different approach to building a business . "
So what is the business model ?
" We 're looking at a number of things .
WordPress as a blogging platform is already open - source .
If you want to run your own blogging service and host other people 's blogs , great .
Take it .
We want lots and lots of people to become serious bloggers .
Then we can offer add - on services to those people .
If a blog starts to have so much traffic that you start making some money , once you get to that point , you 're ready to spend meaningful money .
For people who just casually blog , it should be free .
We 're starting to license add - on services like Akismet , which blocks Web spam , to other people who are running corporate blogs , for example .
If you 're , say , an About.com , and your business is on blogs , you can't have spam on there . "
What 's Web spam ?
" Web spam happens anywhere you have a website that 's open to public posting and comments .
It could be a blog that 's open to comments , it could be a wiki , it could be a bulletin board , it could be a newsgroup .
And in all of those places , you start getting garbage in there .
Spammers try to sneak in comments without you noticing , so that they get the links back to their sites . "
How do you view competitors like Six Apart and Blogger ?
" Blogger is interesting .
They compete at the low end because they 're free - - a lot of people start on Blogger .
They are probably the biggest blogging platform out there .
There are 27 million blogs out there .
It 's not well understood , but the biggest services -- like Blogger , MySpace , and MSN Spaces -- probably account for half of that figure .
But that 's just the raw number of blogs .
In terms of how much traffic they generate , where a lot of the high - end blogging happens , that happens on services like Six Apart 's TypePad and with software like WordPress and Six Apart 's Movable Type .
There we do n't have accurate numbers , but my guess is that there are probably somewhere between 200,000 and 500,000 WordPress blogs out there and probably about half as many Movable Type blogs .
And TypePad might have a few hundred thousand as well .
So I actually think Movable Type and TypePad combined are probably smaller than WordPress at this point , but I do n't have any real numbers . "
Why not ?
" Because WordPress is open - source , we only know how many downloads there have been of the WordPress package . "
So what does Automattic own , exactly ?
" It owns the WordPress trademark and WordPress.com , where we host blogs .
We launched that late last year . "
Why do you think Blogger , which is owned by Google , has n't evolved into a more sophisticated product ?
" My guess would be that the market opportunity does n't fit what Google is going after .
I think Yahoo deals with this as well :
Do you become a blogging platform yourself , or do you work with all the other platforms out there ?
Because you actually want everybody 's content , not just your own . "
You worked at Yahoo for a year and a half after the Oddpost acquisition .
What was your role there ?
" I worked on Yahoo 's products for the software developers .
Before I came , Yahoo did n't have anything like that .
If you were a third - party developer and you wanted to do something with Yahoo , you could n't really do it .
There were no rules .
With all the Web 2.0 activity , all of a sudden lots and lots of small companies wanted to build things on top of the services and infrastructure that Yahoo and others already had .
It was perfect timing to say , OK , let 's take some of these things that Yahoo has built that are super industrial strength and make them available to developers .
Yahoo makes it really easy to then plug into various parts of Yahoo .
Say you want to build a weather feed into your application , or traffic information , or maps .
Now you can just pull it in from Yahoo . "
Why did you leave Yahoo to go through the startup grind again ?
Did n't you make enough money from Oddpost that you do n't have to work anymore ?
" No . I 'm plenty motivated still . "
Really ?
The general perception is that Oddpost was a big win .
" It was .
It was a nice chunk of money , but , you know , raising a family in San Francisco - - it adds up .
Oddpost definitely worked out all around .
The only person who did n't want to do the deal was Tim Draper , one of our lead investors .
He said , ' You 're selling too cheap .
It 's too early .
You could be the next Microsoft .
They 're stealing this company . ' "

This demonstrated to Afghan warlords that they could not play America and Iran off one another and prompted Tehran to deport hundreds of suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban operatives who had fled Afghanistan .
Those who argue that Iran did not cause Iraq ’s problems and therefore can be of only limited help in dealing with Iraq ’s current instability must also acknowledge that Iran did not “ cause ” Afghanistan ’s deterioration into a terrorist - harboring failed state .
But , when America and Iran worked together , Afghanistan was much more stable than it is today , Al Qaeda was on the run , the Islamic Republic ’s Hezbollah protégé was comparatively restrained , and Tehran was not spinning centrifuges .
Still , the Bush administration conveyed no interest in building on these positive trends .

From an Iranian perspective , this record shows that Washington will take what it can get from talking to Iran on specific issues but is not prepared for real rapprochement .
Yet American proponents of limited engagement anticipate that Tehran will play this fruitless game once more — even after numerous statements by senior administration figures targeting the Islamic Republic for prospective “ regime change ” and by President Bush himself that attacking Iran ’s nuclear and national security infrastructure is “ on the table . ”
Our experience dealing with xxxx xxxx Iranian diplomats over Afghanistan and in more recent private conversations in Europe and elsewhere convince us that Iran will not go down such a dead - end road again .
Iran will not help the United States in Iraq because it wants to avoid chaos there ;
Tehran is well positioned to defend its interests in Iraq unilaterally as America flounders .
Similarly , Iran will not accept strategically meaningful limits on its nuclear capabilities for a package of economic and technological goodies .
Iran will only cooperate with the United States , whether in Iraq or on the nuclear issue , as part of a broader rapprochement addressing its core security concerns .
This requires extension of a United States security guarantee — effectively , an American commitment not to use force to change the borders or form of government of the Islamic Republic — bolstered by the prospect of lifting United States unilateral sanctions and normalizing bilateral relations .
This is something no United States administration has ever offered , and that the Bush administration has explicitly refused to consider .
Indeed , no administration would be able to provide a security guarantee unless United States concerns about Iran ’s nuclear activities , regional role and support for terrorist organizations were definitively addressed .
That is why , at this juncture , resolving any of the significant bilateral differences between the United States and Iran inevitably requires resolving all of them .
Implementing the reciprocal commitments entailed in a “ grand bargain ” would almost certainly play out over time and in phases , but all of the commitments would be agreed up front as a package , so that both sides would know what they were getting .
Unfortunately , the window for pursuing a comprehensive settlement with Iran will not be open indefinitely .
The Iranian leadership is more radicalized today , with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president , than it was three years ago , and could become more radicalized in the future , depending on who ultimately succeeds Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as supreme leader .
If President Bush does not move decisively toward strategic engagement with Tehran during his remaining two years in office , his successor will not have the same opportunities that he will have so blithely squandered .

Keywords and keyphrases ( multi - word units ) are widely used in large document collections .
They describe the content of single documents and provide a kind of semantic metadata that is useful for a wide variety of purposes .
The task of assigning keyphrases to a document is called keyphrase indexing .
For example , academic papers are often accompanied by a set of keyphrases freely chosen by the author .
In libraries professional indexers select keyphrases from a controlled vocabulary ( also called Subject Headings ) according to defined cataloguing rules .
On the Internet , digital libraries , or any depositories of data ( flickr , del.icio.us , blog articles etc. ) also use keyphrases ( or here called content tags or content labels ) to organize and provide a thematic access to their data .
KEA is an algorithm for extracting keyphrases from text documents .
It can be either used for free indexing or for indexing with a controlled vocabulary .
KEA is implemented in Java and is platform independent .
It is an open - source software distributed under the GNU General Public License .

SQL SELECT in VFP and T - SQL
Watch out for these language differences when moving between Visual FoxPro and SQL Server .
Over the last few years , the Fox Pro team at Microsoft has done an excellent job of bringing VFP ’s SQL sub - language closer to accepted industry standards .
In particular , they have made the SELECT statement more closely conform to ANSI - 92 standards , which is good news for developers who need to move between VFP and back - end databases like SQL Server and Oracle .
Yet VFP ’s version of SELECT still has enough syntax and other differences to trap the unwary programmer .
Some of these differences reflect the peculiarities of the FoxPro language , while others offer genuinely useful – albeit non-standard – services that developers would be reluctant to do without – the ability to send query results direct to an array , for example .
In this article , we highlight the differences between the VFP and SQL Server ( T - SQL ) versions of SELECT .
We originally compiled the list with SQL Server 2000 in mind , but all of the points apply equally to SQL Server 2005 ( as well as to version 7 ) .
If you know of any differences not covered here , we ’d welcome your feedback .
Order of clauses
VFP has always been relaxed about the order of the clauses within a statement , and that applies equally to SELECT .
Put your ORDER BY before the FROM clause , or your TOP N right at the end of the command , and VFP wo n’t so much as blink .
T - SQL is much stricter .
In general , T - SQL demands that the clauses appear in the order in which they are listed in the syntax diagram in the Help file .
Empty column names
An oddity of T - SQL that sometimes surprises VFP folk is its ability to generate result sets with empty column names .
This happens by default with calculated or aggregate columns .
For example , in the results of this query :
SELECT EmployeeID , UPPER( LEFT( LastName,4 ) ) FROM Employees
the second column will have no name .
In VFP , the column name would default to something like Exp_1 .
In both versions , you can use the AS clause to assign a name to a column :
SELECT EmployeeID , UPPER( LEFT( LastName,4 ) ) AS ShortName FROM Employees
but T - SQL gives you an alternative syntax that ’s not supported by VFP :
SELECT EmployeeID , ShortName = UPPER ( LEFT ( LastName,4 ) ) FROM Employees
TOP N
In VFP , SELECT statements with a TOP N clause must also have an ORDER BY clause .
Not so in T - SQL .
You may omit the ORDER BY , in which case the ordering will be arbitrary .
WITH TIES
In T - SQL , you can add WITH TIES to a TOP N clause to indicate that the result set should include any tied values in the Nth row .
So , if you specify TOP 10 WITH TIES , and the 10th and 11th rows have the same value , you ’ll get 11 rows in the result set .
VFP does n’t support this clause .
However , VFP 8.0 and below always behave as if WITH TIES was present .
So , the following query will produce 11 rows if the 10th and 11th rows have the same order amount :
SELECT TOP 10 Order_Amt FROM Orders ; ORDER BY Order_amt
If that ’s not what you want , add a GROUP BY clause , like so :
SELECT TOP 10 Order_Amt FROM Orders ; ORDER BY Order_amt GROUP BY Order_Amt
In VFP 9.0 , the default behaviour is not to return tied values .
So a query will always return exactly the number of rows specified in the TOP N clause .
You can make VFP 9.0 behave like earlier versions by setting ENGINEBEHAVIOR to 70 or 80 , but this will be at the expense of performance .
( Our thanks to Stella Levin for pointing out this behaviour to us and for suggesting the GROUP BY workaround shown here . )
Optional FROM clause
Now here ’s another one that surprises a lot of people .
In T - SQL , it ’s legal to omit the FROM clause from a SELECT command – but only if the expressions in the expression list do n’t reference any columns in a table .
Doing so will always generate a result set with exactly one row .
The following command , for instance , would produce a result set containing just the current datetime :
SELECT GETDATE ( ) AS Current
VFP would unhesitatingly reject a command like that .
LIKE operator
VFP and T - SQL both let you use wildcard characters ( ‘ _’ and ‘ %’ ) with the LIKE operator .
These represent a single character and an arbitrary number of characters respectively .
So this query :
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Product_Name LIKE '% chocolate % '
will find all products whose names includes ‘ chocolate ’ .
T- SQL goes one better by letting you also use square brackets to denote ranges and sets .
For example , the following statement would find products whose codes start with A , B or C , followed by two digits :
SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Product_Code LIKE ' [ A - C ] [ 0 - 9 ] [ 0 - 9 ] '
Unfortunately , this handy feature is not available in VFP .
GROUP BY and aggregate functions
This one has trapped many VFP developers , especially since VFP 8.0 first appeared .
In earlier versions , the following syntax was legal :
SELECT Country , City , AVG ( Inv_Total ) ; FROM Invoices GROUP BY Country
However , although legal , that syntax produced potentially incorrect results .
In the above example , VFP would select an arbitrary city to match each country , even though a given country could have many cities .
ASNI - 92 SQL imposes a simple rule : if a query has a GROUP BY clause , every item in the expression list ( the list immediately following the keyword SELECT ) must either be an aggregate function or one of the columns listed in the GROUP BY clause .
T- SQL strictly enforces that rule , as does VFP 8.0 and above , but earlier versions of Fox Pro do n’t ( in VFP 8.0 and above , you can override the enforcement by setting ENGINEBEHAVIOR to 70 ) .
Grouping on column numbers
Still on the subject of GROUP BY , the following syntax is legal in all versions of VFP :
SELECT Country , AVG ( Inv_Total ) ; FROM Invoices GROUP BY 1
T- SQL would choke on that because column numbers are not permitted in the GROUP BY clause .
You would have to use the following form ( which would also be legal in VFP ) :
SELECT Country , AVG ( Inv_Total ) FROM Invoices GROUP BY Country
However , both versions allow the use of column numbers with ORDER BY .
HAVING clause
In VFP , you can use a HAVING clause even if there is no GROUP BY clause .
In that case , HAVING behaves like WHERE .
In T - SQL , HAVING is not permitted without GROUP BY .
Outer joins
In T - SQL , you ca n’t specify a join simply as OUTER .
Unlike in VFP , you must include the appropriate keyword : LEFT , RIGHT or FULL .
Projections and derived tables
VFP and T - SQL both support subqueries in the WHERE clause .
In VFP 9.0 , as in T - SQL , subqueries can also appear in the expression list and in the FROM and JOIN clauses .
Subqueries in the expression list are called projections , while those in the FROM or JOIN clauses are called derived tables .
The Help files for VFP 9.0 and SQL Server both contain examples of how these can be used .
VFP 8.0 and below do not support projections or derived tables .
Query destinations
VFP allows you to send query results to a variety of destinations .
By default , they go to a behinds - the - scenes cursor which VFP immediately displays in a Browse window .
You can use the PREFERENCE clause to specify options for that window .
Alternatively , you can use the TO clause to send the results to the screen , a printer or a text file .
Or you can use INTO to place the results in a cursor , table or array .
In T - SQL , query results are simply returned to the client process in the form of a result set .
The only option for re-directing them is to send them to a new table , which you do like so :
SELECT * INTO Choc_Products FROM Products WHERE Product_Name LIKE '% chocolate % '
Unlike in VFP , the position of the INTO clause is significant – it must appear between the expression list and the FROM clause – and it should n’t include the keyword TABLE .
If you want to send the query results to a temporary table – similar to a cursor in VFP – use the same syntax as above , but start the table name with # .
Tables whose names begin with # are stored in SQL Server ’s Tempdb database , and are destroyed when the connections which created them are closed .
Memo and general fields in DISTINCT clause
VFP 7.0 and below allow you to specify memo and general fields in the expression list of a query that includes the keyword DISTINCT , even though such queries produce incorrect results .
For VFP 8.0 , the Fox Pro team tightened up the syntax .
Now , memo and general fields are disallowed in DISTINCT queries , unless ENGINEBEHAVIOR is set to 70 .
The SQL Server equivalents of memo and general fields are text and image columns .
T- SQL does not allow these column types in the result sets of queries that have a DISTINCT clause .
Number of tables
VFP 8.0 and below imposes a limit of 30 tables ( to be precise , 30 aliases ) in a SELECT statement .
The equivalent figure in T - SQL is 256 .
VFP 9.0 has no theoretical limit .
Nesting of subqueries
In VFP 8.0 and below , you can only have a single level of subquery nesting .
In VFP 9.0 , there is no theoretical limit .
In T - SQL , the limit is 32 levels .
Null values
If you want to exclude null values from a result set ( or exclude everything except null values ) , you can ( and should ) use IS [ NOT ] NULL in the WHERE clause .
That applies in both VFP and T - SQL .
But be careful about the seemingly similar ISNULL ( ) function .
In VFP , this function does what its name suggests : it tells you if a given expression evaluates to null .
In T - SQL , ISNULL ( ) is more like VFP ’s NVL ( ) function .
It takes two arguments ; if the first argument is null , the function returns the second argument , otherwise it returns the first .

500 - Plus Economists Sign Open Letter Reminding President Bush of the Benefits of Immigration
Immigration :  The Greatest Anti-Poverty Program Ever Devised 
“ America is a generous and open country and these qualities make America a beacon to the world .
We should not let exaggerated fears dim that beacon . ”
 The 500 + signers of the Independent Institute ’s Open Letter on Immigration
Washington , D.C. The Independent Institute has just released its Open Letter on Immigration to President Bush and Congress on the economics of immigration .
The list of more than 500 signatories includes 5 Nobel Laureates Thomas C. Schelling ( University of Maryland ) , Robert Lucas ( University of Chicago ) , Daniel McFadden ( University of California , Berkeley ) , Vernon Smith ( George Mason University ) , and James Heckman ( University of Chicago ) .
The Open Letter on Immigration reminds President Bush and all members of Congress of America ’s history as an immigrant nation , the overall economic and social benefits of immigration , and the power of immigration to lift the poor out of poverty .
“ Economists disagree about a lot of things but there is a consensus on many of the important issues surrounding immigration , ” said Alexander Tabarrok , Research Director at the Independent Institute and the primary author of the letter .
“ The consensus is that most Americans benefit from immigration and that the negative effects on low - skilled workers are somewhere between an 8 % wage reduction to no loss in wages at all . ”
Reflecting this consensus the signatories to the Open Letter include prominent economists involved in both Democratic and Republican administrations such as N. Gregory Mankiw ( Harvard University ) , former Chairman of President Bush ’s Council of Economic Advisers , and J. Bradford DeLong ( University of California , Berkeley ) , Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton , as well as Alfred Kahn ( Cornell University ) , Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board under President Jimmy Carter , and Paul McCracken ( University of Michigan ) , Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Richard Nixon .
The letter also points to many important effects of immigration that may not be widely appreciated : “ Immigration is the greatest anti-poverty program ever conceived .
Not just because the immigrants are much better off but also because they send billions of dollars of their own money back to their home countries a form of truly effective foreign aid . ”
As the House and Senate struggle toward compromise on an immigration bill , tensions and rhetoric are rising .
The signers of the Open Letter on Immigration believe that this emotional debate taking place in Washington , D.C. and around the country could be elevated by a modest and non-partisan reminder of the value of immigration , and plea for a clear - eyed consideration of the principles at stake and the historic American goals that will be affected in any outcome .
To help create a fair sense of both sides of the argument , the Open Letter on Immigration notes the economic benefits of immigration , but puts them in context .
For instance , “ Overall , immigration has been a net gain for American citizens , though a modest one in proportion to the size of our 13 trillion - dollar economy . ”
Similarly , the signers also acknowledge that “ immigration of low - skilled workers may have lowered wages of domestic low - skilled workers , ” but also note that the resulting wage reductions for high school dropouts is estimated to be from eight percent to as little as zero percent .
In addition , the Open Letter points up connections that sound immigration policy can make between the political values on both sides of the debate , balancing , for instance , compassion for those low - skilled workers seeking jobs with the power of freely competitive markets to create those jobs : “ Immigrants do not take American jobs .
The American economy can create as many jobs as there are workers willing to work so long as labor markets remain free , flexible and open to all workers on an equal basis . ”
“ Public fears of lost jobs are unfounded and most workers will not experience any negative impact on their wages .
Congress would do well to recognize the benefits of immigration and pass a reform that allows greater numbers of legal workers into America , ” said signer and Independent Institute Research Fellow Benjamin Powell , Director of the Center on Entrepreneurial Innovation .
By presenting legitimate concerns over immigration in light of a realistic assessment of immigration ’s economic benefits , the signers of the Independent Institute ’s Open Letter on Immigration hope to promote more thoughtful debate on one of the most contentious issues of the day .

The most important thing being delivered from any Web site is the content .
Therefore , time and effort should be spent on making that content the most accessible aspect of any project .
The method in which you style the content intensive elements of your document has a very strong effect on accessibility .
There are different ways to style text according to the medium on which the text will appear .
It is generally accepted that using em units to scale your text is the best method .
Why is em preferred over other methods such as pixel , percentage , or ex units ?
This issue has been written about and discussed in many well written articles already .
If you are unfamiliar with the differences between the various unit sizes , you should take a minute and read the following articles :
There are many more excellent articles with a lot of great information on using em as a font - size unit .
What is usually a hard concept to grasp is why it is the preferred method to use .
After all , it is much easier as a developer to use pixel sizing and be completely positive as to how big your fonts will be .
When first using em , it is sometimes difficult to determine why a font is represented in a particular size .
The concept of a font size being dependent on a variable becomes confusing very quickly at first .
Why not px ?
The most important thing to keep in mind is that opposed to pixel units , em units are relative to the font size of parent elements .
If you take a step back and look at it , everything boils down to the font size of the browser itself – essentially giving the developer no control of the font size of their document .
To the developer ’s advantage , more often than not , users do not change the default font size of their browser and many do n’t know that it is even possible ; however , the people who do know how to change the font size are the people that matter in this situation .
Those users are the ones who may have a visual impairment that requires them to browse the Web using larger font sizes so they are actually able to read text on screen .
It is those people that developers should aim to acclimate with their CSS .
Aside from people with visual impairments there are other reasons to discontinue the usage of px .
Picture the following scenario :
You have just finished development on a site for a major client and they have requested a presentation in order to show them what you have been doing with their money .
You are standing in front of a room of 20 board executives and have your work displayed on a projector .
As a side note , you ’re in the business place of the client , and the only browser available on their Windows XP presentation computer is Internet Explorer .
After presenting what you ’ve come up with , you open the floor to any questions and one of the execs in the back reports that he can’t read some of the text on screen .
Here is where your presentation can excel or diminish .
Unfortunately , the font - size within your document is being controlled using pixel units and ca n’t be adjusted with Internet Explorer .
Had you styled your document using em font units , you would be able to increase the font size of the browser which would in turn scale all of the text within your document , enabling this particular board member to read the text .
While this situation may not always be applicable , it should still be taken into account .
It may be an extreme situation , but when developing it is important to keep in mind the end user .
Not trying to be over - dramatic , allowing for scalable text is an important feature to keep in mind .
While many modern browsers are able to scale px units , IE / Win does not , and as we all know , it is by far the most common configuration for our end users and must be taken into account .
Why not % , or ex ?
Research shows that the ex unit would be a preferred method of scaling text when being compared to em units .
A wonderful explanation is provided by mozillaZine in their article titled Em Units Versus ex Units .
In which they explain that using em units can result in some font - size rounding issues .
Scaling the overall font size has a positive effect on this problem , but using ex still seems like the way to go considering all the facts .
It would be wonderful to implement , provided that it was consistent in cross browser performance .
Unfortunately , this is not the case .
After testing in Firefox , using ex seemed to perform just right .
After getting used to ex it seemed as though it was an effective way to determine font - sizes .
Testing in Opera proved otherwise .
All of my fonts were extremely small and almost impossible to read .
After looking into this , it seems as though Opera and IE render 1ex as 0.5 em which is the cause of all the trouble .
Further investigation lead me to believe that the cause of this was n’t Opera or Internet Explorer , but a limitation of the Windows OS somehow .
I was n’t able to find much detail as to the cause of this problem , but the fact remains that the default rendering is not correct .
Using % to Scale Font
Using a percentage as a font - size indicator simply does not seem intuitive .
In day to day use , you usually do n’t find yourself setting a font size as a percentage .
Many people are used to setting points in word processing applications , which more often than not use a point system .
This closely relates to pixel values and is more natural to use as opposed to a percentage for many people .
Some developers do prefer to use percentages as opposed to other units .
It really comes down to preference .
The thing to keep in mind is the issue of scalability in an effort to assist the end user in any way possible .
Putting em to Use
As stated before , using em units for font - size is dependent on the font size of parent elements .
This is the most important concept to grasp when using em to scale text , and most often confusing to early adopters .
As you know , the default font size for ‘ medium ’ text in browsers is 16 px .
When trying to determine em units for fonts based on a 16px font size can be difficult and might even require the use of a calculator from time to time .
Developers have come up with the solution of scaling down the font size of the entire document by shrinking the overall font size from within the body to a value such as 62.5 % .
As a reminder , scaling the font size allows the developer to set the value of 1em equal to a pixel equivalent of 10 .
This makes things much easier on the developer due to the fact that you can determine the em font size simply by taking the pixel size you envision and dividing by ten .
In order to keep from being confused , it is often a good idea to keep font - size declarations to a minimum .
Once the font - size is defined in the body , you should only continue to define where needed due to the fact that em font - sizes are relative to parent elements .
Uses Outside of Font
The idea behind scalable text is to allow for greater accessibility .
If the only attribute being controlled with em in your stylesheet is font size – the structure of your layout may be degraded greatly the instant the user changes font size .
If a particular element is styled in a way that the width and height is determined by a pixel value and the contained content is a tight squeeze , increasing the font size will force it to exceed your intended boundaries , possibly resulting in lost content or other ill effects .
This brings a major issue to mind :
What would the point of having scalable text be if making use of the feature destroys your presentation ?
The answer is to control your document as the font size increases or decreases .
Container Elements
If you have container elements which house your content , allow them to expand in a way which will not destroy your layout .
One way is to control the height of your container using em and control the width using px .
This way you have control over how wide the container is , yet it will scale in height to accommodate changing font sizes .
Dealing with Overflow
When using relative font sizes , you will come to realize that as the font sizes increase greatly , things may get ugly .
One way to better the situation is to control the overflow content not essential to your document .
In certain circumstances it may be in your better interest to set a width of an element and then set an overflow : hidden and allow the content to become truncated .
This issue should n’t come up very often in real life circumstances .
It is rare that a user would be browsing your site with a default font size of 25 px or so .
Margins
Another effective way of using em units is to measure your margins .
The majority of time this again occurs with vertical measurements only .
As a font size increases and scales downward , there is potential of overlap with neighboring elements that are positioned based on pixel values .
To correct this , more often than not em units can be used to space the elements from one another , and that space will scale in equal increments along with the font - size .
For Example …
The overflow problem became an issue when styling Monday By Noon .
The list elements chosen to be included in the design became a disaster after a few font size increases .
To deal with this , the overflow solution was put into effect .
Setting overflow : hidden to certain elements of those lists allows for the structure to be retained while conveying the content as best as possible .
Those list elements along with the Search section of the site are also spaced using vertical em margins because of overflowing issues as the font - size grew .
To retain the look of Monday By Noon , the majority of widths are still controlled using pixel values .
As this may be frowned upon by some , it is used to retain the look and feel of the site .
Ideally , a particular
Web site could be scaled in its entirety based on the font size of the user .
Cross Browser Issues
After taking some steps to lightly test the usage of em units , I ’ve found that the character rendering seems to be off kilter in both Galeon and Epiphany when using Linux .
They appear to reflect the same issues as Opera and IE in Windows but I was n’t able to find a great deal of related information .
Otherwise , adopting an em font - size unit seems like the best way to
increase the accessibility and usability of your site in modern browsers once the learning curve is overcome .

Un Tramway Nommé Désir Streetcars Make a Comeback in Paris
The last Paris tram ground to a halt 60 years ago .
Now a new tram line is being introduced with lots of fanfare .
France hopes this return to the past will ring in a new era of urban mobility .
The tram is quiet , fast and comfortable -- a perfect remedy for traffic jams .
This important thought occurred to me today as I walked safely through a park .
How different things would be if packs of squirrels suddenly attacked people and devoured them ?
What if squirrels ( rodents of the family Sciuridae ) attacked humans with such vigor that they were known as the “ piranhas of the woods ? ”
A stroll in the park would no longer be a stroll in the park .
We ’d have to dress up in armor to go out and get the newspaper .
Professional sports teams would proudly call themselves “ The Squirrels . ”
And to call someone “ squirrelly ” might be a compliment .
But what would we do with all those acorns ?
I consider the lack of each and every bad thing to be a good thing .
If any bad thing existed , but then someone fixed that problem , we ’d all celebrate .
Every day that those bad things do n’t exist is a great victory , then , and we should take a moment to be grateful for every bad thing that does n’t actually exist .
Here are a few others :
I ’m thankful that it does n’t cost money to poop .
I ’m glad that light bulbs do n’t need to be buried in little coffins when they burn out .
I ’m relieved that perspective does n’t work in reverse , such that things looked bigger the further away they got .
I ’m grateful that ears are not considered “ private parts , ” such that we felt compelled to cover them with muffs everywhere we went .
And I ’m thankful that sex is not spelled “ sexoxlneycihweobkeiyusmsklucolehskyzsnxjkbwuhkpeiys , ” which would make this fascinating topic much more difficult to talk about and write about .
That squirrels do n’t actually prey on humans is an especially good thing .
There ’s just too many of them out there .
It would be incredibly ugly if a pack of them decided to collaborate to clean you down to the bone .
Think about it .
This concludes my appreciation therapy tonight .
Japan And The Atomic Bomb
by Anatoly Koshkin
Moscow ( RIA Novosti ) Dec 29 , 2006
On December 25 , the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun published a government document dated December 20 about Japan 's intention to develop small nuclear warheads .
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuhisa Shiozaki immediately refuted the report 's authenticity , saying , " The government does not know anything about the existence of the document . "
Nevertheless , the question of a Japanese nuclear bomb remains open .
After coming to power , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his cabinet announced their intention to make a fundamental change in military policy .
What was hushed up before is turning into a national program .
Using the North Korean threat as an excuse , the government is urging the nation to give up the constitution 's pacifist clauses , embark on the formation of powerful armed forces , put a legal stamp of approval on the right of the Japanese army and navy to participate in military operations in any part of the world together with the United States , and set up a government intelligence service modeled after the CIA .
In parallel , the government is brainwashing the public on a massive scale .
Prime Minister
Abe has set his government the task of " bringing patriotism back to schools . "
Authors of textbooks are rewriting history to whitewash the atrocities of Japanese militarism and present the wars conducted by Japan in East Asia and the Pacific in the past century as a mission of liberation which brought civilization to the invaded nations .
They are emphasizing that Japan 's policy in the future should not be limited to repenting for its military past .
The formation of the new cabinet was accompanied by appeals from influential members of the government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to launch a nationwide discussion on Japan 's potential nuclear armament , which caused quite a stir both in Japan and beyond , especially in East Asia .
Since the late 1960s , Japan has adhered to three principles : not to possess , develop , or import any types of nuclear weapons .
Now the wisdom of following these principles is openly being called into question .
Much has been done to prepare the ground for the removal of constitutional provisions denying Japan the right to conduct warfare and maintain armed forces , an effort which facilitates the discussion of nuclear armament .
The results of a public opinion poll published last October show that 60 % of Japanese agree that the constitution should be changed .
More than two - thirds of deputies in the Diet , or the majority required to change the constitution , are ready to vote for an appropriate bill .
While Prime Minister
Abe declares his government 's intention to adhere to the same policy towards weapons of mass destruction , members of his cabinet announce , albeit not without reservations , that Japan is technologically capable of producing nuclear warheads , if need be .
Speaking at a meeting of the House of Representatives security committee on November 30 , Foreign Minister Taro Aso said : " Japan has the technology to produce nuclear weapons , but it is not going to use it . "
He added that the constitution does not prohibit Japan from having nuclear weapons .
" Article 9 ( 1 ) of the constitution does not ban the possession of a small quantity of arms for the purpose of self - defense .
Even nuclear weapons are not outlawed if their quantity falls under this definition , " the minister specified .
The press has reported that at present Japan has the ability to develop nuclear weapons using both uranium and plutonium .
As of late March of 2005 , it had 43.8 metric tons of plutonium , 5.9 tons of which are stored in Japan and 37.9 tons in Britain and France .
Experts have estimated that this is enough for almost 5,475 warheads , considering that one such weapon requires eight kilos of plutonium .
There are reports to the effect that it would take Japan no more than six weeks to develop nuclear weapons , and not some primitive devices , but state - of - the - art nuclear armaments - either aerial bombs or warheads .
However , there are several geopolitical reasons why Japan might not go nuclear .
Most important is the American factor .
Washington knows about the intention of nationalistic - minded Japanese politicians to gradually rid Japan of its long - term status as a U.S. military and political protectorate .
It is also aware of the doubts about whether the Americans will fight for the Japanese in the event of a conflict in the Far East .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was charged with convincing Japan and South Korea of the U.S. 's readiness to fulfill allied commitments .
It is clear that U.S. politicians will try to persuade the Japanese government to curb its nuclear ambitions , at least for the time being .
They understand perfectly well that having gone nuclear , Japan and South Korea may renounce Uncle Sam 's military services .
But the U.S. does not want to leave the Far East and regards its military bases in Japan and Korea as major assets in its global strategy .
Indicatively , while opposing the emergence of Japanese nukes , the U.S. is doing all it can to encourage Tokyo to build up conventional arms .
Having endorsed , or rather initiated , the revision of the constitution 's pacifist articles , Washington is trying to make broader use of the Japanese armed forces in its military missions .
Having met with reluctance on the part of its European allies to take part in its ventures , Americans have started looking to still - obedient Japan .
In October , U.S. National Security Advisor Jack D. Crouch bluntly said that Japan must expand its military presence abroad - ostensibly to ensure security in unstable areas of the world .
Washington advocates the involvement of Japan , South Korea , Australia , and New Zealand in NATO .
Japan is close to Russia , and Moscow should take the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation in northeast Asia seriously .
If Japan goes nuclear , the inevitable arms race will threaten to involve Russia in armed conflicts , jeopardizing its plans to improve the standard of living in its eastern regions and resolve their serious demographic problem .
It is in our vital interests to take all possible political measures to turn the Korean Peninsula into a nuclear - free zone and make sure that North Korea is not invaded like Iraq .
We would hope that despite its security concerns , Japan understands that dialogue and compromise are much better than nuclear brinkmanship .

A ' wanted ' poster for Zarqawi : there is a $ 25 m bounty on his head
Maj Gen Hussein Kamal told reporters that Zarqawi was detained in the central Iraqi town of Falluja , but was released when nobody recognised him .
Falluja was the scene of a massive US - led operation in November 2004 .
Zarqawi's group , al - Qaeda in Iraq , has claimed responsibility for many of the biggest attacks of the insurgency .
Gen Kamal said Iraqi police had detained Zarqawi for about three or four hours before releasing him .
He got away once , he will not get away the next time
Maj Gen Hussein Kamal
Profile : Abu Musab al - Zarqawi
" Iraqi police forces , who were in Falluja then , did not have sophisticated equipment to take pictures of him or take his fingerprints , " he told the Associated Press .
But the deputy minister insisted Zarqawi would eventually be captured .
" He is human , he does not have the power of God , " he said .
" He got away once , he will not get away the next time .
He will be tried for the crimes he committed against the Iraqi people . "
A British official has told the BBC 's security correspondent , Frank Gardner , that there is no credibility to the claim that Zarqawi was detained .
Most wanted
Zarqawi is the most wanted suspect in Iraq and has a US bounty of $ 25 m on his head .
His pictures and DNA have been supplied to both US and Iraqi forces .
The US military said it captured his driver at a checkpoint in western Iraq in February , but narrowly missed the main target .
In May , Iraqi Interior Minister Bayan Jabr said Zarqawi had been critically injured after a US air raid on his hideout in Qaim , on the Syrian border .
Following the attack , Zarqawi was said to have been treated at a hospital in Ramadi , fleeing 10 minutes before Iraqi and US force arrived .
The claim rapidly attracted postings on Islamist websites saying it was fraudulent .

喔，我不該提到這個嗎？我都還沒真的談到那些小事故耶，當時她……好吧，算了。我們繼續。我相信她會是個好駕駛的。從現在開始。
總之，我真的對 Perl 6 非常感同身受，因為我是隻蝴蝶。我也不得不在蛹裡忍住很久的時間，等到出來的那一天。我真的是非出櫃不可。哈，應該說是飛出櫃吧！
呃，唉呀。我又來了，是吧。
總之，請對 Perl 6 有點耐心。雖然我們今天宣稱她長大了，但你也知道，她還只是青少年。當我們很小的時候，就只是那年紀的小鬼，但當我們成為青少年，歷經賀爾蒙的變化時，這個嘛，我們就會開始不穩定了。這種不穩定的程度，有一陣子會顯得更嚴重。在
15 歲的時候，這種不穩定的幅度可能是正負 10 年。某天的舉止就像是 25 歲，隔天又像是 5 歲一樣。
所以 Perl 6 還需要再更加成熟，這當然囉。我的意思不是在她亂發脾氣把我們逼瘋的日子裡我們就比較不愛她，我的意思是，呃，我想我的意思是她就是家人，而不論甘苦你都會愛著家人的。因為你相信，總有一天會苦盡甘來。
而我們都是她的大家族，今天在這裡相聚。人們說撫養一個小孩需要一座村莊，但從來沒有過這樣的小孩或這樣的村莊！如果你明天宿醉消退後，有機會看看程式碼，也請看看背後的貢獻者列表。超過 800 人積極地為 Perl 6 的開發提供協助，以各種方式。當然一定還有些名字沒列在上面。
你們是很重要的一群人，你們所有人都是，不只是家族中親近的那些人。我們家族從很久以前就知道，成長中的電腦語言所能得到的最珍貴指引，有些來自於直系親屬之外。朋友和熟人，有時比朝夕相處的人能擁有更大的視野。這就是為什麼會需要一座村莊。
「 成熟」這件事就像碎形，會在許多尺度下進行。Perl 6 透過你們認識她即將進入的寬廣世界，外頭的世界充滿挑戰。Perl 6 對其中某些情況已做好準備，這多虧了你們。
當然，她還只有 15 歲。某些事情她已經做得很好了。她的溝通技巧非常棒，當不懂你的意思時也很有禮貌。她可以同時進行許多對話。她數學很好，也相當擅長處理各種物件。她熱愛外語，以及那些奇妙的字符。
但她仍是個慎重的孩子，在學習事物時有時似乎思考得太努力了。沒關係，在接下來幾年她會變得更快並更有效率，因為她的腦袋正在重組成完全的大人。她會學到新的東西，關於這個世界和自己。但我不認為她的性格會有太大的變化，這點是很明顯的。
而這是因為她的性格其實來自於大家。是你們的愛讓她誕生，而現在她準備要把這些愛，傳達給還不認識她的人。
火箭升空時我們都會很興奮 。TimToady 告訴我在凌晨起床看水星號、雙子星號和阿波羅火箭升空的事。我還太小不記得那些，但我們有自己的刺激進展可以追蹤。我的話，我很高興看到這禮拜
SpaceX 成功降落。在經過一些小事故後……
[ 又一陣聽不見的議 論 ]
我不理你。小心了，我們已經非常非常擅長不理會某些人。別成為他們之中的一份子。
真的，我為那些只在不開心的事出現時才開心的人感到遺憾。
總之，向世界推出 Perl 6 就像火箭升空。倒數時非常興奮，還有不知道會升空還是爆炸的屏息時刻。我們現在就是如此。主推進器已經點著了，固定器也鬆開了。這些都很戲劇化，主要是因為此刻看來並沒有真的發生什麼事。
不過火箭本來就跟這些無關，戲劇性並不是火箭想要的。火箭想要的是升空，更快更快再更快。這跟位置無關，甚至也跟速率無關。重要的是，一切都在加速進行中。
[ 舉杯 ]
那麼，在此獻 上 Perl 6。她將自由高飛。祝她為存在而歡喜，祝她為發現世界而歡喜，祝她只要願意就能不斷加速！乾杯！
About the Latest Cancer Cure
by Bill Sardi by Bill Sardi
DIGG THIS
My email box fills with reports of a newly found cancer cure .
No , not another herb touted by a poneytailed herbalist who just returned from Katmandu , but from the University of Alberta .
OK , it deserves attention .
God knows , humanity needs a treatment for cancer that works and does n’t kill the patients before it cures .
Take Tamoxifen for example .
The most recent study found , after 12 months , 22 % of women being treated for breast cancer had ceased using the drug .
At 24 months 28 % had stopped Tamoxifen , and at 3.5 years 35 % had stopped the treatment .
[ Cancer , Online : January 22 , 2007 Print Issue Date : March 1 , 2007 ]
Tamoxifen ’s side effects are horrendous , and the drug only marginally effective .
In one Tamoxifen study , among 6600 healthy women who took Tamoxifen , there were 69 fewer tumors compared to 6000 other women who took a dummy pill .
In other words , Tamoxifen benefited only about 1 in 100 high - risk women as a preventive measure .
Yet it was widely hailed as a breakthrough !
[ Associated Press Oct. 30 , 1998 ]
Ninety - nine women would have to take Tamoxifen and be subject to its side effects for one woman to escape breast cancer .
Among the serious and life - threatening events associated with Tamoxifen are uterine malignancies ( yep , cancer ! ) , stroke , and pulmonary embolism ( life - threatening blood clot in the lungs ) , not to mention blinding cataracts , aged skin , hair loss .
A " Tamoxifened " woman looks terrible .
Back to our report about the new cancer wonder drug .
So the University of Alberta press release says a " small molecule offers big hope against cancer . "
So far , sounds attractive , since small molecules are avidly being investigated for cancer treatment as they can enter the cell nucleus and switch cancer promoting / inhibiting genes on or off .
The surprising molecule that does this is dichloroacetate ( DCA ) , an odorless , colorless , inexpensive , and " relatively non-toxic " drug that has already been used in humans to treat a condition called lactic acidosis .
OK , lactic acidosis is the common state of metabolism in cancer cells .
Cancer cells , lacking the ability to produce energy from within their own cellular machinery ( mitochondria ) , revert to producing sugar for cell energy , which produces lactic acid as a by - product .
The lactic acid dumps outside the cell , repelling anti-cancer agents and making the cancer cell immortal .
Dammit , these tumor cells wo n’t die off like normal cells .
So the researchers found that dichloroacetate ( DCA ) revives the energy - producing compartments ( mitochondria ) within cancer cells , eventually resulting in cancer cell death ( what researchers called apoptosis ) .
DCA did no harm to surrounding healthy cells , so it might be non -toxic .
Modern medicine is desperately searching for anti-cancer molecules that kill cancer cells and leave healthy cells alone .
Unfortunately , chemotherapy today is very toxic to tumor and healthy cells alike , and the patient often succumbs to the treatment rather than their disease .
Furthermore , cells do n’t like the toxic drugs ; they develop a resistance to them , so chemotherapy usually only works for a short time .
The University of Alberta researchers note that DCA has already been used in humans to treat mitochondrial disease with " relative " non-toxicity .
But they lament that DCA is unpatentable so it is not likely to receive any attention , or research funding , from a pharmaceutical company .
Now there is the rub .
The admission there may be a cure for cancer out there , but it ’s gotta make a big profit for a drug company or they wo n’t pay attention to it .
This is commercially understandable .
However , this serves to say , simpler remedies may exist , but patients are going to have to go on a scavenger hunt to find them on their own .
The university - based researchers sought widespread publicity for DCA hoping a private source would provide research funds .
[ Small molecule offers big hope against cancer , University of Alberta press release , Jan. 17 , 2007 ]
But treating mice in the laboratory is a long way from proving a cancer drug not only kills cancer cells , but actually improves survival .
There are a lot of drugs that shrink tumors , but do n’t improve survival .
When DCA was used in humans in 1983 , it effectively reduced lactic acidosis and normalized blood pressure .
The drug itself produced no known toxicity , but 12 of 13 DCA - treated patients still died .
[ New England Journal Medicine 309 : 390— 96 , 1983 ]
In animals , DCA induces liver toxicity and neoplasia ( yep , cancer ! ) .
DCA is actually a by - product of water chlorination , chlorine being one of the most toxic molecules on the planet .
[ Environmental Health Perspectives 106 ( Suppl 4 ) : 989—994 , 1998 ]
Of interest , the toxic side effects of DCA may emanate from inducement of a vitamin B 1 ( thiamine ) deficiency .
The chronic use of dichloroacetate ( DCA ) for diabetes has been compromised by nerve and other forms of toxicity .
DCA is metabolized to glyoxylate , which is converted to oxalate and , in the presence of adequate thiamine levels , to other metabolites .
Nerve toxicity from DCA administration appears to result from depletion of body thiamine stores and abnormal metabolism of oxalate , a known nerve toxin .
The co-administration of vitamin B1 with DCA reduces urinary oxalate levels from 86 % above normal to only 28 % above normal .
[ Toxicological Sciences 14 : 327—37 , 1990 ]
Maybe this tips off how DCA actually works , by depriving cells of an essential nutrient .
Anyway , you ’ve learned more about DCA than you care to , or need to , know .
That ’s because there is another small molecule that deserves more attention .
Like DCA , it is a small molecule that can enter the cell nucleus and switch genes on or off .
It is perceived by the body as a toxin , but actually is non-toxic , and it is very stealth , it can penetrate any resistant cancer cell .
It works in a similar manner to DCA by inducing cancer cell death ( apoptosis ) .
The molecule is resveratrol , known as a red wine molecule .
Resveratrol appears to kill off cancer cells by depolarizing ( demagnetizing ) mitochondrial bodies within tumor cells .
Resveratrol is 100 anti-cancer drugs in one .
Resveratrol works in so many ways to block cancer , researchers can’t find a cancer - promotion pathway it does n’t inhibit .
It is virtually non -toxic since , after oral ingestion , it is quickly metabolized by the liver , attached to a detoxification molecule called glucuronate , which renders it harmless , though biologically inactive , at least for a time .
At the site of tumors cells there is an unzipping enzyme ( glucuronidase ) that uncouples resveratrol from glucuronate .
This is nature ’s " drug delivery system , " releasing resveratrol at the right time and place .
This explains resveratrol ’s stealthiness .
[ Cancer Letters 231 : 113 — 22 , 2006 ; Oncogene 23 : 6702 — 11 , 2004 ; Toxicology Letters 161 : 1—9 , 2006 ; World Journal Gastroenterology 12 : 5628 — 34 , 2006 ; Investigative Ophthalmology Visual Science 47 : 3708 — 16 , 2006 ; Cancer Detection Prevention 30 : 217-23 , 2006 ; Molecular Cancer Therapy 4 : 554—61 , 2005 ; Journal Biological Chemistry 278 : 41482—90 , 2003 ]
There are currently two human resveratrol / cancer trials underway , one for cancer prevention at the University of Leicester , and one for colon cancer at the University of California , Irvine .
Both trials have passed the safety arm , meaning no overt toxicity .
Cancer patients await the completion of these studies .
Ideas and Inventions by questioning everyday life
Btw i'm not a regular writer or a thinker ( although i use that name to post entries here ) .
This is my first attempt at public writing and blogging .
And it all started with a what if i start writing about ideas .
If this attempt succeeds i owe it to my friends who have convinced me into blogging .
Most people think that great ideas and inventions are generated by a complex chemical reaction that happens in the brain cells of only an elite section of the society who possesses the right chemicals for such a process to occur .
The members of this elite section are calledand the complex chemical process their .
But very rarely do they even question about what makes the geniuses different from them rather than taking it for granted .
And that in itself is the biggest differentiator .
Geniuses question .
They do n't .
Quite some years back I watched a hindi movie where the illustrious Paresh Rawal plays the character of a .
In the movie the character was that of an irritating man who questions the obvious - irrelevantly and unnecessarily - with the aim to tickle the funny bones of the audience .
Although in the reel lifedoes n't portray abut in real life is it quite the other way round .
A Question Mark Man , in real life , is actually one who we know as a Genius .
Although a genius , unlike the movie , does n't irritate others by questioning but questions themselves .
Some of the world 's best discoveries have been made by questioning the obvious .
Would Sir Isaac Newton have discovered the laws of gravity without questioning the falling apple or Archimedes discover principles of buoyancy without questioning the floating bodies ( although it would have been much better , atleast for him , to not think about it while having a bath :-) ) .
What about inventions ?
We all know that discoveries and inventions are different .
Discovery is one of the first steps for any invention .
Invention can be arrived at primarily from two directions - i ) by application of a discovery ii ) finding a solution to an unsolved problem .
Invention of submarines , applying Archimedes ' Principles , is an example of the former and that of internet or the world wide web , a solution to the problem of general communication between various computers , is an example of the latter .
So behind every great discovery and invention there is a process of questioning the obvious rather than thinking hard to come up with a novel thing totally from the scratch .
Actually there is really nothing that is totally novel .
Every new idea that has been generated ever since the origin of mankind till date have actually been by questioning what we see and perceive which was otherwise easily ignored or in attempt to find solution to a problem .is so true .
The great inventors are all geniuses .
But their ingenuity is not in their ability to cook up totally new theories in their mind but their ability to effectively question the things than an average person ignores and follow through with utmost patience and perseverance till they arrive at a plausible explanation and then apply their discoveries for the greater benefit of mankind .
Ingenuity is not a gift to a few selected members of the human species .
It is something that we all are born with .
We use them in various degrees in our day to day life .
Just that we do n't realize it .
We do question and come up with better ways of doing things than others and soon they follow .
How many times have you been in a traffic jam at a junction and said " What if I turn left and take this other route ? " .
You take the turn although you are quite unsure about the new route and you find that all of a sudden there are a few other cars that start following you .
What you had was an idea .
An idea which started off with questioning the obvious that other drivers did n't think of .
But is questioning all that is required ?
No you also need to have the courage , patience and perseverance to go ahead and find the answer to it .
Just questioning the possibility of a new driving route is not enough .
You have to drive on it .
It is not always that you find an answer to what you question .
You may have 100 failures before you even discover something .
You may realize that the idea of taking a new route was a mistake because it had a dead end .
But one big discovery is probably worth a thousand failures .
On the other hand you may have discovered that the new route actually saves you half an hour of driving time everyday during the peak time traffic .
People see and remember the inventors by the success that they had .
But hardly do anyone ponder over the failures that they have gone through .
We know Thomas Alva Edison by his successful inventions but not by his failed inventions .
Inventors are Entrepreneurs .
Entrepreneurs are the risk takers .
High returns almost always comes packaged with high risks .
People who invest in stock markets probably understand this better .
Unless you take the risk , you can never hope for high returns .
Entrepreneur does n't mean only someone who have started their own business .
Anyone who questions the obvious , strives hard to find a solution , is unperturbed by the failures but is constantly fuelled by the passion to solve the unsolved and has the courage to take risks for the high returns ( definition of high returns is tied to the expectations and hence varies from person to person ) is an entrepreneur .
We all have the ability to become entrepreneurs in various modes of life .
We need to start by questioning even the most trivial of things and try to come up with better approaches .
This blog is all about generating ideas by questioning things .
Not that we will come up with revolutionary concepts but nevertheless we will try .
Feel free to submit your thoughts and ideas as comments here .
Lets all have aon our foreheads .
Lets all become
Hyperfast and lightweight templating for the Python platform .
Home | Community | Documentation | Download
Mako Templates for Python
Mako is a template library written in Python .
It provides a familiar , non-XML syntax which compiles into Python modules for maximum performance .
Mako 's syntax and API borrows from the best ideas of many others , including Django and Jinja2 templates , Cheetah , Myghty , and Genshi .
Conceptually , Mako is an embedded Python ( i.e. Python Server Page ) language , which refines the familiar ideas of componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most straightforward and flexible models available , while also maintaining close ties to Python calling and scoping semantics .
Mako is used by reddit.com where it delivers over one billion page views per month .
It is the default template language included with the Pylons and Pyramid web frameworks .
Nutshell :
< % inherit file= " base.html " /> < % rows = [ [ v for v in range ( 0 , 10 ) ] for row in range ( 0 , 10 ) ] %> < table > % for row in rows : $ { makerow ( row ) } % endfor </ table > <% def name= " makerow ( row ) " > < tr > % for name in row : < td > $ { name } </td > \ % endfor </tr > </ % def >
Philosophy :
Python is a great scripting language .
Do n't reinvent the wheel ... your templates can handle it !
Features :
Super - simple API .
For basic usage , just one class , Template is needed : from mako .
template import Template print ( Template ( " hello $ {data} ! " ) . render ( data = " world " ) )
For filesystem management and template caching , add the TemplateLookup class .
is needed : For filesystem management and template caching , add the class .
Super fast .
As templates are ultimately compiled into Python bytecode , Mako 's approach is extremely efficient , and was originally written to be just as fast as Cheetah .
Today , Mako is very close in speed to Jinja2 , which uses a similar approach and for which Mako was an inspiration .
Standard template features control structures constructed from real Python code ( i.e. loops , conditionals ) straight Python blocks , inline or at the module - level plain old includes
Callable blocks two types - the tag provides Python def semantics , whereas the tag behaves more like a Jinj a2 content block .
can access variables from their enclosing scope as well as the template 's request context can be nested arbitrarily can specify regular Python argument signatures outer - level callable blocks can be called by other templates or controller code ( i.e. " method call " )
Calls to functions can define any number of sub - blocks of content which are accessible to the called function
This is the basis for nestable custom tags .
Inheritance supports " multi-zoned " inheritance - define any number of areas in the base template to be overridden using or .
supports " chaining " style inheritance - call next. body ( ) to call the " inner " content .
the full inheritance hierarchy is navigable in both directions ( i.e. parent and child ) from anywhere in the chain .
inheritance is dynamic !
Specify a function instead of a filename to calculate inheritance on the fly for every request .
Full - Featured filters , such as URL escaping , HTML escaping .
Markupsafe is used for performant and secure HTML escaping , and new filters can be constructed as a plain Python callable .
complete caching system , allowing caching to be applied at the page level or individual block / def level .
The caching system includes an open API that communicates with dogpile .
cache by default .
New cache backends can be added with ease via setuptools entrypoints .
Supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 and above .
Supports Google App Engine .

A surprising study published last year in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs reported that hypnotism could be used to induce a realistic experience of being high on MDMA ( aka ‘ ecstasy ’ ) in people who had taken the drug before .
An extended nondrug MDMA - like experience evoked through posthypnotic suggestion J Psychoactive Drugs .
2006 Sep;38(3):273-83 .
Hastings A
This research explored whether hypnotic suggestion could produce a subjective mindbody condition similar to that produced by the psychoactive drug methylenedioxy methamphetamine ( MDMA , Ecstasy ) .
Twelve participants received posthypnotic instructions to re-experience an MDMA - like state posthypnotically , similar to one in their prior experience , for one hour .
Three separate self report measures and qualitative self reports showed that the posthypnotic condition effectively mimicked an MDMA - like experience , lasting an hour at a stable level .
Participant ratings in real time and in retrospect ranged from 36 % to 100 % similarity to a drug - induced experience .
The qualitative reports and rating scales enabled a phenomenological description of the subjective experience .
Scores on the Tellegen Absorption Scale correlated significantly with the strength of the posthypnotic condition ( Spearman rho .87 , p = .0003 ) .
The participants successfully carried out various intentional activities during this time ( e.g. , self reflection , talking with partners about relationships , artwork , walking in nature ) .
Applications for this technique as an adjunct to therapy and health treatments are discussed .
It ’s interesting to speculate how this effect occurs .
A brain imaging study has shown that in patients with Parkinson ’s disease who take regular medication for the condition , a placebo actually causes the brain the mimic the effects of the medication .
Perhaps the participants hypnotised to believe they are re-experiencing the effects of MDMA genuinely re-experience the neurochemical effects of the drug to some degree .

The second page of the Israeli presentation obtained by the Electronic Intifada
Now ,
The Electronic Intifada has obtained an Israeli Ministry of Defense Powerpoint presentation which provides a frightening glimpse into the mindset of the bureaucracy of apartheid .
The first page of the document bears the name “ Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories ” as well as the acronym “ COGAT ” at the bottom of each page .
These appear to refer to the unit of the Israeli army that enforces the occupation against the Palestinian civilian population .
The top of the first slide also bears the names and insignia of the “ State of Israel ” and the “ Ministry of Defense . ”
Dated January 12 , the presentation is titled “ Key Measures for easing the daily lives of the Palestinian Population . ”
Far from that , the document provides detail of the regime of severe movement restrictions , bureaucratic ethnic cleansing and political manipulation and fostering of collaborators that Israel operates in the the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip .
The document , in English , appears to be genuine .
While its exact purpose or audience is not known , it may have been designed to impress foreign diplomats with Israel ’s generosity to the Palestinians .
The fourth page of the presentation
Efforts to “ empower Abu - Mazen ” ( Palestinian Authority chairman Mahmoud Abbas ) by facilitating entry of “ security equipment for the Presidential Guard ” donated by foreign countries .
( The United States recently announced that it would provide millions of dollars of weapons and equipment to this unit which serves as a personal militia for Abbas and his Fatah faction who seek to overthrow the democratically - elected Hamas government ) .
Providing special privileges for “ the movement of VIP s and senior Palestinians ” and others allies of Abbas , including “ facilitating movement without security checks . ”
These special privileges , not available to millions of Palestinians are intended for “ Strengthening Abu - Mazen , ” presumably at the expense of the democratically - elected Hamas - led cabinet and legislative council dozens of whose members , far from enjoying VIP treatment , have been kidnapped and are being held without charge or trial by Israeli occupation forces .
Special permits for 505 Palestinian “ businessmen , ” allowing them to be exempt from the pass laws that forbid overnight stays by Palestinians in Israel .
They will also be subject to fewer security checks .
This privileged class may also benefit from the “ Possible return of $ 60 Million from the frozen tax money to the private sector , subject to identification of the businessman , and the formation of a working mechanism . ”
This could possibly indicate that Israel , in collusion with Abbas , seeks to misappropriate Palestinian public assets it has illegally seized , bypassing the Palestinian Authority Finance Ministry and redistributing them to Abbas cronies .
With frightening precision , allowing “ 42,899 ” Palestinian laborers to work “ in Israel and the settlements ” and exempting 2,000 Palestinian agricultural laborers from the pass laws so that “ overnight stay in Israel ” is “ permitted . ”
Of these workers , a mere 1,600 would be permitted to enter occupied East Jerusalem , the largest Palestinian city in the West Bank .
The eighth page of the presentation
Millions of Palestinians around the world are forbidden from visiting or living in their country due to Israeli restrictions and laws that discriminate against non-Jews .
A privileged few Palestinians have been able to do so , however , by virtue of their citizenship in the United States or European countries , whose citizens are generally allowed to enter Israel without visas as tourists .
Even this precarious existence has recently been threatened by the new Israeli practice of denying them re-entry if they leave the country for any reason .
While the document claims these restrictions will be eased , it also confirms the policy of prohibiting ordinary family life for Palestinians .
Palestinians ( always referred to as “ foreign nationals ” ) with foreign passports , even those with spouses and families Israel does recognize as residents , will be limited to a total cumulative stay not exceeding 27 months in their country .
No other country calling itself a democracy systematically treats indigenous people as foreigners and deports them in this manner breaking apart families in the process .
Finally , the document lists a number of catergories of “ humanitarian ” workers who will be given some leeway from the strict pass laws .
These include 1,450 religious personnel , 1,300 hospital employees , 300 hotel workers , and lawyers , teachers and residents of an enclave in occupied East Jerusalem that has been besieged by settlers and the apartheid wall .
Amidst a system of ruthless and obsessive control such as the one Israel operates against Palestinians , not even this token ‘ easing ’ designed purely for public relations can be taken for granted ; Israel routinely lies about what it does .
For example , during a summit meeting with Mahmoud Abbas in December , Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert promised to remove dozens of checkpoints and obstacles impeding the movement of Palestinians inside the occupied West Bank .
The Israeli occupation forces later claimed to have removed 44 of the hundreds of obstacles in fulfillment of Olmert ’s pledge .
In fact , the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz reported on January 22 , the Israeli army “ admitted on Sunday that the 44 dirt obstacles it said had been removed from around West Bank villages did not actually exist . ”
What does exist , and is plain for all the world to see , is a horrifying regime of totalitarian control of millions of Palestinians who remain prisoners of Israel ’s racist system and the army and settler militias that enforce it .
" Billy " vs. God Swedes Trust IKEA
More than the Church
What do Volvo , Ericsson , Saab and IKEA have in common ?
The people of Sweden have more faith in them than in the church .
Christopher Bollyn , Investigative Journalist For American Free Press
It 's after 2 a .m. in the morning , my deadline is tomorrow , and I have been beaten up by the local police and my right elbow is sorely hurting , but I need to write down exactly what happened to me today before I go to sleep .
Otherwise I will forget important details .
I was harassed , beaten , and shocked with a Tazer - like gun in my front yard before my wife and children , and then abused for 6 hours by the ADL - trained local police .
I have every reason to believe it is because of my journalistic investigation into 9/11 .
I have been threatened before in my career as a journalist , but this is the first time I have been intentionally beaten and abused ­ by the cops .
I have investigated 9/11 since it happened and looked into the many unanswered questions of the terror attacks .
I discovered last year that I had had at least two FBI informants crawling around my house for years .
This is the main reason I do not feel safe in the United States .
It is also why I spend much of the time in Europe or at safe houses in this country , with fellow 9/11 researchers like Ellen Mariani and Eric Hufschmid .
I have two small children .
I have only been at my old home in Hoffman Estates for a couple of weeks , mainly because my road - weary children dearly love this old red house , which is the only home they have ever known .
It is just a simple Hoffman - Rosner suburban Chicago tract home that my late parents bought in 1957 , but it 's home .
I had noticed an unusual amount of police activity around my house since I returned .
We live on a quiet side street where one might normally see a police cruiser once or twice a week .
Since I returned I have noticed all kinds of police cars and devices in the immediate proximity of my house .
But yesterday there was something very unusual around my house .
It was an unmarked car with three armed men with body armor driving around my block as I rode my bike to the store .
Who in the heck is that ?
I thought to myself .
It looks like they are going to my house , but I wo n't be there , I thought .
Then today , the same time and the same car with three men passed slowly by my house where the neighborhood kids were playing .
" Hello , FBI , " I said from my porch and waved .
The man in the front passenger seat waved back .
I immediately alerted my wife and kids .
Helje said I should stop them and ask them what they want .
For background , today I was working on two rather big stories and I made a lot of phone calls to the Embassy of Israel , the S.E.C. , the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York , and to an old Israeli living in New York who I have suspicions may be a key player in 9/11 .
I 'd like to discuss this lead but I can't at this point .
All of my calls were about 9/11 related , except for the calls to the Embassy and local consulate of Israel .
These were standard journalistic inquiries about Israel casualties and losses in Lebanon .
The Embassy press department did n't like my questions , but I told them it 's my job .
I wanted to know about the number of dead and wounded and if 60 Merkava tanks had been taken out , as Hezbollah claims .
Then I also asked where exactly the two Israeli soldiers had been abducted .
I told them that there were at least 15 newswire stories that said the soldiers had been captured in the Lebanese village of Aitaa al - Shaab ­ inside Lebanon .
He was surprised to hear that , too .
Apart from my un -disclosable investigation , the other calls were about how Jacob " Kobi " Alexander was able to flee with more than $ 60 million dollars last week , several months after it was public knowledge that he and the other Israelis working with Comverse Technology , Ltd. had swindled hundred of millions through fraudulent stock options trades .
This has been going on for years , and The Wall Street Journal and Globes ( Israel ) reported the names and the amounts last March .
For crying out loud , my newspaper , American Free Press , reported it in April 2005 .
I wanted to know from the SEC and the U.S. Attorney 's office how this Kobi Alexander was able to wire $ 60 million to his account in Israel and flee New York without any body stopping him .
" If I wired $ 5 million to Norway the whole NSA and FBI would be all over me , " I said .
The U.S. Attorney 's office said they " expect " Kobi will turn himself in .
Note to the wise : Do n't count on it .
Kobi Alexander was one of the owners and developers of Odigo software which allowed Israelis to communicate instantly on 9/11 .
It was via the " buddy system " on Odigo software , which allows one to communicate to a large group of people that share a trait , such as the Hebrew language , that thousands of Israelis were warned not to go to the twin towers on 9/11 .
Kobi Alexander 's Mossad - linked company , Comverse Technology , was a developer and owner of Odigo since early 2000 , something The New York Times does not consider to be part of " All the News that 's Fit to Print . "
Comverse makes a black box system called the " Audio Disk " that police , intelligence and security agencies , and governments around the world , have attached to their phone networks .
This simple device allows the Israeli employees of Comverse back in Tel Aviv to hear and intercept all the data being exchanged by these naive agencies ... everything .
Hello ...?
I had finished all of my calls and watched the first part of the Lou Dobb 's news program on CNN and was on my way to the store , when I stepped out on the stoop and saw this threatening dark car full of obvious agents of some sort .
I immediately warned my wife and kids and rode the bike to the store .
Something is not right , I said to myself , and I stopped at the local wine shop and asked to use the phone .
I called 911 and told them that a strange car with armed men is driving around my neighborhood for no apparent reason .
I was told that a police car would meet me at my house in 20 minutes .
I was just in my house a few minutes when the very same suspicious car stopped in front of my house and three armor - clad men stood on my driveway .
I had just been calling the police department and put down the phone .
I was more than a little surprised to see these armor - clad thugs on my driveway .
My wife and 8 - year old daughter were already there and I asked these men who they were and why they were harassing my street .
Why are you driving around with this unmarked car around my house , I asked ?
Who are you , anyway ?
They were not at all willing to identify themselves and were very confrontational , to say the least .
I ran to my front door to call my brother when the three of them tackled me and shocked me with some sort of stun - gun .
The three men then sat on me and pushed my face in the dirt , handcuffed me and put me in their car .
Remember , I had called 911 because of a suspicious car in my neighborhood , a neighborhood I have known since 1957 , when my parents helped found this town .
I have two small children , after all , and this car looked very threatening to me .
This is what I call my normal neighborhood obligations , but I discovered that they are actually watching us .
They even joked about it at the station later .
" We are watching you , " they said .
It should be noted that my neighborhood does not have any crime or gangs or anything of that nature that would warrant an undercover squad to patrol around my house day after day .
This is why it is so suspicious .
And why are they patrolling around my house ?
As they pummeled me , my wife was pleading for me and my daughter was crying .
I really wanted my brother , my neighbors , and my son to come help me but before even one minute had passed there were dozens of cops and firemen in my front yard .
Where did they all come from so quickly ?
How were so many police in my neighborhood at the same time ?
This is most unusual , as Hoffman Estates is spread out all over northwest Cook County , but there were at least 5 squad cars and at least 10 officers in my front yard within one minute of my being beaten up on my lawn .
Sitting in the squad car with handcuffs on is when the private abuse began .
Officer Fitzgerald indulged in offending me , my late mother , a village pioneer , and then threatened to beat me .
When another officer came to the car , he told me that this guy was going to beat the ---- out of me .
When I repeated what he said word for word , he would say , " I did n't say that . "
He then started to drive me to the station , which is about three miles away from the old village center where I live .
Bombarded with continuous verbal abuse , when I would say something from the back - seat he would slam on the brakes so that my head hit the plexi - glass separation window .
Typical Chicago cop torture treatment ; rough the guy up on the way to the station .
This is exactly the kind of thing that I ran against when I ran for mayor of this town in 2001 .
I decided to lean back on the seat and not say another word .
When we got to the station , there was a host of white - gloved cops waiting for me in the police garage .
When Officer Fitzgerald drove in to the garage , he told the 10 - 12 waiting cops : " He says cops are a bunch of ..
You can take care of him now . "
When they took me out , I informed them that I am a journalist and will write about their treatment .
The verbal abuse now came from all sides .
They told me I should get out of town , etc .
I told them that my dear parents had founded Hoffman Estates , but they did n't care .
When I was in the station they forcibly stripped off my belt and tore of my shirt leaving me clad only in shorts and undershirt .
I asked why I was being detained and they told me that I had resisted arrest and threatened the police with my fists , two complete lies .
I was never the subject of any arrest .
I had called to police to report a suspicious vehicle driving around my home !
I was thrown into a cell with no water .
I asked for a drink of water and was told , " Drink from the toilet . "
Why am I being treated this way , I wondered ?
At midnight , an officer came to my cell and asked if I could pay $ 100 to get out .
What I am being charged with , I asked ?
I called the police and they beat me up in my front yard , I protested .
What did I do to deserve that ?
My older brother had posted bail and shortly after midnight , I was pushed out onto the street with a good two - mile walk home .
I am shocked at how I was treated , because although my journalism gets me into trouble with police in many places , I have never been treated so brutally in my life .
I honestly believe this brutal treatment is connected to my 9/11 research .
I intend to seek asylum in Norway or Switzerland .
I can read the writing on the wall .
Investigative journalists are not safe in Iraq ­ or the United States .
The other day , while administering the Free Our Data blog ( freeourdata.org.uk / blog if you have n't stopped by yet ) , I came across an unusual piece of comment spam - a remark left on one of the blog posts .
It was advertising a site offering share tips .
No surprise there : " pump and dump " spam , as we 've pointed out , has become a principal form of email spam , and spammers seem to have found that people are searching for share advice online ( a worrying enough thought on its own ) .
The surprise was that despite the automated defences to prevent such junk being posted by a machine , it had got through .
The junk filter stops hundreds of such attempted spams daily without a murmur ; so far it 's stopped 10,000 spams while allowing 377 human comments .
So why had this got through ?
The electronic trail explained : the " captcha " ( Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ) had been filled in .
The captcha is the junk filter 's last resort .
Because it 's easy and cheap to program machines to post any sort of junk on blogs , a captcha ( which puts numbers or letters in an image , which a machine in theory can't read ) shows whether you 've got a real live person giving their thoughts , or just a dumb machine trying to up some spammer 's search - engine ranking .
If the captcha was filled in , it must have been done by a person ; if it had been done by a machine , the spammers would have cracked the problem of solving captchas and would be busily spamming every blog they could find .
So who had done this ?
The junk filter had recorded their IP ( internet ) address .
It resolved to somewhere in India .
Which rang a bell : earlier this year , I spoke with someone who does blog spamming for a living - a very comfortable living , he claimed .
But he said that the one thing that did give him pause was the possibility that rival blog spammers might start paying people in developing countries to fill in captchas : they could always use a bit of western cash , would have the spare time and , increasingly , cheap internet connections to be able to do such tedious ( but paid ) work .
A few days later I read a stunning report by George Packer in the New Yorker magazine - regrettably , it 's not online - about the sprawling mega- city of Lagos in Nigeria .
It 's the world 's sixth largest city , and growing fast ; the concept of urban planning has collapsed and life is eked out from the margins of existence .
Corruption is n't an occasional hazard ; it underpins a near - feudal society .
While there , Packer was approached by one of his guides , who offered him the promise of riches looted from a despot ; the classic Nigerian scam .
Packer declined politely , attaching no blame to his would - be scammer : " He would have been regarded locally as a fool if he had n't tried to exploit [ me ] , " he noted without rancour .
Elsewhere this week , deliveries began of the hand - powered laptop , Nicholas Negroponte 's computing gift to the developing world .
I 've no doubt it will radically alter the life of many in the developing world for the better .
I also expect that once a few have got into the hands of people aching to make a dollar , with time on their hands and an internet connection provided one way or another , we 'll see a significant rise in captcha - solved spam .
But , as my spammer contact pointed out , it 's nothing personal .
You have to understand : it 's just business .
· In January I suggested that " spam has passed its peak " .
Oh well .
I guess I 'll have to sit in the corner with Bill Gates , who declared in January 2004 that " spam will be solved in two years " .
After you with the pointy - D hat , Bill .

Simply put , as one of my friends said , " Bush has lost the world . "
What my friends described was not a mere rise of anti-Americanism amongst the world 's publics , such as was discussed here :
No , what my friends sketched for me was much more profound and far more troubling : a reaction to the Bush regime 's Iraq and Iran follies that is impelling Russia , China , and Germany into an unprecedented level of co-operation .
Remember back in March and April , when Bush himself appeared in public for live , unrehearsed Q and A's for what we thought was part of an effort to halt his steep decline in public approval ratings ?
At the same time , Russian President Vladimir Putin was visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing for two days .
The two leaders signed nearly 30 agreements , putting the finishing touches on a political , economic and technological alliance that is a historic shift in the geo-political alignment of the globe .
But the summit between Putin and Hu Jintao received nary a mention in the U.S. news media .
You have to step back and think about this a minute ( or have a long dinner and a few drinks with certain residents of Falls Church , Virginia ) for the full weight to sink in .
Two of the world 's most powerful nations , which have historically been at each other 's throats , have reacted to what the U.S. has done under Bush , by agreeing to settle their border disputes ( full demarcation is slated for next year ) , AND by forging ahead with a framework for a solid alliance of cooperation and shared progress .
In fact , Putin and Hu Jintao have met FIVE times in the past year .
In July 2005 , they issued a joint statement denouncing " the pursuit of monopoly or domination of world affairs , " a remark clearly aimed at the U.S .
About three to four weeks after the most recent Putin - Hu Jintao summit ( I therefore assume three to four weeks to be the amount of time it takes for the conservative ideologues running the United States to become conscious of the fact that some one is poking them in the belly with a sharp stick ) , Vice - President Dick Cheney created an international furor with his undiplomatic and impolitic May 4 remarks about Russia and Putin .
Cheney 's remarks are likely to be seen by future historians as the opening shots in a new phase of the conservatives ' " long war . "
( Do n't hold your breath waiting for similar remarks by Cheney regarding China ; the Chinese have too much leverage over the U.S. economy in the form of their supplying basic consumer commodities such as shoes and electronics , and their holdings of U.S. debt . )
Just a few days ago , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Viktorovich Lavroy was in Peking again .
The online version of the Daily News & Analysis of India reports :
http://www.dnaindia.com/...
On his current tour of duty to China , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Viktorovich Lavroy noted on Tuesday that his country 's relationship with China had " reached an unprecedented level . "
He made his comments as the two giants , both of whom share an anxiety over US militarist policies and both of whom have veto power in the UN Security Council , reiterated their calibrated stand on the Iran nuclear standoff : China and Russia , he said , would not vote for the use of force in resolving the issue , and would instead favour dialogue and diplomacy .
This unambiguous articulation of policy places them diametrically opposite to the course of action preferred by the US ... snip Moscow and Beijing have built on their economic relationship , which is founded on China 's need for Russian oil and natural gas , raw materials as well as weapons , and elevated it to a level where there is an increasing congruence to their worldviews ....
Where does Germany fit into this ?
You mean besides the energy deals between Germany and Russia ?
China is industrializing as rapidly as it can , with little regard at present for social and environmental consequences .
Who is designing and constructing all those new factories being built so frantically ?
According to my friends , there are over 400 German companies doing the great bulk of that work in China .
Hmm , and you were wondering why Germany 's new chancellor , Angela Merkel , was in China just a week ago .
The online edition of the Asia Times http://www.atimes.com/...
recently had an article entitled , " Germany , Russia redraw Europe 's frontiers " which reported that Polish Defense Minister Radek Sikorski made remarks to a conference of European and North American leaders in Brussels
intended to draw the attention of the trans -Atlantic leaders to the lengthening shadows of the Russian - German ties across the vast landscape of Central and Eastern Europe and Eurasia ( and even stretching all the way to China ) that are steadily , inexorably reconfiguring the international system .
Given that the German economy is rebounding as Europe 's No 1 powerhouse and given Russia 's growing status as the 21st century 's energy superpower - and not the least of all , China 's phenomenal rise - a lineup involving the three countries would profoundly impact Euro - Atlanticism .
The rest of the article has all the details you could want about the energy deals between Germany and Russia .
What about the rest of the world ?
We all know how the U.S. is now in the process of " losing South America . "
http://www.foreignaffairs.org/... ( again , note the China angle )
In India , no one is particularly happy about the closer relations with the U.S. Bush tried to forge two months ago , even if it gives India access to U.S. nuclear technology ( which is outmoded , anyway ) .
India is one of the countries where the fruits of Bush / conservative ideology -- the ongoing re-alignment of global geo-politics - is going to cost the U.S. dearly , because it is giving China more maneuvering room on the world stage .
The Chinese Communist Party is furtively supporting the small but very active group of Maoists in India , who are shifting the tone and frames of reference of politics in India , much as the conservatives have done in the U.S. since Barry Goldwater 's 1964 defeat .
Iran and Afghanistan are the pivot of the world geo-political re-alignment .
Part of the cost of Bush and company 's strategic blunder in Iraq is that they left unfinished the good work they had started in Afghanistan .
The result is that the Afghan economy is a shambles and increasingly dependent on poppy production for the making of opium and heroin , the political strength of the warlords is increasing outside of Kabul , the Taliban is resurging in the border areas , and the population has grown weary of the unfulfilled promises of the shrinking " coalition of the willing . "
http://news.scotsman.com/...
In Iran , my friends said that in the mid-1990s , the U.S. and its ( former ) European allies had successfully created a republican ( with small " r " ) movement in Iran that was poised to reduce , if not completely replace , the power of the mullahs .
That republican movement in Iran was crushed virtually overnight by Bush 's " Axis of Evil " State of the Union address in 2002 .
That reference to Iraq , Iran , and North Korea as an " Axis of Evil " is a frightening case study of how policy is made in the Bush administration .
In his insiders ' account of the U.S. preparations for the invasion of Iraq , Plan of Attack , Bob Woodward recounts how the term " axis of hatred " was included in the State of the Union address by Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson after asking conservative author David Frum " to come up with a sentence or two summing up the case for going after Iraq . "
Gerson changed " axis of hatred " to " axis of evil . "
Condoleezza Rice and Stephen Hadley then suggested including Iran and North Korea by name , in order to " protect " the secrecy of then ongoing Iraq war planning .
( See Plan of Attack , pages 86 to 91 . )
Bush 's mention of Iran as part of an axis of evil thus was a small part of a major speech that had no input from the professional diplomats at the State Department or the spymasters at the CIA .
But this small part had major repercussions inside Iran , where the terms of political debate shifted in the mullahs ' favor literally overnight , derailing the republican movement that had been slowly and painstakingly nurtured over nearly a decade .
The ideological blinders and mis-steps of the Bush regime also carry a high price tag here at home .
My friends ' description of the demoralization of State and CIA careerists made my chest constrict painfully .
Career diplomats , foreign service officers , and analysts realize they have been deliberately frozen out of policy making and have lost all hope of having any influence in the Bush administration and of turning around what they see as a series of mounting disasters .
One friend said simply , " Everybody at State goes home each night and starts drinking . "
My other friend said the same applies to the CIA .
I would like to reinforce Markos ' message about Democratic candidates NOT running against Bush , or even the Bush regime 's incompetence .
http://www.dailykos.com/...
The one third of the American people that remain solidly for Bush see the federal government bureaucracy as one of the major obstacles to their vision of " renewing " America .
They WANT government careerists shoved aside and kept out of the making and implementation of policy ,
As Markos said :
What you are seeing is the failure of right - wing conservatism .
The failures since 2000 are not Bush , or Cheney , or incompetence ; they are the logical end result of their philosophy of government .
When you vote for people who believe government is the problem , this is the government you get .
Auditory Eavesdropping
In the information age , surveillance is n’t just for the police .
Marketers want to watch you , too : what you do , where you go , what you buy .
Integrated Media Measurement , Inc. wants to know what you watch and what you listen to — wherever you are .
They do this by turning traditional ratings collection on its head .
Instead of a Nielsen - like system , which monitors individual televisions in an effort to figure out who ’s watching , IMMI measures individual people and tries to figure out what they ’re watching ( or listening to ) .
They do this through specially designed cell phones that automatically eavesdrop on what ’s going on in the room they ’re in :
The IMMI phone randomly samples 10 seconds of room audio every 30 seconds .
These samples are reduced to digital signatures , which are uploaded continuously to the IMMI servers .
IMMI also tracks all local media outlets actively broadcasting in any given designated media area ( DMA ) .
To identify media , IMMI compares the uploaded audio signatures computed by the phones with audio signatures computed on the IMMI servers monitoring TV and radio broadcasts .
IMMI also maintains client - provided content files , such as commercials , promos , movies , and songs .
By matching the signatures , IMMI couples media broadcasts with the individuals who are exposed to them .
The process takes just a few seconds .
Panel Members may sometimes delay watching or listening to a program by using satellite radio , DVRs , VCRs , or TiVo .
IMMI captures these viewings with a “ look - back ” feature that recognizes when a Panel Member is exposed to a program outside of its normal broadcast hour , and then goes back in time ( roughly two weeks ) to identify it .
These cell phones are given away to test subjects , who get free service in exchange for giving up all their privacy .
I ’m sure the company will claim not to actually eavesdrop on in - room conversations , or cell phone conversations .
And just how different are these special phones , anyway ?
Can the software be installed on off - the - shelf phones ?
Can it be done without the owner ’s knowledge or consent ?
The potential for abuse here is enormous .
Remember , the threats to privacy in the information age are not solely from government ; they ’re from private industry as well .
And the real threat is the alliance between the two .

A key part of the brain involved in processing emotionally influenced memories acts differently in men and women , even in the absence of stimuli , UC Irvine researchers have found .
Larry Cahill , an associate professor of neurobiology and behavior , and Lisa Kilpatrick , a former postdoctoral fellow in his laboratory , have found that the amygdala , an almond - shaped structure found on both sides of the brain , behaves very differently in males and females while the subjects are at rest .
In men , the right amygdala is more active and shows more connections with other regions of the brain , even when there is no outside stimulus .
Conversely , in women , the left amygdala is more connected with other regions of the brain .
In addition , the regions of the brain with which the amygdala communicates while a subject is at rest are different in men and women .
The finding could be key to determining why gender - related differences exist in certain psychiatric disorders and how to treat a variety of illnesses .
The study appears in this week ’s issue of NeuroImage .
“ These findings are intriguing because they provide the first hint of what could be a fundamental difference in how the brain is wired in men and women , ” said Cahill , a fellow at UCI ’s Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory .
“ If , even in a resting state , the brain shows such differences between the sexes , it could have far - reaching implications for our study of certain psychiatric and medical disorders . ”
The researchers used Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) scans to analyze the brains of 72 healthy , right - handed adults ( 36 men and 36 women ) .
The subjects were instructed to relax with their eyes closed while being scanned .
When the scans were later studied , researchers found that not only was there a difference between the men and women as to which hemisphere 's amygdala was more active , but also that the regions of the brain that the amygdala “ talked ” with were also quite different .
In men , the right - hemisphere amygdala showed more connectivity with brain regions such as the visual cortex and the striatum .
In contrast , the left amygdala in women was more connected to regions such as the insular cortex and the hypothalamus .
The finding led to an unexpected discovery : Many brain areas communicating with the amygdala in men are engaged with and responding to the external environment .
For example , the visual cortex is responsible for vision , while the striatum coordinates motor actions .
Conversely , many regions connected to the left - hemisphere amygdala in women control aspects of the environment within the body .
Both the insular cortex and the hypothalamus , for example , receive strong input from the sensors inside the body .
“ Throughout evolution , women have had to deal with a number of internal stressors , such as childbirth , that men have n’t had to experience , ” Cahill said .
“ What is fascinating about this is the brain seems to have evolved to be in tune with those different stressors . ”
Cahill believes this study could be the basis for a fuller understanding and treatment of a number of disorders that affect one gender or the other .
For example , in the study , one of the brain areas communicating with the amygdala in women is implicated in disorders such as depression and irritable bowel syndrome , which predominantly affect women .
Cahill has led the way in exploring gender - related differences in the brain .
In a 2001 study , he showed that the sexes use different sides of their brains to process and store long - term memories .
In another study in 2002 , he demonstrated how a particular drug , propranolol , can block memory differently in men and women .
Researchers from Vanderbilt University and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis also participated in this study , funded by the Department of Veteran Affairs and by a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health .

Introduction
The amount of RAM used to be the limitation for the number of applications you can open at any one time .
Even with the use of virtual memory , there was a practical limit to the number of applications you can open .
But today , having 1GB to 2GB of memory is not uncommon .
With so much memory , it 's now possible to load up many applications , even memory - guzzling ones like Adobe Photoshop .
Or is that only what we think ?
Believe it or not , even if you have so much memory , you may still encounter problems loading up all the applications you want .
In fact , you may also face problems with the applications that are already running !
The Symptoms
Before we proceed further , ask yourself if you have ever encountered any of the following problems :-
You try to open an application but it refuses to load or it starts to load and then it disappears !
You try to open or use an application but you get an " Out Of Memory " error message !
One of your running applications inexplicably quits !
When you right - click on your application , nothing happens !
The command menu refuses to pop-up !
Your web browser simply refuses to load any more windows or tabs !
Your application is missing some menus or toolbars !
You get the following error messages :
Initialization of the dynamic library < system>\system32\user32.dll failed .
The process is terminating abnormally .
Initialization of the dynamic library < system>\system32\kernel32.dll failed .
The process is terminating abnormally .
A quick check of the Task Manager will usually show plenty of free memory , like in this example .
As you can see , the computer above has 1GB of memory , of which only 58,436 KB has been used by applications and over 500MB allocated to the system cache .
This leaves just over 390 MB of free memory .
But you still wo n't be able to open any more applications !
Why ???
The Problem
The reason why we are all facing this problem is because the system has run out of desktop heap !
The desktop heap is a section of memory reserved for the storage of menus , hooks , strings and windows .
This heap is allocated memory from a fixed 48 MB system buffer that is also used to store printer data and font drivers .
By default , Windows allocates a total of 4.5 MB of memory for the desktop heap .
But if the system ever runs out of space in the desktop heap , it wo n't be able to load new windows .
It 's as simple as that !
Fortunately , the solution is also quite simple .
Let 's take a look !
Are you procrastinating ?
Or are you just thinking ?
| Gadgetopia
I think Deane 's insights on procrastination and programming might actually be even more true of writer 's block and for many of the same reasons .
But perhaps unlike coding , the gestation period of a writing project almost always benefits from a series of very small starts .
While there are dozens of tricks for psyching yourself out of a perceived writing slump , you eventually learn that blocks are sometimes there for a theoretically plausible reason -- because you really have n't figured out what you 're trying to say yet , but suffer crippling anxiety and dread about even committing the " shitty first draft . "
So , as with the programming example , your brain beats itself up for being such a laggard and you may stay locked in creativity - sapping inaction .
But the truth is you 're probably working on it already .
The only way to find out is to start someplace .
Anyplace .
As Neil Fiore wisely points out in his excellent book , The Now Habit , we usually have more than enough information to just start most any job .
Do n't begin by fussing about perfection or the " right " place to start , just start .
You can get help midwifing the process through tools like outlines , mind maps , or talking to a duck .
But , if you 've truly procrastinated even getting to the point where proper gestation and idea seeding can begin , you 're understandably in a bit of trouble .
Because now you have to go straight to producing the artifact ( the code or the article or whatever ) while your brain still craves that extra bit of time to turn it all over .
Like they say , a pregnancy takes nine months , regardless of how many women you 've put on the job .
Do n't slip on a deadline that makes you try to make an infant in one night .
The trick is to find that very first point when some part of your thinking can be converted from uncaptured brain droppings into notes , doodles , outlines , or any kind of markings on a page -- even though it 's clearly not ready to be shaped into a deliverable just yet .
Whether it's your unified field theory of physics or a 50 - word blog post about the molé burrito you just ate , it pays to get something down .
Anything .
In my experience , getting that hand in motion tends to really stimulate creativity .
The rough draft process is where procrastination is finally displaced by clarity , focus , and a fuller understanding of the relationships between the things that have been collecting in your brain pan .
So , next time you accept a job , whether programming , writing , or what have you , do n't wait to get started in even a seemingly trivial way .
Even if you can't start dedicated work on a big project for a month or two , try reading over the raw materials and background information that you have , just to get the shape and texture of the work .
Maybe make a date with wikipedia to get some early background info on your topic .
For a writing assignment , initially capture 5 - 10 bullets that you want to make sure to cover , and then add to the list periodically as things occur to you .
Who knows what your brain could do with an extra four weeks of active percolation time ?
And if you 're sitting there right now procrastinating and catastrophizing : consider how little you have to lose by a few minutes of free writing or 2 fast minutes of making notes on a blank sheet of paper .
Take a modest but physical step to get off the dime , and you may be surprised at how much you already have to say .
Adjust font size :
When Meg Ryan faked an orgasm at the deli in When Harry Met Sally , audiences were embarrassed and a little shocked .
That was 1989 .
Today ?
Orgasms -- real ones -- are everywhere .
The interns on Grey 's Anatomy seem to have them regularly , and Sex and the City 's Samantha thrashes and moans two nights a week -- in prime time !
It 's enough to make the average woman feel like a bit of an underachiever .
While we all suspect that endlessly orgasmic Samantha is n't entirely " normal , " we 're not sure we are , either .
The truth is , only one in four women regularly has an orgasm during intercourse , and a third rarely or never do .
This news may be reassuring -- or depressing .
But what 's healthy when it comes to orgasms , anyway ?
To find out , Health went in search of a sexual reality check and uncovered everything ( well , almost everything ) you 'll ever want to know about the Big O .
It is n't all easy
It 's true that the female orgasm is definitely " hot , " says Dorian Solot , a sex educator and co-author with her partner of the forthcoming " I Love Female Orgasm : From ' Right There ' to ' Oh , Yeah ! ' and Everything in Between . "
" Once upon a time , " says Solot 's partner , Marshall Miller , " a ' real man ' cared only about his own pleasure and ignored female satisfaction entirely . "
No more .
And not a moment too soon , right ?
After all , there 's no question that orgasms are part of a healthy sex life .
When the Earth moves , you 're working those muscles , releasing tension , and bonding with your partner -- all good things .
Yet even as Top 10 lists and titillating TV shows give women 's orgasms the importance they 've lacked for years , sexperts including Solot contend that pop culture does n't quite get it .
For starters , women are n't built like men ( that 's no surprise ) .
And when it comes to orgasm during intercourse , it can be quite a challenge getting all the right parts ( the clitoris , in particular ) lined up for pleasure .
Kind of like Jupiter aligning with Mars .
" The myth of the century is that all women should have orgasms from intercourse , " Solot says .
Julie Kasperson , 46 , of Las Vegas , Nevada , knows the challenge firsthand .
She can climax during oral sex or when being touched , but not during intercourse .
" I used to talk endlessly with my girlfriends about it , " she says .
" I 'd wonder if there was something wrong , or if I was n't doing the right things . "
There 's nothing wrong with Kasperson , who , like 70 percent of women , is n't regularly orgasmic during intercourse .
Most women need clitoral stimulation to climax , and that 's not automatic .
" You can get it if the sexual position allows for friction , " says Laura Berman , Ph.D. , assistant clinical professor of psychiatry and OB - GYN at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University .
But it can take time and practice to find that position .
And if you do n't ?
Berman , who 's also the director of the based Berman Center , a health - care facility in Chicago , Illinois , that helps women improve their sex lives , recommends using a vibrator during intercourse to help you reach orgasm or trying other tricks to boost your sexual satisfaction .
It 's also no secret that some women , some of the time , are satisfied with non-orgasmic sex .
" Orgasm is not the pinnacle for all women , " says psychologist Dennis Sugrue , Ph.D. , a past - president of the American Association of Sex Educators , Counselors , and Therapists .
" The usual model suggests that if the orgasm does n't occur , somehow the sexual experience got derailed .
I do n't think this does us service in terms of understanding women and their sexuality . "
In fact , many women tend to want intimacy and a sense of connection just as much as an orgasm or even more so .
" That is very true , " says sex researcher Beverly Whipple , Ph.D. , author of " The Science of Orgasm . "
" You have to remember that whatever is pleasurable and satisfying can be an end in itself . "
The upshot :
You do n't have to have an orgasm to be satisfied .
But if it 's an orgasm you want , expect the unexpected .
" Orgasms are like snowflakes ; every one is unique , " Solot says .
" They can be more or less intense de-pending on a zillion factors , everything from the kind of stimulation to how long the buildup to how connected you 're feeling . "
The goal is to find out what you like and how to have it your way .
Pressure : A big turn - off
The pressure that women feel to be orgasmic is n't just coming from all the hot sex in the media , Miller says .
It 's also a response to the urging of partners , some well - intentioned and some not .
And that can add up to a lot of pleasure - killing pressure .
" Today , many guys measure their worth " by whether they can make their partner climax , Miller explains .
Toni Ann Johnson , a 38 - year - old writer from Los Angeles , suffered from having an overzealous partner .
" Sex was all about him showing off , " she says .
" I felt like he wanted me to have an orgasm to show how great he was that he could do that . "
The power play backfired , though .
Johnson was anxious , frustrated , and distracted by his narcissism .
The result of all the stress ?
She broke up with the guy and is happier with her current partner .
With him , her orgasm , she says , is " as important to him as it is to me .
Sometimes it 's not important to me .
I do n't always need to have one . "
But when she does , he 's at the ready .
Johnson 's solution was more honest than how some women deal with the pressure .
" There 's an epidemic of women who , for whatever reason -- perhaps mercy for an overenthusiastic partner -- are faking , " Northwestern 's Berman says .
" Men are getting a legacy of fakers in their path , so that with every new relationship , a guy says , ' Every woman I 've been with has reached orgasm with me , so what 's wrong with you ? ' "
Maybe that sounds a little far - fetched , especially for committed couples who think they can talk openly about sex .
But even if you 're happily married , there may be a level of honesty that can bring you closer , a level that only makes sex better .
Sexologists say talking to your partner about orgasm -- what works , what does n't , why having one may not matter -- is an essential part of a healthy sex life .
Johnson used to be really shy about opening up with her partner when it came to her intimate needs .
But she discovered that talking with other women really helped .
In fact , Johnson went so far as to talk about sexual satisfaction on " The O Tapes , " a documentary scheduled to air on Showtime next year that features women 's first - person stories about female orgasm .
" Being part of a forum where there are so many women with similar experiences validated my own , " she says .
" And a lot of men and couples can benefit from hearing so many women talk about what they need sexually . "
The most important sex organ
Let 's assume that orgasm is a part of life you do n't want to live without , whether or not you have one every time .
The key to unlocking your potential , sexologists say , may be what 's happening between your ears , not elsewhere .
" Orgasm can be more a mental response than a physical one , " says Yvonne K. Fulbright , M.S. , a sex educator and author of " Touch Me There !
A Hands - On Guide to Your Orgasmic Hot Spots . "
Indeed , recent research suggests that how emotionally connected you are with your partner can affect the quality of your orgasm .
So whether you 're going to have an orgasm -- and whether you 're actually going to feel good about the one you have -- may have as much to do with how you feel about your partner and yourself as it does with whether everything 's caressed and coddled in the proper fashion ( although that does n't hurt , either ) .
Feeling badly about yourself and your sexuality can be a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Let 's say , for instance , you think you peaked sexually in your 20s or 30s and your body will never achieve the same level of satisfaction .
Those negative thoughts can sabotage your brain and body so that you miss out on decades of pleasure .
" Orgasm is the most vulnerable you can be in front of someone else , " Berman says .
" If you do n't feel safe , if you feel bad about your body , or guilty , it can be difficult for you to let go and release yourself to experience orgasm . "
But if you think of orgasms as something important and wonderful regardless of your age or whether they 're earth - shattering explosions or just tiny blips , then ooh la la .
Even a 2006 Swedish study backs it up : Women of all ages who thought sex was important actually had orgasms more often .
Wendy Olvin ( not her real name ) , 40 , of Portland , Oregon , is much happier now that she understands sexual satisfaction is n't all about the mechanics of the act .
When Olvin 's had trouble achieving orgasm , it was because " my head was n't along for the ride , " she says .
But now she knows that experimenting with erotica , talking to her husband , and having a lot more foreplay can make a difference .
Olvin 's orgasms have gotten better as she 's gotten older .
" Maybe it 's because I know my body so much better , " she says .
" I am no longer afraid to ask for what I need because I know what I need .
How fabulous is that ? "

The changing colors reflect how a brain cell network evolves over time in response to stimuli .

" Time " is the most popular noun in the English language , yet how would we tell time if we did n’t have access to the plethora of watches , clocks and cell phones at our disposal ?
For decades , scientists have believed that the brain possesses an internal clock that allows it to keep track of time .
Now a UCLA study in the Feb. 1 edition of Neuron proposes a new model in which a series of physical changes to the brain ’s cells helps the organ to monitor the passage of time .
" The value of this research lies in understanding how the brain works , " said Dean Buonomano , associate professor of neurobiology and psychiatry at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and a member of the university ’s Brain Research Institute .
" Many complex human behaviors -- from understanding speech to playing catch to performing music -- rely on the brain ’s ability to accurately tell time .
Yet no one knows how the brain does it . "
The most popular theory assumes that a clock - like mechanism – which generates and counts regular fixed movements -- underlies timing in the brain .
In contrast , Buonomano suggests a physical model that operates without using a clock .
He offers an analogy to explain how it works .
" If you toss a pebble into a lake , " he explained , " the ripples of water produced by the pebble ’s impact act like a signature of the pebble ’s entry time .
The farther the ripples travel the more time has passed .
" We propose that a similar process takes place in the brain that allows it to track time , " he added .
" Every time the brain processes a sensory event , such as a sound or flash of light , it triggers a cascade of reactions between brain cells and their connections .
Each reaction leaves a signature that enables the brain - cell network to encode time . "
The UCLA team used a computer model to test this theory .
By simulating a network of interconnected brain cells in which each connection changed over time in response to stimuli , they were able to show that the network could tell time .
Their simulations indicated that a specific event is encoded within the context of events that precede it .
In other words , if one could measure the response of many neurons in the brain to a tone or a flash of light , the response would not only reveal the nature of the event , but the other events that preceded it and when they occurred .
The UCLA team tested the model by asking research volunteers in the study to judge the interval between two auditory tones under a variety of different conditions .
The researchers found that volunteers ’ sense of timing was impaired when the interval was randomly preceded by a " distracter " tone .
" Our results suggest that the timing mechanisms that underlie our ability to recognize speech and enjoy music are distributed throughout the brain , and do not resemble the conventional clocks we wear on our wrists , " said Buonomano .
Because time - related information is critical to understanding speech , determining how the brain tells time represents an important step toward understanding the causes of diseases , such as dyslexia , that result in impaired linguistic abilities , he noted .
The next step for the research will be recording the response from a large number of brain cells to determine whether they encode information about the timing of stimuli .

I ’m not what you ’d call a “ fitness freak . ”
I ’ve spent enough time in gyms to know how the machines work and experience the sensation of building up a sweat , and I practice t’ai chi regularly .
I also do a fair bit of walking around my neighborhood .
But working out for its own sake is not really my idea of a good time .
My disenfranchisement with exercise goes way back .
All throughout school , I was the kid who got picked on in phys .
ed. classes — the last one chosen for teams , the slowest in races , the kid who could n’t do a chin - up if his life depended on it .
The shared trauma of phys .
ed. embarrassments from high school strengthened my bond with my wife .
When we were first dating , I asked her how she felt about exercise , and she replied , “ My motto is : ‘ no pain , no pain . ' ”
A woman after my own heart .
A number of years ago I stumbled across an ad that made me laugh : it was one of those Charles Atlas comic - book ads from the 1930s .
You know the basic idea : the skinny 97 - pound weakling gets sand kicked in his face at the beach , but he ca n’t stand up to the bully so he loses the girl .
Then he sends for Mr. Atlas ’s program and one frame later , he ’s admiring his new body in the mirror .
He goes back to the beach , decks the bully , and gets the girl .
The ad then goes on to show a photo of a smiling Charles Atlas with the caption “ The World ’s Most Perfectly Developed Man . ”
The reason I laughed at the ad was not just that it reflected a long - forgotten advertising style or that Atlas looked goofy in his leopard - skin briefs ; I laughed because the ad was on a website , and after the better part of a century , the program was still being sold .
Curiosity got the better of me and I sent in my US$ 50 .
( The price has since gone up slightly , to $ 54.95 . )
Pages of History
What I got in the mail about two months later was a slim three - ring binder with about 60 photocopied pages inside : the 12 lessons in the original Atlas program , intended to be worked through at the rate of roughly two lessons every two weeks .
These could have been exactly the same pages sent out to skinny kids 30 or 40 years ago , except for the URL and email address at the tops of the pages .
For $ 50 , I would have expected a slightly more modern and professional presentation , but I figured , I ’m not just paying for exercise instructions , I ’m paying for history .
Charles Atlas was born Angelo Siciliano in 1892 and immigrated to the United States from Italy in 1903 .
He was the kid who got sand kicked in his face at the beach .
He decided to do something about it , and got the idea for his special brand of isometric exercises while watching lions stretching at a zoo .
After building his own physique , he saw a statue of the Greek god Atlas at Coney Island and decided to change his name to “ Atlas ” to reflect his new image .
Several years later , he met entrepreneur Charles Roman and the two designed the formal exercise program ( and its advertising campaign ) .
Atlas died in 1972 , but his company has continued selling the instructions to this day .
And just what do the instructions say ?
The core of what Atlas is teaching would now be called Isometric Contraction — exercises in which you put tension on muscles without using machines or free weights .
Instead , you ’re relying on opposition from other muscles .
Along with isometrics are some isotonic exercises ( pushing or pulling on a weight , though in this case , all the weight comes from your own body , as in push - ups ) .
None of this is rocket science : as you increase the amount of resistance , you build muscles , and as your muscles strengthen , you further increase the amount of resistance you ’re able to supply .
Atlas also talks about things like breathing , posture , and proper nutrition — though some of his diet recommendations are a bit suspicious by modern standards — and he has an entire lesson on avoiding constipation .
Weight and See
Fitness experts who have seen the Atlas program typically say it ’s fine as far as it goes .
Of course , there are some muscle groups it does n’t address , and aerobic fitness is basically ignored .
Arguably , the use of machines or weights could yield similar results more quickly or permit someone to advance further , but for people wanting to build muscles on a budget , it ’s an entirely reasonable program .
The only real problem — and the reason my arms still do n’t look like Atlas ’s — is that the exercises are hard .
Or , perhaps I should say , they ’re no easier than any other kind of exercise .
Naturally , they work only if you practice them diligently over an extended period of time .
When I first got the Atlas program in the mail , I did make an honest effort to follow the instructions — for about a week .
Then I gave up , due to laziness , sore arms , and a lack of time and motivation .
Every once in a while I think to myself , “ I should actually go all the way through the program … just to see . ”
Perhaps one day I will .
Of course , I never , ever wanted to have the bodybuilder physique ; I just do n’t find that body shape appealing .
And for me , written instructions and the promise that I ’ll be able to beat up a bully some day are not strong motivators ; if I wanted to build serious muscles , I ’d probably sign up at a gym with a personal trainer .
Still , for all its anachronistic campiness , the Atlas program is really a pretty good idea — good enough to keep selling by the tens of thousands more than 80 years later .

Called the “ Biome ” , the beautiful flora terrarium is controlled exclusively ( climate , water level and nutrients ) via your iPad or other smartphone device .
Wilkinson told MocoLogo that the idea “ promotes ‘ digital downtime ’ by finding an alternative use for smartphones and encouraging their owners to consider a slower life .
The control and nurturing of a real mini eco-system takes patience and care , contrasting with the immediacy of messaging or tweeting that is so characteristic of the smartphone generation . ”
Biome was developed for a recent exhibition titled “ Slow Tech – Designs for Digital Downtime ” .
There ’s no word yet on if the Biome or its companion app will ever see the light of day as a real product
QUOTED OFTEN , FOLLOWED RARELY
Thirty years after he published the " bible of software engineering , " Fred Brooks talks about managing teams of people and why projects so often go wrong .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) – In 1975 , Frederick Brooks published The Mythical Man-Month .
It had no right to succeed .
The book detailed Brooks ' experience managing IBM 's bet - the - company System / 360 computers and OS / 360 software , and featured odd illustrations , an awkward title , and loads of jargon .
Yet Brooks ' deconstruction of what went right and wrong became a must - read among tech and nontech execs ; dog-eared copies are still passed around .
The best known passages expose flaws in the then common use of " man months " -- the tool ( okay , gender - biased tool ) for estimating project cost and length .
A 12 - man - month project might have three people assigned to it for four months ; if delays set in , managers simply added more people .
Brooks proved that doing so increased bureaucracy and training , leading to Brooks ' law : Adding people to a late software project makes it later .
He also laid out new strategies for organizing teams and managing creative types .
In November , Brooks , now 74 and since 1964 a computer science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , explained in his Southern drawl why people still turn to his book for guidance .
Edited excerpts :
It 's been 30 years since you wrote your book .
Is it still relevant ?
People still buy copies to give to their boss .
The book is really more about management than about technology .
The technology has changed immensely , so some of the old chapters are totally out of sync .
On the other hand , people have n't changed much .
That 's why Homer and Shakespeare and the Bible are still relevant , because they 're all dealing with human nature .
I think that 's part of the explanation for this book :
The problems of managing people in teams have not changed , though the medium in which people are designing and the tools they are using have .
Some people have called the book the " bible of software engineering . "
I would agree with that in one respect : that is , everybody quotes it , some people read it , and a few people go by it .
It 's also been influential outside software .
Tell me about that .
Surprisingly enough , a partner in a big law firm said , " Oh , this describes our practice . "
I 've had physicians say the same .
It 's really about people and people in teams : the communication problems , the scheduling problems , the estimating problems .
Does Brooks ' law apply in those industries ?
Brooks ' law depends heavily on the amount of information that has to be communicated .
So the argument is that if you add people to a project that you already know is late , which means you 're at least in the middle of the project , you have to repartition the work .
That 's a job in itself :
Just deciding who is going to do what means that instead of having the thing divided into the units you had it divided into , you have to divide it into more units .
Sometimes that can be done by subdividing the existing units , but sometimes you have to move boundaries .
That 's a lot of work .
The next thing is , you have to train the new people .
Who can train them ?
Only the old people .
So they quit working and go to training .
And the new people are green and have to get up to speed .
So there 's a period where they 're unproductive , and there 's a period when they are less productive .
And there 's a period when they inject errors into the process .
Then there are just more people to communicate to .
So if a project is already late and throwing more people on it is just going to make it worse , how do you solve the problem ?
One is to officially slip the schedule .
And officially doing it has many benefits over unofficially letting it slip .
Peter Fagg , a really wise System / 360 engineering manager , gave very sound advice : " Take no small slips . "
That is , if you 're going to take a slip , get everybody onboard , get organized , and take a six - month slip , even though you may at the moment feel as if you 're only four months late .
The other obvious solution is to lighten the ship : Decide there are some things we 're not going to do .
A third thing is to phase the work : Say , " All right , we 're going to do a version that has just the essentials for the most important or most numerous users . "
Meanwhile schedule and develop the things that should go in version 2 and ship them later .
Sounds like a recipe for Microsoft 's Vista , its long - delayed and now pared - down new operating system .
Does it surprise you that the same mistakes are being made 30 years later ?
No .
People still build bridges that fall in .
That art has two centuries of engineering practice behind it , if not three .
The software engineering discipline is just plain younger than the electrical engineering discipline .
So software is less mature than hardware , and by a whole generation of people .
Also , the median age of the practitioners is probably younger .
What advice would you give to one of those young managers ?
The best single advice is a motto I read on the ceiling of a German drinking fraternity in Heidelberg - - this cave had been there , I guess , since the 16th century .
It said , Numquam incertus ; semper apertus : " Never uncertain , always open . "
Sometimes the first part is put as saying , " You ca n't steer a ship that 's not underway . "
At any given time , you ought to have pretty clear goals , and know where you 're going , and be going there .
On the other hand , you always should be open to saying , " Is that what we really ought to be doing ?
Here 's another idea . "
But sitting still in the water waiting to decide which way to go is the wrong thing to do .
The other was when I was a new IBM employee and heard Vin Learson , a VP at the time , later CEO .
He said , " The problem is not to make the right decision ; it 's to make the decision right . "
I thought that was the most anti-intellectual thing I had about ever heard .
I was fresh out of graduate school , and of course to me , the problem is to make the right decision .
I came to understand that he was talking from an executive - level point of view .
As decisions bubble up they are first 80/20 decisions , then 70/30 , then 60 /40 , and then they are 49/51 decisions .
At that level the arguments on each side are pretty strong ; going either way can be made to work , but it 's very important to pick one and then go whole hog .
A counter - example is IBM 's PL / I language .
They adopted it , they backed it , and then there was a spell when they decided maybe it was n't going to be the language .
And then they decided maybe it was going to be .
As a consequence , most customers did n't stick with it .
The wishy - washiness killed it , I think .
That 's the numquam incertus :
Whatever you 're doing , you 'd better go do it .
Does the rise of open - source projects like Linux challenge some of your more formal organizing principles ?
The advantage of [ open source ] is early , large - scale testing , with lots of people motivated to find the bugs , and a culture in which people communicate fixes to each other .
A second big advantage is that multiple versions of any particular component gets built , and the marketplace votes on them .
In many cases one wins out .
In many cases , one does n't , and different versions circulate .
That 's confusing , and you get compatibility issues .
This model clearly works best when the builders are the clients .
So the question I ask is , Would you want to build an air - traffic - control system that way ?
The answer is no .
That task requires a tighter degree of integration .
Whereas when the community is building tools for itself , it 's advantageous to have different people , with different ideas of what they want to build , build it , and then let the market vote .
Also , as an economic model , the hard problem is how to compensate people .
The reward here is prestige .
There 's no mechanism for ensuring that the creative get fed .
What 's your computer setup today ?
I happily use a Macintosh .
It 's not been equalled for ease of use , and I want my computer to be a tool , not a challenge .
What do your former colleagues think of your being a Mac user ?
I have n't discussed it .

I can read about half of it .
I have mixed feelings about the use of labels to describe philosophical views , whether of myself or others .
It is difficult to avoid doing so because our efforts to understand and communicate about the world necessarily involve the use of words and words are , as Alfred Korzybski warned us , abstractions that never equate with what they are meant to describe .
His oft - quoted statement that " the map is not the territory " offers a caveat whose implications for confusion are further compounded when addressing such abstract topics as political philosophy .
One philosophical abstraction that seems to befuddle most people is " anarchy . "
To those challenged by complexity — such as radio talk show hosts and cable - TV " newscasters " who are convinced that all political opinions can be confined to the categories of " liberal " and " conservative " — the word anarchy evokes an unfocused fear of uncertain forces .
Images of bomb - throwing thugs who smash and burn the property of others are routinely conjured up by politicians and the media to frighten people into an extension of police authority over their lives .
" Disorder " and " lawless confusion " are common dictionary definitions of this word .
That there have been some , calling themselves " anarchists , " who have engaged in violence on behalf of their political ambitions , is not to be denied .
Nor can we overlook the provocateuring occasionally engaged in by undercover policemen — operating under the guise of " anarchists " — to justify harsh reprisals against political protests .
But to condemn a philosophic viewpoint because a few wish to corrupt its meaning for their narrow advantage is no more justifiable than condemning Christianity because a man murders his family and defends his acts on the grounds " God told me to do it ! "
As long as a president continues to rationalize war against the Iraqi people as " operation freedom " ; as long as the Strategic Air Command insists that " peace is our profession " ; and as long as police departments advertise that they are there " to serve and protect , " intelligent minds must be prepared to look behind the superficiality and imagery of words to discover their deeper meaning .
Such is the case with the word " anarchy . "
The late Robert LeFevre made one such effort to transcend the popular meaning of the word when he declared that " an anarchist is anyone who believes in less government than you do . "
But an even better understanding of the concept can be derived from the Greek origins of the word ( anarkhos ) which meant " without a ruler . "
It is this definition of the word that members of the political power structure ( i.e. , your " rulers " ) do not want you to consider .
Far better that you fear the hidden monsters and hobgoblins who are just waiting to bring terror and havoc to your lives should efforts to increase police powers or budgets fail .
Are there murderers , kidnappers , rapists , and arsonists in our world ?
Of course there are , and there will always be , and they do not all work for the state .
It is amazing that , with all the powers and money conferred upon the state to " protect " us from such threats , they continue to occur with a regularity that seems to have increased with the size of government !
Even the current " mad cow disease " scare is being used , by the statists , as a reason for more government regulation , an effort that conveniently ignores the fact that the federal government has been closely regulating meat production for many decades .
Nor can we ignore the history of the state in visiting upon humanity the very death and destruction that its defenders insist upon as a rationale for political power .
Those who condemn anarchy should engage in some quantitative analysis .
In the twentieth century alone , governments managed to kill — through wars , genocides , and other deadly practices — some 200,000,000 men , women , and children .
How many people were killed by anarchists during this period ?
Governments , not anarchists , have been the deadly " bomb - throwers " of human history !
Because of the disingenuous manner in which this word has been employed , I endeavor to be as precise in my use of the term as possible .
I employ the word " anarchy " not as a noun , but as a verb .
I envision no utopian community , no " Galt ’s Gulch " to which free men and women can repair .
I prefer to think of anarchy as a way in which people deal with one another in a peaceful , cooperative manner ; respectful of the inviolability of each other ’s lives and property interests ; resorting to contract and voluntary transactions rather than coercion and expropriation as a way of functioning in society .
I am often asked if anarchy has ever existed in our world , to which I answer : almost all of your daily behavior is an anarchistic expression .
How you deal with your neighbors , coworkers , fellow customers in shopping malls or grocery stores , is often determined by subtle processes of negotiation and cooperation .
Social pressures , unrelated to statutory enactments , influence our behavior on crowded freeways or grocery checkout lines .
If we dealt with our colleagues at work in the same coercive and threatening manner by which the state insists on dealing with us , our employment would be immediately terminated .
We would soon be without friends were we to demand that they adhere to specific behavioral standards that we had mandated for their lives .
Should you come over to our home for a visit , you will not be taxed , searched , required to show a passport or driver ’s license , fined , jailed , threatened , handcuffed , or prohibited from leaving .
I suspect that your relationships with your friends are conducted on the same basis of mutual respect .
In short , virtually all of our dealings with friends and strangers alike are grounded in practices that are peaceful , voluntary , and devoid of coercion .
A very interesting study of the orderly nature of anarchy is found in John Phillip Reid ’s book , Law for the Elephant .
Reid studied numerous diaries and letters written by persons crossing the overland trail in wagon trains going from St. Joseph , Missouri to Oregon and California .
The institutions we have been conditioned to equate with " law and order " ( e.g. , police , prisons , judges , etc. ) were absent along the frontier , and Reid was interested in discovering how people behaved toward one another in such circumstances .
He discovered that most people respected property and contract rights , and settled whatever differences they had in a peaceful manner , all of this in spite of the fact that there were no " authorities " to call in to enforce a decision .
Such traits went so far as to include respect for the property claims of Indians .
The values and integrities that individuals brought with them were sufficient to keep the wagon trains as peaceful communities .
Having spent many years driving on California freeways , I have observed an informal order amongst motorists who are complete strangers to one another .
There is a general — albeit not universal — courtesy exhibited when one driver wishes to make a lane change and , in spite of noncooperative drivers , a spontaneous order arises from this interplay .
A major reason for the cooperative order lies in the fact that a driving mistake can result in serious injury or death , and that such consequences will be felt at once , and by the actor , unlike political decision - making that shifts the costs to others .
One may answer that freeway driving is regulated by the state , and that driving habits are not indicative of anarchistic behavior .
The same response can be made concerning our behavior generally ( i.e. , that government laws dictate our conduct in all settings ) .
But this misconceives the causal connections at work .
The supervision of our moment - to - moment activities by the state is too remote to affect our actions .
We are polite to fellow shoppers or our neighbor for reasons that have nothing to do with legal prescripts .
What makes our dealings with others peaceful and respectful comes from within ourselves , not from beyond .
For precisely the same reason , a society can be utterly destroyed by the corruption of such subjective influences , and no blizzard of legislative enactments or quadrupling of police forces will be able to avert the entropic outcome .
Do you now understand the social meaning of the " Humpty - Dumpty " nursery rhyme ?
The study of complexity , or chaos , informs us of patterns of regularity that lie hidden in our world , but which spontaneously manifest themselves to generate the order that we like to pretend authorities have created for us .
There is much to discover about the interplay of unseen forces that work , without conscious direction , to make our lives more productive and peaceful than even the best - intended autocrat can accomplish .
As the disruptive histories of state planning and regulation reveal , efforts to impose order by fiat often produce disorder , a phenomenon whose explanation is to be found in the dynamical nature of complexity .
In the words of Terry Pratchett : " Chaos is found in greatest abundance wherever order is being sought .
Chaos always defeats order because it is better organized . "
" Anarchy " is an expression of social behavior that reflects the individualized nature of life .
Only as living beings are free to pursue their particular interests in the unique circumstances in which they find themselves , can conditions for the well - being of all be attained .
Anarchy presumes decentralized and cooperative systems that serve the mutual interests of the individuals comprising them , without the systems ever becoming their own reasons for being .
It is this thinking , and the practices that result therefrom , that is alone responsible for whatever peace and order exists in society .
Political thinking , by contrast , presumes the supremacy of the systems ( i.e. , the state ) and reduces individuals to the status of resources for the accomplishment of their ends .
Such systems are grounded in the mass - minded conditioning and behavior that has produced the deadly wars , economic dislocations , genocides , and police - state oppressions that comprise the essence of political history .
Men and women need nothing so much right now as to rediscover and reenergize their own souls .
They will never be able to accomplish such purposes in the dehumanizing and dispirited state systems that insist upon controlling their lives and property .
In the sentiments underlying anarchistic thinking , men and women may be able to find the individualized sense of being and self - direction that they long ago abandoned in marbled halls and citadels .

WYMAGANA ROZDZIELCZOŚĆ MATRYCY
Jeżeli nie zamierzamy robić odbitek formatu większego niż A4 ( kartka papieru do drukarki ) to ABSOLUTNIE wystarczy nam aparat z matrycą 5,0 MP .
Nie dajmy sobie wmawiać , że im więcej magapikseli , tym lepsze będą zdjęcia .
To absolutna bzdura .
Powszechny jest " mit megapikseli " i to nie tylko w Polsce .
Wynika on z tego , że sprzedawcy zawsze będą chcieli sprzedać aparat droższy .
Jeżeli ktoś ma zamiar bardzo mocno kadrować swoje zdjęcia , czyli wybierać z nich mały fragment i powiększać do pełnego rozmiaru odbitki 10x15 , to większa rozdzielczość może być przydatna .
Jednak już 6,0 MP to do zastosowań amatorskich całkowicie wystarczająca rozdzielczość .
Jako dowód naszej tezy pokazujemy zdjęcie wykonane aparatem Minolta Dimage
Xt o matrycy 3,2 MP i jego powiększony fragment .
Górne zdjęcie jest zdjęciem oryginalnym , dolne jest wykadrowanym fragmentem powiększonym do rozmiaru pierwszego zdjęcia .
Jakość obydwu nie budzi najmniejszych zastrzeżeń .
Z tego wykadrowanego została wykonana odbitka formatu 10x15 cm i jej jakość nie odbiega od jakości odbitek robionych z aparatu z filmem formatu 35 mm .
A przecież 3,2 MP to rozdzielczość już praktycznie nie występuj ąca w obecnie produkowanych aparatach cyfrowych .
5,0 MP jest dziś chyba najmniejszą rozdzielczością .
Zdjęcie oryginalne Fragment górnego zdjęcia powiększony do pełnego formatu .
Pokazane tu zdjęcia powinny
Was przekonać , że " mania megapikseli " nie ma sensu .
Dzisiaj nawet w prostych aparatach montowane są matryce o rozdzielczości 6,0 , czy 7,0MP .
To jednak tylko chwyt marketingowy .
Można by np. do Fiata Seicento " wcisnąć " jakiś silnik o mocy 150 KM ale nigdy tej mocy nie wykorzystamy , gdyż Seicento by nam się rozleciało .

Hoping to calm the furor created when UCLA police used a Taser to subdue a student studying in Powell Library , the university ’s acting chancellor announced Friday that a veteran Los Angeles law enforcement watchdog would head up an independent investigation of the incident .
Norman Abrams said he ordered the probe after the university received numerous calls and e-mails from parents and alumni raising concerns about the officers ’ actions during the videotaped Tuesday night arrest , which has been widely seen on TV news and the YouTube website .
“ I want to assure them that the UCLA campus is a safe environment .
Student safety and treatment are of paramount concern at UCLA , ” Abrams said .
“ We plan to move ahead promptly with a complete and unbiased review . ”
Abrams appointed Merrick Bobb , who was a staff attorney for the Christopher Commission and currently works as the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors ’ watchdog over the Sheriff ’s Department , to handle the probe .
Abrams said Bobb has a proven track record looking into allegations of police misconduct , including the Rodney King beating and more recently the riots at the L.A. County jail system .

The move came hours after more than 200 students marched to the UCLA police station calling for an independent investigation into the Taser incident as well as the suspension of the officers involved .
Wearing signs reading , “ I am a student , do n’t Taser me ” and chanting , “ Tasers out of UC , ” the protesters said it was an inherent conflict of interest for university police to handle the investigation of their own officers .
“ What was done was unnecessary , ” said Rahmatullah Akbar , a senior majoring in psychology .
“ We as students do n’t deserve to be Tasered . ”
Tuesday ’s incident occurred about 11 p.m. in a library filled with students studying for midterm examinations .

According to the university , Mostafa Tabatabainejad , a 23 - year - old senior , was asked for his ID as part of a routine nightly procedure to make sure that everyone using the library after 11 p.m. is a student or otherwise authorized to be there .
Campus officials have said the long - standing policy was adopted to ensure students ’ safety .
Authorities said Tabatabainejad refused repeated requests by community service officers and regular campus police to provide identification or to leave .
UCLA Police Chief Karl Ross said the officers decided to use the Taser to incapacitate Tabatabainejad after he went limp while they were escorting him out and urged other library patrons to join his resistance .
Mavrick Goodrich , a chemical engineering major who observed the incident , said Tabatabainejad shouted , “ Am I the only martyr ? ”

Some witnesses disputed the officers ’ account , saying that when campus police arrived , Tabatabainejad had begun to walk toward the door .
Tabatabainejad ’s attorney , Stephen Yagman , said his client refused to show his ID because he thought he was being singled out because of his Middle Eastern appearance .
Tabatabainejad is of Iranian descent but is a U.S. citizen by birth and a resident of Los Angeles .
The student was shocked five times with the Taser , Yagman said .
Another student used a cellphone camera to record portions of the incident , in which Tabatabainejad can be heard screaming in pain when the Taser shocks are administered .

One of the issues Bobb ’s investigation will examine is whether the officers complied with the university police rules for using Tasers .
Several local police agencies -- including the LAPD and Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department -- allow officers to use Tasers only if a suspect poses a physical threat or is acting combatively .
The sheriff ’s policies expressly say deputies ca n’t use Tasers simply to move someone .
“ We look for assaultive conduct , ” said Bill McSweeney , chief of the sheriff ’s leadership and training division “ We generally do n’t use the Taser on passive resisters except when an individual indicates explosive action to follow , such as a verbal threat . ”

But UCLA police are allowed to use Tasers on passive resisters as “ a pain compliance technique , ” Assistant Chief Jeff Young said in an interview Friday .
Under UCLA policy , Young said , officers can use the weapons after considering the potential injury to police and to the individual as well as the level of resistance and the need for prompt resolution .
Young described Tabatabainejad as a “ passive resister ” who refused to cooperate with officers .
He acknowledged that the student did n’t actively resist the officers .
“ He was 200 pounds and went limp and was very hard to manage .
They were trying to get him on his feet , ” Young said .

The officers used the device in stun mode -- which affects only the part of the body being touched -- rather than the dart mode , in which tiny electrodes are fired into a person and pass a current through them , disabling the person entirely .
Young said police have used the Tasers “ on several occasions ” before but said he did n’t know how many times .
The officers involved in Tuesday ’s incident were off duty Friday but had not been placed on administrative leave .
On Friday , many students remained outraged over Tabatabainejad ’s treatment .

“ Once you have him subdued , you do n’t have to keep Tasing him , ” said Rohit Mahajan , a psychobiology major who watched the video .
“ You could see him crying .
He ’s not a threat .
He ’s maybe acting like a smartass , but he does n’t ” deserve that .
The protest march was organized by leaders of the campus Muslim and Iranian American student groups .
They support Tabatabainejad , though some demonstrators said they did n’t think the officers ’ actions were motivated by his ethnicity
The American Civil Liberties Union also said that it was examining the incident .
“ It is an appalling and traumatically excessive use of force on someone passive - resisting , ” said ACLU attorney Peter Bibring .
“ The officers seem so confident in what they are doing .
They need to change their policies and training . ”

UCLA officials urged students and others to withhold judgment actions until the investigations are completed .
“ Not all the events of Tuesday evening can be heard or viewed on YouTube , ” Ross said at a news conference with Abrams .
The acting chancellor expressed confidence in and respect for the UCLA police , and noted that Ross ’ department would continue with its own internal investigation .
“ But there are times when it is helpful to turn to an outside review as well , ” Abrams said .

2001 memo to Rice contradicts statements about Clinton , Pakistan Larry Womack
Published : Tuesday September 26 , 2006 Print This Email This [ New to RAW STORY ?
Be sure to check out our front page for all the latest breaking news . ]
A memo received by United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice shortly after becoming National Security Advisor in 2001 directly contradicts statements she made to reporters yesterday , RAW STORY has learned .
" We were not left a comprehensive strategy to fight al Qaeda , " Rice told a reporter for the New York Post on Monday .
" Big pieces were missing , " Rice added , " like an approach to Pakistan that might work , because without Pakistan you were n't going to get Afghanistan . "
Rice made the comments in response to claims made Sunday by former President Bill Clinton , who argued that his administration had done more than the current one to address the al Qaeda problem before the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks .
She stopped short of calling the former president a liar .
However , RAW STORY has found that just five days after President George W. Bush was sworn into office , a memo from counter - terrorism expert Richard A. Clarke to Rice included the 2000 document , " Strategy for Eliminating the Threat from the Jihadist Networks of al - Qida : Status and Prospects . "
This document devotes over 2 of its 13 pages of material to specifically addressing strategies for securing Pakistan 's cooperation in airstrikes against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan .
The Pakistan obstacle
The strategy document includes " three levers " that the United States had started applying to Pakistan as far back as 1990 .
Sanctions , political and economic methods of persuasion are all offered as having been somewhat successful .
Other portions of the passages relating to Pakistan  marked as " operational details "  have been redacted from the declassified memo at the CIA 's request .
The document also explores broader strategic approaches , such as a " need to keep in mind that Pakistan has been most willing to cooperate with us on terrorism when its role is invisible or at least plausibly deniable to the powerful Islamist right wing . "
But Clarke also made it clear that the Clinton Administration recognized the problem that Pakistan posed in mounting a more sweeping campaign against bin Laden : " Overt action against bin Laden , who is a hero especially in the Pushtun- ethnic border areas near Afghanistan , " Clarke speculated in late 2000 , " would be so unpopular as to threaten Musharraf 's government . "
The plan notes that , after the attack on the USS Cole , Pakistan had forbidden the United States from again violating its airspace to attack bin Laden in Afghanistan .
The memo sent by Clarke to Rice , to which the Clinton - era document was attached , also urges action on Pakistan relating to al Qaeda .
" First [ to be addressed , ] " wrote Clarke in a list of pending issues relating to al Qaeda , is " what the administration says to the Taliban and Pakistan about ending al Qida sanctuary in Afghanistan .
We are separately proposing early , strong messages on both . "
A disputed history The documents have been a source of controversy before .
Rice contended in a March 22 , 2004 Washington
Post piece that " no al Qaeda plan was turned over to the new administration . "
Two days later , Clarke insisted to the 9/11 Commission that the plan had in fact been turned over .
" There 's a lot of debate about whether it 's a plan or a strategy or a series of options , but all of the things we recommended back in January , " he told the commission , " were done after September 11th . "
The memo was declassified on April 7 , 2004 , one day before Rice herself testified before the 9/11 Commission .
Excerpts from documents relating to the situation follow : # Pages 11 - 13 of the Clinton - era document sent to Rice from Clarke , detailing Pakistan 's role in the al Qaeda problem .
The plan was referred to by Clarke , and later by Rice in public statements :
# Page 2 of memo from Clarke to Rice , urging " early , strong messages " to Pakistan on the al Qaeda problem .
The Clinton " plan " was attached to this memo :
The US government said it could not find the men that Guantánamo detainee Abdullah Mujahid believes could help set him free .
The Guardian found them in three days .
Two years ago the US military invited Mr Mujahid , a former Afghan police commander accused of plotting against the United States , to prove his innocence before a special military tribunal .
As was his right , Mr Mujahid called four witnesses from Afghanistan .
But months later the tribunal president returned with bad news : the witnesses could not be found .
Mr Mujahid 's hopes sank and he was returned to the wire - mesh cell where he remains today .
The Guardian searched for Mr Mujahid 's witnesses and found them within three days .
One was working for President Hamid Karzai .
Another was teaching at a leading American college .
The third was living in Kabul .
The fourth , it turned out , was dead .
Each witness said he had never been approached by the Americans to testify in Mr Mujahid 's hearing .
The case illustrates the egregious flaws that have discredited Guantánamo - style justice and which led the US supreme court to declare such trials illegal on Thursday in a major rebuke to the Bush administration .
Mr Mujahid is one of 380 Guantánamo detainees whose cases were reviewed at " combatant - status review tribunals " in 2004 and 2005 .
The tribunals were hastily set up following a court ruling that the prisoners , having been denied all normal legal rights , should be allowed to prove their innocence .
Ten of the hearings proceeded to full trials , including that of Osama bin Laden 's aide , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , who brought the successful supreme court appeal .
But by the time the review tribunals ended last year the US government had located just a handful of the requested witnesses .
None was brought from overseas to testify .
The military lawyers simply said they were " non-contactable " .
That was not entirely true .
Abdullah Mujahid was originally identified by Washington - based reporters from the Boston Globe after trawling through thousands of pages of testimony from the controversial military trials .
US forces arrested Mr Mujahid in the southern Afghan city of Gardez in mid-2003 , claiming he had been fired as police chief due to suspicion of " collusion with anti-government forces " , according to official documents .
Later , they alleged , he attacked US forces in retaliation .
In the military tribunal Mr Mujahid protested his innocence .
He enjoyed good relations with American soldiers and had been promoted , not fired , he said .
The three living witnesses he requested were easily located with a telephone , an internet connection and a few days work .
Shahzada Massoud was at the presidential palace , where he advises Mr Karzai on tribal affairs .
Gul Haider , a former defence ministry official , was found through the local government in Gardez .
The interior ministry gave an email address for the former minister , Ahmed Ali Jalali , although he could as easily been found on the internet - he teaches at the National Defence University in Washington DC .
The witnesses largely corroborated Mr Mujahid 's story , with some qualifications .
Mr Jalali , the former interior minister , said Mr Mujahid had been fired over allegations of corruption and bullying - not for attacking the government .
Mr Haider , the former defence official , said Mr Mujahid had contributed 30 soldiers to a major operation against al - Qaida in March 2002 .
" He is completely innocent , " he said .
Other Afghans agreed .
General Ali Shah Paktiawal , Interpol director of the Afghan national police , said : " Some people have given false information about him and that 's why this problem has come up . "
Their testimonies do not necessarily exonerate Mr Mujahid but at the very least raise serious questions about the case against him .
An Afghan government delegation that recently visited Guantánamo estimated that half of the 94 Afghan detainees were not guilty of serious crimes and should be released .
They did not release any names .
In Gardez , Haji Muhammad Hasan , 65 , keeps a stack of Red Cross letters as the only proof of his son's whereabouts .
" I feel completely helpless , " he said in despair .
Beside him the detainee 's shy sons - aged three , four and five - waited for news of a father they could hardly recall .
Lies and old rivalries had sent many innocent Afghans to Guantánamo , said Taj Muhammad Wardak , a former governor of Paktiya .
" You can investigate these people here .
There is no need to send them to Guantánamo , " he said .
" It is a great sadness between our countries that will last for many years . "
Mr Fox 's government wants Mexico to maintain its current output
The field is in the Gulf of Mexico , and Mexico says it could be bigger than its largest oil field , Cantarell .
Production there is said to have declined sharply in recent years .
Mr Fox made the announcement as figures showed the country 's total oil reserves had fallen 2 % between 2003 and 2005 .
Perforation of the well known as Noxal 1 , which is located about 100 km ( 60 miles ) from the port of Coatzacoalcos on the coast of Veracruz state , started in December .
MEXICO'S OIL Mexico is Latin America 's largest oil producer ahead of Venezuela and Brazil Output : 3.4 m barrels per day Oil provides one third of the state income Half of the production is exported , mainly to the US
The oil is under 930 metres ( 0.6 miles ) of water and a further 4,000 metres ( 2.5 miles ) underground .
Visiting the drilling platform , Mr Fox said : " With Noxal we will begin a new era of oil exploration in our country . "
The government says its investment in exploration will enable Mexico to maintain its current output in the future .
With at least 3.4 m barrels per day , Mexico is Latin America 's largest crude producer ahead of Venezuela and Brazil , according to the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) .
The oil industry provides one third of the Mexican state income .
More than half the crude extracted is exported , mainly to the United States .
The state - owned company Petroleos Mexicanos ( Pemex ) is among the biggest players in the international oil market .
Mexico is not a member of oil producers ' cartel Opec .
And though recent test runs of new computerized voter registration rolls in Indiana and Missouri revealed large numbers of errors , on Election Day reports of problems with the databases were few and isolated .
The National Association of Secretaries of States , which represents top election officials from across the country , has said Nov. 7 was generally “ a good day . ”
But some of the biggest states have not been able to overcome problems with new technology or rules and the lightly trained poll workers who must oversee them .
In Ohio , thousands of voters were turned away or forced to file provisional ballots by poll workers puzzled by voter - identification rules .
In Pennsylvania , the machines crashed or refused to start , producing many reports of vote - flipping , which means that voters press the button for one candidate but a different candidate ’s name appears on the screen .
Perhaps most notoriously , officials in Sarasota County say nearly 18,000 votes may never have been recorded by electronic machines in a Congressional race , even though many voters said they tried to vote .
The recent problems will probably help propel legislation that has stalled for months in Congress mandating that electronic voting machines have a paper trail to better enable recounts .
Less clear , experts say , is whether anything will be done to address concerns about the lack of technicians to troubleshoot machines , polling places with too few machines and poorly trained workers , and a system run by partisan election officials who may decide conflicts based on politics rather than policy .
“ These types of low - tech problems threaten to disenfranchise just as many people , if not more , but they tend to get less attention , ” said Tova Wang , an elections expert with the Century Foundation , a nonpartisan research group in New York .
“ We still have a long way to go toward fixing the biggest problems with our election system . ”
Election workers and experts say the advances in technology have simply overwhelmed many of the people trying to run things on the ground .
At a hearing in Denver last week , one focus was on how hard it has become for the poll workers , often retirees getting paid $ 100 for a 14 - hour day , and what it would take to attract younger people who are perhaps more savvy about computers .
“ It used to be that you would come in , set up the machines , make a cup of coffee and say hello to your neighbors , ” said Sigrid Freese , who has worked at Denver polling places for more than 20 years .
Now , she said , the job is complicated and stressful , and “ I know a lot of people who said , ‘ Never again . ’ ”
Recharging your laptop computer , your cell phone and a variety of other gadgets may one day be as convenient as surfing the web -- wirelessly .
Marin Soljacic , an assistant professor in MIT 's Department of Physics and Research Laboratory of Electronics , will describe his and his MIT colleagues ' research on that wireless future on Tuesday , Nov. 14 at the American Institute of Physics Industrial Physics Forum in San Francisco .
Like many of us , Soljacic ( pronounced Soul - ya - CHEECH ) often forgets to recharge his cell phone , and when it is about to die it emits an unpleasant noise .
" Needless to say , this always happens in the middle of the night , " he said .
" So , one night , at 3 a.m. , it occurred to me : Would n't it be great if this thing charged itself ? "
He began to wonder if any of the physics principles he knew of could turn into new ways of transmitting energy .
After all , scientists and engineers have known for nearly two centuries that transferring electric power does not require wires to be in physical contact .
Electric motors and power transformers contain coils that transmit energy to each other by the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction .
A current running in an emitting coil induces another current in a receiving coil ; the two coils are in close proximity , but they do not touch .
Later , scientists discovered electromagnetic radiation in the form of radio waves , and they showed that another form of it -- light -- is how we get energy from the sun .
But transferring energy from one point to another through ordinary electromagnetic radiation is typically very inefficient :
The waves tend to spread in all directions , so most of the energy is lost to the environment .
Soljacic realized that the close - range induction taking place inside a transformer -- or something similar to it -- could potentially transfer energy over longer distances , say , from one end of a room to the other .
Instead of irradiating the environment with electromagnetic waves , a power transmitter would fill the space around it with a " non-radiative " electromagnetic field .
Energy would only be picked up by gadgets specially designed to " resonate " with the field .
Most of the energy not picked up by a receiver would be reabsorbed by the emitter .
In his talk , Soljacic will explain the physics of non-radiative energy transfer and the possible design of wireless - power systems .
While rooted in well - known laws of physics , non-radiative energy transfer is a novel application no one seems to have pursued before .
" It certainly was not clear or obvious to us in the beginning how well it could actually work , given the constraints of available materials , extraneous environmental objects , and so on .
It was even less clear to us which designs would work best , " Soljacic said .
He and his colleagues tackled the problem through theoretical calculations and computer simulations .
With the resulting designs , non-radiative wireless power would have limited range , and the range would be shorter for smaller - size receivers .
But the team calculates that an object the size of a laptop could be recharged within a few meters of the power source .
Placing one source in each room could provide coverage throughout your home .
Soljacic is looking forward to a future when laptops and cell phones might never need any wires at all .
Wireless , he said , could also power other household gadgets that are now becoming more common .
" At home , I have one of those robotic vacuum cleaners that cleans your floors automatically , " he said .
" It does a fantastic job but , after it cleans one or two rooms , the battery dies . "
In addition to consumer electronics , wireless energy could find industrial applications powering , for example , freely roaming robots within a factory pavilion .
Soljacic 's colleagues in the work are Aristeidis Karalis , a graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science , and John Joannopoulos , the Francis Wright Davis Professor of Physics .
Both are also affiliated with the Research Laboratory of Electronics .
The work is funded in part by the Materials Research Science and Engineering Center program of the National Science Foundation .

Kung fu fan tries to stop train
( China Daily )
Updated : 2006-06-03 09:06
A 17 - year - old boy surnamed Liang almost died when he tried to use a kung fu movement to stop a running train in Laibin Railway Station in South China 's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on Tuesday , Nanguo Jinbao reported .
Liang was pushed to safety by a railway policeman just as he was about to be knocked down .
Liang jumped down to the tracks and wanted to use Xianglongshibazhang , a famous kung fu posturing described in many swordsman fictions , to stop the running train .
He was taken into custody for breaking railway rules and said he wanted to test whether or not he could use kung fu to stop the train .
Liang is a great fan of swordsman fiction and has also learnt martial arts .
The popularity of Iran 's controversial leader , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , is surging almost a year after he unexpectedly won a closely contested presidential election , Iranian officials and western diplomats said yesterday .
Attributing his success to his populist style and fortnightly meet - the - people tours of the country , the sources said that as matters stood , Mr Ahmadinejad was the clear favourite to win a second term in 2009 .
The perception that the president was standing up to the US on the nuclear issue was also boosting his standing .
" He 's more popular now than a year ago .
He 's on the rise , " said Nasser Hadian - Jazy , a professor of political science at Tehran University .
" I guess he has a 70 % approval rating right now .
He portrays himself as a simple man doing an honest job .
He 's comfortable communicating with ordinary people . "
While there are no reliable national opinion polls in Iran , western diplomats acknowledged that support for Mr Ahmadinejad is growing , defying predictions after last June 's election that he would not last more than three months .
" An indication of his power is the way he has whipped up public opinion on the nuclear energy issue , " a western diplomat said .
" If there was an election today , he would win . "
It was possible that Mr Ahmadinejad could become a liability to the government if Iran were taken to the UN security council , he said , adding : " But I think in that situation , he gets stronger . "
Vahid Karimi of the government - affiliated Institute for Political and International Studies said : " Certainly his popularity is increasing .
People like what he says .
It 's not so much because he stands up to the west but because he 's not corrupt .
This is very important . "
Independent Iranian sources said many people were surprised that Mr Ahmadinejad had not turned out to be as socially conservative as many expected .
His attacks on the privileges enjoyed by some of Iran 's ruling clerical elite and his recent unsuccessful attempt to allow women to attend football matches had made a big impact .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's rising fortunes run counter to US attempts to isolate Iran , which it brands a rogue state .
US officials have described the Iranian president as a threat to world peace and claim that he faces a popular insurrection at home .
Professor Hadian - Jazy said Mr Ahmadinejad had been surprised by reaction to his criticism of Israel and apparent denial of the Holocaust .
" Coming from his background it was not uncommon to say that stuff .
He never thought that as president it would be different .
But once he got the reaction , he realised it could establish him as a strong leader among Muslims .
It was a calculated move . "
Iran strongly supports Palestinian rights , but the president 's anti-Israeli statements made an even bigger impact in the Arab world , said Sayed Mohammad Adeli , Iran 's former ambassador to Britain and the head of the Econotrend thinktank .
" They see Ahmadinejad 's resistance as admirable .
He has become a hero of the people on the street . "
Mohammad Atrianfar , the founder of the leading reformist newspaper Shargh and an ally of Hashemi Rafsanjani , the president 's rival , said Mr Ahmadinejad would not have it all his own way .
" The reform movement is alive , despite last year 's defeat , " he said .
Meanwhile , the government was mishandling economic policy , and that could be its undoing .
" The present economy , due to the rate of oil prices , is in a good situation .
But the management of the state sector is very bad .
He has taken horrid and rushed decisions . "
Mr Atrianfar said that oil revenue was being squandered through state handouts to impoverished provinces and commodity subsidies .
But there was insufficient investment in long - term projects and infrastructure , foreign investment was falling , and the country was suffering capital flight and a brain drain .
Until recently , Delmenhorst was one of Germany 's many decaying , postindustrial factory towns , blighted by unemployment and poverty and without a sense of pride or common purpose .
But when a right - wing organization threatened to turn an abandoned downtown hotel into a neo -Nazi conference center five months ago , Delmenhorst 's residents joined together and found some very creative ways to buy the building .
The city 's butchers launched a " Bratwursts Against Nazis " campaign .
Taxi drivers urged donations in lieu of tips .
A professional soccer team from nearby Bremen donated signed jerseys , which were auctioned on eBay .
Meanwhile , countless protests sprang up in front of the building .
Muslims and Jews banded together for one event .
Children marched from schools across the city to stage a demonstration .
Labor unions and politicians jumped into the fray , sometimes rallying crews of more than 4,000 , according to organizers .
Delmenhorst 's near daily protests and $ 1.2 million fundraising blitz , which made headlines across Europe , echo the anti-Nazi battles that have erupted in many towns as Germany 's right - wing parties have surged .
According to the German Ministry of the Interior , there were about 8,000 politically motivated right - wing crimes between January and August 2006 .
That 's double the number that were counted during the same period in 2004 and a 20 percent increase over 2005 .
Far - right parties have also made stunning electoral gains in parts of the nation 's ragged east .
Experts believe the far - right groups have been able to achieve this success largely by building ideological centers that offer everything from right - wing workshops to rock concerts and social services for the elderly .
" These places are decisive for spreading the far right 's influence in local communities and making them a legitimate social force , " says right - wing extremism expert Hajo Funke .
Delmenhorst 's ordeal started in late July , when the Wilhelm Tietjen Foundation for Fertilization bid $ 4.4 million for the Hotel am Stadtpark .
The organization is directed by Jürgen Rieger , a neo -Nazi lawyer known for defending right - wing extremists and leading an annual march honoring Rudolf Hess , a top Third Reich official .
He also wrote a book on the " disastrous " effects of " bastardizing " races .
Mr. Rieger has bought at least six properties since 1995 , including a farm , a theater , a former army barracks , and a 19th century manor .
His aim is to establish right - wing training facilities , as well as communes and fertility centers for members of the " Nordic blond race . "
Winning the good fight
Delmenhorst 's saga finally drew to a close two weeks ago , when the city , with the help of private donations and fundraising efforts , bought the 100 - room hotel for some $ 4 million .
The public drew a sigh of relief and politicians waxed triumphant .
" The Nazis are out , the city is united , and we have won the good fight , " said Mayor Patrick de La Lanne .
" We knew it would destroy our community , " says Günter Feith , a 58 - year - old architect .
" There would be constant clashes between Nazis and protesters .
The streets would always be swarmed with police .
You could basically shut our city center down . "
It was Mr. Feith and Gerd Renker , a local tax adviser , who launched a fundraising drive to buy the building just days after Rieger 's plans became known .
The effort all but transformed the cultural life of this quiet city with a dozen or so fundraising concerts – featuring everything from rock and blues to choral music .
At least 10,000 of the city 's 80,000 residents also dipped into their own wallets .
Money began to pour in from some unlikely places .
Niko Wilker , a 16 - year - old high school student , who sports fatigues and combat boots , says he donated most of his $ 90 allowance one month .
" I did n't want to see brown shirts invading the city , " he says .
By mid-August , when the deal with Rieger was initially supposed to close , the people of Delmenhorst had raised more than $ 1 million .
But they were still far short of matching Rieger 's $ 4.4 million , and they were making enemies in far - right circles .
Hackers frequently attacked Delmenhorst 's anti-Nazi organizing website .
Feith started getting death threats .
A band of right - wing activists also threatened to go after donors and even posted a list of their names on the Web .
Determined not to give in , officials started scouring the law books .
" We tried to create every conceivable legal hurdle to keep the Nazis from buying the hotel , " says Mayor de La Lanne .
One scheme involved enlarging the downtown renovation area to include the building .
Politicians hoped this would allow the city to buy the hotel at a price determined by a neutral third party .
In other words , for much less than Rieger was offering .
In response to the city 's plan to rezone the hotel and low - ball Rieger 's generous original offer , the hotel 's owner , Günter Mergel , threatened to give the building to Rieger 's foundation if the group would promise to assume Mr. Mergel 's debt of more than $ 2 million .
A question of money
Throughout September , Delmenhorst continued to wrangle with Mergel .
Meanwhile , Rieger , who had been insisting that the deal was about to close , suddenly fell silent .
In early October , German media reported that his foundation had been wiped off the commercial register in Britain , where it was legally based .
Some reports speculated that the organization was bankrupt .
Still , the city of Delmenhorst scraped together $ 3 million and , in mid-October , announced plans to buy the hotel .
The deal was finalized on Dec. 20 .
Many residents are euphoric .
" Never before have we been so strong , so united as a community , " says Feith .
But the hefty price tag has launched a new wave of controversy .
Some German pundits and Delmenhorst residents now believe the building 's previous owner used the Nazi threat as a ploy to get double the appraised value , which was about $ 1.7 million .
" Mergel played the politicians to get more money , " says Luigi Miccoli , who runs an Italian restaurant inside the abandoned hotel complex .
" He just used Rieger 's name for profit . "
Mergel could not be reached for comment .
As for Mayor de La Lanne , he insists that the community had no choice but to buy .
" We paid the price we did for political reasons , " he explains .
" And it was worth paying .
If we had n't , the Nazis would have come in and our city would have been ruined .
Life here would never have been the same . "

FBI files : Rehnquist had rough drug detox
Report shows sleep aid caused late chief justice to have delusions
WASHINGTON — Chief Justice William Rehnquist took a powerful sedative during his first decade on the Supreme Court and grew so dependent on it that he became delusional and tried to escape from a hospital in his pajamas when he stopped taking the drug in 1981 , according to newly released FBI files .
The files also show that during both of Rehnquist 's confirmation battles — when he was first named to the court by President Nixon in 1971 and when President Reagan nominated him as chief justice in 1986 — the Justice Department enlisted the FBI to find out what witnesses lined up by Senate Democrats were prepared to say .
New details released
The FBI this week released 1,561 pages from its files on Rehnquist in response to Freedom of Information Act requests filed after his death in September 2005 .
Privacy laws forbid disclosure of such files during the person 's lifetime .
The fact that Rehnquist checked into George Washington University Hospital for a week in late December 1981 to be treated for back pain and dependence on a prescription drug was previously known .
Journalists had noted that fall that Rehnquist 's speech was sometimes slurred on the bench , and the Washington Post reported on the hospitalization .
But the files reveal dramatic new details about the addiction .
During its 1986 investigation , the FBI concluded Rehnquist began taking the drug Placidyl for insomnia following back surgery in 1971 , the year before he joined the court .
By 1981 he apparently was taking 1,500 milligrams each night , three times the usual starting dose .
Placidyl is a sedative that is not usually prescribed for more than a week at a time .
It is not an opiate and is not a painkiller , but it is addictive , and withdrawal can cause hallucinations and temporary memory loss .
The justice was weaned off Placidyl in early 1982 over the course of a month , according to the records .
The hospital doctor who treated Rehnquist said the Capitol Hill physician who prescribed Placidyl for Rehnquist was practicing bad medicine , bordering on malpractice .
Both doctors ' names were redacted from the documents .
Paranoid delusions
Doctors interviewed by the FBI told agents that when the associate justice stopped taking the drug , he suffered paranoid delusions .
One doctor said Rehnquist thought he heard voices outside his hospital room plotting against him and had " bizarre ideas and outrageous thoughts , " including imagining " a CIA plot against him " and " seeming to see the design patterns on the hospital curtains change configuration . "
At one point , a doctor told the investigators , Rehnquist went " to the lobby in his pajamas in order to try to escape . "
Ultimately , the doctors concluded that the withdrawal symptoms were so severe that they began giving Rehnquist the drug again and slowly lowered the dosage until he quit taking it entirely on Feb.
7 , 1982 .
By 1986 , the files show , all the doctors interviewed by the FBI said the former drug dependence should not affect Rehnquist 's work on the court .
FBI spokesman Paul Bresson declined to comment on any documents released by the bureau .
However , Bresson denied that the FBI 's background investigations for judicial nominees are partisan in any way .
The Associated Press contributed to this report .

A handwritten score of one of Ludwig van Beethoven 's most revolutionary works has been discovered by a librarian cleaning out a cabinet in a seminary in Pennsylvania after being missing for more than a century .
The 80 - page manuscript for a piano version of Grosse Fuge , thought to have been written by Beethoven himself , dates from the final months of his life when he was completely deaf .
The work was described by scholars of the German composer yesterday as an " amazing find " and " extremely important " .
The lost work came to light in July when Heather Carbo , a librarian at the Palmer Theological Seminary outside Philadelphia , was cleaning out an archival cabinet .
" It was just sitting on the shelf , I was in a state of shock , " she told the New York Times .
" I 'd heard oral history about a Beethoven manuscript , so I recognised what I had found immediately . "
The fate of the manuscript has been one of the great musical mysteries since it was auctioned in Berlin in 1890 .
It is written mainly in brown ink and was described by the New York Times as a furious scattering of notes across the page , with many changes and crossings out .
The work , which went on display yesterday at the evangelical seminary , will be sold at Sotheby 's in London on December 1 and is expected to fetch around £ 1.5 m .
Grosse Fuge was composed as the finale for the string quartet in B flat major , Op 130 , which Beethoven began in May 1825 and completed in September of that year .
It is a notoriously difficult work , and when first performed the audience apparently demanded encores of only two of the movements .
" Why not the fugue ? " Beethoven demanded .
" Cattle ! Asses ! " he is reputed to have shouted .
But despite criticism by contemporaries it is now seen as one of his most important works .
The composer later produced a version for piano , and it is a manuscript of that reworking that has been discovered in Pennsylvania .
Stephen Roe of Sotheby 's said it was an amazing find : " The manuscript was only known from a brief description in a catalogue in 1890 and it has never been seen or described by Beethoven scholars .
Its rediscovery will allow a complete reassessment of this extraordinary music . "
Maynard Solomon , a biographer of Beethoven and a world expert on the composer , who has seen a selection of pages from the manuscript , said it was an extremely important find .
" It is in beautiful condition and has many interesting compositions and will be the subject of much analytical work because it fills an important gap in the compositional history of one of Beethoven 's major works . "
Dr Roe said the manuscript was written in brown and black ink , sometimes over pencil , and includes annotations in pencil and red crayon .
It shows the extent of Beethoven 's reworkings and includes deletions , corrections and deep erasures - occasionally the paper is rubbed right through leaving small holes - smudged alterations and several pages pasted over the original or affixed with sealing wax .
The passion that Beethoven endured is also in evidence on the manuscript : the higher and more intense the music becomes the larger the notes .
" What this document gives us is rare insight into the imponderable process of decision - making by which this most complex of quartet movements is made over into a work for piano four hands , " Richard Kramer , a musicologist at the Graduate Centre of the City University of New York , told the New York Times .
The manuscript last surfaced at an auction in Berlin in 1890 where it appears to have been purchased by William Howard Doane , a Cincinnati industrialist and hymn writer .
Civil rights icon Rosa Parks dies at 92 Long known as the ' mother of the civil rights movement ' Rosa Parks earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Obituaries ( General ) Rosa Parks Civil Rights Martin Luther King Jr or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) -- Rosa Parks , whose act of civil disobedience in 1955 inspired the modern civil rights movement , died Monday in Detroit , Michigan .
She was 92 .
Parks ' moment in history began in December 1955 when she refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Montgomery , Alabama .
Her arrest triggered a 381 - day boycott of the bus system by blacks that was organized by a 26 - year - old Baptist minister , the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ( See video on an activist 's life and times -- 2:52 )
The boycott led to a court ruling desegregating public transportation in Montgomery , but it was n't until the 1964 Civil Rights
Act that all public accommodations nationwide were desegregated .
Facing regular threats and having lost her department store job because of her activism , Parks moved from Alabama to Detroit in 1957 .
She later joined the staff of U.S. Rep. John Conyers , a Michigan Democrat .
Conyers , who first met Parks during the early days of the civil rights struggle , recalled Monday that she worked on his original congressional staff when he first was elected to the House of Representatives in 1964 .
" I think that she , as the mother of the new civil rights movement , has left an impact not just on the nation , but on the world , " he told CNN in a telephone interview .
" She was a real apostle of the nonviolence movement . "
He remembered her as someone who never raised her voice -- an eloquent voice of the civil rights movement .
" You treated her with deference because she was so quiet , so serene -- just a very special person , " he said , adding that " there was only one " Rosa Parks .
Gregory Reed , a longtime friend and attorney , said Parks died between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. of natural causes .
He called Parks " a lady of great courage . "
Parks co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development to help young people pursue educational opportunities , get them registered to vote and work toward racial peace .
" As long as there is unemployment , war , crime and all things that go to the infliction of man 's inhumanity to man , regardless -- there is much to be done , and people need to work together , " she once said .
Even into her 80s , she was active on the lecture circuit , speaking at civil rights groups and accepting awards , including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999 .
" This medal is encouragement for all of us to continue until all have rights , " she said at the June 1999 ceremony for the latter medal .
Parks was the subject of the documentary " Mighty Times : The Legacy of Rosa Parks , " which received a 2002 Oscar nomination for best documentary short .
In April , Parks and rap duo OutKast settled a lawsuit over the use of her name on a CD released in 1998 .
( Full story ) Bus boycott She was born Rosa Louise McCauley in Tuskegee , Alabama , on February 4 , 1913 .
Her marriage to Raymond Parks lasted from 1932 until his death in 1977 .
Parks ' father , James McCauley , was a carpenter , and her mother , Leona Edwards McCauley , a teacher .
Before her arrest in 1955 , Parks was active in the voter registration movement and with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , where she also worked as a secretary in 1943 .
At the time of her arrest , Parks was 42 and on her way home from work as a seamstress .
She took a seat in the front of the black section of a city bus in Montgomery .
The bus filled up and the bus driver demanded that she move so a white male passenger could have her seat .
" The driver wanted us to stand up , the four of us .
We did n't move at the beginning , but he says , ' Let me have these seats . '
And the other three people moved , but I did n't , " she once said .
When Parks refused to give up her seat , a police officer arrested her .
As the officer took her away , she recalled that she asked , " Why do you push us around ? "
The officer 's response : " I do n't know , but the law 's the law , and you 're under arrest . "
She added , " I only knew that , as I was being arrested , that it was the very last time that I would ever ride in humiliation of this kind . "
Four days later , Parks was convicted of disorderly conduct and fined $ 14 .
That same day , a group of blacks founded the Montgomery Improvement Association and named King , the young pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church , as its leader , and the bus boycott began .
For the next 381 days , blacks -- who according to Time magazine had comprised two - thirds of Montgomery bus riders -- boycotted public transportation to protest Parks ' arrest and in turn the city 's Jim Crow segregation laws .
Black people walked , rode taxis and used carpools in an effort that severely damaged the transit company 's finances .
The mass movement marked one of the largest and most successful challenges of segregation and helped catapult King to the forefront of the civil rights movement .
The boycott ended on November 13 , 1956 , after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that Montgomery 's segregated bus service was unconstitutional .
Parks ' act of defiance came one year after the Supreme Court 's Brown v. Board of Education decision that led to the end of racial segregation in public schools .
( Full story ) U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia , a Democrat , told CNN Monday he watched the 1955 - 56 Montgomery drama unfold as a teenager and it inspired him to get active in the civil rights movement .
" It was so unbelievable that this woman -- this one woman -- had the courage to take a seat and refuse to get up and give it up to a white gentleman .
By sitting down , she was standing up for all Americans , " he said .

Apple Computer this week acknowledged that some of its 15 - inch MacBook Pro notebooks may emit an irritable whining sound and said affected customers should contact the company .
In a rather curt statement on its support site , the Mac maker wrote : " If your 15 - inch MacBook Pro emits a high - pitched buzzing sound , please contact AppleCare for service . "
Apple offered no other details .
The Cupertino , Calif . - based company has been scurrying to mend a handful of minor issues reported with its new MacBook product lines , the the first of its consumer and professional notebooks to use chips and underlying technology from Intel Corp .
Despite the minor hiccups , Apple last quarter generated $ 1.16 B in notebook sales , shipping nearly 800,000 units .
The company said the notebook unit total consisted of a primary mix of MacBook and MacBook Pro models , and too a lesser extent , PowerBook G4s that remained in inventory .
Of all the models , Apple 's consumer oriented Intel MacBook has emerged as a top seller .
Although the company said it shipped a " significant number " of MacBooks in June , it still exited its recent fiscal quarter without enough supply to meet demand .
Earlier this week , the Mac maker admitted there is a problem with some of its white MacBooks where the computer casing may exhibit signs of premature discoloration .

A few months ago I made a post telling the world that as of my birthday of this year I would no longer be using AOL Instant Messenger , MSN Messenger , Yahoo Messenger , or ICQ — and use federated IM services ( Specifically those using the Jabber protocol ) exclusively .
Well , guess what : Today 's my birthday .
For those of you who are still confused as to what exactly Jabber is , read on and I 'll break it down for you one more time .
What 's the problem ?
I know a lot of friends who have Hotmail accounts .
I also know a lot of friends who have GMail accounts .
I personally do n't use either , I have my own email server at deepdarc.com .
Do I need to have an account on Hotmail in order to email my friends who use Hotmail , or a GMail account to email my friends who use GMail ?
Of course not — that would be absurd .
Yet , that is exactly the situation we tolerate with respect to instant messaging .
I have friends who use only AIM , I have friends who use only MSN , and I have friends who use only Yahoo .
In order to be able to keep in contact with all of them , I have to have accounts on each one .
AIM users can't talk to MSN users .
Yahoo users can't talk to ICQ users .
Why is this the case ?
Is there some sort of technological barrier ?
IMHO , the only excuse for this situation is corporate greed .
But it does n't have to be this way .
This is where Jabber comes in .
Instead of having the majority of the world 's IM capability in the hands of three large American corporations , Jabber allows anyone with a domain name to set up their own Jabber server .
Jabber is different from the " legacy " IM systems in that if I have an account on Google Talk , and my friend has an account on Gizmo Project , we can still communicate .
In fact , communicating with someone who has an account on another server is just as easy as communicating with someone on your own server .
Why am I not using legacy services anymore ?
Quite simply , to encourage something called the network effect .
Wikipedia sums it up quite well :
The network effect is a characteristic that causes a good or service to have a value to a potential customer dependent on the number of customers already owning that good or using that service .
In other words , in order for Jabber as an open communications platform to be successful and useful , people must use it .
Often in my evangelical fits , I 'll hear the excuse , " I do n't know anyone who uses Jabber who does n't already use a service that I am already on " .
Well , now they do —me .
I do n't expect other people to do the same thing that I am doing .
Feel free to continue using the legacy services like AIM , MSN , etc ...
I 'm only asking that you have a jabber account , and that you use that account as much as you would use those other legacy services .
If you have and use a GMail account , then you are practically doing this already !
But just what exactly is Jabber ?!
When you hear someone ( probably me ) talking about Jabber , they are usually referring to one of the following :
The XMPP ( Jabber ) Protocol
The Public Federated Jabber Network ( PFJN )
The Jabber Platform ( which includes the previous items , as well as jabber chat clients , devices , transports , etc. )
Jabber is , strictly speaking , the informal name of an open - standard decentralized instant messaging protocol officially called XMPP .
NOTE : It is also the name of a company called Jabber Inc. , which sells Jabber - based products .
However , the Jabber platform is much larger than this single company .
Do n't let this confuse you !
If you want to go to the authoritative website about jabber , that would be jabber.org , not jabber.com !
The network of independent Jabber servers on the internet make up the Public Federated Jabber Network .
If you have an account on a server on the PFJN , then you can communicate with anyone else who has an account on a PFJN server .
This means that Google Talk users can communicate seamlessly with Gizmo - Project users ( and vice - versa ) , as both of these services are on the Public Federated Jabber Network .
About Spam / Spim / Spoofing
With respect to network topography , Jabber is similar to eMail .
Messages are sent from the client to the server , which then sends that message to the destination user 's server , which then sends the message to the other user 's computer .
However , there is one very important distinction to make between the way email works and the way Jabber works :
A Jabber server requires some sort of authentication from servers trying to connect to it , whereas an email server does not .
This is a critical flaw in today 's email infrastructure , and is directly responsible for the deluge of spam that we all receive on a daily basis .
Email servers take no steps to ensure that the messages they are receiving were actually sent by who they say they are .
Authentication is all about knowing that who you are talking who is who they say they are , and it is a required part of the XMPP protocol .
There are two ways that servers can authenticate themselves to other servers : Server Dial - Back , and Certificates .
There is plenty of documentation as to how each of these work , so I 'll avoid duplicating that information here .
The important part to remember is that with Jabber you can be quite sure when you receive a message that it is from who it says it is from .
Jabber IDs
Jabber IDs look a lot like email addresses , and this is intentional .
You have a username and a server , separated by a " @ " symbol .
They are often called JIDs for short .
My JID is darco@deepdarc.com .
Use Jabber !
When I say that you should " Use Jabber " , I mean that you should have an account on a server which is on the PFJN ( Or , more simply , a " Jabber server " ) .
There are many services on the PFJN which allow anyone to register for an account :
Not all of these services offer the same features , so shop around !
Choosing a program
If you have an account on a Jabber server , then you have a choice as to which jabber client you can use .
Here are some of the most popular , broken down by operating system .
Note that some of them will only work with a specific service , but that does n't mean you can't use a different client with that service .

--
A military nurse who has served in combat zones for 30 years today sued her civilian employer , Sutter Health , alleging the company violated federal law by firing her after she told her supervisor she was being deployed to Iraq .
The federal lawsuit , filed in San Francisco , accuses Sutter Health of violating the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 -- USERRA -- by firing Debra Muhl , a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve , in June 2006 .
Sutter Health spokeswoman Karen Garner said Tuesday that Muhl 's termination was based on internal economics and not on her military service .
She said that while Sutter regretted the timing of Muhl 's termination notice -- two days after her notification of deployment -- the company followed procedures and went so far as to continue paying Muhl more than required by law during her final deployment after her termination .
" We have a strong and generous military - and - disaster - leave policy that goes above and beyond what the law requires , " she said .
Muhl said she was given the same economic explanation when she was fired , but rejected it , as did her attorney , David Lowe of Rudy , Exelrod & Zieff in San Francisco .
" Colonel Muhl is an honest - to - goodness war hero , " Lowe said .
" She has treated thousands of wounded individuals and service members ...
We felt this was an important case that required intervention by the courts . "
Muhl , 56 , said she worked at Sutter from 2002 to 2006 , most recently as administrative director of the joint cardiac program .
She was called up to active duty status several times during that period , including in March 2003 for 10 months and twice in 2005 for military training .
In her complaint , Muhl alleges that her supervisor , Richard Gray , the cardiac program 's medical director , found her deployments frustrating , at one point instructing her to file a complaint with Congress seeking to get out of the military .
As a compromise , Muhl said , she requested a transfer to a unit with fewer deployments .
Nevertheless , in late December 2005 , she learned she would be going back to Iraq for several months .
Gray was visibly angry by the news , Muhl said , and two days later called her into his office .
" You had news for me on Tuesday , now I have news for you , " Muhl recalled Gray saying .
" You will not have a job when you return from the desert . "
The technology could lead to more personal advertising
The " mass personalization " system can identify a programme from as little as five seconds of sound .
It then presents related information or adverts in the web browser .
Google researchers believe it could also be used to monitor audience size or create social networks around viewers watching the same show .
" The system could keep up with users while they channel surf , presenting them with a real - time forum about a live political debate one minute and an ad - hoc chat room for a sporting event in the next , " wrote Google researchers Michele Covell and Shumeet Baluja on the Google research blog .
" All of this would be done without users ever having to type or to even know the name of the program or channel being viewed , " they wrote .
Although the product has been tested and shown to work in trials , Google are keen to stress that there are still technical hurdles to overcome and that it may never be launched .
All researchers at Google are given time to work on their own pet projects .
Unique sound
Mass personalisation aims to combine television viewing with a personalised web experience .
" Mass - media channels typically provide limited content to many people , " the researchers wrote .
" The Web provides vast amounts of information , most of interest to few . "
The core of the system works in a similar way to the Shazam music service that identifies music played into a mobile phone and then sends the listener a text message with the name of the track .
We could collect snippets from the web describing the actors appearing in a movie or present maps of locales within the movie as it takes place
Michele Covell and Shumeet Baluja
Instead of music and mobile phones , Google 's system uses a laptop or computer to listen to the ambient sound in a room .
Each snippet of television audio has a unique pattern , like an audio fingerprint , that can be queried against a database of television soundtracks .
By recording the background sound and regularly analysing five second chunks , the system can identify the programme being watched .
It then starts to look for related information and content .
This could include personalised adverts .
For example if the system recognised that you were watching a trailer for a film , it might show adverts for cinemas or DVD rental shops .
The researchers envisage that retailers and advertisers would bid for television segments for their adverts in the same way as they bid for keywords on the Google search engine at the moment .
Social sites
The Google scientists believe the system could also be used to direct other information to a television user 's computer .
" We could collect snippets from the web describing the actors appearing in a movie or present maps of locales within the movie as it takes place , " they wrote .
The system could analyse any background sound in the future
The team says that mass personalisation could also allow viewers of the same shows to link up with on social networking sites .
This would allow real time chat and allow fans to discuss and comment on shows as they are broadcast .
Other applications include providing broadcasters with accurate , real - time viewing figures or allowing viewers to create video bookmarks of their favourite shows .
In the latter example , viewers watching on demand services would press a button to identify a programme or particular segment as being of interest .
The audio collected at the time the button was pressed would allow a viewer to retrieve entire shows or clips from online movie databases .
Future vision
Although the system has many potential applications , it also has many potential hurdles .
Background sound and chatter does interfere with the system making the retrieval of accurate information difficult .
However , the researchers believe that they can glean enough " clean " snippets of sound , enough of the time , to make it work .
In their " in-living - room " experiments the researchers showed the system could correctly identify the right programme every time .
But the tests used a database of just 24 hours of audio .
The biggest hurdle for a real world system could be creating the audio database itself .
With thousands of hours of television broadcast around the world every day , keeping track of all of the soundtracks and having the processing power to search the massive database could be a problem .
But despite these hurdles , the researchers are confident that the system can work and could be used on devices like mobile phones or PDA 's and for different content .
" The mass media content can originate from other sources like radio , movies or scenarios where viewers share a location with a common auditory background ( e.g. , an airport terminal , party , or music concert ) , " they write .
Levels of CSS knowledge
As you might have understood by now I 'm very much pro web standards .
The current widely accepted standards are : ( X) HTML for page structure , CSS for design , and Javascript for behaviour .
HTML is pretty well known by now , it has been there since the beginning of the web and there are tutorials everywhere that gets you started .
CSS is starting to get a grip , large companies are switching their sites to CSS based layouts and the webdev blogosphere reaches more and more people .
When you promote web standards , like many of us do , you get to talk to a lot of people .
If you promote it in a live chat room like #CSS on EFNet it gets even clearer : there are a lot of different levels of CSS knowledge out there .
This article is going to list some of those levels along a rating of how this kind of developer will affect the web .
Here we go :
Level 0
" CSS ?
Is n’t that a multiplayer game ? "
These people have probably never made a webpage in their life .
If they did it was pure HTML and they barely knew what they were doing .
We get some of these people in # CSS , not because they want to start learning but because they think they 've come to another channel , often looking for CS:S .
No need to worry about these people , they probably wo n't do many webpages in their lives so they can't do much harm .
Level 1
" Yeah , I use it to remove underlines on links sometimes "
Different from Level 0 , the people in this level do actually know basic HTML .
They probably learned it at least five years ago and have made a couple of simple sites .
They use very little CSS , only when they need to do simple stuff you can't do with HTML only , like removing underlines and setting line - height ( No ! do n't even think about setting line - height with HTML ) .
While these people could present us with some badly coded sites they rarely have any large and well visited ones .
This means that they wo n't do much harm either .
Level 2
" No , I do n't like divs ; tables are much easier to work with "
Instead of just playing with HTML , like those from Level 1 , some continued their quest .
They mastered HTML tables and started using it to make things look just like they wanted .
Somewhere around reaching HTML mastery they stopped looking at new ways of working .
They heard about other people using " divs to design their pages " and even took some time one day to try to learn what the fuss was about .
After a few hours of not getting it they gave up , went back to the familiar land of tabled layouts , and stayed there .
Many do know CSS syntax and sometimes even some background but they believe it's far too hard and ill - supported to use instead of tables .
Watch it !
These are dangerous people , some even webmasters of big corporate websites .
Since they have been in the business for a while many are leaders for their web departments .
These are the people it 's most important to reach , and if we do it means a lot for the web .
Concentrate on these people all you standards advocates .
Level 3
" Yes I 've heard it 's good , but I ca n't use it because of … "
While people in this group still do n't use CSS for positioning they do know some CSS and perhaps heard good things about it .
They 've tried making simple layouts and some even liked how it felt to work with .
Problem here is that something is stopping them .
Perhaps they have a Level 2 boss , perhaps their website needs to cater for Netscape 4 users , there might be many different reasons but something is in the way .
These people need to know that while CSS does not work everywhere that is n't the end of the world .
Old browsers will still get all your content , just pure content .
Instead of them you will reach a new audience : there may be accessibility and usability benefits , newer browsers will get a richer experience and the site might even get easier to add content to ( which will lead to more content ) .
Tell this to the people in this group .
If you 're unlucky they are not be the ones making decisions but in that case their influence on Level 2 Bosses will still be worth it .
Level 4
" CSS ?
Oh !
Yes , I use divs for all my layouts "
It 's not unusual that these people use only divs on their sites .
Each part of their page gets a div , often with a carefully crafted id ( #toprightredline or even # r5 _ c7 with r standing for row and c for column ) , and then they position their divs with absolute positioning by the pixel .
The result looks good , hey , it even validates as XHTML 1.1 (!) but what they have missed is that most of the benefits of CSS has been lost .
These pages are terrible when it comes to a screen reader interpreting it .
Same with older non-CSS browsers , they wo n't get the content … they will get one big block of text .
When using bad class names and ids you loose the possibility to change the layout : if that red line needs to be changed to black you 'll need to change all your HTML documents too ( can be hundreds ) .
Do n't fall into the trap of telling them they are stupid or make them google " css " , they know they are smart people and they did learn about CSS from google in the first place .
Tell them exactly what could be improved on their sites .
Tell them what the benefits are .
Keep your cool and tell them why .
People of Level 4 produce sites that are rather bad .
The damage is reduced though by them often being open to new ideas .
After all , not to long ago they did manage to learn and start to use CSS .
Some of the reasons for people thinking this way is because of what WYSIWYG editors are doing .
Most such editors produce terrible div-only code but I 'm hearing that there are gradual improvements in this field .
This is a good thing and hopefully this will help people move from Level 4 to the higher levels .
Level 5
" I use CSS for design , it 's better than tables because of … "
After a lot of reading , talking to people and thinking most people arrive at Level 5 .
This is where you both can use CSS and know why it 's better .
Some people in this level have minor problems on the sites they produce but it 's nothing serious .
When asked they can argue why separating structure and design is a good thing and they have worked with CSS long enough to know the common pitfalls .
I 'm guessing many of the readers of this article are on this level and I feel I am .
But this is not the best we can do …
Level 6
" What version of CSS ?
Yes , I do .
Did you read my book about … "
For some people knowing how and why is n't enough .
These people strive to improve how CSS is used and are publishing great articles on new ways of using it .
They constantly go back to the basic needs CSS is filling and attack problems from new angles , often resulting in more great articles .
Some have actually read the whole W3C specification on CSS ( sic ) and they certainly know which parts are supported by which browsers .
They function as role models for beginners and do great things for the web with their influence .
Many work with the Web Standards Project .
If you ever find an error on their site there is a reason for it .
Ask them and they 'll tell you why .
That 's it .
I hope this article gave you some inspiration to keep pushing the web to new victories .
At which level are you ?
Do you have examples of people in last level ?
Unfortunately , you can advertise in all the right places , have a fantastic internship program , and interview all you want , but if the great programmers do n’t want to work for you , they ai n’t gonna come work for you .
So this section will serve as a kind of field guide to developers : what they ’re looking for , what they like and dislike in a workplace , and what it ’s going to take to be a top choice for top developers .
Private offices
Last year I went to a Computer Science conference at Yale .
One of the speakers , a Silicon Valley veteran who had founded or led quite an honor roll of venture - capital funded startups , held up the book Peopleware .
“ You have to read this book , ” he said .
“ This is the bible of how to run a software company .
This is the most important book out there for how to run software companies . ”
I had to agree with him : Peopleware is a great book .
One of the most important , and most controversial , topics in that book is that you have to give programmers lots of quiet space , probably private offices , if you want them to be productive .
The authors , DeMarco and Lister , go on and on about that subject .
After the speech I went up to the speaker .
“ I agree with you about Peopleware , ” I said .
“ Tell me : did you have private offices for your developers at all your startups ? ”
“ Of course not , ” he said .
“ The VCs would never go for that . ”
Hmm .
“ But that might be the number one most important thing in that book , ” I said .
“ Yeah , but you gotta pick your battles .
To VCs , private offices look like you ’re wasting their money . ”
There ’s a strong culture in Silicon Valley that requires you to jam a lot of programmers into a big open space , despite a preponderance of evidence that private offices are far more productive , something which I ’ve covered repeatedly on this site .
I ’m not really getting through to people , I do n’t think , because programmers kind of like being social , even if it means they are unproductive , so it ’s an uphill battle .
I ’ve even heard programmers say things like , “ Yeah , we all work in cubicles , but everyone works in a cubicle — up to and including the CEO ! ”
“ The CEO ?
Does the CEO really work in a cubicle ? ”
“ Well , he has a cubicle , but actually now that you mention it there ’s this one conference room that he goes to for all his important meetings … ”
Mmmm hmmm .
A fairly common Silicon Valley phenomenon is the CEO who makes a big show of working from a cubicle just like the hoi polloi , although somehow there ’s this one conference room that he tends to make his own ( “ Only when there ’s something private to be discussed , ” he ’ll claim , but half the time when you walk by that conference room there ’s your CEO , all by himself , talking on the phone to his golf buddy , with his Cole Haans up on the conference table ) .
Anyway , I do n’t want to revisit the discussion of why private offices are more productive for software developers , or why just putting on headphones to drown out the ambient noise has been shown to reduce the quality of work that programmers produce , and why it does n’t really cost that much more in the scheme of things to have private offices for developers .
I ’ve talked about that already .
Today I ’m talking about recruiting , and private offices in recruiting .
No matter what you think about productivity , and no matter what you think about egalitarian workspaces , two things are incontrovertible :
Private offices have higher status Cubicles and other shared space can be socially awkward .
Given these two facts , the bottom line is that programmers are more likely to take the job that offers them a private office .
Especially if there ’s a door that shuts , and a window , and a nice view .
Now , it ’s an unfortunate fact that some of these things that make recruiting easier are not really within your power .
Even CEOs and founders can be prevented from establishing private offices if they ’re dependent on VCs .
Most companies only move or rearrange their office space every five to ten years .
Smaller startups may not be able to afford private offices .
So my experience has been that a number of excuses all pile up until it ’s virtually impossible to get private offices for developers in any but the most enlightened of companies , and even in those companies , the decision of where to move and where people should work is often taken once every ten years by a committee consisting of the office manager ’s secretary and a junior associate from a big architecture firm , who is apt to believe architecture - school fairy tales about how open spaces mean open companies , or whatever , with close to zero input from the developers or the development team .
This is something of a scandal , and I ’ll keep fighting the good fight , but in the meantime , private offices are not impossible ; we ’ve managed to do it for all of our full - time programmers , most of the time , even in New York City where the rents are some of the highest in the world , and there ’s no question that it makes people much happier about working at Fog Creek , so if you all want to keep resisting , so be it , I ’ll just let this remain a competitive advantage .
The physical workspace
There ’s more to the physical workspace than private offices .
When a candidate comes to your company for the day of interviews , they ’re going to look around at where people are working , and try to imagine themselves working there .
If the office space is pleasant , if it ’s bright , if it ’s in a nice neighborhood , if everything is new and clean : they ’ll have happy thoughts .
If the office space is crowded , if the carpets are ratty and the walls have n’t been painted and there are posters up with pictures of rowing teams and the word TEAMWORK in large print , they ’re going to have Dilbert thoughts .
A lot of tech people are remarkably unaware of the general condition of their office .
In fact , even people who are otherwise attuned to the benefits of a nice office may be blinded to the particular weaknesses of their own office , since they ’re so used to it .
Put yourself in your candidate ’s heads , and think honestly :
What will they think of our location ?
How does Buffalo sound , compared to , say , Austin ?
Do people really want to move to Detroit ?
If you ’re in Buffalo or Detroit , can you at least try to do most of your interviewing in September ?
When they get to the office , what is the experience like ?
What do they see ?
Do they see a clean and exciting place ?
Is there a nice atrium lobby with live palm trees and a fountain , or does it feel like a government dental clinic in a slum , with dying corn plants and old copies of Newsweek ?
What does the workspace look like ?
Is everything new and shiny ?
Or do you still have that gigantic , yellowing TEAM BANANA sign up , the one that was printed on fanfold paper on a dot matrix printer back when there used to be a thing called fanfold paper and a thing called dot matrix printers ?
What do the desks look like ?
Do programmers have multiple large flat screens or a single CRT ?
Are the chairs Aerons or Staples Specials ?
Let me , for a moment , talk about the famous Aeron chair , made by Herman Miller .
They cost about $ 900 .
This is about $ 800 more than a cheap office chair from OfficeDepot or Staples .
They are much more comfortable than cheap chairs .
If you get the right size and adjust it properly , most people can sit in them all day long without feeling uncomfortable .
The back and seat are made out of a kind of mesh that lets air flow so you do n’t get sweaty .
The ergonomics , especially of the newer models with lumbar support , are excellent .
They last longer than cheap chairs .
We ’ve been in business for six years and every Aeron is literally in mint condition : I challenge anyone to see the difference between the chairs we bought in 2000 and the chairs we bought three months ago .
They easily last for ten years .
The cheap chairs literally start falling apart after a matter of months .
You ’ll need at least four $ 100 chairs to last as long as an Aeron .
So the bottom line is that an Aeron only really costs $ 500 more over ten years , or $ 50 a year .
One dollar per week per programmer .
A nice roll of toilet paper runs about a buck .
Your programmers are probably using about one roll a week , each .
So upgrading them to an Aeron chair literally costs the same amount as you ’re spending on their toilet paper , and I assure you that if you tried to bring up toilet paper in the budget committee you would be sternly told not to mess around , there were important things to discuss .
The Aeron chair has , sadly , been tarnished with a reputation of being extravagant , especially for startups .
It somehow came to stand for the symbol of all the VC money that was wasted in the dotcom boom , which is a shame , because it ’s not very expensive when you consider how long it lasts ; indeed when you think of the eight hours a day you spend sitting in it , even the top of the line model , with the lumbar support and the friggin ’ tailfins is so dang cheap you practically make money by buying them .
Toys
Similar logic applies for other developer toys .
There is simply no reason not to get your developers top of the line computers , at least two large ( 21 ″ ) LCD screens ( or one 30 ″ screen ) , and give them free rein on Amazon.com to order any technical book they want .
These are obvious productivity gains , but more importantly to our discussion here , they ’re crucial recruiting tools , especially in a world where most companies treat programmers as interchangeable cogs , typists , really , why do you need such a big monitor and what ’s wrong with 15 ″ CRTs ?
When I was a kid , …
The social life of developers
Software developers are not really all that different from regular people .
Sure , I know , it ’s popular these days to think of developers as stereotypical Asperger ’s geeks , totally untuned to interpersonal things , but that ’s just not true and even Asperger ’s geeks care about the social aspect of a workspace , which includes these issues :
How are programmers treated inside the organization ?
Are they hotshots or typists ?
Is company management made up of engineers or former programmers ?
When developers go to a conference , do they fly first class ?
( I do n’t care if that seems like a waste of money .
Stars go first class .
Get used to it . )
When they fly in for an interview , does a limo pick them up at the airport or are they expected to find their own way to the office ?
All else being equal , developers are going to prefer an organization that treats them like stars .
If your CEO is a grouchy ex-sales person who does n’t understand why these prima donna developers keep demanding things like wrist pads and big monitors and comfortable chairs , who do they think they are ? , your company probably needs an attitude adjustment .
You ’re not going to get great developers if you do n’t respect them .
Who are their colleagues ?
One thing programmers pay close attention to in the day of interviewing is the people they meet .
Are they nice ?
More importantly : are they smart ?
I did a summer internship once at Bellcore , a spinoff of Bell Labs , and everybody I met kept telling me the same thing , again and again : “ The great thing about working for Bellcore is the people . ”
That said , if you have any grouchy developers that you just ca n’t get rid of , at least take them off the interview schedule , and if you have cheerful , social , cruise - director types , make sure they ’re on it .
Keep reminding yourself that when your candidate goes home and has to make a decision about where to work , if everyone they met was glum they are not going to have such a positive memory of your company .
By the way , the original hiring rule for Fog Creek , stolen from Microsoft , was “ Smart , and Gets Things Done . ”
Even before we started the company , we realized that we should add a third rule : “ Not a jerk . ”
In retrospect , at Microsoft not being a jerk is not a requirement to get the job ; although I ’m sure they would pay lip service to how important it as for people to be nice to one another , the bottom line is that they would never disqualify someone for a job just because they were a jerk , in fact , being a jerk sometimes seems like a prerequisite for getting into upper management .
This does n’t really seem to hurt from a business perspective , although it does hurt from a recruiting perspective and who wants to work at a company where jerks are tolerated ?
Independence and autonomy
When I quit my job at Juno , back in 1999 , before starting Fog Creek Software , HR gave me a standard exit interview , and somehow , I fell into the trap of telling the HR person everything that was wrong about the management of the company , something which I knew perfectly well could have no possible benefit to me and could only , actually , hurt , but I did it anyway , and the main thing I complained about was Juno ’s style of hit - and - run management .
Most of the time , you see , managers would leave people alone to quietly get their work done , but occasionally , they would get themselves involved in some microscopic detail of something which they would insist be done exactly their way , no excuses , and then they ’d move on to micromanage some other task , not staying around long enough to see the farcical results .
For example , I remember a particularly annoying period of two or three days where everyone from my manager to the CEO got involved in telling me exactly how dates must be entered on the Juno signup questionnaire .
They were n’t trained as UI designers and did n’t spend enough time talking to me about the issues to understand why I happened to be right in that particular case , but it did n’t matter : management just would not back down on that issue and would n’t even take the time to listen to my arguments .
Basically , if you ’re going to hire smart people , you ’re going to have to let them apply their skills to their work .
Managers can advise , which they ’re welcome to do , but they must be extremely careful to avoid having their “ advice ” interpreted as a command , since on any given technical issue it ’s likely that management knows less than the workers in the trenches , especially , as I said , if you ’re hiring good people .
Developers want to be hired for their skills , and treated as experts , and allowed to make decisions within their own realm of expertise .
No politics Actually , politics happen everywhere that more than two people congregate .
It ’s just natural .
By “ no politics ” I really mean “ no dysfunctional politics . ”
Programmers have very well - honed senses of justice .
Code either works , or it does n’t .
There ’s no sense in arguing whether a bug exists , since you can test the code and find out .
The world of programming is very just and very strictly ordered and a heck of a lot of people go into programming in the first place because they prefer to spend their time in a just , orderly place , a strict meritocracy where you can win any debate simply by being right .
And this is the kind of environment you have to create to attract programmers .
When a programmer complains about “ politics , ” they mean — very precisely — any situation in which personal considerations outweigh technical considerations .
Nothing is more infuriating than when a developer is told to use a certain programming language , not the best one for the task at hand , because the boss likes it .
Nothing is more maddening than when people are promoted because of their ability to network rather than being promoted strictly on merit .
Nothing is more aggravating to a developer than being forced to do something that is technically inferior because someone higher than them in the organization , or someone better - connected , insists on it .
Nothing is more satisfying than winning an argument on its technical merits even when you should have lost it on political merits .
When I started working at Microsoft there was a major , misguided project underway called MacroMan to create a graphical macro programming language .
The programming language would have been very frustrating for real programmers , because the graphical nature did n’t really give you a way to implement loops or conditionals , but would not have really helped non-programmers , who , I think , are just not used to thinking in algorithms and would n’t have understood MacroMan in the first place .
When I complained about MacroMan , my boss told me , “ Nothing ’s gonna derail that train .
Give up . ”
But I kept arguing , and arguing , and arguing — I was fresh out of college , about as unconnected as anyone could be at Microsoft — and eventually people listened to the meat of my arguments and the MacroMan project was shut down .
It did n’t matter who I was , it mattered that I was right .
That ’s the kind of non-political organization that delights programmers .
All in all , focusing on the social dynamics of your organization is crucial to making a healthy , pleasant place to work that will retain programmers and attract programmers .
What am I working on ?
To some extent , one of the best ways you can attract developers is to let them work on something interesting .
This may be the hardest thing to change : doggone it , if you ’re in the business of making software for the gravel and sand industry , that ’s the business you ’re in , and you ca n’t pretend to be some cool web startup just to attract developers .
Another thing developers like is working on something simple enough or popular enough that they can explain to Aunt Irma , at Thanksgiving .
Aunt Irma , of course , being a nuclear physicist , does n’t really know that much about Ruby programming in the gravel and sand industry .
Finally , many developers are going to look at the social values of the company they ’re working for .
Jobs at social networking companies and blog companies help bring people together and do n’t really pollute , it seems , so they ’re popular , while jobs in the munitions industry or in ethically - challenged accounting - fraud - ridden companies are a lot less popular .
Unfortunately I ’m not really sure if I can think of any way for the average hiring manager to do anything about this .
You can try to change your product lineup to make something “ cool , ” but that ’s just not going to go very far .
There are a few things , though , that I ’ve seen companies do in this area :
Let the top recruits pick their own project
For many years , Oracle Corporation had a program called MAP : the “ Multiple Alternatives Program . ”
This was offered to the college graduates whom they considered the top candidates from each class .
The idea was that they could come to Oracle , spend a week or two looking around , visiting all the groups with openings , and then choose any opening they wanted to work in .
I think this was a good idea , although probably someone from Oracle knows better whether this worked out .
Use cool new technologies unnecessarily
The big investment banks in New York are considered fairly tough places for programmers .
The working conditions are dreadful , with long hours , noisy environments , and tyrannical bosses ; programmers are very distinct third - class citizens while the testosterone - crazed apes who actually sell and trade financial instruments are corporate royalty , with $ 30,000,000 bonuses and all the cheeseburgers they can eat ( often delivered by a programmer who happened to be nearby ) .
That ’s the stereotype , anyway , so to keep the best developers , investment banks have two strategies : paying a ton of money , and allowing programmers basically free reign to keep rewriting everything over and over again in whatever hot new programming language they feel like learning .
Wanna rewrite that whole trading app in Lisp ?
Whatever .
Just get me a goddamned cheeseburger .
Some programmers could n’t care less about what programming language they ’re using , but most would just love to have the opportunity to work with exciting new technologies .
Today that may be Python or Ruby on Rails ; three years ago it was C# and before that Java .
Now , I ’m not telling you not to use the best tool for the job , and I ’m not telling you to rewrite in the hot language - du - jour every two years , but if you can find ways for developers to get experience with newer languages , frameworks , and technologies , they ’ll be happier .
Even if you do n’t dare rewrite your core application , is there any reason your internal tools , or less - critical new applications , ca n’t be written in an exciting new language as a learning project ?
Can I identify with the company ?
Most programmers are n’t just looking for a gig to pay the rent .
They do n’t want a “ day job ” : they want to feel like their work has meaning .
They want to identify with their company .
Young programmers , especially , are attracted to ideological companies .
A lot of companies have some connection to open source or the free software movement ( these are not the same thing ) , and that can be attractive to idealistic developers .
Other companies line up with social causes , or produce a product which , in some way , can be perceived or framed as benefitting society .
As a recruiter , your job is to identify the idealistic aspects of your company , and make sure candidates are aware of them .
Some companies even strive to create their own ideological movements .
Chicago - area startup 37signals has strongly aligned themselves with the idea of simplicity : simple , easy to use apps like Backpack and the simple , easy to use programming framework Ruby on Rails .
For 37signals , simplicity is an “ - ism ” , practically an international political movement .
Simplicity is not just simplicity , oh no , it ’s summertime , it ’s beautiful music and peace and justice and happiness and pretty girls with flowers in their hair .
David Heinemeier Hansson , the creator of Rails , says that their story is “ one of beauty , happiness , and motivation .
Taking pride and pleasure in your work and in your tools .
That story simply is n’t a fad , it ’s a trend .
A story that allows for words like passion and enthusiasm to be part of the sanctioned vocabulary of developers without the need to make excuses for yourself .
Or feel embarrassed about really liking what you do . ”
Elevating a web programming framework to a thing of “ beauty , happiness , and motivation ” may seem like hubris , but it ’s very appealing and sure differentiates their company .
In propagating the narrative of Ruby on Rails as Happiness , they ’re practically guaranteeing that at least some developers out there will be looking for Ruby on Rails jobs .
But 37signals is still new at this identity management campaign thing .
They do n’t hold a candle to Apple Computer , which , with a single Superbowl ad in 1984 , managed to cement their position to this day as the countercultural force of freedom against dictatorship , of liberty against oppression , of colors against black and white , of pretty women in bright red shorts against brainwashed men in suits .
The implications of this , I ’m afraid , are ironically Orwellian : giant corporations manipulating their public image in a way which does n’t even make sense ( like , uh , they ’re a computer company — what the hell does that have to do with being against dictatorships ? ) and successfully creating a culture of identity that has computer shoppers around the world feeling like they ’re not just buying a computer , they ’re buying into a movement .
When you buy an iPod , of course , you ’re supporting Gandhi against British Colonialism .
Every MacBook bought takes a stand against dictatorship and hunger !
Anyway .
Deep breath …
The real point of this section is to think of what your company stands for , how it ’s perceived , and how it could be perceived .
Managing your corporate brand is just as important for recruiting as it is for marketing .
One thing that programmers do n’t care about
They do n’t care about money , actually , unless you ’re screwing up on the other things .
If you start to hear complaints about salaries where you never heard them before , that ’s usually a sign that people are n’t really loving their job .
If potential new hires just wo n’t back down on their demands for outlandish salaries , you ’re probably dealing with a case of people who are thinking , “ Well , if it ’s going to have to suck to go to work , at least I should be getting paid well . ”
That does n’t mean you can underpay people , because they do care about justice , and they will get infuriated if they find out that different people are getting different salaries for the same work , or that everyone in your shop is making 20 % less than an otherwise identical shop down the road , and suddenly money will be a big issue .
You do have to pay competitively , but all said , of all the things that programmers look at in deciding where to work , as long as the salaries are basically fair , they will be surprisingly low on their list of considerations , and offering high salaries is a surprisingly ineffective tool in overcoming problems like the fact that programmers get 15 ″ monitors and salespeople yell at them all the time and the job involves making nuclear weapons out of baby seals .
Sorting Resumes
This series continues with an article on how to sort resumes , so that the first people you interview are the most likely to work out well .
WASHINGTON  A commission formed to assess the Iraq war and recommend a new course has ruled out the prospect of victory for America , according to draft policy options shared with The New York Sun by commission officials .
Currently , the 10 - member commission  headed by a secretary of state for President George H.W. Bush , James Baker  is considering two option papers , " Stability First " and " Redeploy and Contain , " both of which rule out any prospect of making Iraq a stable democracy in the near term .
More telling , however , is the ruling out of two options last month .
One advocated minor fixes to the current war plan but kept intact the long - term vision of democracy in Iraq with regular elections .
The second proposed that coalition forces focus their attacks only on Al Qaeda and not the wider insurgency .
Instead , the commission is headed toward presenting President Bush with two clear policy choices that contradict his rhetoric of establishing democracy in Iraq .
The more palatable of the two choices for the White House , " Stability First , " argues that the military should focus on stabilizing Baghdad while the American Embassy should work toward political accommodation with insurgents .
The goal of nurturing a democracy in Iraq is dropped .
The option papers , which sources inside the commission have stressed are still being amended and revised as the panel wraps up its work , give a clearer picture of what Mr. Baker meant in recent interviews when he called for a course adjustment .
They also shed light on what is at stake in the coming 2 1/2 months for the Iraqi government .
The " Redeploy and Contain " option calls for the phased withdrawal of American soldiers from Iraq , though the working groups have yet to say when and where those troops will go .
The document , read over the telephone to the Sun , says America should " make clear to allies and others that U.S. redeployment does not reduce determination to attack terrorists wherever they are . "
It also says America 's top priority should be minimizing American casualties in Iraq .
Both Mr. Baker and his Democratic co-commissioner , Lee Hamilton , have said for nearly a month that the coming weeks and months are crucial for the elected body in Baghdad .
More recently , Mr. Baker has said he is leaning against counseling the president to withdraw from Iraq .
Mr. Bush yesterday spoke approvingly of his father 's old campaign manager and top diplomat , saying he looked forward to seeing " what Jimmy Baker and Lee Hamilton have to say about getting the job done . "
The president also said he was not averse to changing tactics .
But he repeated that the strategic goal in Iraq is to build " a country which can defend itself , sustain itself , and govern itself . "
He added , " The strategic goal is to help this young democracy succeed in a world in which extremists are trying to intimidate rational people in order to topple moderate governments and to extend the caliphate . "
But the president 's strategic goal is at odds with the opinion of Mr. Baker 's expert working groups , which dismiss the notion of victory in Iraq .
The " Stability First " paper says , " The United States should aim for stability particularly in Baghdad and political accommodation in Iraq rather than victory . "
Mr. Baker in recent days has subtly been sounding out this theme with interviewers .
On PBS 's " Charlie Rose Show , " Mr. Baker was careful to say he believed the jury was still out on whether Iraq was a success or a failure .
But he also hastened to distinguish between a Middle East that was " democratic " and one that was merely " representative . "
" If we are able to promote representative , representative government , not necessarily democracy , in a number of nations in the Middle East and bring more freedom to the people of that part of the world , it will have been a success , " he said .
That distinction is crucial , according to one member of the expert working groups .
" Baker wants to believe that Sunni dictators in Sunni majority states are representative , " the group member , who requested anonymity , said .
Both option papers would compel America to open dialogue with Syria and Iran , two rogue states that Iraqi leaders and American military commanders say are providing arms and funds to Iraq 's insurgents .
" Stabilizing Iraq will be impossible without greater cooperation from Iran and Syria , " the " Stability First " paper says .
The option also calls on America to solicit aid and support from the European Union and the United Nations , though both bodies in the past have spurned requests for significant aid for Iraq .
Because of the politically explosive topic of the Baker commission , the panel has agreed not to release its findings until after the November 7 elections .
The commission , formally known as the Iraq Study Group , was created by Congress in legislation sponsored by Rep. Frank Wolf , a Republican of Virginia and close confidant of Mr. Bush's .
Mr. Baker has said he will likely present the panel 's findings in December .
Is Beirut Burning ?
" IT SEEMS that Nasrallah survived , " Israeli newspapers announced , after 23 tons of bombs were dropped on a site in Beirut , where the Hizbullah leader was supposedly hiding in a bunker .
An interesting formulation .
A few hours after the bombing , Nazrallah had given an interview to Aljazeera television .
Not only did he look alive , but even composed and confident .
He spoke about the bombardment - proof that the interview was recorded on the same day .
So what does " it seems that " mean ?
Very simple : Nasrallah pretends to be alive , but you can't believe an Arab .
Everyone knows that Arabs always lie .
That 's in their very nature , as Ehud Barak once pronounced .
THE KILLING of the man is a national aim , almost the main aim of the war .
This is , perhaps , the first war in history waged by a state in order to kill one person .
Until now , only the Mafia thought along those lines .
Even the British in World War II did not proclaim that their aim was to kill Hitler .
On the contrary , they wanted to catch him alive , in order to put him on trial .
Probably that 's what the Americans wanted , too , in their war against Saddam Hussein .
But our ministers have officially decided that that is the aim .
There is not much novelty in that : successive Israeli governments have adopted a policy of killing the leaders of opposing groups .
Our army has killed , among others , Hizbullah leader Abbas Mussawi , PLO no .
2 Abu Jihad , as well as Sheik Ahmad Yassin and other Hamas leaders .
Almost all Palestinians , and not only they , are convinced that Yassir Arafat was also murdered .
And the results ?
The place of Mussawi was filled by Nasrallah , who is far more able .
Sheik Yassin was succeeded by far more radical leaders .
Instead of Arafat we got Hamas .
As in other political matters , a primitive military mindset governs this reasoning too .
A PERSON returning here after a long absence and seeing our TV screens might get the impression that a military junta is governing Israel , in the ( former ) South American manner .
On all TV channels , every evening , one sees a parade of military brass in uniform .
They explain not only the day 's military actions , but also comment on political matters and lay down the political and propaganda line .
During all the other hours of broadcasting time , a dozen or so have - been generals repeat again and again the message of the army commanders .
( Some of them do n't look particularly intelligent - not to say downright stupid .
It is frightening to think that these people were once in a position to decide who would live and who would die . )
True , we are a democracy .
The army is completely subject to the civilian establishment .
According to the law , the cabinet is the " supreme commander " of the army ( which in Israel includes the navy and air force ) .
But in practice , today it is the top brass who decide all political and military matters .
When Dan Halutz tells the ministers that the military command has decided on this or that operation , no minister dares to express opposition .
Certainly not the hapless Labor Party ministers .
Ehud Olmert presents himself as the heir to Churchill ( " blood , sweat and tears " ) .
That 's quite pathetic enough .
Then Amir Peretz puffs up his chest and shoots threats in all directions , and that 's even more pathetic , if that 's possible .
He resembles nothing so much as a fly standing on the ear of an ox and proclaiming : " we are ploughing ! "
The Chief - of - Staff announced last week with satisfaction : " The army enjoys the full backing of the government ! "
That is also an interesting formulation .
It implies that the army decides what to do , and the government provides " backing " .
And that 's how it is , of course .
NOW IT is not a secret anymore : this war has been planned for a long time .
The military correspondents proudly reported this week that the army has been exercising for this war in all its details for several years .
Only a month ago , there was a large war game to rehearse the entrance of land forces into South Lebanon - at a time when both the politicians and the generals were declaring that " we shall never again get into the Lebanon quagmire .
We shall never again introduce land forces there . "
Now we are in the quagmire , and large land forces are operating in the area .
The other side , too , has been preparing this war for years .
Not only did they build caches of thousands of missiles , but they have also prepared an elaborate system of Vietnam - style bunkers , tunnels and caves .
Our soldiers are now encountering this system and paying a high price .
As always , our army has treated " the Arabs " with disdain and discounted their military capabilities .
That is one of the problems of the military mentality .
Talleyrand was not wrong when he said that " war is much too serious a thing to be left to military men . "
The mentality of the generals , resulting from their education and profession , is by nature force - oriented , simplistic , one - dimensional , not to say primitive .
It is based on the belief that all problems can be solved by force , and if that does not work - then by more force .
That is well illustrated by the planning and execution of the current war .
This was based on the assumption that if we cause terrible suffering to the population , they will rise up and demand the removal of Hizbullah .
A minimal understanding of mass psychology would suggest the opposite .
The killing of hundreds of Lebanese civilians , belonging to all the ethno- religious communities , the turning of the lives of the others into hell , and the destruction of the life - supporting infrastructure of Lebanese society will arouse a groundswell of fury and hatred - against Israel , and not against the heroes , as they see them , who sacrifice their lives in their defense .
The result will be a strengthening of Hizbullah , not only today , but for years to come .
Perhaps that will be the main outcome of the war , more important than all the military achievements , if any .
And not only in Lebanon , but throughout the Arab and Muslim world .
Faced with the horrors that are shown on all television and many computer screens , world opinion is also changing .
What was seen at the beginning as a justified response to the capture of the two soldiers now looks like the barbaric actions of a brutal war - machine .
The elephant in a china shop .
Thousands of e-mail distribution lists have circulated a horrible series of photos of mutilated babies and children .
At the end , there is a macabre photo : jolly Israeli children writing " greetings " on the artillery shells that are about to be fired .
Then there appears a message : " Thanks to the children of Israel for this nice gift .
Thanks to the world that does nothing .
Signed : the children of Lebanon and Palestine . "
The woman who heads the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has already defined these acts as war crimes - something that may in future mean trouble for Israeli army officers .
IN GENERAL , when army officers are determining the policy of a nation , serious moral problems arise .
In war , a commander is obliged to take hard decisions .
He sends soldiers into battle , knowing that many will not return and others will be maimed for life .
He hardens his heart .
As General Amos Yaron told his officers after the Sabra and Shatila massacre : " Our senses have been blunted ! "
Years of the occupation regime in the Palestinian territories have caused a terrible callousness as far as human lives are concerned .
The killing of ten to twenty Palestinians every day , including women and children , as happens now in Gaza , does not agitate anyone .
It does n't even make the headlines .
Gradually , even routine expressions like " We regret … we had no intention … the most moral army in the world … " and all the other trite phrases are not heard anymore .
Now this numbness is revealing itself in Lebanon .
Air Force officers , calm and comfortable , sit in front of the cameras and speak about " bundles of targets " , as if they were talking about a technical problem , and not about living human beings .
They speak about driving hundreds of thousands of human beings from their homes as an imposing military achievement , and do not hide their satisfaction in face of human beings whose whole life has been destroyed .
The word that is most popular with the generals at this time is " pulverize " - we pulverize , they are being pulverized , neighborhoods are pulverized , buildings are pulverized , people are pulverized .
Even the launching of rockets at our towns and villages does not justify this ignoring of moral considerations in fighting the war .
There were other ways of responding to the Hizbullah provocation , without turning Lebanon into rubble .
The moral numbness will be transformed into grievous political damage , both immediate and long term .
Only a fool or worse ignores moral values - in the end , they always take revenge .
IT IS almost banal to say that it is easier to start a war than to finish it .
One knows how it starts , it is impossible to know how it will end .
Wars take place in the realm of uncertainty .
Unforeseen things happen .
Even the greatest captains in history could not control the wars they started .
War has its own laws .
We started a war of days .
It turned into a war of weeks .
Now they are speaking of a war of months .
Our army started a " surgical " action of the Air Force , afterwards it sent small units into Lebanon , now whole brigades are fighting there , and reservists are being called up in large numbers for a wholesale 1982 - style invasion .
Some people already foresee that the war may roll towards a confrontation with Syria .
All this time , the United States has been using all its might in order to prevent the cessation of hostilities .
All signs indicate that it is pushing Israel towards a war with Syria - a country that has ballistic missiles with chemical and biological warheads .
Only one thing is already certain on the 11th day of the war : Nothing good will come of it .
Whatever happens - Hizbullah will emerge strengthened .
If there had been hopes in the past that Lebanon would slowly become a normal country , where Hizbullah would be deprived of a pretext for maintaining a military force of its own , we have now provided the organization with the perfect justification : Israel is destroying Lebanon , only Hizbullah is fighting to defend the country .
As for deterrence : a war in which our huge military machine cannot overcome a small guerilla organization in 11 days of total war certainly has not rehabilitated its deterrent power .
In this respect , it is not important how long this war will last and what will be its results - the fact that a few thousand fighters have withstood the Israeli army for 11 days and more , has already been imprinted in the consciousness of hundred of millions of Arabs and Muslims .
From this war nothing good will come - not for Israel , not for Lebanon and not for Palestine .
The " New Middle East " that will be its result will be a worse place to live in .
Hoping to spur public support for equipping commercial airplanes with missile defense systems , Northrop Grumman Corp. has unveiled a 6 - foot - long canoe - shaped device that would be attached to the belly of an airliner .
The equipment would work by emitting a laser beam that would jam the guidance system of a shoulder - fired missile .
Northrop put the device on display last week at Mojave Airport .
For the record : For The Record

Airliner defense system --
An article in Thursday ’s Business section about Northrop Grumman Corp. unveiling a missile defense system for commercial aircraft misspelled the last name of the executive vice president for the Air Transport Assn. , John Meenan , as John Meanen .
The timing of Northrop ’s public relations event could not have been better .
Hours earlier a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted two men on charges of conspiring to smuggle as many as 200 shoulder - fired , surface - to - air missiles into the U.S. Both men , naturalized U.S. citizens of Chinese descent living in Los Angeles , allegedly tried to broker the sale of Chinese - made QW - 2 missiles to undercover FBI agents .
The case is the second involving covert sales of shoulder - fired missiles .
A British arms dealer was convicted this year in New Jersey of attempting to broker a deal to sell 200 Russian surface - to - air missiles to an East African terrorist group he thought would use them to shoot down commercial airliners in the U.S .

The cases have renewed attention on efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to protect airlines from portable surface - to - air missiles .
It also has intensified the debate over the necessity of defensive systems .
Domestic airlines , already financially strapped , are balking at moves to equip their jets with the systems , which could cost up to $ 1 million per plane .
“ It ’s a huge expenditure of resources to deal with one type of threat , ” said John Meanen , executive vice president for the Air Transport Assn. , which represents major airlines .
The Department of Homeland Security has warned of the widespread availability of portable weapons and that terrorists could use them to shoot down jetliners .
“ Airplanes approaching LAX [ Los Angeles International Airport ] are particularly vulnerable because they are flying over mountains ” as they descend , said Jack Pledger , head of the Northrop unit that developed the system .

Thus far , no U.S. passenger plane has been downed by a shoulder - fired missile outside of a combat zone .
But 35 foreign civilian aircraft , many in war - torn parts of Africa , have been attacked with shoulder - fired missiles , according to the Transportation Security Administration .
Of those , two dozen were shot down , killing 640 people .
And terrorists linked with Al Qaeda are believed to have fired two portable surface - to - air missiles that narrowly missed hitting an Israeli passenger jet after it took off from Kenya in 2002 .
The typical shoulder - held launcher and the small missile were designed by the U.S. in the 1950s and can strike aircraft flying up to 15,000 feet , or at a range of up to three miles .
More than 1 million portable missile launchers have been produced worldwide , according to reports .
Concerned by the potential threat to U.S. carriers after the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the Homeland Security Department began a competition last year to develop a cheaper , commercial variant of missile defense systems used by the military .
Century City - based Northrop , and Britain ’s largest defense contractor , BAE Systems , each received $ 45 - million contracts to develop prototype systems .

However , Rep. John L. Mica ( R - Fla . ) , chairman of the aviation subcommittee of the House Transportation Committee , is pushing for a mandate to get the equipment installed on commercial aircraft that would fly in and out of vulnerable airports .
It would be like having an air marshal on board , he said .
Meanwhile , Raytheon Corp. has proposed a ground - based defense system that could be installed at major airports for about $ 25 million apiece .
It would use microwaves to damage a missile ’s electronic components , disrupting the guidance system .
So last week , Northrop and BAE unveiled their competing systems , which are undergoing preliminary flight tests .
Northrop has teamed with Federal Express , which has the device installed on one of its MD - 11 cargo planes , while BAE has put its gear on an American Airlines Boeing 767 .
Actual live - fire tests are not expected until next year , when the U.S. government will decide whether to pick one or both systems .
Live tests will be conducted at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico .

Both systems rely on sensors that detect missiles and use a laser to disrupt the missiles ’ infrared guidance system , which typically lock onto the heat emitted from a jet engine .
The rival systems cost about the same , but differ in how they would be used on aircraft .
In the Northrop system , the sensors , electronics and laser are all encased in a portable pod weighing about 430 pounds that can be attached or detached in about 10 minutes , the company said .
Much of BAE ’s system , however , is designed to be permanently installed into a plane ’s fuselage , with various components and sensors positioned at different places on an aircraft .
Northrop maintains that its system is easier to maintain , while BAE says its integrated equipment will be more streamlined , increasing fuel efficiency .

Northrop also contends that its defense system has been proven in military use and that simulated tests of the commercial device have been “ 100 % successful . ”
“ We know how to defeat missiles , ” said John Stanfill , who is leading the commercial development of Northrop ’s military defense system .
“ This program is not about that .
It ’s about making it viable for commercial use . ”
Shares of Northrop closed up 59 cents Wednesday at $ 56.72 .
Is a Recession Imminent ?
The sharp slowdown in housing and the inverted yield curve have led to concerns that the odds of a recession have risen .
For instance , Dow Jones Newswire reported on November 2 that one model based on the yield curve put the probability of a recession over the next four quarters at more than 50 % .
This Letter presents and discusses various estimates of the probability of recession .
Our review of the evidence suggests two conclusions :
First , recessions appear difficult to predict ; second , while the probability of a recession over the next year may now be somewhat elevated , it does not appear to be nearly as high as the yield curve suggests .
Indicator models for predicting recessions
One way to predict the likelihood of a recession would involve simulating a large structural model of the U.S. economy .
But economists disagree about the structure of the economy , so several have suggested using indicator models instead .
The indicator models constructed by James Stock and Mark Watson ( SW ) are among the best known .
Their work in this area preceded the 1990 - 1991 recession and continued through December 2003 ( see , for instance , SW 1989 ) .
Their recession index ( which estimates the probability of recession six months hence ) and variations thereof are themselves a function of two indexes for Leading and Coincident Indicators .
Unfortunately , their real - time performance has not been wholly satisfactory .
The first index failed to predict the 1990 - 1991 recession , and a variation failed to predict the 2001 recession .
Of course , the SW indicators are not the only ones that failed .
SW ( 2003 ) discusses this widespread failure and argues that it is hard to predict recessions because each is caused by a unique set of factors .
For instance , income and consumption data did not provide much evidence portending a recession in 2001 , but industrial production data did , because the recession was associated with IT manufacturing .
By contrast , in the 1990 - 1991 recession , consumption did slow .
Thus , “ without knowing these shocks in advance , it is unclear how a forecaster would have decided in 1999 which of the many promising leading indicators would perform well over the next few years and which would not ” ( p. 88 ) .
It should be noted that the SW approach definitely has had successes ; the version used by the Chicago Fed , for instance , did a reasonably good job in real time of signaling a ( coincident ) slowdown in activity early in the 2001 recession .
What does the index say now ?
As of October 25 , the three - month average of the Chicago Fed ’s National Activity Index ( 2006 ) stood at - 0.25 .
A value below zero implies that growth is below trend ; values below - 0.7 are associated with an “ … increasing likelihood that a recession has begun ” ( p. 2 ) .
Information from the yield curve
The yield curve is perhaps the best known of all the indicator models used to predict recessions .
We begin with a model developed by Wright ( 2006 ) that uses information on the term spread and the funds rate .
As Figure 1 shows , this model has done a reasonably good job of predicting recessions .
Based on data for November 8 , the model estimates a 47 % probability of recession over the next four quarters .
As a reference point , note that over 1964 : Q1 - 2005 :Q2 , 27 % of the four - quarter periods after any given quarter contained a recession ; however , over 1984:Q1 - 2005 : Q2 , a period when output growth was noticeably less volatile than before , this frequency falls to only 15 % .
There is reason to be skeptical about the current high estimate of the probability of recession , because the unusually low rates at the long end of the yield curve are not well understood ; indeed , former Fed Chairman Greenspan famously pointed out that this behavior is a conundrum ( 2005 ) .
Wright attempts to deal with these problems by estimating several alternative versions , but the results are virtually indistinguishable from the base model .
Hence , the statistical evidence does not clearly indicate how to incorporate the low long - term yields into the probability estimates .
Concern about the behavior of long - term yields could be allayed by adding other variables to the forecasting equation .
For example , Dueker ( 2005 ) included real GDP growth and CPI inflation ( in addition to the spread and the funds rate ) and estimated a vector autoregression to improve the modeling of the dynamics of the process .
Unlike the SW models , real - time estimates from the Dueker model made at the end of 2000 placed the probability of recession in mid- to late 2001 above 50 % .
Figure 2 shows the business conditions index that underlies this probability ; this version is updated and based on currently available data .
When this index falls below zero ( as it did in 2000 ) , the recession probability rises above 50 % .
Although the figure indicates that business conditions have deteriorated recently , they remain comparable to those prevailing around 1995 - 1996 , a period when the economy had slowed but did not enter a recession .
While the model predicts some further deterioration in business conditions over the next year , it does not see much more than a 10 % chance of a recessionary quarter over this period .
Survey evidence
Surveys , such as the well - known Blue Chip survey and the Survey of Professional Forecasters , represent subjective probability assessments and could incorporate judgmental adjustments to model forecasts .
In November , the Blue Chip survey asked a special question on the odds of a recession in the next 12 months .
The consensus was 24.8 % ; the average of the highest ten responses was 36.5 % , and the average of the lowest ten was 14.8 % .
Earlier , the consensus was 25.1 % in September and 26.9 % in August .
Although these numbers are well below those from the yield curve model , they also are not that different from those recorded before the beginning of the last recession in March 2001 ; for example , in every month from May to September 2000 and again in November 2000 , the consensus probability of recession varied from a low of 16 % to a high of 23 % .
Moreover , respondents found it hard to tell if the economy was in a recession in real time ; for instance , when asked whether the economy had entered a recession in June 2001 , 93 % said no .
The Survey of Professional Forecasters regularly asks respondents to provide separate estimates of the probability that real GDP growth will be negative in the current quarter and the subsequent four quarters .
Figure 3 displays data for three of these five quarters ; for example , regarding the forecast for 2006 : Q3 , the line labeled “ current quarter ” shows the mean probability of negative real GDP growth as estimated in 2006:Q3 , and the line labeled “ 2 quarters earlier ” shows this probability as estimated in 2006 : Q1 .
Recently , the probabilities have crept up , with the third quarter survey results indicating close to a 10 % chance of recession in 2006:Q4 and a 19 % chance in 2007 : Q2 .
Still , these levels are around the middle of the range that prevailed during the boom years of the late 1990s ( see the line labeled “ 2 quarters earlier , ” for instance ) .
Furthermore , probabilities from this survey did not give much warning of the last recession , as even the current - quarter estimate did not rise substantially until after the recession had begun .
An assessment
Because the single - equation model based on the yield curve and the funds rate appears to have performed better historically than other models , it makes sense to take its pessimistic forecast seriously .
Yet there also are mitigating factors to consider .
For example , the ability of the yield curve to forecast recessions is often attributed to the fact that the long - term rate reflects market expectations about future developments in the economy .
But in that case , one would expect professional forecasters to have this information as well , leading to survey probabilities similar to those from the yield curve .
At a minimum , forecasters should be incorporating information from the yield curve into their forecasts .
A more concrete reason to be cautious about this forecast lies in the recent behavior of long - term rates , which argues for reducing the weight one places upon the term spread and relying upon other variables when making forecasts .
The Dueker model provides one way of doing so , and its forecast ( based on data through August ) is noticeably more optimistic .
However , deciding what to include brings us back to the problem discussed by Stock and Watson :
The forecast we get depends on the indicators we add to the term spread .
In particular , adding data on the housing sector is sure to lead to more pessimistic forecasts .
That said , our review of the available surveys , indicators , and model forecasts leads to estimates of the probability of recession that are all lower than the one based on the term spread and the yield curve .
Furthermore , financial markets exhibit little evidence of distress : the Dow has hit record highs recently , and various risk spreads ( such as the rate on corporate bonds relative to Treasuries ) remain at low levels .
Taken together with our inability to explain the unusually low level of long - term rates , this suggests to us that while the probability of recession might have gone up somewhat in recent months , it is not yet at worrisome levels .
Finally , not only are recessions hard to predict , it is even hard to tell that the economy is in a recession once it has begun .
This is especially true in the low volatility regime that has prevailed since the mid-1980s .
Here , the evidence suggests that it may be useful to supplement data from the surveys with data from indicator models that attempt to measure the current state of the economy .

In a darkened Las Vegas conference room , a cheering audience waves cardboard wands in the air .
Each wand is red on one side , green on the other .
Far in back of the huge auditorium , a camera scans the frantic attendees .
The video camera links the color spots of the wands to a nest of computers set up by graphics wizard Loren Carpenter .
Carpenter 's custom software locates each red and each green wand in the auditorium .
Tonight there are just shy of 5,000 wandwavers .
The computer displays the precise location of each wand ( and its color ) onto an immense , detailed video map of the auditorium hung on the front stage , which all can see .
More importantly , the computer counts the total red or green wands and uses that value to control software .
As the audience wave the wands , the display screen shows a sea of lights dancing crazily in the dark , like a candlelight parade gone punk .
The viewers see themselves on the map ; they are either a red or green pixel .
By flipping their own wands , they can change the color of their projected pixels instantly .
Loren Carpenter boots up the ancient video game of Pong onto the immense screen .
Pong was the first commercial video game to reach pop consciousness .
It 's a minimalist arrangement : a white dot bounces inside a square ; two movable rectangles on each side act as virtual paddles .
In short , electronic ping - pong .
In this version , displaying the red side of your wand moves the paddle up .
Green moves it down .
More precisely , the Pong paddle moves as the average number of red wands in the auditorium increases or decreases .
Your wand is just one vote .
Carpenter does n't need to explain very much .
Every attendee at this 1991 conference of computer graphic experts was probably once hooked on Pong .
His amplified voice booms in the hall , " Okay guys .
Folks on the left side of the auditorium control the left paddle .
Folks on the right side control the right paddle .
If you think you are on the left , then you really are .
Okay ?
Go ! "
The audience roars in delight .
Without a moment 's hesitation , 5,000 people are playing a reasonably good game of Pong .
Each move of the paddle is the average of several thousand players ' intentions .
The sensation is unnerving .
The paddle usually does what you intend , but not always .
When it does n't , you find yourself spending as much attention trying to anticipate the paddle as the incoming ball .
One is definitely aware of another intelligence online : it 's this hollering mob .
The group mind plays
Pong so well that Carpenter decides to up the ante .
Without warning the ball bounces faster .
The participants squeal in unison .
In a second or two , the mob has adjusted to the quicker pace and is playing better than before .
Carpenter speeds up the game further ; the mob learns instantly .
" Let 's try something else , " Carpenter suggests .
A map of seats in the auditorium appears on the screen .
He draws a wide circle in white around the center .
" Can you make a green ' 5 ' in the circle ? " he asks the audience .
The audience stares at the rows of red pixels .
The game is similar to that of holding a placard up in a stadium to make a picture , but now there are no preset orders , just a virtual mirror .
Almost immediately wiggles of green pixels appear and grow haphazardly , as those who think their seat is in the path of the " 5 " flip their wands to green .
A vague figure is materializing .
The audience collectively begins to discern a " 5 " in the noise .
Once discerned , the " 5 " quickly precipitates out into stark clarity .
The wand - wavers on the fuzzy edge of the figure decide what side they " should " be on , and the emerging " 5 " sharpens up .
The number assembles itself .
" Now make a four ! " the voice booms .
Within moments a " 4 " emerges .
" Three . "
And in a blink a " 3 " appears .
Then in rapid succession , " Two ... One ... Zero . "
The emergent thing is on a roll .
Loren Carpenter launches an airplane flight simulator on the screen .
His instructions are terse : " You guys on the left are controlling roll ; you on the right , pitch .
If you point the plane at anything interesting , I 'll fire a rocket at it . "
The plane is airborne .
The pilot is ... 5,000 novices .
For once the auditorium is completely silent .
Everyone studies the navigation instruments as the scene outside the windshield sinks in .
The plane is headed for a landing in a pink valley among pink hills .
The runway looks very tiny .
There is something both delicious and ludicrous about the notion of having the passengers of a plane collectively fly it .
The brute democratic sense of it all is very appealing .
As a passenger you get to vote for everything ; not only where the group is headed , but when to trim the flaps .
But group mind seems to be a liability in the decisive moments of touchdown , where there is no room for averages .
As the 5,000 conference participants begin to take down their plane for landing , the hush in the hall is ended by abrupt shouts and urgent commands .
The auditorium becomes a gigantic cockpit in crisis .
" Green , green , green ! " one faction shouts .
" More red ! " a moment later from the crowd .
" Red , red ! REEEEED ! "
The plane is pitching to the left in a sickening way .
It is obvious that it will miss the landing strip and arrive wing first .
Unlike Pong , the flight simulator entails long delays in feedback from lever to effect , from the moment you tap the aileron to the moment it banks .
The latent signals confuse the group mind .
It is caught in oscillations of overcompensation .
The plane is lurching wildly .
Yet the mob somehow aborts the landing and pulls the plane up sensibly .
They turn the plane around to try again .
How did they turn around ?
Nobody decided whether to turn left or right , or even to turn at all .
Nobody was in charge .
But as if of one mind , the plane banks and turns wide .
It tries landing again .
Again it approaches cockeyed .
The mob decides in unison , without lateral communication , like a flock of birds taking off , to pull up once more .
On the way up the plane rolls a bit .
And then rolls a bit more .
At some magical moment , the same strong thought simultaneously infects five thousand minds : " I wonder if we can do a 360 ? "
Without speaking a word , the collective keeps tilting the plane .
There 's no undoing it .
As the horizon spins dizzily , 5,000 amateur pilots roll a jet on their first solo flight .
It was actually quite graceful .
They give themselves a standing ovation .
The conferees did what birds do : they flocked .
But they flocked self - consciously .
They responded to an overview of themselves as they co-formed a " 5 " or steered the jet .
A bird on the fly , however , has no overarching concept of the shape of its flock .
" Flockness " emerges from creatures completely oblivious of their collective shape , size , or alignment .
A flocking bird is blind to the grace and cohesiveness of a flock in flight .
At dawn , on a weedy Michigan lake , ten thousand mallards fidget .
In the soft pink glow of morning , the ducks jabber , shake out their wings , and dunk for breakfast .
Ducks are spread everywhere .
Suddenly , cued by some imperceptible signal , a thousand birds rise as one thing .
They lift themselves into the air in a great thunder .
As they take off they pull up a thousand more birds from the surface of the lake with them , as if they were all but part of a reclining giant now rising .
The monstrous beast hovers in the air , swerves to the east sun , and then , in a blink , reverses direction , turning itself inside out .
A second later , the entire swarm veers west and away , as if steered by a single mind .
In the 17th century , an anonymous poet wrote : " ... and the thousands of fishes moved as a huge beast , piercing the water .
They appeared united , inexorably bound to a common fate .
How comes this unity ? "
A flock is not a big bird .
Writes the science reporter James Gleick , " Nothing in the motion of an individual bird or fish , no matter how fluid , can prepare us for the sight of a skyful of starlings pivoting over a cornfield , or a million minnows snapping into a tight , polarized array ....
High - speed film [ of flocks turning to avoid predators ] reveals that the turning motion travels through the flock as a wave , passing from bird to bird in the space of about one - seventieth of a second .
That is far less than the bird 's reaction time . "
The flock is more than the sum of the birds .
In the film Batman Returns a horde of large black bats swarmed through flooded tunnels into downtown Gotham .
The bats were computer generated .
A single bat was created and given leeway to automatically flap its wings .
The one bat was copied by the dozens until the animators had a mob .
Then each bat was instructed to move about on its own on the screen following only a few simple rules encoded into an algorithm : do n't bump into another bat , keep up with your neighbors , and do n't stray too far away .
When the algorithmic bats were run , they flocked like real bats .
The flocking rules were discovered by Craig Reynolds , a computer scientist working at Symbolics , a graphics hardware manufacturer .
By tuning the various forces in his simple equation -- a little more cohesion , a little less lag time -- Reynolds could shape the flock to behave like living bats , sparrows , or fish .
Even the marching mob of penguins in Batman Returns were flocked by Reynolds 's algorithms .
Like the bats , the computer - modeled 3 - D penguins were cloned en masse and then set loose into the scene aimed in a certain direction .
Their crowdlike jostling as they marched down the snowy street simply emerged , out of anyone 's control .
So realistic is the flocking of Reynolds 's simple algorithms that biologists have gone back to their hi-speed films and concluded that the flocking behavior of real birds and fish must emerge from a similar set of simple rules .
A flock was once thought to be a decisive sign of life , some noble formation only life could achieve .
Via Reynolds 's algorithm it is now seen as an adaptive trick suitable for any distributed vivisystem , organic or made .

2,3,5 , Infinity !
ABSTRACT : Nearly 60 years after the first electronic digital computer was designed at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies ( IAS ) , companies like Google are demonstrating the power of a world built from 1s and 0s .
Zome is a system that models the world built from the numbers 2 , 3 and 5 .
We will explore how these numbers are knotted together to form the structure of space , from the subatomic framework of the atom , to the geometry of life , to a recently proposed “ shape ” of the universe !

iClaustron : Open Source Grid Cluster Storage Controller
ABSTRACT : Many applications has requirements to store petabytes of base data and many terabytes of structured data .
Examples of this are genealogy , astronomy , biotech and so forth .
This talk will discuss requirements from the genealogy application and show how this requirements requires building very large clustered systems with an hierarchy of clusters .
These clusters are used to both store base data and structured data .
He goes on to show how these requirements translate into a systems architecture with essential components of off - the shelf servers , cheap storage , clustered software and integrated cluster interconnects .

Security is Broken
ABSTRACT : Our computer security model is broken .
Worse yet , it never really has worked at all well , and is even less suitable for today 's uses .
In this talk , I explore the history behind the design of the current security both in hardware and operating systems .
Instead of evolving a more secure model over time , system designers have actually managed to make things worse , creating insecurity in depth .
Most of today 's systems are single user machines : certainly desktops and laptops , but also most servers .
The current security model was not designed to protect users from themselves , and this goes a long way towards understanding why security is so difficult .
I end by looking at strategies for improving security -- but no real solutions .
The point is to start thinking outside of the box , while adopting best practices today .
What we have done in the past has not worked , and can not work .
We need to look at the security model in a new way , and that is the real point of this presentation .
High Radix Interconnection Networks
ABSTRACT : High - radix interconnection networks offer significantly better cost / performance and lower latency than conventional ( low - radix ) topologies .
Increasing radix is motivated by the exponential increase in router pin bandwidth over time .
Increasing the radix or degree of a router node is a more efficient way to exploit this increasing bandwidth than making channels wider .
A high - radix poses several challenges in router design because the internal structures of conventional routers ( e.g. , the allocators ) scale quadratically with radix .
A hierarchical switch organization with internal buffering yields a scalable design with near - optimal performance .
A high - radix " flattened butterfly " topology , enabled by recent developments in global adaptive routing , offers twice the performance as a comparable - cost Clos network on balanced traffic .
Many of these developments have been incorporated in the YARC router and interconnection network for the Cray Black Widow Supercomputer .

Using Statistics to Search and Annotate Pictures
ABSTRACT : The last decade has produced significant advances in content - based image retrieval , i.e. the design of computer vision systems for image search .
I will review our efforts in the area , with emphasis on the subject of semantic retrieval .
This consists of learning to annotate images , in order to support natural language queries .
In particular , I will argue for a retrieval framework which combines the best properties of classical " query by visual example " ( QBVE ) , and more recent semantic methods , and which we denote as " query by semantic example " ( QBSE ) .
While simple , we show that , when combined with ideas from multiple instance learning , this framework can be quite powerful .
It improves semantic retrieval along a number of dimensions , the most notable of which is generalization ( out - of - vocabulary queries ) .
It can also be directly compared to query by example , making it possible to quantify the gains of representing images in semantic spaces .
Our results show that these gains are quite significant , even when the semantic characterization is noisy and somewhat unreliable .
This suggests an interesting hypothesis for computer vision : that it may suffice to adopt simple visual models , as long as they operate at various levels of abstraction and are learned from large amounts of data .
Badvertisements : Stealthy Click Fraud with Unwitting Accessories
ABSTRACT : We describe a new type of threat to the Internet infrastructure , in the shape of a highly efficient but very well camouflaged click - fraud attack on the advertising infrastructure , not using any type of malware .
The attack , which we refer to as a " badvertisement " , is described and experimentally verified on several prominent advertisement schemes .
This stealthy attack can be thought of as a threatening mutation of spam and phishing attacks , with which it has many commonalities , except for the fact that it is not the targeted individual who is the victim in the attack , but the advertiser .
Decision Making and Chance
ABSTRACT : Certain gambling games , such as roulette and craps , are games of pure chance :
In repeated play , luck disappears , and the persistent gambler will go broke .
Other gambling activities , such as betting on sports or the stock market , may involve an element of skill .
One way to measure this is to compare the results of a gambling strategy with chance :
A skillful strategy should produce long - run results that are better than would be achieved by someone who is just guessing .
One can also compare a gambler ’s losses with chance to see if the gambler is doing worse than chance would allow .
I will discuss two recent projects that illustrate these concepts :
Automated data mining software discovers that the Baltimore Ravens are 17 - 3 versus the point spread when they lost their previous game and their opponents played their previous game on the road .
Do situations like this give clever gamblers an edge or are such strong win-loss records merely random flukes ?
A gambler loses $ 30 million betting at an online casino .
Is it possible to lose this much just by chance or is the gambler being cheated ?
Or maybe the gambler is part of a money laundering scheme .
The Electric Sheep and their Dreams in High Fidelity
ABSTRACT :
Electric
Sheep is a distributed screen - saver that harnesses idle computers into a render farm with the purpose of animating and evolving artificial life - forms known as sheep .
The votes of the users form the basis for the fitness function for a genetic algorithm on a space of abstract animations .
Users also may design sheep by hand for inclusion in the gene pool .
This cyborg mind composed of 35,000 computers and people was used to make Dreams in High Fidelity : a painting that evolves .
It consists of 55 GB of high definition sheep that would have taken one computer over 100 years to render , played back to form a nonrepeating continuously morphing image .
The talk will cover the genetic code and renderer , the genetic algorithm , how error correction is built into the distributed renderer while minimizing performance penalty , and how to distribute 750 GB of video per day without paying for it .
The talk will include a demo of the artwork .
ReUsable Web Components with Python and Future Python Web Development
ABSTRACT : Python 's Web Server Gateway Interface ( WSGI ) not only enables a multitude of Python web frameworks to share code when it comes to deployment , but also enables entirely new levels of re-use for Python web development .
This talk is focused on explaining WSGI , new types of re-use with WSGI middleware , and explore new frameworks that heavily utilize WSGI ; in this case , Pylons .
Moving beyond monolithic frameworks that try to do everything themselves , to new modes of development where you can use just the parts you want and still have active development communities to interact with .

Measuring Programmer Productivity
ABSTRACT : Developers have been programming for the last 30 years in a wide variety of programming languages .
Over the years , we have all developed a feeling for what it is in a programming language that makes us productive as programmers .
As part of the DARPA HPCS ( High Productivity Computing Systems ) program , we are developing models and tools to measure programmer productivity .
We will describe our data gathering process , and our effort to model programmer workflows using timed markov models .

Sparse and large - scale learning with heterogeneous data
ABSTRACT : An important challenge for the field of machine learning is to deal with the increasing amount of data that is available for learning and to leverage the ( also increasing ) diversity of information sources , describing these data .
Beyond classical vectorial data formats , data in the format of graphs , trees , strings and beyond have become widely available for data mining , e.g. , the linked structure of the world wide web , text , images and sounds on web pages , protein interaction networks , phylogenetic trees , etc .
Moreover , for interpretability and economical reasons , decision rules that rely on a small subset of the information sources and / or a small subset of the features describing the data are highly desired : sparse learning algorithms are a must .
This talk will outline two recent approaches that address sparse , large - scale learning with heterogeneous data , and show some applications .

Random Sampling from a Search Engine 's Index
ABSTRACT : We revisit a problem introduced by Bharat and Broder almost a decade ago : how to sample random pages from a search engine 's index using only the search engine 's public interface ?
In this paper we introduce two novel sampling techniques : a lexicon - based technique and a random walk technique .
Our methods produce biased sample documents , but each sample is accompanied by a corresponding " weight " , which represents the probability of this document to be selected in the sample .
The samples , in conjunction with the weights , are then used to simulate near - uniform samples .
To this end , we resort to three well known Monte Carlo simulation methods : rejection sampling , importance sampling and the Metropolis - Hastings algorithm .
We analyze our methods rigorously and prove that under plausible assumptions , our techniques are guaranteed to produce near - uniform samples from the search engine 's index .
Experiments on a corpus of 2.4 million documents substantiate our analytical findings and show that our algorithms do not have significant bias towards long or highly ranked documents .
A New Way to look at Networking
ABSTRACT : Today 's research community congratulates itself for the success of the internet and passionately argues whether circuits or datagrams are the One True Way .
Meanwhile the list of unsolved problems grows .
Security , mobility , ubiquitous computing , wireless , autonomous sensors , content distribution , digital divide , third world infrastructure , etc. , are all poorly served by what 's available from either the research community or the marketplace .
I 'll use various strained analogies and contrived examples to argue that network research is moribund because the only thing it knows how to do is fill in the details of a conversation between two applications .
Today as in the 60s problems go unsolved due to our tunnel vision and not because of their intrinsic difficulty .
And now , like then , simply changing our point of view may make many hard things easy .
Privacy Preserving DataMining
ABSTRACT : The rapid growth of the Internet over the last decade has been startling .
However , efforts to track its growth have often fallen afoul of bad data --- for instance , how much traffic does the Internet now carry ?
The problem is not that the data is technically hard to obtain , or that it does not exist , but rather that the data is not shared .
Obtaining an overall picture requires data from multiple sources , few of whom are open to sharing such data , either because it violates privacy legislation , or exposes business secrets .
The approaches used so far in the Internet , e.g. , trusted third parties , or data anonymization , have been only partially successful , and are not widely adopted .
The paper presents a method for performing computations on shared data without any participants revealing their secret data .
For example , one can compute the sum of traffic over a set of service providers without any service provider learning the traffic of another .
The method is simple , scalable , and flexible enough to perform a wide range of valuable operations on Internet data .
Near - optimal Monitoring of Online Data Sources
ABSTRACT
Crawling the Web for interesting and relevant changes has become increasingly difficult due to the abundance of frequently changing information .
Common techniques for solving such problems make use of heuristics , which do not provide performance guarantees and tend to be tailored to specific scenarios or benchmarks .
In this talk , I will present a principled approach based on mathematical optimization for monitoring high - volume online data sources .
We have built and deployed a distributed system called Corona that enables clients to subscribe to Web pages and notifies clients of updates asynchronously via instant messages .
Corona assigns multiple nodes to cooperatively monitor each Web page and employs a novel decentralized optimization technique for distributing the monitoring load .
In its currently running form , the optimization algorithm guarantees the best update detection time on average without exceeding resource constraints on the monitoring servers .
Based on simulations and measurements on our deployed system , I will show that Corona performs substantially better than commonly used heuristics .

More than three - quarters of police officers in England and Wales do not want to carry firearms , even though more than 40 % have faced life - threatening situations in the past two years , a report reveals today .
The Police Federation poll , released at its annual conference in Bournemouth , found 77 % of respondents rejected routine arming of frontline officers , despite 5.7 % , the equivalent of 7,000 throughout the 43 English and Welsh forces , having had guns pointed at them , while 28 % have been threatened with knives .
A total of 41.6 % had been physically assaulted while arresting suspects .

BBC News , Beit Hanoun
Homes were left standing , but inside there was great destruction
This street in Beit Hanoun is very , very quiet indeed .
It 's just a matter of hours since a number of Israeli shells fell on houses in this area , killing 18 people , including six children and two women .
We counted about eight impacts .
The shells appear to have landed roughly in a straight line , starting in the fields at the end of the street and hitting houses on either side of it .
A pen for livestock was struck by one of the explosions and the animals are lying dead on the ground .
There are pools of bloodstained water outside one of the houses , which has had a hole blown through the roof and there are shrapnel marks everywhere from the explosion .
Shock and incomprehension
A woman just walked past me crying , being helped by some of her neighbours .
Most of the victims were from the same branch of the same family
A father of one child who was killed told me : " One missile I believe could have been a mistake , but the number of missiles that were fired , I can't believe that was a mistake . "
A resident who works in one of Gaza 's hospitals says : " I have not seen injuries like this for a long time . "
" The shrapnel severed peoples hands and arms and they were left lying on the ground , " Dr Ali said .
He had been sleeping in his bedroom when the shells struck the next door building .
The windows of his bedroom had been blasted out and there was glass on the ground .
Dr Ali tells the same story as everyone I spoke to , that there had been no anti-Israeli attacks by Palestinian militants from this area , as the Israeli military claims , before the shells struck .
" I did not get woken up by anything during the night .
There was no sign of rocket fire during the night , " Dr Ali said .
It seems clear that rockets have been fired from near this area in the past , but there appears to have been nothing on that night .
Slumped
Raed Ibrahim tells me that all the dead came from the same branch of the same family .
" I am angry .
I hate the US , I hate George W Bush , I hate of course Israel .
I also hate the Arab states which do nothing to help and the international community , " said Raed .
But it was not anger in his eyes , it was more like an immense sadness that showed through .
That mood was shared by most of the people we saw , many of them slumped tearfully against walls in the street .
Normally when something like this happens members of armed groups turn up and chant slogans with their loudspeakers .
But this time we only saw one militant appear , and he quickly vanished again .
Die frei verfügbare Telekommunikations - Software Asterisk setzt den Herstellern proprietärer Telefonanlagen verstärkt zu .
" Den Verkäufern von Telefonsystemen verschafft Asterisk viele ungewohnte Freiheiten und Raum für Eigenentwicklungen " , erklärte Marc Spencer von Digium am gestrigen Samstag auf dem Free and Open Source Software Developers ' European Meeting ( FOSDEM ) in Brüssel .
Das US - Unternehmen agiert als Projektträger der Programm - Suite .
So könnten Systemintegratoren etwa bei der grafischen Nutzerschnittstelle oder bei der verwendeten Hardware eigene Wege gehen , sagte Spencer .
Gleichzeitig beschleunige Asterisk die Geschwindigkeit im Markt und erlaube es kleinen Firmen , einfacher dort Fuß zu fassen .
Asterisk ist eine Telefonanlagen - Software und eine Plattform für die Anpassung gängiger Telefon - Applikationen an spezielle Bedürfnisse .
Sie bringt zum einen gängige digitale Anruf - Funktionen wie das Management zahlreicher Nebenstellen , Weiterschaltung , Warteschleife oder Nummernerkennung mit sich .
Dabei beherrscht sie zum einen gängige " klassische " Protokolle wie T1 oder Loopstar , zum anderen neue wie die zunehmende Zahl an VoIP - Protokollen ( Voice over IP ) .
Spencer bezeichnete Asterisk , das unter der GNU GPL sowie über eine kommerzielle Lizenz ähnlich der von MySQL erhältlich ist , als " Apache für die Telefonie " .
Insgesamt gehe es dabei aber nicht nur um den Aufeinanderprall von Open - Source und proprietärer Software .
Vielmehr stehe Asterisk auch im Zentrum des allgemeinen Umbruchs des Telefonmarktes weg von analogen hin zu digitalen Lösungen , vom leitungsgebundenen Schalten zur Internet - Telefonie , von einem zentralisierten Ansatz zu Peer - 2 - Peer sowie von der reinen Datenübertragung zum Transfer konvergierender Medienströme .
Die Architektur von Asterisk macht es kommerziellen Anwendern der Software laut Spencer einfach , etwa mit dem Aufbau von VoIP - Gateways , dem eigenen IAX - Protokoll , über Webserver mit Funktionen für Anrufbeantworter , Konferenzschaltungen oder Kontaktcentern mit proprietären Systemen zu konkurrieren .
Die Asterisk - Platformen seien zudem mit eigenen Zusätzen schier beliebig zu erweitern .
Einer der Entwickler der freien Telefonsoftware habe sich etwa eine Routine eingerichtet , die jeden Anruf der Ex-Freundin automatisch an den Anrufbeantworter schickt .
Den oft vorgebrachten Vorwurf , dass freie Software allein Features bereits bestehender proprietärer Programme nachahme , wollte der Digium - Präsident nicht gelten lassen .
So kann das Asterisk - Protokoll seinen Angaben nach Daten effizienter transportieren als herkömmliche Systeme .
Pro Megabyte seien etwa dreimal so viele Anrufe übertragbar , schätzt Spencer .
Zudem warte die Software mit dem " ersten echten " Service zum automatischen Erkennen von Umgebungen via Bluetooth auf , könne also zum Beispiel die Serviceleistungen ohne Eingriff des Nutzers von der Heim - auf die Büroumgebung umschalten .
Generell rechnet Spencer mit einem weiteren raschen Wachstum bei der Verbreitung von Asterisk .
" Wir müssen ja auch im Telekom - Markt kein Monopol bekämpfen wie im Fall von Linux auf dem Desktop " , begründete er seinen rosigen Blick in die Zukunft .
Ernsthafte Hindernisse durch Patentstreitigkeiten erwartet er nicht : Einzelne Klageversuche gegen Asterisk - Nutzer durch die E - Fax - Firma j2 Global Communications bezeichnete er als lächerlich .
Es gebe ausreichend Nachweise dafür , dass die entsprechenden Verfahren der Weiterleitung eines Fax an einen E - Mail - Server schon deutlich älter seien als die beanspruchte " Erfindung " von j2 .
Gegen Digium selbst habe es zudem noch keine Klagen oder Drohbriefe gegeben .

They must have been reading very utilitarian fiction - their 1961 creation was a 4,000 - pound arm that stacked sheets of hot metal .
But it transformed the assembly line ; a variant is still in use today .

While technically a cyborg , the heartless lumberjack of Oz did wrestle with a common existential dilemma faced by robots : the desire to feel .
( Well , that and the desire to combat rust . )
Not bad for 1939 .

Back in 1739 , Jacques de Vaucanson wanted to create artificial life .
He settled for a mechanical duck that pooped .
The machine used a weight system to quack , flap its wings , drink water , and eat grain , which it would digest mechanically and expel through an opening in its backside .

Audio Search provides access to a variety of audio files including podcasts , music downloads , albums and spoken word such as newscasts , speeches , and interviews , as well as other audio related information including music videos , album reviews , artist images and artists websites … .
… Yahoo !
Audio Search ’s integration with My Web , Yahoo ! ’s new social search engine , enables users to save audio searches , creating a personal , searchable Web of favorite audio Web pages .
Moreover , My Web users can share their musical tastes with their communities by creating RSS feeds of their saved Web pages .
Gary has a complete review here .
From that :
… what Yahoo is releasing today is a different .
It ’s a one - stop service ( metasearch , sort of ) that allows the user to search , find , and access both “ open web ” audio files ( via a Yahoo crawl ) along with audio files from numerous music / audio ( fee- based ) services including Yahoo ’s own Music Unlimited , iTunes , Napster , Rhapsody , Emusic , GarageBand.com , and other services .
Of course , to download these files you ’ll need to pay .
That ’s right folks , you ’ll need to pay .
Get used to this , I ’d wager it ’s coming from Google as well – search as the interface to finding and then paying for stuff .
It ’s about time , in my humble opinion .
Imagine when Google oneboxes ( ie adds results automatically like they do with Local ) Google Print , for example , or audio , or video …. when nearly every search suggests something that can be purchased .
Why , it ’s a veritable ecommerce nightmare for Amazon and eBay .
No wonder they are so into search …
As we remember the tragedy of the London bombings , voices in Europe and America issue ominous warnings of an Islamic threat : the rise of Eurabia , Londonistan and an Islamic caliphate .
Recently , a prominent political commentator warned : " Even as Christianity seems to be dying in Europe , Islam is rising to shake the 21st century as it did so many previous centuries . "
The Bin Ladens and Zarqawis of the world shape perceptions of Muslims .
How do we prevent the militant rhetoric and actions of a minority from defining Islam and relations between Muslims and the west ?
Our common peace and security depend more on mutual understanding than demonisation .
We , Muslims and non-Muslims , have all been victims of global terrorism , in New York , Madrid , London , Bali and Amman .
And yet , five years after 9/11 , the war on terrorism is seen by many Muslims as a war on Islam .
As Islamophobia and xenophobia grow , the critical distinction between religious extremism and mainstream Islam is increasingly blurred .
How do we break out of this cycle of ignorance ?
The Gallup World Poll provides us with information about Muslim beliefs , perceptions , fears and hopes .
For the first time , we can get beyond conflicting expert analysis , media coverage or selected voices from the Arab street .
Listening to a billion Muslims sometimes corroborates but often challenges entrenched beliefs about our differences .
Is there a blind hatred to the west ?
The poll indicates the opposite .
Muslims in the 10 countries polled ( Morocco , Egypt , Lebanon , Jordan , Turkey , Saudi Arabia , Iran , Pakistan , Bangladesh and Indonesia ) said what they most admired , after technology , was the west 's political freedom .
Overwhelming majorities in every country would support freedom of speech , religion and assembly if drafting a constitution .
Majorities in virtually every country also felt women should have the same legal rights as men .
Those familiar with the EU were more likely to say the group of nations played a positive rather than negative role in promoting peace .
However , not surprisingly they gave the US and UK , in contrast to France and Germany , unfavourable ratings , linking the US to such attributes as " ruthless and arrogant . "
Muslims were also critical of their own countries , citing " extremism , radicalism , terrorism and fanaticism , lack of political freedom and political corruption " .
Only 8 % believed the 9/11 attacks were justified , while 35 % were positive about America and felt 9/11 was not justified ; 51 % were " sceptical moderates " , critical of the US but not believing that 9/11 was justified .
What would improve relations with the west ?
Their most frequent replies were " demonstrate more understanding and respect for Islam " ; help with " economic development / jobs " ; and " stop interfering in our affairs " .
Most wanted better relations with the west , but did not believe the US was serious about promoting real self - determination .
The conclusion ?
Anti-western feelings result from what we do , our policies and actions , not from our way of life .
Globalisation and an increasingly multicultural west test the mettle of our values .
Islamophobia is a threat to our democratic way of life .
This cancer should be as unacceptable as anti-semitism .
Pluralism and tolerance demand greater understanding and respect from non-Muslims and Muslims alike .
The more we learn about each other , the more we will see beyond our differences to a reservoir of common concerns , values and interests .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Friday January 19 2007
Stephen Hawking was mistakenly described as a Nobel laureate in the article below .
He is not .
The scientist Stephen Hawking today warned that the world is on the brink of a second nuclear age and a period of unprecedented climate change .
The University of Cambridge mathematician 's comments came as the time on the doomsday clock , which counts down to nuclear Armageddon , was moved two minutes closer to midnight , reflecting concerns among scientists over the rise of new nuclear powers .
Climate change was also increasing the threat of catastrophic damage to the planet , academics at the Bulletin Of The Atomic Scientists ( BAS ) said .
" Since Hiroshima and Nagasaki , no nuclear weapons have been used in war , though the world has come uncomfortably close to disaster on more than one occasion , " Prof Hawking said .
" But for good luck , we would all be dead .
" As we stand at the brink of a second nuclear age and a period of unprecedented climate change , scientists have a special responsibility once again to inform the public and advise leaders about the perils that humanity faces .
" We foresee great perils if governments and society do not take action now to render nuclear weapons obsolete and prevent further climate change . "
Since 1947 , the clock - with midnight representing nuclear apocalypse - has appeared on the cover of the BAS with its minute hand moved to reflect the perceived nuclear threat .
The hand 's position has been altered 18 times including today 's change , which takes the time shown to five to midnight .
Scientists at the magazine , which was founded by University of Chicago physicists alarmed about the dangers of the nuclear age , said people were living in the " most perilous period " since Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
They said the " major step " of moving the hand reflected growing concerns marked by grave threats including the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea and unsecured nuclear materials in Russia and elsewhere .
The move towards increased used of nuclear power to replace fossil fuels , and reduce carbon emissions would increase the risk of nuclear proliferation , they added .
The decision to move the clock forward was reached after discussions with the bulletin's board of sponsors , which includes 18 Nobel laureates .
" North Korea 's recent test of a nuclear weapon , Iran 's nuclear ambitions , a renewed emphasis on the military utility of nuclear weapons , the failure to adequately secure nuclear materials and the continued presence of some 26,000 nuclear weapons in the United States and Russia are symptomatic of a failure to solve the problems posed by the most destructive technology on Earth , " a statement from the board said .
The statement added that the dangers posed by climate change were almost as dire as those posed by nuclear weapons .
" The effects may be less dramatic in the short term than the destruction that could be wrought by nuclear explosions , but over the next three to four decades , climate change could cause irremediable harm to the habitats upon which human societies depend for survival , " it added .
Sir Martin Rees , the president of the Royal Society and a professor of cosmology and astrophysics , added : " Nuclear weapons still pose the most catastrophic and immediate threat to humanity , but climate change and emerging technologies in the life sciences also have the potential to end civilisation as we know it . "
The closest the clock has come to midnight was at two minutes away in 1953 , when the US and Soviet Union tested thermonuclear devices within nine months of each other .
In 1991 , in a wave of optimism at the end of the cold war , it was set at its furthest away - 17 minutes to midnight .
It was last moved in February 2002 , when , following the terror attacks of events of September 11 2001 and growing concerns over global terrorism , it was pushed forward by two minutes , moving to seven minutes to midnight .
BAS said steps could be taken to reduce the current danger level .
These included reducing the launch readiness of US and Russian nuclear forces , dismantling , storing , and destroying more than 20,000 warheads over the next 10 years and stopping the production of nuclear weapons material .
Investments in biofuel and other alternative energies could also reduce the need for new nuclear plants .

One thing you are almost guaranteed to see on trains these days is at least one person ( quite often more ) with pencil poised , glassy - eyed , intensely focused on a Sudoku puzzle .
These fascinating numbers puzzles have become exceedingly popular in the UK ( and goodness knows where else ) .
I have never been a keen puzzles enthusiast , so I was initially reluctant to check out this new craze .
But seeing how people seemed to be enjoying it I finally gave it a go .
I found that it was quite easy to understand the rules , get started , and get stuck in !
And soon , before I knew what hit me , I was hooked .
You can think of a Sudoku as a square divided into 9 equal squares ( blocks ) and the 9 squares each further divided into 9 much smaller squares ( cells ) .
That makes 9 blocks and 81 cells ( see Figure 1 ) .
Figure 1 : An example of a Sudoku puzzle
The blocks make a 3 x 3 grid ( i.e. 3 rows and 3 columns ) .
The cells make a 9 x 9 grid ( i.e. 9 rows and 9 columns ) .
A Sudoku puzzle comes with numbers already present in some of the cells .
The objective of the puzzle is to fill in the remaining cells with the right numbers .
The cells must be filled according to the following simple rules :
All the 9 cells in each row must have the numbers 1 to 9 with no repetition .
All the 9 cells in each column must have the numbers 1 to 9 with no repetition .
All the 9 cells within each block must have the numbers 1 to 9 with no repetition .
( ‘ No repetition ’ is purely for emphasis , because if you use all of 1 to 9 , and you have only 9 places to fill , there can be no repetition anyway . )
Sudoku comes in varying levels of difficulty and degrees of challenge , depending on which , and how many , cells have been filled in already .
Whatever the case , you do not need any kind of serious mathematics or clever mental gymnastics ; all you need is your own personal logical reasoning and a determination not to be beaten .
That is why they can be so much fun .
To make it even more fun for myself , I embarked on an exercise to write a program that solves Sudoku puzzles .
And to make it even more challenging I decided not to write the program in the popular object - oriented fashion ( Java , C++ , C# , etc. ) or in any of the old - fashioned procedural programming languages ( Pascal , C , Basic etc ) ; but in Transact SQL , within SQL Server 2000 .
Basically , I wanted to see how the features of T - SQL can be used to develop something like a Sudoku puzzle solution .
I have learnt some useful things from the exercise , which I ’m eager to pass on to my fellow programmers .
T- SQL is rich in in - built programming functions and features .
Far from being just for holding and manipulating data , T - SQL is a programming language in its own right .
Many algorithm - based problems that used to be solved with mainstream procedural or object - oriented languages can now be dealt with completely within SQL Server using T - SQL , because not only does it have the usual programming constructs such as ‘ While … End ’ ; ‘ Case ’ and ‘ Ifs ’ ; it also , of course , has SQL .
This exercise gave me a chance to use the following programming features of T - SQL :
Stored Procedures Tables String manipulation functions ‘ While … End ’ Case statements Temporary tables SQL GROUP BY statements Sub queries
How the program works
… and probably more .
There is no fancy user user - interface .
The final program is just one single Stored Procedure called pSolveSudoku .
To use it you will need the SQL Analyzer which is the place in SQL Server where SQL queries and stored procedures are run .
The example below shows how the stored procedure is used :
The puzzle in Figure 1 is expressed as :
EXEC pSolveSudoku ‘ 040000000 001034620 603000070 000483507 000050060 000009040 005000001 800547396 000021000 ‘
EXEC pSolveSudoku ‘0400000000010346206030000700004835070 00050060000009040005000001800547396000 021000 ’
As you can see , the stored procedure takes a single parameter which is a string , in which there is a number for each cell .
The numbers 1 to 9 are used where the values are already known and 0 is used otherwise .
It is a good thing that the SQL Query Analyzer interface allows multiple lines to be used in strings otherwise we would have had to write the entire string on a single line , like this :… which is still okay , but not quite as user - friendly .
When you run the stored procedure you get a table showing all the numbers in their right places ( see Figure 2 ) – a solved Sudoku .
Figure 2 : Solution
This information actually comes from a table called tSudoku9x9 which is generated by pSolveSudoku .
If you run the following SQL you will get the result of the last puzzle done by the stored procedure .
SELECT * FROM tSudoku9x9
The structure of the table is shown in the table below .
Table 1 : The table structure for tSudoku9x9 Column Data type Description R Integer Row number C1 Integer Column 1 C2 Integer Column 2 C3 Integer Column 3 C4 Integer Column 4 C5 Integer Column 5 C6 Integer Column 6 C7 Integer Column 7 C8 Integer Column 8 C9 Integer Column 9
Method
So how does the stored procedure solve the Sudoku ?
First let me introduce you to tSudokuData , the most important object in this project .
tSudokuData is a table that is populated with all the necessary data which can be queried and updated by stored procedures that automate the task of solving the Sudoku .
tSudokuData contains 81 records , each relating to a cell in the Sudoku .
Each record comprises of Location ( i.e. row and column number ) ; block information in relation to the cell ; ‘ Elimination String ’ and Current number in the cell .
The ‘ Elimination String ’ is a special 9 - charcter field normally containing ‘ 123456789 ’ .
In the process of solving the puzzle each character is replaced with X when a number has been eliminated from those that can be in the cell .
This means that for a cell for which the number is already known the elimination string is ‘ XXXXXXXXX ’ .
The structure of tSudokuData is shown in the table below .
Table 2 : The table structure for tSudokuData Column Data type Description iRow integer Row number of the cell ( 1 to 9 ) iCol integer column number of the cell ( 1 to 9 ) iVal integer the number in the cell 0 for unsolved 1 to 9 for solved s Elim char ( 9 ) 9 - character string ‘ 123456789 ’ , assigned to each cell , in which each character is replaced with X when it has been eliminated from possible numbers that may be used to fill the square iBlock integer Block number ( Each block is assigned a number from 1 to 9 ) iBRow integer Block row ( i.e. the row number of the block in the 3X3 grid ) iBCol integer Block column ( i.e. the column number of the block in the 3X3 grid ) iPos integer Within each block the cells are numbered 1 to 9 .
iPos is the position of the cell within its block .
To populate the table tSudokuData we use the pLoadSudoku Stored Procedure .
This does minimal validation on the input string ; sets up all the necessary information for each cell , including the elimination string ; and assigns values to the cells .
CREATE PROC pLoadSudokuData @sInputData VARCHAR ( 180 ) AS BEGIN delete tSudokuData -- Remove non-numeric characters from -- the string -- Check that there are 81 characters declare @i INT select @i =999 while @i > 0 begin SELECT @i = patindex ( ‘ % [ ^0 - 9 ] % ’, @sInputData ) SELECT @sInputData = replace( @sInputData , substring ( @sInputData , @i, 1 ) , ’’) end IF len( @sInputData ) <> 81 BEGIN PRINT ‘ Invalid input ’ RETURN END DECLARE @iRow INT , @iCol INT , @iVal INT , @iBlock INT , @iBRow INT , @iBCol INT , @sElim VARCHAR ( 9 ) , @iPos INT DECLARE @r INT , @c INT SELECT @r = 1 WHILE @r <= 9 BEGIN SELECT @c = 1 WHILE @c <= 9 BEGIN SELECT @iRow =@r , @iCol =@c , @iVal = substring ( @sInputData , @c + ( @r - 1 ) * 9,1 ) , @sElim =’123456789 ’ , @iBlock =CASE WHEN @r IN ( 1,2,3 ) AND @c IN ( 1,2,3 ) THEN 1 WHEN @r IN ( 1,2,3 ) AND @c IN ( 4,5,6 ) THEN 2 WHEN @r IN ( 1,2,3 ) AND @c IN ( 7,8,9 ) THEN 3 WHEN @r IN ( 4,5,6 ) AND @c IN ( 1,2,3 ) THEN 4 WHEN @r IN ( 4,5,6 ) AND @c IN ( 4,5,6 ) THEN 5 WHEN @r IN ( 4,5,6 ) AND @c IN ( 7,8,9 ) THEN 6 WHEN @r IN ( 7,8,9 ) AND @c IN ( 1,2,3 ) THEN 7 WHEN @r IN ( 7,8,9 ) AND @c IN ( 4,5,6 ) THEN 8 WHEN @r IN ( 7,8,9 ) AND @c IN ( 7,8,9 ) THEN 9 END , @iPos = CASE WHEN @r IN ( 1,4,7 ) AND @c IN ( 1,4,7 ) THEN 1 WHEN @r IN ( 1,4,7 ) AND @c IN ( 2,5,8 ) THEN 2 WHEN @r IN ( 1,4,7 ) AND @c IN ( 3,6,9 ) THEN 3 WHEN @r IN ( 2,5,8 ) AND @c IN ( 1,4,7 ) THEN 4 WHEN @r IN ( 2,5,8 ) AND @c IN ( 2,5,8 ) THEN 5 WHEN @r IN ( 2,5,8 ) AND @c IN ( 3,6,9 ) THEN 6 WHEN @r IN ( 3,6,9 ) AND @c IN ( 1,4,7 ) THEN 7 WHEN @r IN ( 3,6,9 ) AND @c IN ( 2,5,8 ) THEN 8 WHEN @r IN ( 3,6,9 ) AND @c IN ( 3,6,9 ) THEN 9 END SELECT @iBRow =CASE WHEN @iBlock = 1 THEN 1 WHEN @iBlock = 2 THEN 1 WHEN @iBlock = 3 THEN 1 WHEN @iBlock = 4 THEN 2 WHEN @iBlock = 5 THEN 2 WHEN @iBlock = 6 THEN 2 WHEN @iBlock = 7 THEN 3 WHEN @iBlock = 8 THEN 3 WHEN @iBlock = 9 THEN 3 END , @iBCol =CASE WHEN @iBlock = 1 THEN 1 WHEN @iBlock = 2 THEN 2 WHEN @iBlock = 3 THEN 3 WHEN @iBlock = 4 THEN 1 WHEN @iBlock = 5 THEN 2 WHEN @iBlock = 6 THEN 3 WHEN @iBlock = 7 THEN 1 WHEN @iBlock = 8 THEN 2 WHEN @iBlock = 9 THEN 3 END INSERT tSudokuData ( iRow , iCol , iBlock , iBRow , iBCol , iVal , sElim , iPos ) VALUES ( @iRow , @iCol , @iBlock , @iBRow , @iBCol , @iVal, @sElim , @iPos ) SELECT @c = @c + 1 END SELECT @r = @r + 1 END UPDATE tSudokuData SET sElim =’xxxxxxxxx ’ WHERE iVal != 0 END GO
Processing Rules
Rules of elimination i.e. finding which number cannot be placed in a cell .
Rules of determination i.e. finding which number can be placed in a cell .
Elimination
Once the table tSudokuData has been created and all the initial information has been inserted into it with pLoadSudokuData , the stage is set for using SQL to solve the Sudoku .
Most Sudoku fans use a set of rules to place the correct numbers in the cells , in a step - by - step fashion .
I can see two kinds of rules : Generally I have found that when solving a Sudoku , elimination and determination go hand in hand .
A process of elimination often facilitates a process of determination , and vice versa .
The ultimate aim is to determine the right number for each cell , but some elimination will have to be done in order to arrive at the right answer .
For each cell , look for any number that already exists in the row , column or block that the cell is contained in .
If you find such a number , update the elimination string for that cell .
What you do here is to set a number in the elimination string to ‘ X ’ once you can tell that the number cannot be placed in the cell because it has already been used in the block , the row or the column that the cell is part of .
The Stored procedure for this process is pBasicElimination , and it is shown below :
CREATE PROC pBasicElimination AS DECLARE @myRow INT , @myCol INT , @myBlock INT , @myPosInBlock INT , @myelimStr varchar ( 9 ) , @iCurrentVal INT SELECT @myRow=1 WHILE @myRow < =9 BEGIN SELECT @myCol=1 WHILE @myCol < =9 BEGIN SELECT @myBlock =iBlock , @myPosInBlock =iPos , @myelimStr =sElim FROM tSudokuData WHERE iRow = @myRow AND iCol = @myCol SELECT @iCurrentVal = 1 WHILE @iCurrentVal <=9 BEGIN SELECT @myelimStr = CASE WHEN -- Along the row EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM tSudokuData WHERE iRow=@myRow AND iVal = @iCurrentVal AND iCol != @myCol ) OR -- Along the column EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM tSudokuData WHERE iCol=@myCol AND iVal = @iCurrentVal AND iRow != @myRow ) OR -- Within the Block EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM tSudokuData WHERE iBlock=@myBlock AND iVal = @iCurrentVal AND iPos != @myPosInBlock ) THEN replace ( @myelimStr , @iCurrentVal , ’X ’ ) ELSE @myelimStr END UPDATE tSudokuData SET sElim = @myelimStr WHERE iRow = @myRow AND iCol = @myCol SELECT @iCurrentVal = @iCurrentVal + 1 END -- @iCurrentVal SELECT @myCol = @myCol + 1 END -- @myCol SELECT @myRow = @myRow + 1 END -- @myRow GO
Three things to note : first we have used a while loop to access each cell in the block using the variables @myRow and @myCol ; then we have tested for existence numbers 1 to 9 in each row , column or block accordingly using the variable @iCurrentVal ; and finally , we have used the replace function to set the numbers that we found in the elimination string to X .
Secondary elimination rule :
This rule can be applied if some elimination has already been carried out and it can be stated as : if there is a row , column or block in which two of the cells have both been eliminated down to the same 2 numbers , then those numbers can be eliminated from other cells in the same row column or block .
Figure 3 : Two cells eliminated
In the example in Figure 3 we are looking at a block in which 2 cells have been eliminated down to 1 and 3 .
A third cell has been eliminated down to 1 , 3 , 7 and 8 ; and a fourth down to 1 , 2 , 6 and 9 .
According to this rule we can eliminate the 1 and 3 in the third and fourth cell .
The stored procedure that deals with this process is pSecondaryElimination which comprises of pSecondaryElimByRow , pSecondaryElimByColumn and pSecondaryElimByBlock .
As you can imagine , the three component stored procedures are quite similar , so I will only explain pSecondaryElimRow here .
CREATE Proc pSecondaryElimByRow AS BEGIN -- 1 . Get a list of all cells in -- columns where there are n1,n2 select * , remainingNums = replace ( sElim , ’X ’ , ’’ ) , matched N1N2 = convert ( varchar ( 9 ) , null ) into #tmp from tSudokuData t0 where exists ( select iRow , replace ( sElim , ’X ’ , ’’ ) , count ( * ) from tSudokuData t1 where len( replace ( sElim , ’X’ , ’’ ) ) =2 and t0.iRow=t1.iRow group by iRow , replace ( sElim , ’X’ , ’’) having count ( * ) = 2 ) order by iRow -- 2 .
Get the only the cells that have the matched n1,n2 select iRow , remainingnums , icount=count ( * ) into #tmpMatches from #tmp where len( replace ( sElim , ’X ’ , ’’ ) ) = 2 group by iRow , remainingnums having count (* ) = 2 -- 3 . Assign the matched n1,n2 to all -- the columns concerned update #tmp set matched N1N2=t2.remainingnums from #tmp t1 , #tmpMatches t2 where t1.iRow = t2.iRow -- 4 . update tSudokuData elimination strings update tSudokuData set sElim= replace ( replace ( tm.sElim , substring ( tm.matchedN1N2,1,1 ) , ’X’ ) , substring ( tm.matchedN1N2,2,1 ) , ’X ’ ) from #tmp tm , tSudokuData ts where tm.iRow=ts.iRow and tm.iCol=ts.iCol and tm.matchedN1N2 != tm.remainingnums END GO
Determination
Here we have used temporary tables to hold data as we have gone through the steps required to implement the rule .
‘ Exists ’ , Sub queries and ‘ Group By ’ have featured in the complex SQL statements .
But the code is concise and it is broken down into identifiable stages .
determine for each cell whether there is a number that is the only one that has not been used in the row , column or block to which the cell belongs .
If you find such a number then fill the cell with it .
For example , you are looking at a row and you find that it already contains 1 , 2 , 3 , 5,6,7,8 and 9 .
One cell has not yet been filled .
Easy – the missing number is 4 , so fill that in .
Since we will be running the Basic elimination Stored procedure first , the elimination string for this cell will be a series of Xs with only one number .
i.e. xxx4xxxxx
To fill in all the cells throughout the whole solution , where all the possible candidate numbers have been eliminated down to ‘ 4 ’ we use the following SQL :
UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=4 , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ WHERE sElim =’ XXX4XXXXX ’
CREATE PROC pBasicDetermination AS BEGIN UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=1 , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ WHERE sElim = ’1XXXXXXXX ’ UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=2 , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ WHERE sElim =’X2XXXXXXX ’ UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=3 , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ WHERE sElim =’XX3XXXXXX ’ UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=4 , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ WHERE sElim =’XXX4XXXXX ’ UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=5 , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ WHERE sElim =’XXXX5XXXX ’ UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=6 , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ WHERE sElim =’XXXXX6XXX ’ UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=7 , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ WHERE sElim =’XXXXXX7XX ’ UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=8 , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ WHERE sElim =’XXXXXXX8X ’ UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=9 , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ WHERE sElim =’XXXXXXXX9 ’ END GO
The stored procedure pBasicDetermination , which deals with this rule , is the simplest of all the stored procedures :
For most puzzles marked as ‘ easy ’ in Sudoku puzzle books , the rules discussed so far are normally sufficient to solve them completely , but for harder Sudoku we need more rules .
Secondary determination rule :
This method is familiar to seasoned Sudoku fans :
Take the 3 blocks along the same row .
Look for a number n that is contained in 2 of the blocks but not the third .
In the block that does not contain the number n ; look at the row of cells other than the rows that contain n in the other 2 blocks .
If there is only one un - filled cell in that row then it should be filled with the number n .
If there is more than one un - filled cell then look at the column that contains each of the cells , to see whether n as been used .
That way you can work out into which of the un - filled cells to place the number n .
Figure 4 : Applying the secondary determination rule
In Figure 4 , two blocks have the number 8 in rows 1 and 2 respectively , therefore according to the Secondary determination rule , the middle block , which is the one that does not contain 2 , should have 8 in the un - filled cell in row 3 .
Figure 5 : Multiple unfilled cells
Figure 5 shows an example of where more than one unfilled cells have been found .
You can see how we have ruled two of them out because ‘ 3 ’ has been used in their columns .
This method can also be applied to blocks along the same column , using the same reasoning .
The Stored Procedure used for this rule is pSecondaryDetermination and it comprises of pSecondaryDetRowOfBlocks ( for blocks in a row ) and pSecondaryDetColumnOfBlocks ( for column of blocks ) .
Again I will show just one , pSecondaryDetRowOfBlocks :
CREATE PROC pSecondaryDetRowOfBlocks @number INT , @blockNumber INT AS --
Ensure that n is not currently in -- the block IF ( SELECT count (* ) FROM tSudokuData where iBlock=@blockNumber AND iVal=@number ) >0 BeGIN RETURN END -- Determine the Column number of the -- block DECLARE @blockRow INT SELECT @blockRow = iBRow FROM tSudokuData WHERE iBlock = @blockNumber --
Get the cell in the other 2 blocks -- with value n IF ( SELECT COUNT (*) FROM tSudokuData WHERE iBlock != @blockNumber AND iBRow = @blockRow AND iVal=@number ) < 2 BEGIN -- n is contained in Only one block RETURN END --
Get the row in the block that is -- not the same as that of cell in the -- other 2 blocks with value n --
And which does not already have a -- value SELECT * INTO #tmp FROM tSudokuData gm1 WHERE NOT iRow IN ( SELECT iRow FROM tSudokuData WHERE iBlock != @blockNumber AND iBRow = @blockRow AND iVal=@number ) AND iBlock= @blockNumber AND iVal=0 --
Get the columns that n is not -- already contained in the row that -- this cell is in --
How many of the columns already -- have n?
DECLARE @CC INT , @cntr INT select @ CC=iCol , @cntr=count ( case when iVal=@number then 1 else null end ) from tSudokuData where iCol in ( select iCol from # tmp ) group by iCol HAVING count ( case when iVal=@number then 1 else null end ) = 0 -- Update tSudokuData IF @@rowcount = 1 BEGIN UPDATE tSudokuData SET iVal=@number , sElim= ’XXXXXXXXX ’ FROM #tmp t , tSudokuData g WHERE t.iRow=g.iRow AND t.iCol=g.iCol
AND t.iCol=@CC END GO
CREATE PROC pSecondaryDetermination /*
Do a block scan for all the numbers ( 1 - 9 ) in all the blocks ( 1 - 9 ) */ AS BEGIN DECLARE @blockNumber INT , @number INT SELECT @blockNumber = 1 WHILE @blockNumber <= 9 BEGIN SELECT @number = 1 WHILE @number <= 9 BEGIN EXEC pSecondaryDetColumnOfBlocks @blockNumber , @number EXEC pSecondaryDetRowOfBlocks @blockNumber , @number SELECT @number = @number + 1 END SELECT @blockNumber = @blockNumber + 1 END END GO
Putting it all together
Set up the tSudokuTable and load in the input string
Find out how many solved cells are in the Sudoku Apply the stored procedures for solving the Sudoku Check the number of solved cells , if still the same , then stop , otherwise go to 3 .
Indicate whether the Sudoku was completed or not .
Display the solution
CREATE PROC pSolveSudoku @sData VARCHAR ( 1000 ) AS BEGIN -- 1 .
Set up the tSudokuTable and load in the data -- 2 . Find out how many solved sudokus -- 3 . Apply the stored procedures for solving the Sudoku -- 4 .
Check the number of solved cells , if still the same -- then stop Exec pLoadSudokuData @sData DECLARE @no_of_solved INT , @finished CHAR(1 ) SELECT @no_of_solved = count (*)
FROM tSudokuData WHERE iVal != 0 WHILE 1 =1 -- loop for evermore !
BEGIN exec pBasicElimination exec pBasicDetermination --
Apply the elimination string to the puzzle exec pSecondaryDetermination exec pSecondaryElimination exec pBasicDetermination --
Apply the elimination string to the puzzle IF @no_of_solved =( SELECT count (* ) FROM tSudokuData WHERE iVal !=
0 ) BEGIN --
No more solutions IF @no_of_solved = 81 BEGIN PRINT ‘ All Cells have been solved ’
END ELSE BEGIN PRINT ‘ Not all Cells have been solved ’
END EXEC pShowSudoku RETURN END SELECT @no_of_solved = count (*)
FROM tSudokuData WHERE iVal != 0 END -- while SELECT @no_of_solved END GO
Conclusion
As you can see this is the most complex of all the stored procedures , but it is broken down into stages and comments are provided to explain what we are trying to achieve .
Also , notice that the stored procedure requires parameters @number ( the number we are testing for ) and @blockNumber ( the block number of the block that we are processing ) .
This means that this stored procedure will be used in a kind of loop where different values will be passed to it .
The passing of values happens in pSecondaryDetermination which is given below :
The top level stored procedure pSolvesudoku uses the other stored procedures in an iterative manner .
These are the steps :
This has been a fun project .
It proves that T - SQL is more versatile than you might imagine , and it only gets better with SQL Server 2005 .
This exercise is by no means complete .
It can be taken further , by adding more rules so that it can solve harder Sudoku .
With some adjustment it can also be converted into a Sudoku Puzzle Generator .
It can even be further enhanced and converted to a web service using the new features in SQL Server 2005 , but that is another story .
Riot police have been out in force in the Hungarian capital
A crowd of between 20,000 and 50,000 people filled the square outside the Hungarian parliament building before the rally broke up around midnight .
The PM admitted in a leaked private speech that his government had lied in order to win re-election this year .
The protesters have adopted white as their symbolic colour .
Rally organisers appealed to participants to add a white ribbon or wear a white item of clothing to symbolise , in their words , the need for truth and non-violence in the face of the PM 's lies .
Mr Gyurcsany 's socialist party has hit back , accusing the opposition conservative party , Fidesz , of responsibility for the protests and for the violence earlier in the week .
The socialists say their government has the support of the international financial community in its efforts to push through tax increases and cut benefits .
But , after a sixth night of demonstrations , the protests appear to be gathering steam again ahead of next weekend 's local elections , the BBC's Nick Thorpe reports .
Nationalist flags
Demonstrations have also spread to several provincial towns .
The rally appears to have ended without serious incident
The mayor of the city has warned about the danger of violence , and large numbers of riot police have been on standby .
Rally organisers distributed flowers in what they said was a symbol of their peaceful intentions .
" Our protest will not cease until the cabinet resigns , " said Tamas Molnar , one of the rally organisers .
" We want to bring down the current post - communist government . "
Many of the demonstrators carried the pre-1945 Hungarian flag , a strong nationalist symbol .
On the first day of the protests , demonstrators stormed the state television building , set alight cars and vandalised the city 's main Soviet war monument .

English is Just a Programming Language
Write documents as you would write code : honor the DRY principle , use metadata , MVC , automatic generation , and so on .
Build Documentation
In , Do n't Bolt It On
Documentation created separately from code is less likely to be correct and up to date .

It animated the controversial ports deal , for example , and it underscores the battle over illegal immigration .
And that 's as it should be .
As I write in my book , Getting America Right , national security is the federal government 's most important obligation .
What could be more critical than that ?
Judging from the government 's spending pattern , we have an answer : corporate welfare .
Last year , Washington spent $ 53 billion on homeland security -- and $ 60 billion on corporate welfare .
Clearly our priorities are misplaced , and it 's time to change that .
Corporate welfare comes in many flavors .
The biggest such program -- farm subsidies -- is disguised as a measure to help " the little guy . "
The 2002 farm bill ( misleadingly sold to Americans as the " Farm Security Act " ) will cost taxpayers $ 180 billion over 10 years .
But little of that money actually goes to the traditional family farmer .
Two - thirds of farm subsidies go to the top 10 percent of subsidy recipients .
That means tens of millions of dollars for big agribusinesses and millions more for such " gentlemen farmers " as basketball star Scottie Pippen , newscaster Sam Donaldson and television mogul Ted Turner .
At least 12 Fortune 500 companies also have pocketed farm subsidies in recent years , including John Hancock and Caterpillar .
In addition , federal money funds critical programs such as barn restoration and paying farmers not to grow certain crops .
Even when farm subsidies actually do go to family farms , the money is often superfluous .
The typical farm household reports a net worth of more than $ 500,000 and probably does n't need much help from Uncle Sam .
Besides , if Congress really wanted to guarantee every farmer a set income , say $ 35,000 a year , it could do so for " only " $ 4 billion .
Instead , it spends far more than that , with most of that simply wasteful corporate welfare .
Another place Washington could trim the welfare spending is the " Advanced Technology Program . "
Congress created this program in the 1980s to supposedly " bridge the gap between the research lab and the marketplace . "
In a country known for its innovations ( the BlackBerry and the iPod , to name just two recent examples ) , it 's not clear why the government should be involved in this process .
After all , when a company does research , it generally plans to bring the product it develops to market .
That 's the sole reason private companies spend $ 150 billion each year on R & D .
Still , the program lives on , handing out more than $ 150 million per year to companies including IBM , General Electric , General Motors , 3 M and Motorola .
And while that seems like a small amount when compared with the billions Washington squanders elsewhere ( the federal government can't account for $ 24.5 billion it spent last year -- it knows the money was spent , but does n't know where it went or what it bought ) , killing this program would be a start .
Lawmakers could then move on to eliminate cotton subsidies ( $ 264 million in 2004 ) , peanut subsidies ( $ 213 million in 2004 ) , dairy subsidies ( $ 206 million in 2004 ) , sugar beet subsidies ( $ 48 million in 2003 ) , and all the rest .
Then we'd be well on our way to eliminating corporate welfare .
Before they decide to spend any money , lawmakers should ask themselves whether the program they intend to spend it on would make us safer .
Remember : Every dollar wasted on corporate welfare is a dollar unavailable to protect our ports and secure our borders .
It 's bad enough to tolerate such subsidies in peacetime , but in a time of war it 's positively immoral .
Let 's make sure our elected representatives know that as they decide which projects to pay for in the future .
Ed Feulner is president of The Heritage Foundation and co-author of the new book “ Getting America Right . ”
The Observer has established that under new plans to combat terrorism , the US government will demand that visitors have all 10 fingers scanned when they enter the country .
The information will be shared with intelligence agencies , including the FBI , with no restrictions on their international use .
US airport scanners now take only two fingerprints from travellers .
The move to 10 allows the information to be compatible with the FBI database .
' We are going to start testing at several airports , ' a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman confirmed .
' It will begin some time this summer . '
Sources said 10 airports would initially be involved .
The scheme will cover most of the major airports frequently used by British travellers , including New York , Washington and Miami .
Countries subject to the new scheme include Britain , other European Union nations , Japan , Australia and New Zealand .
Last night the British civil rights group Liberty expressed astonishment at the plan , which will affect four million British travellers to the US .
' This must be the Keystone Cops school of border control , ' said Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty .
' Accumulating the fingerprints of millions of innocent passengers will not deter would - be suicide bombers . '
Security experts warned the scale of the scheme might jeopardise its success .
' This maniacal proposal will turn thousands of law - abiding British travellers into terrorist suspects , ' said Simon Davies , head of Privacy International , a campaign against intrusive surveillance .
' The technology at US airports will be far less reliable .
That means anyone could be the victim of a false match , Davies said .
' Be warned .
A San Francisco
Bay family holiday may easily become a nightmare .'
He predicted that airport queues would treble as a result of the scheme .
' Taking fingerprints is a delicate and complex undertaking that can't be rushed to keep queues short , ' he said .
A recent report by the civil liberties group Statewatch highlighted a Japanese study that tested 15 biometric systems and found 11 of them failed to detect ' false ' fingerprints were being used in the form of a latex strip covering a person 's fingers .
Britons already have their credit card details and email accounts inspected by the American authorities following a deal between the EU and the Department of Homeland Security .
Now passengers face having all their credit card transactions traced when using one to book a flight .
And travellers giving an email address to an airline will be open to having all messages they send and receive from that address scrutinised .
The demands were disclosed in ' undertakings ' given by the Department of Homeland Security to the EU and published by the Department for Transport after a request under the freedom of information legislation .
In America , the 10 - digit fingerprint plan has sparked concern among civil rights groups , which accuse the government of using the excuse of terrorism to expand its ability to monitor individuals .
The scheme uses an electronic scanner .
Fingerprint information is then fed into a Department of Homeland Security database that stores material from domestic security organisations such as the FBI , as well as international bodies like Interpol .
It already holds 71 million fingerprints and is growing .
' This is about stopping crime and about national security after 9/11 , ' the Homeland Security spokeswoman said .
' The reason for 10 - digit fingerprints is that it is more secure than the two - digit system , and the 10 - digit system is becoming the international standard . '
The spokeswoman said she was confident the new procedure would not deter people from visiting the US .
' That is what people said when we introduced the two - digit system , ' she said .
' But that is not what happened . '
She added the reason the scheme was to run in just 10 airports initially was to ensure its smooth operation before it became standard at all US airports , major ports of entry and consulates abroad .
The Department of Homeland Security aims to have the new system in place across the US by the end of 2008 .
In a speech at a technology conference Michael Chertoff , the Secretary of Homeland Security , said the main aim was to deter ' the unknown terrorist ' .
It could pick up on fingerprints left at terrorist sites around the world .
' A fingerprint that is left ... in the training camp or in the safe house is , in fact , a powerful tool . '
He added that he hoped the system would deter any terrorists from ever trying to enter the US .
' We will have a world in which any terrorist who has ever been in a safe house or has ever been in a training camp is going to ask himself or herself this question : have I ever left a fingerprint anywhere ? '
Chertoff said .
Google has introduced a calling feature in Google Maps that lets you connect to a business without even dialling a number .
All you have to do is search for a business on Google Maps and click the " Call " link next to the phone number of the business .
Now , enter your phone number and click " Connect for Free " .
So what does Google do now ?
Well !
Its calls your phone number and automatically makes a connection between your number and the destination number .

How to structure large CSS files
Many methods exist to structure your CSS .
This article tries to describe the method I use .
I call it the " Tree method " , since it structures the CSS like … that 's right , a tree structure .
I want to stress that it is n’t my invention ; I just describe and give reasons for its rules .
Everyone that has built a bigger site has had to deal with the mess CSS so easily become .
There are ids and classes all over the place , and to find where a certain class is defined you usually need to use some search feature in your editor .
Matching the other way , from the CSS to the HTML is even harder ; you do n't even know what file a certain class is defined in .
It ’s a mess .
The Tree method tries to structure the CSS into logical blocks ; blocks taken from the HTML .
It also aims to be easy to understand for anyone .
No secret codes or difficult ordering schemes .
Order your selectors like the HTML
One of the problems of mapping between the HTML and the CSS is that they usually differ in structure .
The HTML is ( if you ’re lucky ) structured like a convenient semantical tree while the CSS often is ordered by something random like fonts , colors , and positioning .
To make moving between the two worlds easier we want to make them as similar as possible .
Is the HTML divided into header , content , and footer ?
Then make sure that 's the three major parts of your CSS as well .
Have you put the navigation above your header in the HTML ?
Then order it like that in the CSS as well !
Any other structure makes moving from the HTML to the CSS much harder .
You might be able to find all font manipulations in one part of the CSS , but only if you know that this particular developer uses that exact scheme .
No , let ’s keep it simple .
Here 's a simple example where we just order the selectors :
# header { ... } h1 { ... } h2 { ... } # content { ... } p { ... } em { ... } strong { ... }
When grouping several styles into one definition I just put the group above both of their specific styles .
#header , # content comes before both #header and #content .
Always use the " full path " to elements
The above is very easy to get an overview of , but the experienced developer knows that very few sites are that easy .
Something you often want is a way to define different styles to different parts of a page .
Let ’s say you want green links in the navigation , but want to keep them blue everywhere else .
For this we use sub selectors .
The selector #navigation a lets you give all links inside your navigation another look .
But let ’s take that further .
Why not always write the full path to your elements ?
Why not use #navigation ul li a instead ?
Doing this gives a developer looking at your code a lot of information about how the HTML and CSS belongs together .
Lets add that to the previous example :
# header { ... } # header h1 { ... } # header h2 { ... } # content { ... } # content p { ... } # content p em { ... } # content p strong { ... }
This does change the meaning from before .
Before we selected all the level two headers ; now we only select headers inside of the header division .
Extending each selector with a " path " has made our CSS rules more specific , and specific means more control for you .
This also makes for fewer new ids and classes ; just specify the path to an element instead of adding a class for it .
Do n't add a new class or id unless you really need to .
We still have the issue of " common styles " ; styles that we want to apply to elements in different parts of the tree .
Since they should be applied to all elements they do n’t fit in the tree structure we 've built .
Instead we make a section in the beginning of the file ( or a separate ) with just " general styles " .
Do n't add rules to this section if you only use them once in the document , you want as much of your code to be in " the tree " as possible .
Indent your code cleverly
To make the code even easier to understand I always add indentation ( for those that do n't know that word : it means spacing in front of blocks of text ) .
Indenting makes the tree structure we 're trying to build even clearer , you can easily find the major sections and dig down from there .
Lets add indention to you our example too :
# header { ... } # header h1 { ... } # header h2 { ... } # content { ... } # content p { ... } # content p em { ... } # content p strong { ... }
Do n't take indentation too far .
If you 're styling tables and using thead in the markup , but do n't change the style of it , you can skip that indentation level .
Double indention just for the sake of it is just a waste of space .
Special case : Templating
We also need to deal with rules that only appear on some of our pages .
Perhaps we want the home page to look somewhat different than the sub pages ?
We solve this by giving an id or class to the body element .
Doing this lets me specify styles for just one specific page , and setting the id or class on body makes me able to change anything in the document based on that .
These page specific styles need a place in the tree too .
Here I tend to break from the above scheme and put them together with the style they change .
So body # page_home #header h1 is one step below #header h1 in the tree .
That makes it easier to see all styles for a certain element , instead of scrolling back and fourth ( like you need to do if you do n't remember your general styles ) .
Keep your templates together with the style they change instead of completely separate .
If you want bigger changes , perhaps a totally different look on some pages , there 's no reason to group things according to the scheme above .
Move them to a separate file instead .
Each declaration on its own line
Indentation combined with full paths makes some lines rather long .
This means that putting all declarations on one line will force you to scroll horizontally , something we already avoid on our sites .
The simplest way to prevent horizontal scrolling is to use one declaration per line , so that 's what the tree method uses .
… in alphabetic order
Grouping of properties is another issue .
I 've seen grouping schemes based on all sorts of things ; from splitting things into " positioning " , colors , and fonts , to people adding their properties completely randomly .
I 've chosen to just order them alphabetically .
It 's one of the few methods that bring some order while still being simple enough .
I 've seen total beginners do this by themselves ; something I believe is a good argument for it .
It 's intuitive .
A simple example to illustrate :
# content { color : Blue ; font : 3.4 em Arial , sans - serif ; margin : 0.5 em ; }
One complaint I 've heard on this method is that it splits up things that belong together .
People tend to keep position : absolute and left : 0 together , just to name one such pairing .
It annoyed me at first too , but declaration blocks rarely contain more than 10 declarations , and the alphabetic order still makes them easy to find .
Also , why handle position different than float and margin ?
That 's it !
By following a few simple rules you can get a CSS - file that 's easier to overview , a file that you proudly can give away to the next developer .
I can praise its existence all day , but you 're the judge of whether it works or not .
Why not give it a try in your next project ?
Update : Maurice van Creij writes in and says that he 's using the same method .
A good way to get started is to generate a CSS file from the HTML .
He has written a javascript that does just that .
Nice !
Try generating a CSS file .
Update : Another part structuring your CSS is making sure you do n't load too much .
I wrote an article previously about combining static and dynamic CSS .
Other creatures with different fundamental physical natures – including plants and the lower animals – lack the capacity to act , since they lack volition : their existence is sustained by instinct and reflex .
The acting man sees that these creatures are fundamentally different from him in body and mind and therefore concludes that they can not act .
However , all humans share the same fundamental physical nature : their bodies exhibit a similar appearance – all particulars of bodily dimensions , color , gender , and miscellaneous small details notwithstanding .
Furthermore , the essential physical structures of every man 's brain and sense organs are the same .
An acting man encountering any other man will realize : " This man fulfills my previously arrived at criterion for acting beings – since he is fundamentally similar to me in his characteristics , and I know that I am an acting being . "
The universality of action among human beings is no mere hypothesis : it is a fact knowable with certainty .
Just because we can only discover the existence of action by looking into our own minds does not mean that action is a product of our imagination , severed from reality .
On the contrary , " our mind is one of acting persons .
Our mental categories have to be understood as ultimately grounded in categories of action .
And as soon as this is recognized , all idealistic suggestions immediately disappear " ( Hoppe , " Praxeology and Economic Science : Sec. I " ) .
The existence of our actions in reality is the very reason why we can introspect to discover the fact that we act .
Implicit in action is the pursuit of ends via real means : even if the ends the actor pursues are in fact non-existent – such as the favor of the great Rain Spirit in watering his crops – his means toward pursuing that end must exist in this reality .
If he does a rain dance to obtain the fictitious spirit's favor , he will be dancing with a real , physical body upon real ground , asking the Spirit to pour water on real crops .
If a man acts , he must necessarily be linked to reality and able to pursue real means – otherwise , he would not be able to act .
Man understands the real nature of his actions through the use of his mind – through introspection .
In fact , introspection is itself an action , as are all the fundamental processes of man 's mind : as " categories of action , they must be mental things as much as they are characteristics of reality .
For it is through actions that the mind and reality make contact " ( Hoppe , " Praxeology and Economic Science : Sec. I " ) .
Action can be manifested in external reality , but it requires the mind to grasp .
It can not be solely a mental category detached from the outside world – since it is the prerequisite for and determinant of all human mental categories .
Nor can action be a solely empirical category distinct from the operations of the individual actor 's mind , since the mind – aside from being necessary for introspection – assigns to acting man his choice of ends and means .
Action can be grasped by neither reason nor observation alone ; in bridging the two , however , it affirms the validity of both .
Since man 's mind belongs to a being acting in reality , its analytical faculty – its reason – can accurately interpret human observation – or the data of reality as available to the human senses .
Moreover , since every man is an acting being – every man has the capacity to reason accurately and make accurate observations , if he chooses to use that capacity .
Certain Knowledge
Since , following from the action axiom , man 's reason can accurately interpret his observations , it can thereby obtain fully correct , certain knowledge about aspects of reality .
The science of praxeology consists of a systematic collection of certain knowledge derived from the action axiom and known to be true .
Just as the action axiom is irrefutable , so are the propositions stemming from it .
Man can know the truth of praxeological propositions fully and absolutely : no amount of further experimentation or empirical evidence can refute them .
Its statements and propositions are not derived from experience .
They are , like those of logic and mathematics , a priori .
They are not subject to verification and falsification on the ground of experience and facts .
They are both logically and temporally antecedent to any comprehension of historical facts .
They are a necessary requirement of any intellectual grasp of historical events .
( HA , p. 32 ) Praxeology offers synthetic a priori insights about reality .
It requires no observation to arrive at , but nonetheless offers knowledge that no observation can possibly refute – and many observations will confirm .
Furthermore , praxeology is synthetic a priori true , because its starting point – the action axiom – is irrefutably correct .
Praxeology is not merely analytic a priori , since it requires more than the mechanisms of formal logic to confirm : one has to be an acting being oneself in order to know of action and praxeology .
While formal logic is necessary in explicating praxeology , it is not sufficient : logic is a category of action and must be preceded by it .
Axioms – like the proposition that humans act – cannot be proved by means of logic alone .
They are the starting points of logical systems and thus cannot be arrived at from within the systems themselves .
Their truth is known more fundamentally : any attempt to refute them implicitly confirms them .
The action axiom makes possible the acquisition of a plethora of a priori knowledge about reality .
A priori true economic propositions , however , are arrived at with especial directness : " Economic propositions flow directly from our reflectively gained knowledge of action ; and the status of these propositions as a priori true statements about something real is derived from our understanding of what Mises terms ' the axiom of action ' " ( Hoppe , " Praxeology and Economic Science : Sec. I " ) .
Economics , as a subcategory of praxeology , is rationally knowable not merely because of the action axiom , but as a direct derivation from it .
For example , the law of diminishing marginal utility can be deduced from the action axiom .
In acting , a man uses a given economic good to fulfill a set of available ends .
If he values a given end above all others , he will devote his first unit of the relevant good to that end – since his valuation of that end can only be observed via the actions he takes to pursue it .
He will necessarily devote his second unit of the same good to the second most subjectively valued end he deems attainable via that good 's use .
The value the actor derives from the use of the good 's second unit is thus necessarily less than the value obtained from using its first unit : the second most valuable end is necessarily less valuable than the first .
Such reasoning can be extrapolated indefinitely , applicable to as many units of a good a given economic actor might have , no matter what the identity of the actor and of the good in question might be .
The law of diminishing marginal utility holds for all time periods – past , present , and future – and no empirical datum could conceivably refute it .
But the propositions of economics are not the sole extent of a priori knowledge made possible by the action axiom 's existence .
Indeed , to clearly delineate the bounds of knowledge that can be arrived at via an axiomatic - deductive approach , another a priori truth is needed : " that humans are capable of argumentation and hence know the meaning of truth and validity " ( Hoppe , " On Praxeology and the Praxeological Foundations of Epistemology : Sec. III " ) .
Hoppe 's axiom of argumentation , like the action axiom , cannot be consistently denied .
One 's attempted refutation of the existence of human argumentation would itself be an argument .
Metaphysically , argumentation is a subclass of action : to argue is to select a set of verbal and logical means to pursue the end of demonstrating something to be true or false .
However , epistemologically , argumentation is prior to action : " without argumentation nothing could be said to be known about action " ( Hoppe , " On Praxeology and the Praxeological Foundations of Epistemology : Sec. III " ) .
The only way one can use argumentation is if one is an acting being .
However , the only way one knows that one is an acting being is by using his reason and exercising argumentation .
If one did not use argumentation ( including abstaining from attempting to deny one 's argumentative capacity ) , one would never know that one is an acting being – nor would one be able to articulate to himself or others why one pursued a given course of action .
One would have to choose ends and means without knowing why one chose them .
This is a contradiction in terms : the very concept of ends and means makes no sense without the actor 's exercise of reason .
Saying or thinking , " I chose means X to get end Y , " constitutes an argument and a reason for one 's action .
Without the ability to convey this reason to at least oneself , one would not be able to act at all .
The capacity to act implies the capacity to use argumentation .
Only through argumentation can one arrive at the action axiom and the praxeological knowledge following from it .
But because argumentation is , in fact , based on action , it can arrive at certain truths : " the possibility of argumentation presupposes action in that validity claims can only be explicitly discussed in the course of an argumentation if the individuals doing so already know what it means to act and to have knowledge implied in action " ( Hoppe , " On Praxeology and the Praxeological Foundations of Epistemology : Sec. III " ) .
Since we are beings who act in reality , our argumentation – being a type of action – is also in and of reality .
It is possible to argue falsely : this would be a specific case of using improper means to achieve a desired end .
However , correct argumentation is similarly possible , as is a more general case of using means that actually fulfill a given actor 's goals .
If it were impossible to act correctly , then no means selected by humans would ever arrive at ends those human beings aimed at .
Since we observe ubiquitously that human beings frequently select proper means to actually fulfill their ends , we know that a correct pairing of means and ends is possible .
Since argumentation facilitates the pairing of means and ends , correct argumentation must be possible as well .
If correct argumentation were impossible , so would any sort of eradication of dissatisfaction – which can only come about from reaching one 's chosen ends .
Furthermore , if no human ends – including basic survival needs – were met , all humans would be long dead .
We know that many humans exist and routinely remedy dissatisfactions ; therefore , much of their action and argumentation must be correct .
Since argumentation pertains to reality , man can obtain knowledge about reality by using argumentation correctly .
Knowledge , the product of argumentation , is then itself a category of action .
If argumentation is a subclass of action , then the realm of a priori , certain knowledge can be described as the realm of propositions that can be arrived at argumentatively , without being contingent on any additional external observations .
According to Hoppe , the " task of epistemology [ is ] that of formulating those propositions which are argumentatively indisputable in that their truth is already implied in the very fact of making one 's argument and so cannot be denied argumentatively " ( Hoppe , " On Praxeology and the Praxeological Foundations of Epistemology : Sec. III " ) .
According to Hoppe , epistemology must then " delineate the range of such a priori knowledge from the realm of propositions whose validity cannot be established in this way but require additional , contingent information for their validation , or that cannot be validated at all and so are mere metaphysical statements in the pejorative sense of the term metaphysical . "
Proper epistemology will tell us which facts can be known through reasoning and introspection – and which require specific observations to verify ; furthermore , it will tell us which propositions are absurd or altogether irrelevant to reality .
The action axiom enables such an epistemology to claim that man can be certain in the accuracy of both his a priori knowledge and his observation – that no fact of reality is inherently off limits to human comprehension .
Any denial of knowledge inextricably linked to the axioms of action and argumentation would entail a contradiction of one 's own argument and would be refuted by one 's very ability to argue .
Furthermore , the realm of a priori knowledge is praxeologically constrained : it is only as broad as the categories of human action allow it to be .
It is possible to have genuine a priori knowledge about something other than action , but the very pursuit knowledge can only be facilitated by action .
Knowing is an end toward which deliberate physical and mental activity is a means .
This praxeological constraint is in fact an assurance : it allows us to understand all genuine a priori knowledge as knowledge of reality , and not merely of the categories of our own minds .
Hoppe explains : " Acting is a cognitively guided adjustment of a physical body in physical reality .
And thus , there can be no doubt that a priori knowledge , conceived of as an insight into the structural constraints imposed on knowledge qua knowledge of actors , must indeed correspond to the nature of things "
( " On Praxeology and the Praxeological Foundations of Epistemology : Sec. III " ) .
Because action necessarily exists in physical reality , a priori knowledge – being a subcategory of action – must also pertain to that reality .
Action and , in particular , argumentation provide a figurative bridge through which the data of reality can enter our minds and reside there without being vulnerable to further disproof or rejection .
The ability to arrive at certain a priori knowledge about reality deals a mortal blow to two doctrines denying the possibility of accurate axiomatic - deductive theoretical insights : empiricism and historicism .

Are smarter people better at ignoring things ?
People frequently complain that they can’t remember things — and they wish their brains had more storage capacity , like today ’s ever - expanding computer hard drives and RAM .
If we could just improve the sheer size of our memory , we ’d be able to retain and manipulate more data , and we ’d become smarter and smarter — right ?
Not according to an intriguing new experiment by brain scientists at the University of Oregon .
Edward Vogel and a team of students took a handful of volunteers and tested their “ visual working memory ” — their ability to maintain awareness of events and objects around them .
The test asked them to pay attention to red or blue bricks in a visual picture .
Now , visual working memory is highly correlated to intelligence : People with a bigger VWM tend to score much better on an array of cognitive challenges .
For years , scientists have assumed that VWM is roughly analogous to cramming info into your head :
The more you can fit in there , the smarter you are .
But when Vogel mapped the brain - wave activity of the volunteers , he noticed something much weirder .
The people with the largest capacity in their VWM were n’t retaining tons of information .
No , they were being quite selective .
Their genius lay in being able to strip out inessential information :
To pay attention only to the red bricks — to hold only those “ in mind ” — and to ignore the blue ones .
The upshot , as the editors at Nature summarize , is that …
… this also implies that an individual ’s effective memory capacity may not simply reflect storage space , as it does with a hard disk .
It may also reflect how efficiently irrelevant information is excluded from using up vital storage capacity .
That chart above shows this relationship :
The more efficiently the subjects ’ brain worked , the bigger their memory capacity .
This is not to say that people who ca n’t screen out stimuli are dumber .
As Vogel noted , “ Being a bit scattered tends to be a trait of highly imaginative people . ”
The more you rattle the marbles around in your brain , the more creative new connections you make , as it were — connections that might be lost on those focusing intently on just the red ones .

BJARNE STROUSTRUP , the designer of C++ , the most influential programming language of the last 25 years , has said that “ our technological civilization depends on software . ”
True , but most software is n’t much good .
Too many programs are ugly : inelegant , unreliable and not very useful .
Software that satisfies and delights is as rare as a phoenix .
All this does more than frustrate computer users .
Bad software is terrible for business and the economy .
Software failures cost $ 59.5 billion a year , the National Institute of Standards and Technology concluded in a 2002 study , and fully 25 percent of commercial software projects are abandoned before completion .
Of projects that are finished , 75 percent ship late or over budget .
The reasons are n’t hard to divine .
Programmers do n’t know what a computer user wants because they spend their days interacting with machines .
They hunch over keyboards , pecking out individual lines of code in esoteric programming languages , like medieval monks laboring over illustrated manuscripts .
Worse , programs today contain millions of lines of code , and programmers are fallible like all other humans : there are , on average , 100 to 150 bugs per 1,000 lines of code , according to a 1994 study by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University .
No wonder so much software is so bad : programmers are drowning in ignorance , complexity and error .
The World Chiropractic Alliance ( WCA ) , an organization dedicated to “ preserving and strengthening subluxation - based chiropractic around the world , ” is upset about a conspicuous ad appearing on the outside of a bus in Bridgeport and Waterbury , Connecticut .
In 2006 , a lawyer acting on its behalf notified the Greater Bridgeport Transit Authority ( GBTA ) that if the ad was not immediately removed , the WCA and several local chiropractors would file suit and ask state and federal authorities to investigate
The ad was placed by the Chiropractic Stroke Victims Awareness Group .
No suit was filed .
The advertising space on our fleet of buses is considered “ public forum ” as is any advertising billboard , therefore protected by the first amendment of the US Constitution of “ free speech . ”
This amendment therefore limits advertisers that can be rejected regardless of the concerns of any one body in the community .
The GBTA could not and will not engage in any form whatsoever that could be construed as prejudicial or bias .
GBTA does not condone or support any of our advertiser ’s claims .
The advertisement in question defames no one ; it merely sets forth a rhetorical question common in lawyer and professional mass media advertising , which asks whether the reader was injured by a chiropractor .
We thank you for your correspondence .
It appears to me that the GBTA did nothing wrong and was not intimidated .
Its official position was that :
Because the ad pointed to the Neck911 Web site , many chiropractors assume the Chiropractic Stroke Victims Awareness Group owns the site .
That was not true , however .
Neck911 was a network of professionals who provide consultations on complications due to neck manipulation [ 2 ] .
Its Web site was operated by John W. Kinsinger , M.D. , an anesthesiologist who has investigated many chiropractors [ 3 ] .
Dr. Kinsinger told me that neither he nor Neck911 had anything to do with the content or placing of the ads .
[ Note :
In 2011 , the domian expired and was taken over by chiropractors who immediately changed the contents to promote neck manipulation . ]
Last year , the Chiropractic Stroke Victims Awareness Group placed other ads that angered chiropractors .
One used the billboard pictured to the right .
The other advertised in the Hartford Courant that :
Our mission is to warn people of the risks involved with chiropractic adjustments and to help victims , like us , their families try to get back some degree of normalcy in their lives .
Unfortunately , chiropractic adjustments are not completely safe and without risk .
We are the proof .
If you or a loved one have been affected , We Want to Hear from You . ”
The Connecticut Chiropractic Association complained to the billboard company and the newspaper and published a newspaper counter - ad which claimed that chiropractors ’ “ proven safety record ” and “ focus on education and patient improvement , as research now shows , are important factors in the success of chiropractic management . . . ” [ 4 ]
Stroke from chiropractic neck manipulation occurs when an artery to the brain ruptures or becomes blocked as a result of being stretched .
Speculations exist that the odds of a serious complication due to neck manipulation are somewhere between one in 5,000 and one in 10 million manipulations .
No one really knows , however , because there has been little systematic study of its frequency [ 5 ] .
Neck911 has summed up the situation this way :
The chiropractic profession has attempted to ignore , or minimize the realities of this devastating consequence .
They often state that it occurs in only one out of a million cervical manipulations , or that a person is more likely to be struck by lightning .
Recently an administrator at a prominent chiropractic college in the midwest was asked about stroke following chiropractic upper cervical manipulation .
He responded that this phenomenon has NEVER happened .
Of course this is totally false as prestigious medical journals from around the world have documented these cases for the past sixty years .
The real concern should not focus on the frequency of this occurrence but rather on risk / benefit ratio .
No matter how infrequent the complication , if there is little or no benefit to the procedure , then a complication as severe as death can not be risked .
This is the case with regard to chiropractic manipulation of the highest part of the neck .
It is a procedure that is used to treat everything from ear infections in babies to high blood pressure and epilepsy in adults .
There is no evidence of any benefit for the majority of the ailments that this procedure is utilized for [ 6 ] .
Shortly after the GBTA was threatened , WTNH -TV aired a program about the bus ad which described the Chiropractic Stroke Victims Awareness Group as “ victims , family members and friends who have been traumatized ” by chiropractic treatment and “ whose lives have been destroyed . ” [ 7 ]
Two members appeared on the program .
The first , identified as “ Britt , ” said she had reached an out - of - court settlement after having a stroke about three years ago in her chiropractor ’s office .
Britt requires a feeding tube because she ’ has lost the ability to swallow .
The other member is Linda Solsbury , a former nurse who won a jury award after suffering a stroke during an adjustment 20 years ago .
She is partially paralyzed , ca n’t speak , and must use a keyboard to communicate .
The book Chiropractic : The Greatest Hoax of the Century ? has a chapter about her case [ 8 ] .
In 2008 , chiropractor Stephen Pisherchia was prosecuted and placed on probation for harassing Britt by telephone [ 9 ] .

Do you believe , as someone somewhere perhaps does , that meetings , meetings , meetings , followed by more meetings are altogether a good thing ?
If so , Alexandra Luong and Steven G Rogelberg think you should think again .
In a newly published study , they say : " We propose that despite the fact that meetings may help to achieve work - related goals , having too many meetings and spending too much time in meetings per day may have negative effects on the individual . "
Luong is an assistant professor of industrial and organisational psychology at the University of Minnesota , Duluth .
Rogelberg is an associate professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte .
Their report appears in the journal Group Dynamics : Theory , Research and Practice .
It begins with a somewhat brief recitation of the history of important research discoveries about meetings .
Here is a capsule version of their tale .
Discovery :
The majority of a manager 's typical workday is spent in meetings .
This was reported by an investigator named Mintzberg in 1973 .
Discovery :
The frequency and length of meetings have grown considerably in the last few decades .
So declared the team of Mosvick and Nelson in 1987 .
Discovery : A scientist named Zohar , in a series of reports published during the 1990s , found evidence that " annoying episodes " - which are sometimes also known as " hassles " - contribute to burnout , anxiety , depression and other negative emotions .
Zohar advanced a theoretical framework that may one day help to explain why this is so .
Discovery :
In 1999 , a scientist named Zijlstra " had a sample of office workers work in a simulated office for a period of two days in order to examine the psychological effects of interruptions .
[ They ] were periodically interrupted by telephone calls from the researcher . "
This had what Zijlstra calls " negative effects " on their mood .
Luong and Rogelberg used those and other discoveries as a basis for their own innovatively broad theory .
They devised a pair of hypotheses , educatedly guessing that :
1 . The more meetings one has to attend , the greater the negative effects ; and
2 . The more time one spends in meetings , the greater the negative effects .
Then they performed an experiment to test these two hypotheses .
Thirty - seven volunteers each kept a diary for five working days , answering survey questions after every meeting they attended and also at the end of each day .
That was the experiment .
The results speak volumes .
" It is impressive , " Luong and Rogelberg write in their summary , " that a general relationship between meeting load and the employee 's level of fatigue and subjective workload was found " .
Their central insight , they say , is the concept of " the meeting as one more type of hassle or interruption that can occur for individuals " .
Rogelberg has delivered this insight in a talk called " Meetings and More Meetings , " which he presented to a meeting at the University of Sheffield .
He also does a talk called " Not Another Meeting ! " , which has been well received at two meetings in North Carolina .

Stock Spam Effectiveness Monitor
[ 08/17/2007 :
This site has been retired .
It 's a hassle to maintain , and after three years I think I 've made my point .
If you 're interested in acquiring the spam corpus for research purposes , please contact me . ]
Who buys stuff from spam ?
Usually , there 's no way to tell .
Spammers are n't exactly forthcoming with their sales numbers .
If only those numbers were required to be made public ; then we could correlate the arrival time of the spam to the volume in sales at that point .
A pleasant daydream , you say ?
Well , actually , there is one type of spam where we can see the results : spam that tries to get you to buy stock .
Spammers send out spam promoting a stock to try to drive up the price .
People buy the stock , and the spammers sell .
Since in this networked age we can get stock quotes in near - real - time , it 's easy to match spam arrival time to stock price and trading volume .
Two 2006 studies ( Böhme and Holz , and Frieder and Zitrain ) show how stock spam takes money from those who respond to it , and makes money for the spammers .
This site is my own contribution to science : a daily updated catalogue of stock spam .
Below you 'll see a graphical representation of the stock spam I received over the most recent day of stock trading .
Each stock price graph has been annotated with a vertical red bar every time I received a spam for that stock .
On the left side of each graph you 'll see any spam that came in after the market closed the previous day .
Stock spam for 2007 - 8 - 6
11 spams sent before market close 2007 - 8 - 6 :
126 spams sent before market close 2007 - 8 - 6 :
How it works
In addition to my normal spam - filtered email addresses , I 've got spam trap addresses that receive an enormous amount of spam .
About 15 % of the spam I get is promoting some company or other ( when I started the Monitor in 2004 it was 3 % ) .
It 's easy to distinguish this spam from other types of spam because it uses a distinct vocabulary .
However it does use many of the general obfuscation techniques as other spam , seemingly with no effect on its credibility among those it suckers .
A script run each evening finds new stock spam in my various inboxes , grabs the latest price charts for those stocks and annotates them .
It then uses the accumulated data to write out reports like the one above .
False positives are rare but possible , especially for stock symbols that are also English words .
I'm on the lookout for these and get rid of them as I see them .

A Realistic Plan for World Peace
a.k.a
Nuke the Moon
by Frank J .
" Gotta nuke something . "
- 20th century philosopher Nelson Muntz
World peace cannot be achieved by sitting around on our duffs singing hippy songs to the moon .
Peace can only be achieved through excessive acts of seemingly mindless violence .
Who do bullies pick on in the playground ?
The giant , crazy looking guy who looks ready to snap and kill the person nearest or some harmless looking weenie who appears to do anything to avoid conflict ?
People pick on the weenie because people like to start fights they think they can win .
In the same way , people will continue to attack America and our interests when they get the idea that they can piss off America without us immediately eradicating them and everyone around them in the most painful way possible .
Now , if I were president , here 's what I would do .
Next time some country does something we do n't take a pining too , such as supporting terrorism or speaking French , I 'd pick the dumbest reason for an attack , e.g. , " A 'q ' should always be followed by a ' u ' .
I do n't make the rules , Iraq , but I will enforce them . "
The more irrational you look , the more scared the country will be that you will really hit them hard .
I 'd then give the country the old one - week notice until bombing starts .
Then , after just twenty - four hours , I 'd start bombing .
When the stupid dictator calls to complain , I 'd say , " I meant one week max .
Oh , and by the way , ground troops - one week . "
I 'm sure that would be enough to capitulate the average evildoer , but some extra measures could help intimidate others as well .
Like , instead of just saturation bombing a city , super - saturation bomb it .
After annihilating everything until nothing but ash is left , I 'd nuke the ashes .
It 's that extra bit of extremely disproportionate use of force that makes other countries start to wonder if America " has it all together " and really worrying who we 'll lash out against next .
Of course , Europe will start complaining , and Europe 's bad mouthing of America gives comfort to our enemies .
I mean , those guys values are so messed up they think calling someone a " cowboy " is an insult .
Best idea would be to assassinate the leader of the first European country we hear a peep out of .
This will probably make us look evil , though , when we want the image of crazy and violent .
So , when the Europeans ask why , I 'd claim to never have heard of the person : " I did n't even know France had a leader .
Sure it was n't suicide ?
Yeah , committing suicide with a sniper rifle would be hard , but not impossible if you had a five - hundred yard length of string to work the trigger . "
Assassination does seem a little extreme , but we 're talking about Europe .
I mean , what are they going to do other than quickly capitulate under a mild threat of force .
We 'll probably start seeing , " We all love America ! " parades in bids to not be our next targets .
Now the world will be pretty convinced that America is frick 'n nuts and just looking for a fight , but we need to really ingrain it into everyone 's conscious so that no one will ever even contemplate crossing us .
This requires making good use of our nukes .
I know , nukes can kill millions of people , but they sure are n't doing anyone any good just sitting around .
I mean , how many years has it been since we last dropped a bomb on someone ?
No one even thinks we 'll actually use one now .
Of course , using nukes should n't be done haphazardly ; all uses have to be well planned out because the explosions are so cool looking that we 'll want to give the press plenty of notice so they can get pictures of the mushroom cloud from all sorts of different angles .
But what to nuke ?
Well , usually the idea is populated cities , but , by the beliefs of my morally superior religion , killing is wrong .
So why can't we be more creative than nuking people .
My idea is to nuke the moon ; just say we thought we saw moon people or something .
There is no one actually there to kill ( unless we time it poorly ) and everyone in the world could see the results .
And all the other countries would exclaim , " Holy @$ # % !
They are nuking the moon !
America has gone insane !
I better go eat at McDonald 's before they think I do n't like them . "
But why stop there .
We 've got like tons of national parks ; we surely would n't miss just one if we nuked it .
Our excuse will be that we heard a drug dealer was hiding there .
Then the foreign nations would be like , " Sacre bleu !
These Americans are nuking themselves !
Surely they will think nothing of bombing us !
Let 's adapt their vapid culture as our own so they might consider us one of them . "
Now all other countries will be completely freaked out and never even dream of messing with us .
They 'll say the name of America with hushed whispers and always praise us in public for fear of reprisal .
We'd be like an Old Testament god to them ; perhaps they would even start worshiping us - actually , we should make that a condition of favored trade status .
Not only will we have ensured peace for ourselves , but we can also now easily end any conflict between other countries .
We see two nations warring over some territory , all we 'll have to do is say , " Hey , break it up , " and they 'll be racing to concede to each other rather than get on the bad side of the " crazy , homicidal Americans . "
And , if people are being oppressed by an evil government , all we 'll have to do is say , " Hey you !
Stop being communist ! " and the next day they 'll have elections , capitalism , and free - press to keep from having their country turned into a parking lot .
It will be that easy to motivate our fellow man , because there is hardly anything people treasure more than not being annihilated .
Now all that 's needed to keep peace is to come up with new and creative ways of looking insane and belligerent without actually harming anyone .
Missile defense is probably a good step in that direction .
Next time some country steps out of line , we launch a nuclear missile at them .
Just seconds before it hits , we blow it up with our missile defense so that everyone there sees the huge explosion in the sky .
Then the president would just call up their leader and say , " Hey , we lost sight of our SDI test .
Did you see if it worked ? "
By now , you 're probably saying , " Great idea .
But how to do we pay for all these random acts of violence ? "
Just create an " Other Country Tax " , a tax for being a country other than the U.S.
After implementing my plan , all the countries will be eager to pay the money , and probably add a nice tip to win favor .
So there you have it , a real peace plan that could actually work .
Warmongering pacifists want us to act all nice such that countries think we 're rational and wo n't kill everyone with a blind fury , thus making it possible they might actually attack us and draw us into a war .
But , if America follows my idea and lashes out at the slightest provocation with unmeasured vengeance , there can be peace .
So there 's the choice : either be a homicidal maniac thus ensuring peace and love in the world , or be some pacifist hippy while the streets flow with the blood of the innocent .

THREE years ago Zell Miller , then a Democratic senator for Georgia , published an anguished book entitled “ A National Party No More : The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat ” .
Today , though , the people who are in that very danger are the Republicans rather than the Democrats .
The Republicans are now engaged in a fierce debate about the meaning of last month 's mid-term defeat .
Was there anything more to their loss of both chambers of Congress than the six - year itch and an unpopular war ?
Do they need to press ahead with the conservative agenda or should they revise it ?
The debate is lively .
But it is missing an important aspect : the Zell Miller dimension .
Is the Republican Party in danger of shrinking to its southern base ?
And is it shrinking at exactly the same time that the Democrats are becoming a more national party ?
The extent of the southernisation of the Republican Party is astonishing .
The party was all but wiped out in its historic base , the north - east .
There is now only one Republican in the 22 - strong New England House delegation .
New Hampshire kicked out its two Republican congressmen ( and gave Democrats a majority in both state houses for the first time since 1874 ) .
Massachusetts ended 16 years of Republican occupation of the governor 's mansion .
Rhode Island decapitated Lincoln Chafee despite his moderate record .
New York installed Democrats in every statewide office for the first time since 1938 .
The Republicans also suffered big losses in a region that voted solidly for Bush in 2004 — the Mountain West .
Three Republicans lost house seats .
Conrad Burns lost his Senate seat in Montana ( 59 % for Bush in 2004 ) .
Democrats now control five of the eight governorships in the region , compared with none in 2000 .
The only place where the national tide had little impact was in the South .
The Democrats made a few inroads in the periphery — winning a Senate seat in Virginia and House seats in North Carolina , Florida and Texas .
But deep southern states such as Georgia and Mississippi remained unchanged .
Exit polls showed that only 36 % of white voters in the South voted for Democratic House candidates ; it was 58 % in the north - east .
The problem for the Republicans is that a regional stronghold can become a prison .
The South has one of the most distinctive cultures in the United States — far more jingoistic than the rest of the country and far more religious .
Fifty - eight per cent of deep southerners identify themselves as either evangelical or born - again compared with a third of non-southerners ( the figure in Mississippi is 73 % ) .
But for every non-southerner who waxes lyrical about southern charm there are many more who associate the South with racial bigotry and cultural backwardness .
The 2006 election — which saw social conservatives such as Rick Santorum and Kenneth Blackwell go down to humiliating defeat — suggests that non-southerners have grown particularly impatient with the South 's brand of in - your - face religiosity .
For once Bill Frist , an outgoing Republican senator from Tennessee , has read the runes correctly in announcing this week that he will not run for president .
Mr Frist is too deeply associated with pandering to the religious right — particularly over the Terri Schiavo affair — to have a chance of winning nationally .
But Mitt Romney , the outgoing governor of Massachusetts , could well be in the process of falling into the trap .
Mr Romney thinks the only way that he can persuade the evangelicals who control the southern party to forgive him his Mormonism is to turn himself into a red - blooded social conservative .
But the more he does that , the more he alienates people outside the South .
The Republican Party 's problems are made worse by the fact that the Democrats have done a good deal to escape from their own Democratic prison .
Beyond their gains in the Mountain West , they will be able to display some interesting new faces when the next Congress assembles in January : like Brad Ellsworth of Indiana , who boasts an A - grade from the National Rifle Association , Mike Weaver of Kentucky , who opposes abortion rights , Heath Shuler , of North Carolina , who boasts that he is “ pro-business , pro-life and pro-gun ” , and Jim Webb of Virginia , who likes nothing better than denouncing the liberal elite .
Still time to rethink
One should be wary of reading too much into the result of a single election — particularly one conducted during the sixth year of a presidency and during a disastrous war .
The Democratic leadership is still dominated by bicoastal liberals .
The two leading Republican presidential candidates , John McCain and Rudy Giuliani , are from Arizona and New York .
Arnold Schwarzenegger won a resounding re-election by taking to the middle .
But the Democratic advances were more than just a fluke .
Howard Dean , the party chairman , made a point of running a 50 - state strategy in 2006 .
But even before that , the party had worked hard to recruit candidates who looked more like America and less like Harvard Yard : Brian Schweitzer , who was elected governor of Montana in 2004 , says that “ we do n't scare 'em .
We are the kind of people who go to church on Sunday , drive a pickup and lower taxes when we can . ”
The danger for the Republicans is that they will respond to these Democratic advances by retreating to their heartland .
The incoming Republican delegation will be more southern and more conservative than ever .
It is hardly encouraging that the Senate Republicans have just reinstalled Mississippi's Trent Lott as one of their leaders — a man who had to give up the top job in 2002 for making a racist remark .
There are plenty of Republican activists who think that the future lies in becoming ever more conservative , and not worrying too much about the slow - growing north - east .
That sort of thinking led the Democrats to become the Party of Taxachusetts and Michael Dukakis .
The Republicans need a Zell Miller of their own .
IN THEIR THIRD PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE , in October 1960 , John F. Kennedy went after Vice President Richard Nixon , blasting him as weak on national security for not stopping the spread of nuclear weapons .
France had just tested its first nuclear device , joining the United States , the Soviet Union and Britain as the world ’s first nuclear powers .
Kennedy warned “ that 10 , 15 or 20 nations will have a nuclear capacity -- including Red China -- by the end of the presidential office in 1964 . ”
As president , Kennedy sought to fight that dark vision , telling the United Nations : “ The weapons of war must be abolished , before they abolish us . ”
He restarted talks on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty , began pursuit of a global nonproliferation pact and signed a treaty with the Soviet Union to ban atmospheric nuclear tests .
Although Kennedy did not live to finish the job , in 1968 , Lyndon Johnson signed what became the diplomatic crown jewel of his presidency : the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , or NPT .
President Nixon secured its ratification .
The NPT is now considered one of the most successful security pacts in history .
Every nation in the world is a member except Israel , India , Pakistan , and North Korea .
Most of the 183 member states that do not have nuclear weapons believe what the treaty says :
We should eliminate nuclear weapons .
The treaty became the hub around which liberals and conservatives built an interlocking network of agreements that deterred , though did n’t altogether stop , the spread of nuclear weapons .
As a result , by 2000 , only three other countries -- Israel , India and Pakistan -- had joined the original five nuclear nations .
With the success of these agreements , and the end of the Soviet - American nuclear standoff at the close of the Cold War , it seemed that the nuclear threat that had haunted the world for so many years might finally be receding .
Advertisement
But now , suddenly , the threat is back .
In the last six years , we seem awash in nuclear threats : First it was Saddam Hussein , then North Korea and Iran .
How did it happen ?
Is nuclear restraint dead ?
At the heart of the problem is the strategy George W. Bush chose , which rejects international treaties as the solution to proliferation .
He and his advisors saw these agreements as limiting U.S. flexibility and viewed the United Nations and other global gatherings as arenas where the world ’s Lilliputians could tie down the American Gulliver .
Bush scuttled the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty , walked away from the nuclear test ban treaty secured by President Clinton , opposed efforts to enforce the treaty banning biological weapons , mocked the U.N. inspectors before the Iraq war and sent low - level officials to critical negotiations , including last year ’s NPT conference .
The world now believes that the chief architect of the global nonproliferation system has abandoned its creation .
Instead , the administration preferred to rely on U.S. military might and technology , such as anti-missile systems , to protect the United States .
Rather than negotiate treaties to eliminate weapons , it forged a strategy to eliminate the regimes that might use them against us .
The Bush team felt they knew who the bad guys were , and they aimed to get them -- one by one .
Advertisement
But the strategy has backfired .
Both Iran and North Korea accelerated their programs , making more progress in the last five years than they had made in the previous 10 .
Now North Korea ’s test threatens to trigger an Asian nuclear - reaction chain that could prompt South Korea , Taiwan and even Japan to reconsider their nuclear options .
And it is not just the threats from small nations such as North Korea that could fuel a new atomic arms race .
It is the continued existence of huge nuclear arsenals in the United States , Russia and other states .
The importance of nuclear weapons as a cornerstone of U.S. defense had been declining since the Cold War ended .
Though the U.S. never ruled out their use , Clinton and George H.W.
Bush made it clear that they believed they were unusable , except perhaps in retaliation .
But the current president ’s policies have elevated the role of these weapons .
The 2002 Nuclear Posture Review detailed plans to build new , more usable “ low - yield ” nuclear weapons and created missions for them .
Bush decided to retain about 6,000 weapons and to research a new generation of nuclear missiles , bombers and submarines .
What ’s the relevance of this to proliferation ?
Simple .
U.S. intelligence officials concluded as early as 1958 that other nations ’ nuclear appetites could not be curbed without limiting the superpowers ’ stockpiles .
That judgment was confirmed by subsequent administrations .
Advertisement
As the superpowers cut their weapons from a Cold War high of 65,000 in 1986 to about 27,000 today , other countries took note .
In the 1960s , 23 countries had nuclear programs , including Australia , Canada , Egypt , Japan , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland and West Germany .
Most ended any weapons programs .
Brazil and Argentina stopped research in the 1980s , and South Africa , Belarus , Kazakhstan and Ukraine gave up their bombs in the 1990s .
We now know that U.N. inspectors ended Iraq ’s nuclear program in 1991 .
In 2003 , Libya abandoned its secret program .
Until last week , no nation had tested a nuclear weapon for eight years -- the longest period in the Atomic Age .
The outrage that greeted the North Korean test shows how strong anti-nuclear sentiment has become .
Many political and military leaders recognize the limited military utility of weapons whose use would kill thousands of innocent civilians .
Rep. David L. Hobson ( R - Ohio ) , a solid Midwest conservative , led the effort last year to kill the administration ’s proposed “ nuclear bunker buster , ” a new weapon designed to go after conventional targets .
Former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advocates greatly reducing the U.S. and Russian arsenals and then working to eliminate them completely , just as countries have done with chemical and biological weapons .
Even former Bush advisor Richard Perle has said the U.S. could cut to well below 1,000 warheads .
“ The truth is we are never going to use them , ” Perle said .
“ The Russians are n’t going to use theirs either . ”
By clinging to our own nuclear arsenal , and touting the importance of these weapons to our own security , the Bush administration has sent the world a schizoid message : Nuclear weapons are very , very important and useful -- but you cannot have them .
This double standard is impossible to maintain .
Advertisement
Last year , International Atomic Energy Agency Director Mohamed ElBaradei said that until the world was committed to eradicating nuclear weapons , “ we will continue to have this cynical environment that all the guys in the minor leagues will try to join the major leagues ....
They will say , ‘ If the big boys continue to rely on nuclear weapons , why should n’t I ? ’ ”
Bush administration officials have proved expert at smashing the agreements their predecessors so painstakingly built , but in doing so they broke the bars that had caged the nuclear beast .
Those who will have to repair the damage would do well to look back at the handiwork of the past .
They might learn a thing or two .
The brain is bombarded by information about the physical proportions of our bodies .
The most familiar sensations , such as a puff of wind or the brush of our own shirt sleeve , serve to constantly remind the brain of the body 's outer bounds , creating a sense of what is known as proprioception .
In a new study , researchers report this week that the brain 's ability to interpret external signals and update its sense of bodily self is more dynamic than had been previously thought and that such updates can happen very quickly , altering within a matter of seconds how body parts and individual touch sensations are perceived .
The work is reported by researchers Frederique de Vignemont , Henrik Ehrsson , and Patrick Haggard at University College London .
The information that is integrated in the course of proprioception comes from several different senses , including touch , pain , vision , information from muscles , and so on .
The brain must combine all these information inputs to accurately perceive the external world through our body 's interaction with it and also to produce a coherent sense of self .
Because all these signals carry such different kinds of information , the brain must perform a constant juggling act in order to make sense of the body and the world .
In the new study , the research team used a method called tendon vibration to induce a distortion of healthy volunteers ' sense of their own bodies .
When the biceps tendon of the right arm was vibrated , the subjects in the experiments felt within seconds that their right elbow was rotating away from the body , even though the arm was actually quite still .
If subjects held their left index finger with their right hand while this happened , they felt their left index finger getting longer as they felt their arm move .
The team then tested how these bodily illusions rearranged the sense of touch .
They touched subjects with two metal rods on the left index finger , and asked them to judge whether the distance between the rods was greater or smaller than the distance between two additional rods touched on the forehead .
When tendon vibration made the index finger seem longer than it really was , subjects overestimated the tactile distance on the index finger , relative to the forehead .
The sense of touch was altered within seconds of applying the vibration , suggesting a very strong and fast link between the brain systems for touch and body position .
The observations showed that abnormal input into one of the body 's sensory systems produced a rapid and profound change in another sensory system :
The brain had changed the way it interpreted the signals from the sense of touch .
These links between different bodily senses show that the brain constantly updates its internal map , and they shed light on the dynamic and flexible nature of the body map that is used to interpret each new perception .

// i guess i’m done !
I called the numbers listed , and went through several layers of menus and waiting .
Of course , the person who answered at Cingular had no idea what to do .
He found someone walking around his call center who told him to call some other number .
He called that number , went through voice menu hell , and finally got told to call some other number .
Now he ’s calling that , and of course , it ’s just ringing the guy next to him , who has no idea what to do , either .
Of course they do n’t .
It ’s a friggin ’ unhandled exception .
Eventually they got me to another customer service representative who had been trained just to ask me what I was trying to do ( add another couple of lines to my account ) and do it .
That ’s not really a solution .
One of the hallmarks of a broken system is when there ’s just no possible way that the programmer who is writing code that talks to customers can ever get feedback from those customers about bugs , because the call center is outsourced to a different company than the software development project is outsourced to .
Everyone is trying their hardest to do their job but management has set it up so that it ’s impossible .
Now , on to wireless companies in the USA .
In the last ten years I ca n’t think of one time when a wireless company has been able to handle the basic things I ’ve asked for ( new service , cancel service , port a phone number ) without 45 minutes of unbelievably incompetent service .
Over the years I ’ve used Sprint , the old AT&T , Cingular , and BellAtlantic , and they ’re all pretty much equally messed up .
All of them suffer from hard working shlubs who are stuck in a situation created by incompetent managers , who have built esoteric mountains of complicated and brittle systems with a million moving parts , 3/4’s of them outsourced , where it ’s simply impossible to get anything done .
What does your code do to contact you when things go badly wrong ?
We use BugzScout to report unhandled problems directly into our own FogBugz database .
But even if you call our customer service line you get a human who is sitting right next to the programmer .
Violence in Aulnay - sous - Bois caught police unaware
At Aulnay - sous - Bois , at least 15 cars were torched as youths hurled stones and firebombs .
Police fired rubber bullets and arrested 34 people .
Although the initial flashpoint of Clichy - sous - Bois stayed calm , trouble spread across much of north - east Paris .
Unrest has flared since two north African boys died .
Local people say they had been fleeing the police .
French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy have delayed trips abroad to try to calm the situation .
Both met relatives of victims , police officials and community leaders on Tuesday in an effort to calm tensions .
But fresh violence broke out even as the pair opened talks .
War of words
As many as 69 cars were reportedly set on fire in nine towns in the Seine - Saint - Denis region , home to many impoverished communities .
When you fire real bullets at police , you 're not a ' youth ' , you 're a thug
Nicolas Sarkozy
French Interior Minister
Paris riots :
Your reaction
Mr Sarkozy , criticised for his description of the rioters as a " rabble " , has repeated his condemnation .
" I speak with real words , " Mr Sarkozy , who has cancelled a visit to Afghanistan and Pakistan next week , told Le Parisien newspaper .
" When you fire real bullets at police , you 're not a ' youth , ' you 're a thug . "
Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin , who has called for calm , has delayed a trip to Canada to try to ease tensions .
The pair have been accused of playing politics with the situation in an effort to win favour ahead of a presidential campaign in 2007 .
On Tuesday , the opposition Socialist Party accused Mr Sarkozy of tarnishing the image of France with his comments .
Cars torched
Unrest flared in Clichy after two teenage boys were electrocuted on Thursday at an electricity sub-station .
An official investigation is under way .
Clichy saw five successive nights of confrontation between police and young people from the mainly north African Muslim communities in the north - eastern suburb .
Unemployment and social problems are rife in many of France 's poorer suburban areas .
Police have reported sporadic incidents involving mobile groups of youths in the Val - d ' Oise , Seine - et - Marne , Hauts - de - Seine and Yvelines regions of Paris .
Four people were arrested for throwing stones at police in Bondy , where 14 cars were burned , the Associated Press quoted officials as saying .
The Tang dynasty * , seen by many historians as a glittering peak in China 's history , was brought to its knees by shifts in the monsoon cycle , according to a study .
Famed for a flowering of art and literature and for prosperity brought by trade with India and the Middle East , the dynasty spanned nearly three centuries , from AD 618 to 907 , before it was overwhelmed by revolt .
Scientists led by Gerald Haug of the Geoforschungszentrum ( GFZ ) in Potsdam , eastern Germany , looked at sedimentary cores taken from a lake at Zhanjiang in coastal southeastern China , opposite the tropical island of Hainan .
The magnetic properties and content of titanium in these deposits are an indicator of the strength of the winter cycle in the East Asian monsoon system , they believe .
They found that over the past 15,000 years , there had been three periods in which the winter monsoon was strong but the summer monsoon was weak .
The first two periods occurred at key moments during the last Ice Age , while the last ran from around 700 to 900 .
Each of these monsoon shifts coincided with what was , relative to the climate epoch , unusually cold weather .
The twilight of the Tang began in 751 , when the imperial army was defeated by Arabs .
But what eventually destroyed the dynasty were prolonged droughts and poor summer rains , which caused crop failure and stoked peasants ' uprisings .

Opening Paragraph
The Asian - Australian monsoon is an important component of the Earth 's climate system that influences the societal and economic activity of roughly half the world 's population .
The past strength of the rain - bearing East Asian summer monsoon can be reconstructed with archives such as cave deposits but the winter monsoon has no such signature in the hydrological cycle and has thus proved difficult to reconstruct .
Here we present high - resolution records of the magnetic properties and the titanium content of the sediments of Lake Huguang Maar in coastal southeast China over the past 16,000 years , which we use as proxies for the strength of the winter monsoon winds .
We find evidence for stronger winter monsoon winds before the Bolling - Allerod warming , during the Younger Dryas episode and during the middle and late Holocene , when cave stalagmites suggest weaker summer monsoons .
We conclude that this anticorrelation is best explained by migrations in the intertropical convergence zone .
Similar migrations of the intertropical convergence zone have been observed in Central America for the period ad 700 to 900 suggesting global climatic changes at that time .
From the coincidence in timing , we suggest that these migrations in the tropical rain belt could have contributed to the declines of both the Tang dynasty in China and the Classic Maya in Central America .

* Info on the Tang Dynasty :
... Near the end of the Tang Dynasty , regional military governors took advantage of their increasing power and began to function more like independent regimes on their own right .
At the same time , natural causes such as droughts and famine due to internal corruptions and incompetent emperors contributed to the rise of a series of rebellions .
The Huang Chao rebellion of the 9th century , which resulted in the sacking of both Chang'an and Luoyang was the most destructive and took over 10 years to suppress .
Although the rebellion was defeated by the Tang , it never really recovered from that crucial blow , weakening it for the future military powers to take over .
In 907 , after almost 300 years in power , the dynasty was ended when one of the military governors , Zhu Wen , deposed the last emperor and took the throne for himself which thereby inaugurated the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period ...

A single , narrow glass plate about 3 inches wide by 9 inches long was placed vertically into the camera by Prokudin - Gorskii .
He then photographed the same scene three times in a fairly rapid sequence using a red filter , a green filter and a blue filter .
When viewed through Prokudin - Gorskii ’s camera , the scene being photographed would have appeared upside down and reversed from its actual orientation .
For the digital process , the original tri-part glass negative is scanned with an overhead digital camera in grayscale mode .
Image - editing software converts the scan of the entire plate from negative to positive form .
The scan is inverted to represent the original physical orientation .
The entire plate is then reduced to 8 - bit grayscale mode .
Under magnification , the quality of each image on the plate is reviewed for contrast , degree of color separation , extent of damage to the emulsion , and any other details that might affect the final color composite .
The scan of the entire plate is aligned and the outside edges are cropped .
An electronic file is created for each image from the cropped tri-part plate forming three separate “ layers ” from which the final color composite will be generated .
The layers are labeled by color .
While still in grayscale mode , the red( R ) , blue ( B ) , and green ( G ) layers are aligned forming the “ RGB ” color composite .
This registration process is the most difficult step .
The RGB ( Red , Green , Blue ) color composite is cropped to eliminate all but the photographic area shared in common by all three layers .
The cropped color composite is adjusted overall to create the proper contrast , appropriate highlight and shadow detail , and optimal color balance .
Final adjustments may be applied to specific , localized areas of the composite color image to minimize defects associated with over or underexposure , development , or aging of the emulsion of Prokudin - Gorskii ’s original glass plate .
A Satellite Dish Gazebo
( Or : Recycling Redneck Refuse as Lawn Decoration )
My ex-wife and I became the proud owners of an 1820 's farm - house in November , 2003 , and completely renovated it from the frame up during 2003 - 2005 .
When we bought the place , the former owners left behind tons ( literally ) of junk that we had to break up , haul out , blow up , or throw away - including things like : a Mazda RX - 7 less motor , a coal - furnace , 2 chicken coops , a pallet - load of broken bricks , a Chevy Cavalier less transmission , large tangles of barbed wire , etc .
One of the more unattractive things they left us was a 1980 's - vintage satellite dish ( AKA " BUD " or " Big Ugly Dish " ) that was partially buried in foliage behind a row of trees in the front of the house .
( BUD in his penultimate resting - place - it 's bigger than it looks )
In August , my buddy Andrew Molitor came up to visit for a couple of days and , as is the tradition , we put our guests to work doing weird projects .
Nobody quite recalls how this one came about , but we were talking about hauling a load of junk to the dump when we remembered the satellite dish and suggested it might be a fun project to smash it up with the tractor and haul the remains to the dump .
As we went back to investigate the situation , someone said , " it looks like the roof of some kind of structure " and someone else said , " hey , we could make a gazebo out of it ! "
Thus began " project gazebo "
Dissection
Taking the dish apart proved to be harder than it looked .
The mounting ring at the base was a 50 - lb rusted steel thing with large bolts that mounted it to a counter - weighted central receiver .
The bolts , and everything else not made of aluminum , were too rusty to turn , in spite of two big guys with pipe wrenches yanking on them .
( RrrrrrrrrrrZoooooOWWW ! )
Fortunately , angle grinders were invented just for the purpose of obliterating rusty stuff .
The aluminum expanded mesh that made up the panels of the antenna were easier to remove : we simply whacked them with a crowbar until they tore , then pulled them off .
Disassembling everything until there was only the aluminum dish - struts took about a half hour , including time spent running back and forth getting tools .
When you live on a farm , one of the things you learn is : projects absorb tools .
By the time you 're done , you 'll hop into your truck 2 or 3 times , bump your way across the " yard " to one barn or another , and come back with one tool - just in time to remember that you forgot the wrench , or socket set , or whatever , and do it all over again in 15 minutes .
By the end of a day doing projects you 'll find yourself sitting in the middle of a circle of tools , extension cords , and vehicles .
It 's a lot of fun , until you have to put everything away .
( Bessie , with post - hole digger , and the uprights in rough position )
We decided to mount the " roof " on 6 uprights consisting of pressure - treated 4x4 lumber sunk into concrete footings .
The concrete is strictly necessary , since frost - heave will pull a post out of the ground about 8 " in a single winter .
Considering the amount of work the whole project was going to involve , it seemed silly to " save " the effort of mixing a couple bags of concrete by building something that was going to look like The Leaning Gazebo of Pizza if we did n't get the footings right .
6 holes courtesy of Bessie
Digging footings in solid rocky ground is an amazing pain in the neck .
We actually started digging with a clam - shell post - hole digger and got about 4 " deep before we decided to break out heavy weaponry .
Andrew 's a really smart guy ( a mathematician ) and calculated pretty quickly that at the rate we were digging it would take us ~3 days to dig all 6 holes two feet deep .
So we invested 20 minutes unhooking the bush - hog from our lawn - mower Bessie ( a diesel Belarus 572 tractor / front - end - loader ) and connecting my post - hole digger and a 5 " auger .
6 holes were installed 2 feet deep in about 15 minutes .
Based on Andrew 's earlier calculation of ~ 3 days to dig the holes by hand , we were now officially " ahead of schedule " so we took a break for lunch .
( Andrew Molitor with hose - level , standing on his " improvised altitude enhancing device " )
Since nothing is flat , or level , or clean on a farm , we did n't have the luxury of just assuming the posts would all be the same height .
We measured each post to a standard height by filling a length of clear plastic tubing with water and using it as a level .
This turned out to be a fun game , because if one side of the hose - level was raised quickly , it would overflow onto the head of the person holding the other end .
Getting it Just Right
Eventually we decided to cut the 4x4s off at a height of exactly " whatever " and marked each one at that height .
Then we took them out , cut them with a chainsaw , and spent a while figuring out which 4x4 went into which hole because we had forgotten to mark them when we pulled them out .
Fortunately , we were still ahead of schedule , so this minor reversal of fortune did n't affect our project timeline significantly .
( Rough - balancing the roof )
We used nails and wire to mount the dome atop the posts and levelled each post individually with a spirit level and struts hammered into the ground .
We used Bessie 's front bucket to haul and mix 2 bags of concrete , which we shovelled into the holes to complete the footings and keep them level .
A Minor Boo-boo
If you look at the picture above , you can see the beginnings of our " big mistake " in the design of the gazebo .
Since we had decided on 6 supporting beams ( 4 would have looked too spindly , 8 would have cost $ 20 more ) we positioned them based on the locations of the ribs in the satellite dish .
So far , it looks OK but we did n't really think about how it would look once we did something with the sides of the gazebo .
We wanted to have enough space to walk through it , and have beams close enough to grow climbing roses on , but I think the overall effect of 6 beams makes the gazebo look a bit lopsided .
We should have used 8 or 4 ; the human eye seems to be more comfortable with multiples of 2 than multiples of 3 .
We then painted the dish a nice rustoleum shade of brown .
Later , Andrew and I pondered the rest of our supplies : vinyl lattice , stainless steel decking screws , stainless steel wire , and lattice channels .
We decided to mount vertical curved lattices on the closer pairs of beams , with a curved lattice across the top of the farther pairs .
Our reasoning was something along the lines of " let 's use this stuff up ! " and that was the optimal solution that used the most lattice with the least cutting .
The lattice channels were screwed onto the beams and curved by hand , then the lattices were cut and fit into the channels , wired to the channel top and bottom , and screwed onto the beams at the sides .
( Final view with Miles The Dog in background and hippy - dippy windchimes in center )
For the top of the dome , I had constructed a pressure - treated plywood block that glued into the base of a vinyl porch - railing finial .
To attach it , I glued a bolt onto the back of the plywood , then filled the whole thing with urethane foam to hold it together .
Once it had cured , I mounted it with a stainless steel eye - bolt through the bottom of the dish - my plan was to hang something ( we had not decided what ) from the bottom of the eye - bolt .
Done !
This photo was taken from an angle to show the gazebo at its worst perspective - you can see it looks a bit lopsided ( it is n't ) because of the 3 - legged effect achieved by latticing the pairs of legs together .
We think that once we 've planted some climbing roses on the whole thing , it will break up the lines and make it look a bit better .
The hippy - dippy windchimes in the center of the gazebo are a project from a few weeks later .
We thought that windchimes would be very cool to have in the gazebo , but were appalled at the price of the larger chime - sets .
My reaction was " $ 1000 for a bunch of aluminum tubes ?
That 's nuts ! "
Of course I happened to have a bunch of aluminum tubes lying around and miter - sawed them to carefully calculated lengths based on the phase of the moon , the number of lines of code in the Linux kernel , and the zodiac ( i.e. : " whatever " ) then suspended them on nylon cords below a piece of pressure - treated plywood .
My windchimes sound just about as good as the typical dope - inspired new - age products but cost about $ 15 to make .
There are a few things I 'd do differently if I had to do this over again .
Instead of making the supports in units of 3 , I 'd make them in units of 4 .
Because of the size of the " dome " there are some angles ( as seen in the photo above ) where it looks a bit weird .
But from other angles it looks pretty nice .
It looks extremely bare right now , but we made the thing out of weather proof materials because we 're planting climbing roses on the side panels in the spring .
Once the roses grow up , we have some river bed - stones to complete the " floor " with and the whole thing should look a lot less stark and barren than it does right now .
Landscaping 250 acres is n't something you do in a hurry , it turns out .
In fact , most of our friends look at us funny when we explain that we use a back - hoe to dig our flower beds .
I 'll update this page with pictures in a few years when the roses are blooming .
Das am 10 .
März von McAfee ausgelieferte Signatur - Update 4715 führte bei diversen legitimen Dateien zu einem Fehlalarm .
Je nach Konfiguration verschiebt der Virenscanner die vermeintlich infizierten Objekte in ein Quarantäne - Verzeichnis oder löscht diese sogar vollständig .
In der vollständigen Liste der fälschlich als Virus W95 / CTX erkannten Dateien befinden sich unter anderem die Windows - Systemdateien usersid.exe und imjpinst.exe , die Microsoft - Office - Dateien excel.exe und graph.exe sowie diverse Dateien aus Java - Installationen , der Google - Toolbar , dem Macromedia - Flash - Player und dem Adobe - Update - Manager .
Über das Ausmaß der Schäden durch die gelöschten Dateien ist bisher nichts bekannt .
Der Redaktion liegen jedoch Hinweise vor , dass in einem Fall Oracle - und ERP - Installationen nach einem Scanner - Durchlauf mit der fehlerhaften Signatur vollständig unbrauchbar wurden .
Laut Hersteller sind alle Anwender des On - Demand - Scanners von McAfee VirusScan , die das Signatur - Update 4715 eingespielt haben , potenziell von dem Problem betroffen .
Bei ausschließlicher Verwendung des On - Access - Scanners , der Dateien schon vor einem Zugriff überprüft , tritt der Fehler nach Angaben von McAfee jedoch nicht zu Tage .
VirusScan Online erkannte W95 / CTX in harmlosen Dateien für einen kurzen Zeitraum am 10 .
März ebenfalls .
Das am selben Tag herausgegebene Signatur - Update 4716 behebt den Fehlalarm in allen Produkten .
Ein offenbar durch den McAfee - Support angekündigtes Tool zur Behebung der entstandenen Schäden wurde bislang noch nicht bereitgestellt .
Der Hersteller empfiehlt betroffenen Anwendern , gelöschte Systemdateien durch eine Systemwiederherstellung von Windows zurückzuspielen .
Dies ist natürlich nur ratsam , wenn der jüngste Wiederherstellungszeitpunkt erst vor Kurzem angefertigt wurde .
Sofern die Dateien lediglich in Quarantäne verschoben wurden , können Sie diese an ihren ursprünglichen Ort zurück verschieben .
Klicken
Sie dazu mit der rechten Maustaste auf das McAfee - Icon im System - Tray am unteren rechten Bildschirmrand und wählen Sie unter " VirusScan " den Menüpunkt " Dateien unter Quarantäne verwalten " .
Haken
Sie dort die Dateien mit dem Status " Infiziert von Virus W95 / CTX " ab und bestätigen Sie mit " Wiederherst . "
Update :
Die Wiederherstellung funktioniert offenbar nicht mit allen Produkten der VirusScan - Serie , insbesondere nicht bei mit dem ePolicy Orchestrator ( ePO ) zentral verwalteten Installationen .
Zwischenzeitlich hat McAfee jedoch auch das angekündigte
Tool namens CTXundo bereitgestellt , das unabhängig von dieser Funktion die unter Quarantäne gestellten Dateien wieder herstellt . ( cr )
Miller has spent almost three months in jail
Miller was freed after a source said she could discuss their conversations and she is now expected to appear on Friday morning before a grand jury .
The case concerns the unmasking of a CIA agent , Valerie Plame , in 2003 .
Ms Plame 's husband was a former diplomat who had criticised President Bush over Iraq , and it was alleged a White House source leaked her name .
The disclosure of a CIA agent 's name can be a federal offence .
Joseph Wilson , Ms Plame 's husband , had earlier attacked President George W Bush over evidence he had presented to justify the assault on Iraq .
Mr Wilson later alleged that his wife 's name was deliberately leaked in revenge .
Waiver offer
Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald wanted to jail both Miller and another reporter , Matthew Cooper of Time magazine .
But in early July Cooper changed his mind , and agreed to testify .
Miller refused to do so , and was jailed .
She has spent 86 days behind bars .
The New York Times says that Miller has now received permission from a source to testify about her conversations with him .
" My source has now voluntarily and personally released me from my promise of confidentiality regarding our conversations , " said Miller in a statement .
The " direct and uncoerced " waiver was offered " voluntarily and personally " , the newspaper reported .
US Constitution
The New York Times says that source is I Lewis " Scooter " Libby , who is chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney .
Miller and Libby met and talked by telephone in July 2003 , the paper says .
The leak of Ms Plame 's name was not made to Cooper or Miller , but they came to the attention of the prosecutor because of their inquiries .
The grand jury probe has focused particularly on the week in which Miller had conversations with her White House source .
In July , Miller and Cooper had refused to co-operate with the investigation , claiming they should not have to reveal their sources because of press freedoms guaranteed in the US Constitution .
That defence was over - ruled by a court in Washington .
CAIRO , Egypt —
In a closely watched case that has become the focus of a national debate on religious freedom , Egypt 's Supreme Administrative Court today ruled against the right of Baha 'is to be properly identified on government documents .
The decision upholds current government policy , a policy which forces the Baha 'is either to lie about their religious beliefs or give up their state identification cards .
The policy effectively deprives Egyptian Baha 'is of access to most rights of citizenship , including education , financial services , and even medical care .
" We deplore the Court 's ruling in this case , which violates an extensive body of international law on human rights and religious freedom to which Egypt has long been a party , " said Bani Dugal , the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations .
" Since this was the last avenue of appeal in this particular case , the Court 's decision threatens to make non-citizens of an entire religious community , solely on the basis of religious belief , " said Ms. Dugal .
" Our hope now is that the public debate over this issue will cause the Egyptian government to rectify its discriminatory policies , " said Ms. Dugal .
" This could be accomplished either by allowing Baha 'is to be listed on government documents , by abolishing the religious affiliation listing entirely or , simply , by allowing the word ' other ' to be legally included on state identification forms . "
The case stems from a lawsuit filed against the government by a married couple , Husam Izzat Musa and Ranya Enayat Rushdy , who had their identification cards and passports confiscated after they applied to have their daughters added to their passports , which listed the Baha'i Faith as their religion .
In Egypt , all citizens must list their religious affiliation on state ID cards and other documents , and current policy requires that they choose from one of the three officially recognized religions - Islam , Christianity or Judaism .
In April , a lower administrative court ruled in favor of the couple , saying the state must issue them ID cards that properly identified their religion .
The ruling said that even if the government did not recognize the Baha'i Faith , adherents should still have their religious status properly stated on official documents .
That ruling provoked an outcry among extremist elements in Egyptian society , who objected to any official mention of a religion other than the three mentioned in the Qur'an , opening a vigorous debate over issues of religious freedom and tolerance here .
Since April , more than 400 articles , stories , commentaries and programs have appeared in the Egyptian and Arabic news media about the case or its fallout .
As well , independent human rights organizations here and abroad have closely followed the issue .
In May , the government appealed the lower court 's ruling , which brought the case before the Supreme Administrative Court .
On 2 December , a final hearing was held on the case , at which Bahai lawyers argued for rejection of the government 's appeal , on the basis that the lower court 's ruling is fully supported by Egyptian law .
The Court said at that time that it would release its final ruling today .

SVG Authoring Guidelines
This document was originally written in 2005 and last updated in 2007 .
A Belorussian translation is also available .
There are a lot of mistakes in the SVG documents currently found on the Web .
Because Adobe 's SVG Viewer ignores many of these errors , the maintainers of these documents usually do n't realise when they 're doing something wrong .
Unfortunately , the result is that far too often SVG on the Web does n't work in Mozilla , Batik or one of the other SVG implementations .
It is important that these problems are addressed as soon as possible to prevent them from propagating into authoring tools and the SVG documents that people will write in the future .
This document highlights some of the most common mistakes made in SVG content , and explains what SVG maintainers can do to fix them .
The hope is that the SVG community will read this document , and that individual members of the community will do what they can to make sure that SVG on the Web is as portable as possible .
Please spread the word .
If you see others making any of the mistakes described here , please let them know so that they can correct them .
Even more important , if you know of SVG authoring tools that make these mistakes please contact the vendor and let me know .

Contents
Configure your server for SVG
This is n't really an issue with SVG content itself , but nevertheless , server misconfiguration is a very common reason for SVG failing to load .
For security and correctness reasons , some browsers decides how to handle files by looking at the HTTP headers the server sends with them .
If your server is n't configured to send the correct headers with the SVG files it serves , then a browser like Mozilla wo n't treat those files as SVG .
Instead it will most likely show the markup of the files as text or encoded garbage , or even ask the viewer to choose an application to open them .
For normal SVG files , servers should send the HTTP header :
Content - Type : image / svg+xml
For gzipped SVG files , servers should send the HTTP headers :
Content - Type : image / svg+xml Content - Encoding : gzip
You can check that your server is sending the correct HTTP headers with your SVG files by using a site such as web - sniffer .
net .
Submit the URL of one of your SVG files and look at the HTTP response headers .
If you find that your server is not sending the headers with the values given above , then you should contact your Web host .
If you have problems convincing them to correctly configure their servers for SVG , there may be ways to do it yourself .
See the server configuration page on the SVG wiki for a range of simple solutions .
Do n't include a DOCTYPE declaration
XML Document Type Definitions , or DTDs for short , are a feature of XML used to validate the contents of a document .
A DTD is associated with a document by placing a DOCTYPE declaration in the document .
The following line is an example of an SVG DOCTYPE declaration .
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN " " http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd " >
Unfortunately the SVG DTDs are a source of so many issues that the SVG WG has decided not to write one for the upcoming SVG 1.2 standard .
In fact SVG WG members are even telling people not to use a DOCTYPE declaration in SVG 1.0 and 1.1 documents .
Instead always include the ' version ' and ' baseProfile ' attributes on the root < svg > tag , and assign them appropriate values as in the following example .
< svg version = " 1.1 " baseProfile = " full " xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/2000/svg " xmlns: xlink = " http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink " xmlns:ev= " http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events " >
If for some reason you want to use the inline features of DOCTYPE declarations ( to create entities , etc. ) , simply omit the public and system identifiers .
Your DOCTYPE declaration should then look like this .
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!-- entities etc. here --> ]>
Bind the required namespaces
SVG is a namespaced XML dialect , and as a consequence all the XML dialects used in your SVG documents must be bound to their namespace as specified in the Namespaces in XML recommendation .
It is sensible to bind the SVG and XLink namespaces at a minimum , and possibly also the XML Events namespace .
Even if you do n't use XLink or XML Events in the current incarnations of some of your SVG documents , including the bindings will prevent annoying errors if you decide to use them later and forget to add the bindings .
This simply requires you to include the following three attributes on the root < svg > tag in your SVG documents .
< svg xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/2000/svg " xmlns: xlink = " http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink " xmlns:ev= " http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events " >
Be careful not to type xmlns : svg instead of just xmlns when you bind the SVG namespace .
This is an easy mistake to make , but one that can break everything .
Instead of making SVG the default namespace , it binds it to the namespace prefix ' svg ' , and this is almost certainly not what you want to do in an SVG file .
A standards compliant browser will then fail to recognise any tags and attributes that do n't have an explicit namespace prefix ( probably most if not all of them ) and fail to render your document as SVG .
Avoid the ' style ' attribute where possible
It is quite common to see the style attribute used to specify properties in SVG .
For example , you may see source code that specifies the fill and stroke properties as follows :
< circle style = " fill : red ; stroke : blue ; " ... />
Usually this is simply gratuitous use of the style attribute , and something that should be avoided .
Contrary to popular belief the style attribute ( note , that 's attribute , not element ) does n't separate content from presentation , and unless you need to override properties set by a CSS selector , it is best to use the SVG formatting attributes instead .
In other words it would be better to rewrite the previous code snippet as :
< circle fill = " red " stroke = " blue " ... />
Using the formatting attributes avoids the pitfalls that can be encountered when using CSS in SVG ( see the following section , for example ) and is generally considered to be better style .
Unlike CSS and the style attribute , the formatting attributes are also supported in SVG Tiny , if that matters to you .
Unfortunately many SVG authoring tools and human authors still make unnecessary use of the style attribute .
Specify units when assigning lengths to properties
SVG uses styling properties to describe many of its document parameters such as fill and stroke - width .
These properties can be set by CSS declarations or by presentation attributes ( XML attributes that share the same name as the property and map to their corresponding CSS properties if the implementation supports CSS ) .
For example , the display property is set on a circle by both :
< circle style = " display : none ; " ...>
and :
< circle display = " none " ...>
For most properties there should be few interoperability problems , but frustratingly when properties are assigned a length the visual result can be completely different in the various SVG implementations .
The problem arises because the SVG specification allows units to be omitted from lengths ( in which case the lengths ' units are the units of the current coordinate system ( user units ) ) , while on the other hand the CSS specification absolutely requires units to be explicity specified for all length values .
The question is , are units required for lengths assigned to properties in SVG or not ?
Which specification takes precedence ?
Unfortunately , this issue is a lot more complex than it first seems , and the answers to these questions are still disputed .
The result is that implementations do n't agree .
Some require units , while others do n't .
The only way to avoid problems is to always specify a unit when assigning lengths to properties .
Happily , in SVG , px units are defined to be equivalent to the units established by the current coordinate system ( user units ) .
In other words , wherever you would otherwise have omitted the unit from a length assigned to a property , use the px unit instead .
For example , instead of writing :
< text stroke - width= " 2 " style = " font - size: 20 ; " ...>
write :
< text stroke - width = " 2 px " style = " font - size :20 px ; " ...>
Note that units are only required for properties .
Plain attributes such as the width or height attributes on the < rect > tag do not require a unit since they do not map to a CSS property .
They can simply be assigned a number and it implicitly has the units of the current coordinate system .
According to the SVG 1.1 Property Index , there are only eight properties applicable to SVG 1.1 that accept a length value : stroke - width , stroke - dashoffset , font , font - size , baseline - shift , kerning , letter - spacing and word - spacing .
It is these properties that you should be careful to always specify a length for .
Use namespace aware DOM methods
The DOM Level 1 recommendation was created before the original Namespaces in XML recommendation was released , therefore DOM1 is n't namespace aware .
This causes problems for namespaced XML such as SVG .
To resolve these problems , DOM Level 2 Core added namespace aware equivalents of all the applicable DOM Level 1 methods .
When scripting SVG it is important to use the namespace aware methods .
The table below lists the DOM1 methods that should n't be used in SVG along with their equivalent DOM2 counterparts that should be used instead .
The first argument for all the DOM2 namespace aware methods must be the " namespace name " of the element or attribute in question .
For SVG elements this is ' http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'.
However , note carefully : the Namespaces in XML 1.1 recommendation states that the namespace name for attributes without a prefix does not have a value .
In other words you must use null as the namespace name for SVG attributes .
As a result , to create an SVG ' rect ' element using createElementNS you must write :
createElementNS ( ' http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', ' rect ' ) ;
However , to retrieve the value of the ' x ' attribute on an SVG ' rect ' element you must write :
getAttributeNS ( null , 'x ' ) ;
Note that this is not the case for attributes from other ( non - SVG ) namespaces such as the xlink : href attribute which use a namespace prefix .
Since it has a namespace prefix in the markup ( " xlink " ) it 's namespace name is the value that was assigned to that prefix , ' http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink'.
Hence to get the value of the xlink : href attribute of an ' a ' element in SVG you would write :
getAttributeNS ( ' http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink', ' href ' ) ;
In summary the rule is simple .
For elements with or without a namespace prefix , and for attributes with a namespace prefix , the namespace name is the namespace URI of the element / attribute in question .
For attributes without a namespace prefix the namespace name is null .
Do n't use Adobe 's getter and setter extensions
Long , long ago when Adobe first released their SVG viewer plug - in , Netscape 4 still had enough users that it was important to be compatible with it .
To do this it seems it was necessary to extend the ECMAScript interfaces and provide corresponding getters and setters for all the properties defined by the specification .
As a result in ASV it is possible to write code like this :
evt.getTarget().getOwnerDocument().getDocumentElement ( ) ;
when the DOM and SVG specifications actually define properties , not methods , so the correct way to write this code is :
evt.target.ownerDocument.documentElement ;
The problem is that no one else supports ASV 's getter and setter extensions .
Scripts that uses them will not work in other SVG implementations .
Happily Netscape 4 is now irrelevant for most of us , and since ASV supports the properties too , new SVG scripts can conform to the standards and work in all SVG implementations by using the properties .
( In fact old code could , and should , be updated too . )
It is difficult to give a list of what is and is n't an ASV extension since there are so many properties .
If you are n't familiar enough with the specifications to know which getters and setters are defined by the W3C and which are ASV extensions , be sure to test your scripts using another SVG implementation such as Mozilla Firefox or Batik .
If you get errors relating to getters or setters try using properties instead and see if that fixes things .
You can also search for getter and setter names in the SVG , DOM2 Core , DOM2 Events and DOM2 Style IDL .
If you can't find them in any of those documents they probably are n't part of any W3C standard .
Research at the University of Liverpool has found that Shakespearean language excites positive brain activity , adding further drama to the bard 's plays and poetry .
Shakespeare uses a linguistic technique known as functional shift that involves , for example using a noun to serve as a verb .
Researchers found that this technique allows the brain to understand what a word means before it understands the function of the word within a sentence .
This process causes a sudden peak in brain activity and forces the brain to work backwards in order to fully understand what Shakespeare is trying to say .
Professor Philip Davis , from the University 's School of English , said : " The brain reacts to reading a phrase such as ‘ he godded me ' from the tragedy of Coriolanus , in a similar way to putting a jigsaw puzzle together .
If it is easy to see which pieces slot together you become bored of the game , but if the pieces do n't appear to fit , when we know they should , the brain becomes excited .
By throwing odd words into seemingly normal sentences , Shakespeare surprises the brain and catches it off guard in a manner that produces a sudden burst of activity - a sense of drama created out of the simplest of things . "
The effect of functional shift on the brain .

Experts believe that this heightened brain activity may be one of the reasons why Shakespeare 's plays have such a dramatic impact on their readers .
Professor Neil Roberts , from the University 's Magnetic Resonance and Image Analysis Research Centre , ( MARIARC ) , explains : " The effect on the brain is a bit like a magic trick ; we know what the trick means but not how it happened .
Instead of being confused by this in a negative sense , the brain is positively excited .
The brain signature is relatively uneventful when we understand the meaning of a word but when the word changes the grammar of the whole sentence , brain readings suddenly peak .
The brain is then forced to retrace its thinking process in order to understand what it is supposed to make of this unusual word . "
Professor Roberts and Professor Davis together with Dr Guillaune Thierry , from the University of Wales , Bangor , monitored 20 participants using an electroencephalogram ( EEG ) as they read selected lines from Shakespeare 's plays .
In this initial test electrodes were placed on the subject 's scalp to measure brain responses .
Professor Roberts said : " EEG gives graph - like measurements and when the brain reads a sentence that does not make semantic sense it registers what we call a N400 effect – a negative wave modulation .
When the brain reads a grammatically incorrect sentence it registers a P600 effect – an effect which continues to last after the word that triggered it was first read . "
Researchers also found that when participants read the word producing the functional shift there was no N400 effect indicating that the meaning was accepted but a P600 effect was observed which indicates a positive re-evaluation of the word .
The team is now using magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( FMI ) to test which areas of the brain are most affected and the kind of impact it could have in maintaining healthy brain activity .
Professor Davis added : " This interdisciplinary work is good for brain science because it offers permanent scripts of the human mind working moment - to - moment .
It is good for literature as it illustrates primary human thinking .
Through the two disciplines , we may discover new insights into the very motions of the mind . "

With news of business deals surrounding the Wired brand recently , I went back to have a look at Hotwired only to find it had been completely replaced with some sort of huckster search engine .
I started working at Wired Magazine back in 1994 .
I actually arrived to manage Wired ’s AOL presence , but that was quickly scrapped in favor of a Web site .
Hotwired was one of the Web ’s first commercial sites , and we went through many iterations as new browser technologies emerged .
We learned so much in such a short amount of time .
I dug into my archives and found all the home page interfaces I worked on back then .
Here ’s a little trip through the history of those redesigns .
1994 - The first interface , which we launched in October of that year .
This was before even Netscape had launched , so we were developing for Mosaic and a handful of browsers that I can’t even remember now .
There was a big debate over whether we would require browsers that supported forms ( we decided to eventually ) .
I particularly like how we incorporated some of the browser behavior into this interface .
For example , we built this as a single image map , and images that were links showed up with a bright blue 2pt border .
Since we control that , we embraced it , adding a large matching border to the image , skewing it , and overlapping the icons a bit .
This was an early example of our design philosophy of engaging constraint rather than fighting it .
Early 1995 - We added a site map to the bottom and streamlined the image for performance issues .
The blurbs at the top point directly to new content items .
Tables were n’t invented yet , so we pre-formatted the text and counted out the spaces between lines to approximate columns .
Late 1995 - Background colors !
Even though it was a proprietary Netscape hack , we started using bgcolor .
The text blurbs that had been at the top of the page moved down to be the focus of the page as images , causing editors responsible for sections to start battling each other .
The site map moved under a link called “ Overview ” and the “ What ’s new ” page had reverse chronological listings of content – something now called a “ blog . ”
1996 - Tables !
Even back then , there was a strong debate about using tables for layout .
We all understood the SGML origins of HTML as a semantic language , but the benefits to design outweighed purist argument .
The real nasty fighting happened over putting ads on the home page ( the Saturn and pager banners at the bottom .
“ We would n’t put ads on the cover of the magazine , why would we put them here ? ”
“ But why would we want to drive traffic away from the site before they even enter ? ”
Good arguments to this day , frankly .
1997 - Frames !
Ads on the home page were successful , so they were made stationary when the page scrolled .
This front page content was written fresh every day to spotlight new content within the site .
This was before RSS , of course , but really served the same purpose .
I used to enjoy reading this every morning when I came in the office .
I also still really like those icons stacked up on the left , too .
Later , you could click a control that would “ detach ” that nav bar and leave it floating in a resized pop -up window using something called “ Javascript ” .
1998 - DHTML !
This was a home page built for the Internet Explorer 4.0 beta .
The items on the page floated around slowly and the background image would change over time .
This was during the big PointCast craze , when everyone thought screensavers would become the new browsers .
We had content constantly moving on and off the screen , evolving over time if you left it open .
The concept and execution was really cool , but it was frustrating to actually use .
I remember chasing after links with my mouse , try to click through to a story .
1999 - Corporate Parents .
This was the last update to the Hotwired home page , as we integrated into the Lycos network and became much more focused on business metrics and pageviews .
Realistic , but disappointing .
This page lasted for years as Hotwired fell into neglect and Lycos chased after whatever new traffic - driving trend came along .
Both Webmonkey and Wired News continued on with strong content , but Hotwired as the hub of the network slowly faded away .
2006 - Sold by whatever international holding company now owns the property .
Hotwired appears to have become a paid - click advertising vehicle leveraging whatever remnant traffic remains .
An ignominious end , indeed .
I suppose it ’s easy to be nostalgic for those times - and a little sad at the eventual outcome .
I ’d hoped that Hotwired would someday have a legacy to match the effort and passion that we all put into it , rather than become a liquid asset for a marketing - driven clearinghouse like Lycos .
Thankfully , the folks over at the Internet Archive understand something of the importance of where we ’ve been ; the Hotwired archives can be browsed there .
But nostalgia is dangerous .
It ’s easy to look fondly back on the good old days while ignoring just how hard all that was .
It was a time when we could n’t fall back on experience to guide us , or much of an industry for support , or a business model , really .
But it ’s also a foundation for helping avoid the same mistakes again .
As we hurtle through Web 2.0 , it ’s helpful to remember what it was like when everything was in beta . ​
Social bookmarking site del.icio.us has exposed a new API providing the top tags and total number of bookmarks for any URL in its system .
Yahoo ’s Developer Network provided a short preview earlier tonight of a soon to be released del.icio.us web badge but currently anyone can request data from the open API .
It ’s a useful feature to provide additional context for a URL , suggest tags , or measure one aspect of a site ’s popularity .
endpoint http://badges.del.icio.us/feeds/json/url/blogbadge parameter hash
Simply submit a request to the above API endpoint with a hex MD5 hash of the URL of interest as your hash parameter value .
Del.icio.us returns results in JSON key - value pairs .
Data includes the total number of del.icio.us users who have tagged the given URL and the top 11 tags ( and tag count ) used to describe its content .
You can check out a few examples such as the response for del.icio.us , the response for apple.com , or the response for niallkennedy.com / blog .
If you need help constructing a MD5 hash you can use Paul Johnson ’s implementation ( del.icio.us uses the same script ) .
You may specify a callback function using the callback parameter .
The API is officially unreleased , may be shut down if not used in full Yahoo - constructed blog sidebar badge form , and may be subject to further terms of service .
Hopefully the new set of del.icio.us servers can keep up with demand .
Do You Make These 10 Mistakes in a Conversation ?
Can you improve your conversation skills ?
Certainly .
It might take a while to change the conversation habits that 's been ingrained throughout your life , but it is very possible .
To not make this article longer than necessary let 's just skip right to some common mistakes many of us have made in conversations and a couple of solutions .
And if you want more in - depth training then join us in my 12 - week , step - by - step Smart Social Skills Course where I share the very best things I have learned in the past 8 years about improving social skills and relationship habits .
1 . Not listening .
Ernest Hemingway once said :
“ I like to listen .
I have learned a great deal from listening carefully .
Most people never listen . ”
Do n't be like most people .
Do n't just wait eagerly for your turn to talk .
Put your own ego on hold .
Stop being lazy in a conversation and learn to really listen to what people actually are saying .
When you start to really listen , you 'll pick up on loads of potential paths in the conversation .
But avoid yes or no type of questions as they will not give you much information .
If someone mentions that they went fishing with a couple of friends last weekend you can for instance ask :
Where did you go fishing ?
What do you like most about fishing ?
What did you do there besides fishing ?
The person will delve deeper into the subject giving you more information to work with and more paths for you choose from .
If they say something like : “ Oh , I do n't know ” at first , do n't give up .
Prod a little further .
Ask again .
They do know , they just have to think about a bit more .
And as they start to open up the conversation becomes more interesting because it 's not on auto - pilot anymore .
2 . Asking too many questions .
If you ask too many questions the conversation can feel like a bit of an interrogation .
Or like you do n't have that much too contribute .
One alternative is to mix questions with statements .
Continuing the conversation above you could skip the question and say :
“ Yeah , it 's great to just get out with your friends and relax over the weekend .
We like to take a six - pack out to the park and play some Frisbee golf . ”
Or you can say :
“ Nice .
We went out in my friend 's boat last month and I tried these new lures from Sakamura .
The blue ones were really great . ”
And then the conversation can flow on from there .
And you can discuss Frisbee golf , the advantages / disadvantages of different lures or your favourite beer .
3. Tightening up .
When in conversation with someone you just meet or when the usual few topics are exhausted an awkward silence or mood might appear .
Or you might just become nervous or worried not knowing exactly why .
Here ’s three things you can do in such a situation :
Be on top of what ’s happening out there .
Leil Lowndes once said : “ Never leave home without reading the newspaper ” .
If you 're running out of things to say , you can always start talking about the current news .
It 's also good to stay updated on current water cooler - topics .
Like what happened on the latest episode of Lost .
Use your surroundings .
Comment on the aquarium at the party , or that one girl 's cool Halloween - costume or the host 's mp3-playlist .
You can always start new conversations about something in your surroundings .
Assume rapport .
If you feel nervous or weird when meeting someone for the first time assume rapport .
What that means is that you imagine how you feel when you meet one of your best friends .
And pretend that this new acquaintance is one of your best friends .
Do n't overdo it though , you might not want to hug and kiss right away .
But if you imagine this you 'll go into a positive emotional state .
And you 'll greet and start talking to this new person with a smile and a friendly and relaxed attitude .
Because that 's how you talk to your friends .
It might sound a bit loopy or too simple .
But it really works .
4 . Poor delivery .
One of the most important things in a conversation is not what you say , but how you say it .
A change in these habits can make a big difference since your voice and body language is a vital part of communication .
Some things to think about :
Slowing down .
When you get excited about something it 's easy to start talking faster and faster .
Try and slow down .
It will make it much easier for people to listen and for you actually get what you are saying across to them .

Speaking up .
Do n't be afraid to talk as loud as you need to for people to hear you .
Do n't be afraid to talk as loud as you need to for people to hear you .
Speaking clearly .
Do n't mumble .
Do n't mumble .
Speak with emotion .
No one listens for that long if you speak with a monotone voice .
Let your feelings be reflected in your voice .

Let your feelings be reflected in your voice .
Using pauses .
Slowing down your talking plus adding a small pause between thoughts or sentences creates a bit of tension and anticipation .

Learn a bit about improving your body language as it can make your delivery a lot more effective .
Read about laughter , posture and how to hold your drink in 18 ways to improve your body language .
5 . Hogging the spot - light .
I 've been guilty of this one on more occasions than I wish to remember . :)
Everyone involved in a conversation should get their time in the spotlight .
Do n't interrupt someone when they are telling some anecdote or their view on what you are discussing to divert the attention back to yourself .
Do n't hijack their story about skiing before it 's finished to share your best skiing - anecdote .
Find a balance between listening and talking .
6 . Having to be right .
Avoid arguing and having to being right about every topic .
Often a conversation is not really a discussion .
It 's a more of a way to keep a good mood going .
No one will be that impressed if you “ win ” every conversation .
Instead just sit back , relax and help keep the good feelings going .
7 . Talking about a weird or negative topic .
If you 're at a party or somewhere where you are just getting to know some people you might want to avoid some topics .
Talking about your bad health or relationships , your crappy job or boss , serial killers , technical lingo that only you and some other guy understands or anything that sucks the positive energy out of the conversation are topics to steer clear from .
You might also want to save religion , money and politics for conversations with your friends .
8. Being boring .
Do n't prattle on about your new car for 10 minutes oblivious to your surroundings .
Always be prepared to drop a subject when you start to bore people .
Or when everyone is getting bored and the topic is starting to run out of steam .
One good way to have something interesting to say is simply to lead an interesting life .
And to focus on the positive stuff .
Do n't start to whine about your boss or your job , people do n't want to hear that .
Instead , talk about your last trip somewhere , some funny anecdote that happened while you were buying clothes , your plans for New Year ’s Eve , your new blog or podcast project or something funny or exciting .
Another way is just to be genuinely interested .
As Dale Carnegie said :
“ You can make more friends in two months by becoming really interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you .
Which is just another way of saying that the way to make a friend is to be one . ”
Knowing a little about many things or at least being open to talk about them instead of trying to steer the conversation back to your favorite subject is a nice quality .
Meaning : talking for what seems like hours about one topic .
Topics may include work , favorite rock - band , TV - show and more work .
Opening up a bit and not clinging desperately to one topic will make the conversation feel more relaxed and open .
You will come across like a person who can talk about many things with ease .
As you 've probably experienced with other people ; this quality is something you appreciate in a conversation and makes you feel like you can connect to that person easily .
9 . Not reciprocating .
Open up and say what you think , share how you feel .
If someone shares an experience , open up too and share one of your experiences .
Do n't just stand there nodding and answer with short sentences .
If someone is investing in the conversation they 'd like you to invest too .
Like in so many areas in life , you can't always wait for the other party to make the first move .
When needed , be proactive and be the first one to open up and invest in the conversation .
One way is by replacing some questions with statements .
It makes you less passive and makes take a sort of stand .
10 .
Not contributing much .
You might feel that you do n't have much to contribute to a conversation .
But try anyway .
Really listen and be interested in what the others are saying .
Ask questions .
Make relating statements .
Open your eyes too .
Develop your observational skills to pick up interesting stuff in your surroundings to talk about .
Develop your personal knowledge - bank by expanding your view of interesting things in the world .
Read the newspapers and keep an eye on new water cooler - topics .
Work on your body language , how you talk and try assuming rapport to improve your communication skills .
But take it easy .
Do n't do it all at once .
You 'll just feel confused and overwhelmed and start to doubt yourself .
Instead , pick out the three most important things that you feel needs improving .
Work on them every day for 3 - 4 weeks .
Notice the difference and keep at it .
Soon your new habits will start to pop up spontaneously when you are in a conversation .
Russian guy Letchik Leha works as a pilot in one of air companies .
He sometimes makes photos right from pilot ’s cabin when he as a pilot flies with a crew .
I do n’t know is he allowed to do this or not , but here are some of his photos .
This is Moscow city at night and his landing on a heavy passenger airliner to one of Moscow airports – there are a few airports in Moscow which population is almost ten million people .
By the way the flights above the Moscow itself are prohibited by Russian law so all the airports are not inside the city itself but near Moscow and in order to make a landing pilot must make a right curve not to crossing air space of Moscow itself .
Moscow planning is made in form of giant circles – there are three bigger circles – wide roads around the city so that you could find a suitable exit for yourself when you drive thru Moscow .
Right in the middle of Moscow there is the Kremlin , the center of political power of the whole Russia .
Moscow is the only monster city in Russia where are all the Russian money circulate , there are not any other major cities in Russia – all the richest companies of Russia have their main offices in Moscow only .
Companies that drill for oil in far away Siberia have themself seated in Moscow and pay Moscow taxes .
It has been said that 90 % of Russian money are in Moscow and 90 % of those 90 % are inside that smallest circle – the closest to the Kremlin road circle .
So you have landed in airport of Moscow , it ’s really freezing outside and snowing .
Welcome to Russia .

The Magazine 's review of blogs
By Alan Connor
Complaints from religious campaigners have led to supermarkets withdrawing comedy DVDs from shelves .
Meet the bloggers who are raising merry hell .
" I believed that Sainsbury and other supermarkets followed the laws of supply and demand , rather than the demands of a small group of self - appointed guardians of morality . "
Peter Gasston
It started this weekend .
The stores are , so far , Sainsbury 's and Woolworths ; the campaigners , this time , are Christian ... and the name of the offending comedy ?
The opera features Springer facing Satan in Hell
When BBC
Two screened the show earlier this year , the atmosphere was fraught , with arguments over how many swear words were in the programme ( estimates ranged from 105 to a cheekier 1.7 billion ) , and reports of death threats against TV execs and an email campaign which opened with the line " The Sikhs have made a stand - but will Christians ? " - a reference to the Behzti riots .
All of which might help to explain why it only took 10 to 20 complaints to Sainsbury 's to yank the DVD from among the bleach and bangers .
' Bulldog Nation '
And it 's this big effect that a small number can have that 's both infuriating and inspiring the bloggers who want to get Jerry Springer : The Opera back in the shops .
Free -flowing information is much - valued in the blogosphere , and the anti-Springer campaigners have brought together in opposition pagans , secularists , one MP , some gay and lesbian humanists , lawyers and Gagwatch , the anti-censorship blog which has as its logo a picture of Theo Van Gogh , the Dutch film - maker murdered by Islamic fundamentalists a year ago .
STORES ' RESPONSE
Woolworths said it does not wish to act as censor but it was responding to " numerous complaints " by customers Sainsbury 's said it received 10 to 20 complaints which should be regarded in the context that it very rarely gets any complaints about DVDs
One such " concerned citizen " is Chicken Yoghurt :
" Remember those heady days after July 7 and the stoicism showed by this Bulldog Nation ( or whatever shorthand the papers coined for ease of consumption ) ?
I thought we were n't in the business of letting fundamentalists dictate how we live our lives and what we read and watch in our own homes , theatres , and cinemas .
I thought we were n't going to give in to threats and blackmail .
It would seem we are after all . "
So what have the bloggers got planned ?
The voice of the people ?
Well , one thing they 've noticed is how the internet can be a better spur to action around an event than the event itself .
84 % of the complaints to the BBC were before the programme had been shown ; likewise Janet Jackson 's nipple did n't prompt a single email complaint until the circular emails urging folk to " write the FCC " appeared in subsequent days .
They 're two of the more prominent examples of a trend described by Blithering Bunny as " protests from non -PC groups " .
WEBLOG WATCH Weblog Watch is the BBC News Magazine 's weekly review of blogs
And this is more or less the model that the pro-Springer bloggers are going for , too : letting the news of the decision bounce from political weblogs to free speech ones ; from personal sites to religious ones .
The chief - and familiar - tactic is a consumer boycott - the letters are going out to Sainsbury 's and Woolworths telling them they 'll be losing Christmas trade , and Tim Ireland of Bloggerheads has even CC:ed Father Christmas .
Will they make themselves heard ?
Weary of receiving standardised replies , they 're also plotting to buy shares in the relevant corporations so as to be able to raise merry hell at AGMs .
They 're also pledging to complain to store managers in person .
So , who will prevail in this unholy row ?
The anti-Springer campaigners may not be legion , but they 're not lacking in commitment .
Meanwhile , the bloggers have got the numbers , but blogging is a hobby , not a religion .
Not yet , anyway .
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites .
Schumacher gets island as present for his retirement
Michael Schumacher has received a unique gift after he drove his final Grand Prix at Interlagos this weekend .
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , Dubai 's crown prince decided to give Schumi a piece of the man-made island ' The World ' .
' The World ' is 300 islands clustered together in a nine kilometre zone to resemble Earth from an aerial photo .
Schumacher 's island , apparently part of ' Antarctica ' on the artificial globe , is worth $ 7 million .
Willi Weber confirmed : " In a couple of years it will be finished .
Then Michael and Corinna will have their own holiday island !

SAGINAW ( WJRT ) - ( 11/07/06 ) -- Saginaw 's City Council meeting featured a shocking incident Monday night .
A Saginaw Valley State University student was TASERed after he became unruly after being asked to take off his baseball cap .
There is a new rule at Saginaw City Council meetings .
Men are required to take their hats off .
Evidently , they are pretty serious about this new rule .
The man was wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers hat .
Officer Doug Stacer of the Saginaw Police Department asked him to remove the hat .
The man raised his voice and did not remove the hat .
As the officer tried to grab the hat and then tried to grab the man , the man with the hat tried to kick Saginaw Police Chief Gerald Cliff , who was coming to help out .
At that point , Stacer TASERed the man , which sends 50,000 volts into a person 's body .
Cliff and Stacer got help from Saginaw County Sheriff Charles Brown hauling the man off to jail .
A few people stood up and watched the event ; the meeting resumed a short time later .
The man faces possible charges of alarming and harassing conduct -- a misdemeanor -- and assaulting a police officer .
That 's a felony .
He was not arraigned Tuesday .
Student who was TASERed released from jail
SAGINAW ( WJRT ) - ( 11/09/06 ) -- A local college student is out of jail following a bizarre incident at a Saginaw City Council meeting .
The 22 year old refused to take off his baseball cap at the meeting and was TASERed by police .
The student 's legal trouble comes as a surprise to his college professor .
Charles Littleton was at the council meeting to get extra credit for his urban sociology class .
Now he faces three criminal charges , including assaulting a police officer .
Monday 's Saginaw City Council meeting was going smoothly until the rules of conduct inside City Hall chambers were read .
One of those rules is that men must remove their hats , something that Littleton did not do .
Saginaw Police Officer Doug Stacer asked Littleton to take off the hat , and when he did n't , Stacer tried to remove the hat himself .
That 's when police say Littleton swung at Stacer and tried to kick Chief Gerald Cliff .
Stacer TASERed Littleton , sending 50,000 volts into the man , who was then escorted out of chambers by Stacer , Cliff and Saginaw County Sheriff Charles Brown .
Cliff broke a finger during the scuffle .
Littleton was at the meeting to gain extra credit for Professor Dawn Hinton 's SVSU sociology class .
She is stunned by what happened .
" He is one of the brightest students in our department , " she said .
Hinton was also unaware that an arrest warrant was issued for Littleton in the Detroit area in an unrelated case .
" He comes to class , he 's on time , he sits in the front row , he raises his hand , he participates in conversation , he reads the material , he has relevant things to say , " she said .
Littleton missed Hinton 's sociology class Thursday morning , but despite his legal problems , he 's still in line for extra credit .
Littleton now has 10 days to appear for an arraignment at the Saginaw County Courthouse .
When does “ collateral damage ” so dwarf combatant deaths that war becomes genocide ?
Bush ’s illegal invasion of Iraq has cost 655,000 Iraqis their lives .
That is the conclusion of a study financed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s Center for International Studies and conducted by physicians under the direction of Johns Hopkins University epidemiologists .
These are deaths over and above the pre-invasion mortality rate .
Bush ’s illegal invasion raised Iraq ’s mortality rate from 5.5 deaths per 1,000 people per year to 13.3 deaths per 1,000 people per year .
The study is published by the distinguished British medical journal , The Lancet , and is available on the journal ’s Web site [ .pdf ] .
The study uses a scientific method known as “ cluster sampling . ”
In 87 percent of the deaths , the researchers requested death certificates , and more than 90 percent of the surveyed households produced the death certificates .
Violence accounted for 601,000 deaths , and disease and destruction of civilian infrastructure accounted for 54,000 deaths .
The violent deaths are attributed to gunshot wounds , coalition air strikes , and car bombs .
Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Gilbert Burnham says , “ We ’re very confident with the results . ”
Columbia University epidemiologist Ronald Waldman says the survey method used is “ tried and true ” and that “ this is the best estimate of mortality we have . ”
When asked about the report , President Bush stated , “ I do n’t consider it a credible report . ”
Bush , of course , is not reality - based , and he knows that any unfavorable news is “ enemy propaganda . ”
That ’s what the neocons who pull his strings tell him , and that is what he believes .
What percentage of these 655,000 deaths were insurgents or “ terrorists ” ?
Probably 1 percent and no more than 2 percent .
Bush ’s “ war on terror ” is , in fact , a war on Iraqi civilians .
Bush ’s invasion has also spawned sectarian conflict or civil war , although the Bush regime denies it .
Even Bush is smart enough to know that “ bringing freedom and democracy to Iraq ” is not compatible with setting off a civil war in Iraq .
Since Bush the faith - based believes that he is bringing “ freedom and democracy to Iraq , ” he cannot accept the fact that he has started a civil war .
Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians are not the only innocent victims of Bush ’s illegal aggression .
The New York Times ( Oct. 11 ) reports that Department of Veterans Affairs documents show that about one in five U.S. soldiers who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan have suffered at least partial disability .
To date , more than 100,000 U.S. troops who are veterans of these wars have been granted disability compensation .
Although the U.S. can not put on the ground in Iraq more than 150,000 troops at one time , 1.5 million troops have served so far and 567,000 have been discharged , of which 100,000 are receiving disability payments .
Paul Sullivan , director of programs for Veterans for America , says that the current rate of injuries will produce 400,000 American veterans suffering 30 percent to 100 percent disability .
Apparently , one of the severe forms of disability is post - traumatic stress , which does not count as a physical wound .
What is America ’s reward for Bush ’s illegal wars that have killed 655,000 Iraqis , an uncounted number of Afghans , and disabled as many as 400,000 U.S. troops ?
According to the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate and to practically every Middle East expert , Bush ’s invasions have radicalized the Muslim Middle East , created legions of recruits for extremists , undermined America ’s puppet rulers , imperiled Israel , and destroyed America ’s reputation .
We are talking about over 1 million casualties that have no other cause than blatant lies by Bush , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Rice , the bloodthirsty neoconservative cabal that occupies Bush ’s subcabinet , and their corporate media propagandists , especially The Weekly Standard , Fox News , National Review , CNN , and the Wall Street Journal editorial page .
The Bush regime deceived America and the world with its lies that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction that would be turned against the West by terrorists .
By giving speeches that continually mentioned Iraq in the same context as 9/11 , the Bush regime created the widespread impression , still prevalent among Americans , that Iraq was responsible for 9/11 .
What kind of government would destroy the lives through death or disability of over 1 million people for no valid reason ?
The same kind of government that fires its own lawyers for doing their constitutional duty .
Navy lawyer Lt. Cmdr. Charles Swift was assigned the task of bringing Salim Hamdan to a guilty plea before the unconstitutional military tribunal that President Bush created for Guantanamo detainees .
Instead , Cmdr .
Swift did his duty and defended his client , winning in the U.S. Supreme Court .
The Bush administration retaliated by blocking Cmdr. Swift ’s promotion , which killed his military career and sent the chilling message to all U.S. military and government attorneys that constitutional scruples are career - enders in the Bush regime .
Anyone who stands for the U.S. Constitution is against Bush and his neocon regime .
The Bush regime is proceeding exactly as the Nazi regime proceeded .
First , eliminate every person of conscience and integrity from the government .
Second , redefine duty as service to the leader : “ You are with us or against us ”  a formulation that leaves no place for duty to the U.S. Constitution .
Patriotism is redefined from loyalty to country and Constitution to loyalty to the government ’s leader .
Americans are too inattentive and distracted to be aware of the grave danger that the neoconservative Bush regime presents to American liberty and to world stability .
The neoconservative drive to achieve hegemony over the American people and the entire world is similar to Hitler ’s drive for hegemony .
Hitler used racial superiority to justify Germany ’s right to ride roughshod over other peoples and the right of the Nazi elite to rule over the German people .
Neoconservatives use “ American exceptionalism ” and “ the war on terror . ”
There is no practical difference .
Hitler cared no more about the peoples he mowed down in his drive for supremacy than the neoconservatives care about 655,000 dead Iraqis , 100,000 disabled American troops , and 2,747 dead ones .
When Bush the Decider claims unconstitutional powers and uses “ signing statements ” to negate U.S. law whenever he feels the rule of law is in the way of his leadership , he is remarkably similar to Hitler , the Führer , who told the Reichstag on Feb. 20 , 1938 : “ A man who feels it his duty at such an hour to assume the leadership of his people is not responsible to the laws of parliamentary usage or to a particular democratic conception , but solely to the mission placed upon him .
And anyone who interferes with this mission is an enemy of the people . ”
You are with us or against us .
Just because you ’re adamant about making sure you have a personal life does n't mean you can't be top in your field .
Top is different today than it was even ten years ago .
Top does n't mean climbing a ladder to make the most money .
Top means having influence in discussions that matter to you , and having interesting problems to solve .
How do you get that ?
One way is by making a move when you can't get any further on the path you 're going .
A good example of this is Billy Cunningham , medical professor at UCLA .
He made a name for himself by documenting that upper - middle - class people of color in the United States were 37 percent more likely to have poor health than upper - middle - class whites , and by making revolutionary recommendations in front of Congress like dispensing medical information in church .
His recommendations worked .
But then he was faced with the question of what to do next .
“ I thought about what is coming down the pipe where we might see the same disparities and can anticipate it and prevent those gaps from occurring .
I also thought about what I could be the first to study .
I started focusing on adherence to AIDS cocktails and then I realized I was late to the game because several others had started working on it before I did and they had laboratory expertise that I did n’t which would make it hard for me to compete . ”
The topic he settled on was the AIDS vaccine .
He was in a position to study ways to distribute it and to put himself in a position to be a key member of the community that launches the vaccine ( when it is discovered ) in South Africa , where the infection rate is as high as 50 % in some populations .
Cunningham knows he wants to bring better medical treatement to minorities , but he knows the best way to make a difference is being the top in his field .
He consciously plots to find a space that is open for him to rise to the top .
You should be doing this too , in your career .
This is how you have the most influence to ask important questions , seek meaningful answers , and make a difference in peoples ’ lives .
Another good example of making a move is Alex Ohanian and Steve Huffman , who just sold their company , Reddit , to Conde Nast .
When I interviewed them last February , they had received a buyout offer from Google , but they turned it down .
At that point , Reddit was on an exciting and seemingly limitless path .
Today , though , Reddit ’s path as a stand alone company might be a dead end because Digg , their competitor , is now an industry standard , and Reddit is second fiddle .
Taking the buyout offer now , from a premier publishing company with enthusiasm for building out Reddit , makes good sense for Ohanian and Huffman .
After all , Ohanian told me , “ We do this because it is fun and interesting . ”
Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. has a long record of rulings on highly charged issues from abortion to the First Amendment as a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit .
Though he is considered the most conservative member of a generally liberal - leaning court , Judge Alito has joined the majority on the court on several notable decisions .
Here are some highlights of his time on the court and as a federal prosecutor in Newark :
Abortion cases
¶ In 1991 , Judge Alito agreed with most of the Third Circuit in the Planned Parenthood of Pennsylvania v. Casey decision upholding a law that imposed several limits on abortion .
The law required girls younger than 18 seeking abortion to get their parents ' consent or a court order saying such approval was not necessary , and it also required all women seeking abortions to be counseled about the procedure and wait 24 hours before they could have the procedure .
But Judge Alito broke with the majority in asserting that Pennsylvania could also require women to notify their husbands before having abortions .
This dissent is often cited by conservatives as evidence that the judge shares their beliefs .
The late Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist quoted Judge Alito in his own dissent in this case when it came before the Supreme Court , which also upheld the other portions of the law by a 5 - to - 4 vote .
¶ In 2000 , Judge Alito joined the majority when it struck down New Jersey 's ban on the so - called partial birth abortions in Planned Parenthood of Central New Jersey v. Farmer .
In a concurring opinion , Mr. Alito echoed the majority in arguing that abortion limits must have an exception for the preservation of the health of the mother , because previous Supreme Court rulings required that they do so .

About two and one - half billion years ago , life on Earth was still in its infancy .
Complex organisms such as plants and animals had not yet appeared , but the planet was teeming with microscopic bacteria which thrived in the temperate and nutrient - rich environment .
Greenhouse methane lingered in the atmosphere and trapped the sun ’s warmth , creating a climate very accommodating to the stew of microbes life that made their home on primitive Earth .
But a billion years of bacterial evolutionary progress was soon stunted by a catastrophic global event .
Geologists find no signs of a great meteor impact nor a volcanic eruption , but they have uncovered the unmistakable geologic scars of rapid worldwide climate change .
Average temperatures , which were previously comparable to our present climate , plummeted to minus 50 degrees Celsius and brought the planet into its first major ice age .
This environmental shift triggered a massive die - off which threatened to extinguish all life on Earth , and paleoclimatologists have good reason to believe that this world - changing event was unwittingly caused by some of the planet ’s own humble residents : bacteria .
The period in history is known as the Paleoproterozoic era , and prior to that time the Earth ’s ecology and environment were significantly different .
The iron - rich waters of the oceans lent them a green tint , and the atmosphere was made up of gasses other than oxygen .
Although oxygen atoms were abundant , such as those found in water molecules , unbound oxygen was extremely rare .
The sea was host to a plethora of anaerobic microorganisms , but there were also a few members of a newly evolved variety : a blue - green algae known as cyanobacteria .
These adapted bacteria were the first to use water and sunlight for photosynthesis , producing oxygen as a by - product of their metabolism .
The cyanobacteria were a struggling minority at first , but scientists believe that these new microbes began to dominate with the help of meltwater from a few glaciers scattered across the young continents .
These glaciers spent centuries scraping across the Earth collecting minerals , ultimately depositing their rich nutrient payloads into the oceans .
The cyanobacteria flourished in the presence of the increased minerals , and the rapidly growing population was soon venting increasingly large amounts of its poisonous waste oxygen into the environment .
At first the damage was limited to the oceans ’ ecosystems .
The underwater oxygen began to chemically react with the abundant iron , eventually scrubbing the seas clean of the element through oxidation .
The oxidized iron settled to the ocean floor , and the oceans ’ green tint began to fade .
This series of developments was nothing short of an ecological disaster⁠ — oxygen was poisonous to most of primitive Earth ’s inhabitants , and many bacteria relied on the iron as a nutrient .
Once the oceans ’ supply of iron was exhausted , oxygen began to seep from the sea into the air .
With very little competition for resources , cyanobacteria continued to proliferate and pollute .
The free oxygen they produced reacted with the air , gradually breaking down the methane which kept the Earth ’s atmosphere warm and accommodating .
It took at least a hundred thousand years ⁠— a short duration in geological terms⁠ — but the Earth was eventually stripped of her methane , and with it her ability to store the heat from the sun .
Temperatures fell well below freezing worldwide , and a thick layer of ice began to encase the oxygen - saturated planet .
Not even cyanobacteria were immune to the effects of this major ice age .
The traits which had once given them such an evolutionary advantage were creating an environment which was completely inhospitable , even for themselves .
As the centuries marched on , the surface became increasingly cold and frozen , with the ice at the equator eventually reaching up to one mile in thickness : Earth was an ice planet .
Thermal vents on the ocean floor provided pockets where some resilient bacteria managed to survive , and certain organisms which lived underground were insulated from much of the destruction ; but these reservoirs of life were scarce .
Almost every living thing on Earth died as a result of this massive bacteria - induced climate change , an event known as the oxygen catastrophe .
As told by the Earth ’s ancient rocks , the story of the Paleoproterozoic era is one of near - extinction for all life on the planet .
The rocks that lined the ocean floor during that period are layered with oxidized iron … the remains of the iron that was removed by the oxygen .
Layers from previous periods have no such banded iron formations .
The fossilized microbes in the rocks are also indicative of violent climate change .
The survivors of the oxygen catastrophe eventually adapted to consume the abundant oxygen and produce carbon dioxide .
This greenhouse gas very gradually made its way into the atmosphere , increasing in concentration and nudging temperatures back into the hospitable range over millions of years .
Had temperatures been slightly colder during the first major ice age⁠ — if Earth had been in a slightly more distant orbit⁠ — the planet would have remained an icy wasteland because the carbon dioxide would have frozen solid before it could promote the greenhouse effect .
Banded iron formation , caused by layers of oxidized iron
Temperatures reached as low as minus 50 degrees Celsius , and carbon dioxide freezes into dry ice at minus 78 degrees .
Indeed it seems that life on Earth was spared by a very tiny margin .
Today all life on the planet can trace its lineage back to those few microorganisms which survived the great dying of 2,500,000,000 BC , and now cyanobacteria are among the most common bacteria on Earth .
In the billions of years since the first ice age , the environment has been dramatically altered on numerous occasions by greenhouse gases which trap heat ; by shifting tectonic plates which reroute ocean currents ; by our sun ’s varying radiation levels ; and by volcanic activity which alters the atmosphere .
But at least once in Earth ’s long history , its own occupants seem to have unwittingly brought all life to the brink of extinction .
The sun is warmer now than it was then , so such a “ Snowball Earth ” is a bit less likely to occur … but the cautionary tale catalogued in ancient rocks warns us that the environment is certainly not impervious to the actions of those living in it .
Poorly - educated men may increasingly struggle to find wives
The gender imbalance could lead to social instability , the report by the State Population and Family Planning Commission warned .
It found that around 118 boys were born to every 100 girls in 2005 .
A traditional preference for boys , in a country with a one - child policy , is the root of the problem , the report says .
Abortions on female foetuses are believed to be widespread as couples , particularly in rural areas , hope for a son who will look after them in their old age .
There is also suspected under - reporting of female births .
' Embrace girls '
The report said the 118 to 100 ratio of newborn boys to girls had jumped from 110 to 100 recorded in 2000 .
In some areas of southern China , such as Guangdong and Hainan , the figure was 130 boys to 100 girls in 2005 .
Nationwide this means there will be 30 million more men than women by 2020 , making it difficult for those particularly with low income or little education to find a wife , the report said .
" The increasing difficulties men face finding wives may lead to social instability , " the report said .
The report went on : " We need to develop a ' movement to embrace girls ' ... and effectively contain the trend towards greater gender imbalances . "
The report also said that China 's current 1.3 billion population would grow by 200 million by 2033 .
And the number of 60 - year - olds and over will jump from the current 143 million to 430 million by 2040 , 30 % of the total population .
The country will need to improve its social security and retirement system , as well as its family planning policies and education and health services , the report concludes .
The BBC's Daniel Griffiths , in Beijing , says the one - child policy has already led to other major problems , with many single children facing the prospect of supporting two parents and four grandparents well into their old age .
Some years ago CNN asked 12 well - known leaders including Carlos Ghosn of Nissan , Marissa Mayer of ( then ) Google and Wynton Marsalis how they manage their time and stay efficient
My favorite answer is this one :
I know that it ’s expected of executives to start the day extremely early , but frankly I feel I make better decisions and relate better to people when I ’m well rested .
So I usually get up around 8 after a good night ’s sleep .
I also make sure to almost always work a standard 40 - hour week and never work on the weekends .
This is important to me for two reasons .
First of all , I have a life outside of work .
I have a family who likes to have me around and friends and hobbies that I also want to have time for .
I find that the time I spend outside of work recharges my batteries , expands my horizons and actually makes me more efficient at work .
Secondly , if I ’m always seen arriving at the office at 6 in the morning and leaving at 9 in the evening , not to mention taking calls and writing emails late at night and all weekend , it ’s sure to send a signal to my employees that this is what the company expects , that this is “ the right way ” .
But it is n’t .
It ’s a simple fact that for most leaders and employees , the first 40 hours they work each week are worth much more to the company than the next 20 , 30 or 40 hours .
But those extra hours spent at work can harm your private life , your family and your health .
Which in turn becomes damaging to the company .
Frankly , if you ca n’t structure your time so your work fits inside a 40 - hour week , you need to get better at prioritizing and delegating .
Refreshing words .
Guess which of the executives said that ?
Come on , take a guess !
NONE OF THEM !
Not one .
Instead , there ’s a lot of “ I get up at 5 and arrive at the office at 6 ” and “ I work 16 hours a day ” and “ I take a lot of calls on the drive in to the office ” and “ I usually leave the office at 7 and then work a few more hours in the evening at home . ”
I fully expected one of them to go “ I get up at 4 in the morning , half an hour before I go to bed , and work a 27 - hour day , only stopping for a 3 - minute lunch break in which two assistants stuff food down my throat like a foie - gras goose . ”
I know it ’s normal to view people working this hard as heroes of the organization , but still I think they would be more efficient and enjoy life more if they cut down their time at work .
They may find that they become more open , less stressed , have more fun AND are better role models for their employees .
This cult of overwork has got to stop .
The school of “ work your butt off , everything else comes second ” is bad for business and bad for people .
Can we please retire this tired idea once and for all ?

Example CAPTCHA
Form
Enter the letters shown in the box above :
NOTE : " Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA " was written in 2005 and may not reflect current best practices .
The W3C Note Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA examines potential solutions to test that users are human , not software robots , in a way that is accessible to people with disabilities .
Robot or Human ?
Tests Discriminate Against Humans
CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart .
CAPTCHA and other security tests are designed to block software robots from interacting with a Web site .
Most of these tests also block humans who are blind , deaf , hard of hearing , have low vision , or a cognitive / intellectual disability such as dyslexia .
For example , a common test requires users to read a distorted set of characters from a graphic image and enter the characters into a form .
This test is not accessible to people who are blind and people with some types of low vision or cognitive disabilities such as dyslexia .
There are other types of tests to block software robots that may be as effective and more accessible to people with disabilities .
The W3C Note Inaccessibility of CAPTCHA discusses the pros , cons , and accessibility issues of several other tests .

Blame Our Evolutionary Risk of Cancer on Our Body Mass
A key enzyme that cuts short our cellular lifespan in an effort to thwart cancer has now been linked to body mass .
Until now , scientists believed that our relatively long lifespans controlled the expression of telomerase — an enzyme that can lengthen the lives of cells , but can also increase the rate of cancer .
Vera Gorbunova , assistant professor of biology at the University of Rochester , conducted a first - of - its - kind study to discover why some animals express telomerase while others , like humans , do n't .
The findings are reported in today 's issue of Aging Cell .
" Mice express telomerase in all their cells , which helps them heal dramatically fast , " says Gorbunova .
" Skin lesions heal much faster in mice , and after surgery a mouse 's recovery time is far shorter than a human's .
It would be nice to have that healing power , but the flip side of it is runaway cell reproduction �cancer . "
Up until now , scientists assumed that mice could afford to express telomerase , and thereby benefit from its curative powers , because their natural risk of developing cancer is low �they simply die before there 's much likelihood of one of their cells becoming cancerous .
" Most people do n't know that if you put mice in a cage so the cat can't eat them , 90 percent of them will die of cancer , " says Gorbunova .
Evolution , it seems , has determined which species are allowed to express telomerase in their somatic cells in order to maintain a delicate balance between cells that live long , and cells that become cancerous .
But while most scientists believed an organism 's lifespan determined whether it was at a higher risk of cancer , Gorbunova has revealed evidence that it is not our long lifespan that puts us at risk , but our much - heavier - than - a - mouse body mass .
The tips of chromosomes , called telomeres , shorten every time a cell divides .
After about 60 divisions , the telomeres are eroded away to the point that the cell stops dividing .
Telomerase rebuilds those tips , so animals that express it , like mice , have cells that can reproduce more extensively and thus heal better .
Cancer cells , however , are those cells that constantly reproduce unchecked , and so evolution has shut off the expression of telomerase in human somatic cells , presumably because the threat of cancer outweighs the benefits of quick - healing .
But no one has looked into why mice express telomerase and humans do n't .
In fact , telomerase activity has been barely catalogued in the animal kingdom .
Gorbunova decided to take on the question by creating a unique test .
She investigated 15 rodents from across the globe to determine what level of telomerase activity each species expressed , to see if there were some correlation she could find .
The species ranged from tiny field mice to the 100 - pound capybara from Brazil .
Lifespans ranged from three years for the mice , to 23 or more for common backyard squirrels .
Acquiring specimens of these animals from around the world proved to be an unusual task .
" At one point I was woken up at two in the morning by a guy on a cell phone hunting pest beavers in Montezuma , " says Gorbunova .
" I 'm still trying to wake up and this voice says , ' I hear you 're looking for beavers . ' "
For over a year , Gorbunova collected deceased rodents from around the world and had them shipped to her lab in chilled containers .
She analyzed their tissues to determine if the telomerase was fully active in them , as it was in mice , or suppressed , as it is in humans .
Rodents are close to each other on the evolutionary tree and so if there were a pattern to the telomerase expression , she should be able to spot it there .
To her surprise , she found no correlation between telomerase and longevity .
The great monkey wrench in that theory was the common gray squirrel , which lives an amazing two decades , yet also expresses telomerase in great quantity .
Evolution clearly did n't see long life in a squirrel to be an increased risk for cancer .
Body mass , however , showed a clear correlation across the 15 species .
The capybara , nearly the size of a grown human , was not expressing telomerase , suggesting evolution was willing to forgo the benefits in order to reign in cancer .
The results cannot be directly related to humans , but Gorbunova set up the study to produce very strong across - the - board indicators .
It 's clear that evolution has found that the length of time an organism is alive has little effect on how likely some of its cells might mutate into cancer .
Instead , simply having more cells in your body does raise the specter of cancer�and does so enough that the benefits of telomerase expression , such as fast healing , were n't worth the cancer risk .
Gorbunova points out that these findings raise another , perhaps far more important question :
What , then , does this mean for animals that are far larger than humans ?
If a 160 - pound human must give up telomerase to thwart cancer , then what does a 250,000 - pound whale have to do to keep its risk of cancer at bay ?
" It may be that whales have a cancer suppressant that we 've never considered , " says Gorbunova .
" I 'd like to find out what kind of telomerase expression they have , and find out what else they use to combat cancer . "
As for the tiny mice : " They do n't have to worry about cancer , " she says .
" They 're probably all praying for an anti-cat gene . "
KARACHI , Pakistan , Jan. 2 — Ali Saleem may have devised the perfect , if improbable , cover for breaking taboos in conservative , Muslim Pakistan .
In a country where publicly talking about sex is strictly off limits , Mr. Saleem has managed not only to bring up the subject on his prime - time television talk show — but to do so without stirring a backlash from fundamentalist Islamic clerics .
And he has done so as a woman .
When Mr. Saleem takes to the airwaves , he is Begum Nawazish Ali , a coquettish widow who interviews Pakistan ’s glitterati and some of its top politicians .
A real woman could not possibly do what Mr. Saleem does .
In the unlikely event a station would broadcast such a show , the hostess would be shunned .
And taking on the guise of a married woman — whose virtue is crucial to her whole family — would be equally impossible .

Madonna made those little red Kabbalah bracelets cool for five minutes , and Tom Cruise talked up Scientology , but Buddhism firmly remains the religion du jour for Westerners looking for respite from a greedy , violent and stressed out world , according to a University of Western Sydney expert .
Dr Cristina Rocha , an ARC postdoctoral fellow with the UWS Centre for Cultural Research , is the author of ' Zen in Brazil : The Quest for Cosmopolitan Modernity ' , being launched today .
Dr Rocha says increasing numbers of Australians , like those in other Western countries , are shying away from their religion of birth and instead adopting ' spiritualities of choice ' .
" Buddhism is attractive because it provides a powerful antidote to the stress , greed and violence of today 's world , " says Dr Rocha .
" Buddhism is now the fastest growing religion in Australia , growing 80 per cent between the 1996 and 2001 census .
Interestingly , this surge is not only due to migration , but also to large numbers of Australian 's converting to Buddhism .
" People from Western cultures are drawn to Buddhism because it is seen as a ' feel good ' spirituality - not tied to a particular church or central leader - and is associated with peace , love , happiness , justice and enlightenment .
" Westerners find it gives them tools to cope with the day - to - day , and helps them detach from the rampant consumerism and stresses of their busy lives . "
She says Western society 's eagerness to embrace Buddhism stands in stark contrast to its misunderstanding , distrust and fear of a religion like Islam , which is labelled by Western media as ' violent ' and linked to terrorism .
" One of the reasons for this is the fact the Dalai Lama received a Nobel peace prize in 1989 for his peaceful resistance against the Chinese invasion of Tibet , " says Dr Rocha .
Dr Rocha says Western society 's flirtation with Buddhism was boosted in the 1960s , thanks to increased levels of migration and exposure to other cultures , and the flower - child generation 's willingness to explore things spiritual and alternative .
However , it 's grown into a full - blown love affair over the last few years , fuelled along by influential Hollywood stars , the media , and other Zen-loving celebrities .
The fascination has even been given a label by commentators - ' Tibetan chic ' .
" Western culture 's exposure to Buddhism is so much greater now .
Books by the Dalai Lama are bestsellers , and people flock to see and hear him speak as he travels the world .
In recent years there have been many movies like ' The Little Buddha ' , ' Kundun ' , and ' Seven Years in Tibet ' , and non-Hollywood films like ' The Cup ' and ' Samsra ' , " says Dr Rocha .
" Celebrities like Richard Gere and the Beastie Boys have used their status to bring attention to the plight of Tibet and its struggle against China ; and actress Uma Thurman 's father , Robert , who is now a professor at Columbia University , was the first Western Tibetan Buddhist monk and an interpreter for the Dalai Lama . "
According to Dr Rocha , increasing numbers of Westerners today want to construct their own spiritual practice ; a ' pick and mix ' of religious elements that suit them best .
" In contrast to Asia , the way Buddhism has been adopted in the West has meant that individualism is emphasised .
Western followers regard meditation as the main practice of Buddhism , " she says .
" Westerners see meditation as something you can do alone , any time , anywhere ; as if there 's no need for a temple , or a priest or monk .
This enables an individual to embark on their own spiritual quest for enlightenment . "
Dr Rocha says the extent of Buddhism 's reach into other cultures is best illustrated by the Brazilian experience , which is the focus of her book .
" Brazil is one of the most predominantly Catholic countries on the planet , yet Buddhism has been experiencing a surge in popularity among the urban , cosmopolitan classes over a number of years , " she says .
" In the 1990s , Buddhism in general , and Zen in particular , were adopted by national elites , the media and popular culture as a set of humanistic values to counter the rampant violence and crime in Brazilian society . "
' Zen in Brazil : The Quest for Cosmopolitan Modernity ' will be launched tonight by Associate Professor Ghassan Hage , from the University of Sydney .
The launch is sponsored by the Japan Foundation and the UWS Centre for Cultural Research ( CCR ) .
WHEN : Thursday 20 April 2006 TIME : 6.30 pm WHERE : Japan Foundation , Chifley Plaza , Shop 23 , Level 1 , 2 Chifley Square , Sydney .

Columbus : The Far Left is Dead Right By Bryan Caplan
By the time Christopher Columbus appeared in Lisbon in 1477 an Old World slave trade was thriving in the eastern Atlantic between West Africa , the Atlantic islands , and Europe .
In his famous letter on his first voyage he informed Ferdinand and Isabella he could , with their help , give them “ slaves , as many as they shall order . ”
On his second voyage Columbus loaded five hundred Indian slaves aboard returning caravels .
On the last leg of his voyage to Cadiz , “ about two hundred of these Indians died , ” a passenger recorded , appending , “ We cast them into the sea . ”
In this manner the discoverer of the New World launched the transatlantic slave trade , at first in Indians and from west to east .
– James Rawley , with Stephen Behrendt , The Transatlantic Slave Trade
The far left ’s radical critique of Columbus Day rubs a lot of people the wrong way .
But the facts are on their side .
Columbus was not just a brutal slaver ; he was a pioneer of slavery .
I flipped through a dozen books on Columbus and slavery in the library today , and none of them disputes this – though the hagiographies generally omit “ slavery ” from the index .
Can you condemn a man just for being a slaver ?
Of course .
It ’s almost as bad as you can get .
And Columbus did n’t even have the lame excuses of a Thomas Jefferson , like “ I grew up with it , ” or “ I could n’t afford not to do it . ”
The lamest excuse of all is that we have to judge Columbus by the standards of his time .
For this is nothing but the cultural relativism that defenders of Western civilization so often decry .
If some cultures and practices are better than others , then we can fairly hold up a mirror to Columbus and the Spanish conquerors , and find theirs to be among the worst .
But has n’t the European colonization of the New World been an improvement ?
Even if this were true , it would be no reason to have a special day to honor Columbus and his ilk .
If Mengele had cured cancer , should we celebrate Mengele Day ?
In any case , you ’ve got to ask : Compared to what ?
The benefits of Western culture would have spread at least as rapidly if the Europeans had arrived in the New World as traders and teachers instead of conquerors and slavers .
Now you could say : Every great man has feet of clay .
That depends , as Yoda would say , on what you consider great .
There are plenty of people who made great contributions to science , business , philosophy , literature , music , and history without practicing slavery and murder .
These are the men and women who might merit a day of remembrance .
Personally , I ’d like to honor Lord Acton , the great historian who taught us better than anyone else to dishonor “ great men ” like Columbus .
He ’s well - known for his eloquent slogan : “ Suffer no man and no cause to escape the undying penalty which history has the power to inflict on wrong . ”
But I like his longer statement even better :
Wired to report US unwittingly evolved superpathogen in Iraqi combat hospitals
John Byrne
Published : Sunday January 21 , 2007
A drug - resistant bacteria that is infecting wounded US soldiers in Iraq -- and has spread to civilian hospitals in parts of Europe -- accidentally evolved in US military hospitals in Iraq , Wired Magazine will report in a massive expose on Monday , RAW STORY has learned .
The full story is now available here .
The several thousand word expose is set to bring uncomfortable new light to the bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii that Pentagon officials previously said was likely a product of Iraqi soil .
" By creating the most heroic and efficient means of saving lives in the history of warfare , the Pentagon had accidentally invented a machine for accelerating bacterial evolution and was airlifting the pathogens halfway around the world , " the magazine reveals .
The story will go live online early Monday , newsroom sources say , and appear in February 's print edition .

Western powers fear Iran is developing a nuclear bomb
A report in The New Yorker magazine said the US was increasing planning for a possible air attack on Iranian nuclear facilities .
It said one option being considered was a tactical nuclear strike against underground nuclear sites .
Dan Bartlett , a senior adviser to President George W Bush , said the report was " ill - informed " .
Those who drew definitive conclusions based on normal defence and intelligence planning " are not knowledgeable of the administration 's thinking on Iran " , he said .
The US has previously refused to rule out military action , but Mr Bartlett said again that the US was committed to a diplomatic solution on the issue of Iran 's nuclear development .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Some people are afraid the president will want to go - just as he wanted to go on Iraq
Seymour Hersh
Send us your comments
UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said talk of a US nuclear strike was " completely nuts " .
Iran has branded the reports as a " psychological war launched by Americans because they feel angry and desperate regarding Iran 's nuclear dossier " .
" We will stand by our right to nuclear technology ...
Iran is not afraid of threatening language , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi said on Sunday .
Western powers fear Iran is developing a nuclear bomb .
Iran says its nuclear programme is for civilian use .
' World war '
The US magazine article , by journalist Seymour Hersh , makes three main claims :
US clandestine activities inside Iran have increased
Planning for a possible air attack has intensified
The option of using of tactical nuclear weapons to ensure the destruction of well - protected Iranian nuclear facilities is still on the table .
Mr Hersh also quoted a former senior intelligence official as saying that President Bush and others in the White House were referring to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as a potential Adolf Hitler threatening another world war .
Speaking to the BBC , Mr Hersh said many US allies felt Iran was two to 10 years away from developing a nuclear bomb and that the real aim was regime change .
" No matter what Iran would do , I think in the short run some people are afraid the president will want to go - just as he wanted to go on Iraq , " he said .
He said he believed the president felt military action against Iran was something only he could do .
" It 's messianic , I quote somebody as saying , " he said .
Planning for military action had moved beyond the contingency stage and into direct operational planning , he added .
Referring to Mr Straw 's comments , he said there were questions about how much information the US government was sharing with its European allies .
' Vulnerabilities '
Retired General Anthony Zinni , the former head of US Central Command , said on Sunday any plan to use military force against Iran was risky .
The US says it will not rule out a military option in Iran
" The Iranians will retaliate , and they have many possibilities in an area where there are many vulnerabilities , from our troop positions to the oil and gas in the region that can be interrupted , to attacks on Israel , to the conduct of terrorism , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
Talk of military strikes against Iran have been prompted by Iran 's refusal to halt nuclear work .
Last month , the UN Security Council gave Iran 30 days to halt its nuclear research , or run the risk of action such as possible sanctions .
E - Plus verändert Web - Content bei der Übertragung
Wie eben ( Freitag , 2006 - 03 - 10 ) aufgefallen , scheint E - Plus ( vermutlich E - Plus Mobilfunk , also der Netzbetreiber ) gestern oder vorgestern einen transparenten HTTP - Proxy für UMTS - und / oder GPRS - Nutzer installiert bzw .
aktiviert zu haben , der Inhalte beim Download verändert .
Die Nutzer wurden vorher nicht informiert .
Updates ( 5 ) weiter unten auf dieser Seite .
Größte Auffälligkeit ist die Veränderung bei GIF - Bildern , deren sonst weißer Hintergrund plötzlich grau erscheint .
Auch ist eine Verschlechterung der Qualität nicht zu übersehen .

Es werden Zeilenumbrüche entfernt und u.a .

Ein solcher Verweis im HTML - head , auch mal zwischen und plaziert , ist : Am Ende einer Seite , gesehen nach :
Lokale Kopie des Scripts : bmi.js .
Also ...
Ich bezahle E - Plus für die Möglichkeit , meine Daten von meinem Webserver über mein Handy auf mein Notebook zu übertragen und soll in Kauf nehmen , dass dabei Inhalte verändert werden ?
Ich frage mich : E - Plus , was soll das ?
Ich zahle 40 Euro im Monat für die Flatrate , und Ihr fummelt in meinen Daten herum ?
Was verändert Ihr denn sonst noch so ?
Optimiert Ihr meine EMails ?
Schlimm genug , dass
Ihr nur RFC1918 - Adressen vergebt , dass für IPSec - Nutzung extra bezahlt werden und ein anderer AP , über den kein nicht - IPSec - Traffic übertragbar ist , verwendet werden muss – und nun das hier .
Arbeitgeber kriegen Strafandrohungen , weil sie gegen Gesetze verstoßen , wenn sie private EMails ihrer Mitarbeiter wegen Spamverdacht nicht zustellen , aber ein Internetprovider darf ohne Aufforderung und ohne Ankündigung Inhalte verändern ?!
Postboten sollen Postkarten nicht lesen , aber E - Plus darf Inhalte verändern ?!
An alle , die sich besser damit auskennen als ich : Wer verstößt hier gegen welches Gesetz ?
Rechtfertigt dieser Eingriff und diese Veränderung meiner Daten , die E - Plus nur zu transportieren hat , eine Kündigung ?
Falls nicht , eine ganz banale Beispielfrage : Wieso muss ich hinnehmen , dass EPlus die Bildqualität verschlechtert ...?
Update 1
Update 2
E - Plus scheint das schon eine Weile immer mal wieder zu machen : http://www.onlinekosten.de/forum/showthread.php?t=72699 , danke für den Hinweis .
E- Plus saut noch mehr herum :
Sie führen ein klassisches TCP - ACK - Spoofing durch , bei dem der die Verbindung aufbauenden Seite ( im vorliegenden Fall also dem Gerät des mobilen Nutzers ) mitgeteilt wird , die Gegenseite hätte die Verbindung bereits angenommen ( SYN - ACK ) , obwohl die Gegenseite noch gar nichts davon weiß .
Lehnt sie den Verbindungsaufbau dann aber ab , hat der Schwindler in der Mitte ein Problem :
Er muss vortäuschen , der angesprochene Kommunikationspartner hätte die gerade angenommene Verbindung gleich wieder abgebrochen .
Auf solch einen Mechanismus kann man zurückgreifen , wenn die Strecke zwischen dem Schwindler in der Mitte und dem eigentlichen Ziel eine hohe Verzögerung aufweist .
Im Falle von E - Plus ist das aber die Strecke zwischen ihrem Firmennetz und dem Internet , nicht etwa die UMTS - oder GPRS - Strecke !
Glückwunsch an E - Plus : Da hat Euch vermutlich jemand für viel Geld ein Feature verkauft , das Euch keinen Vorteil bringt , die Kunden verärgert und die eine oder andere Applikation ganz schön aus dem Tritt bringen kann .
Update 3
Und nun bestätigt : E - Plus nimmt TCP - Verbindungen komplett auseinander und überträgt den Inhalt anders auf IP - Pakete aufgeteilt weiter .
Vorteil für den Kunden : keiner .
Vorteil für E - Plus : keiner .
Kein Wunder , dass mobile Datenübertragung so teuer ist , wenn Geld für sowas verschwendet wird .
Was ist die Lösung ?
Bleibt wohl nur : mittels OpenVPN nach Hause , von dort über Tor nach außen .
Und was lernen wir daraus : Mobile Datenübertragung ist für Otto Normal nicht zu empfehlen , denn es ist teuer und voller Überraschungen .
Den Eindruck wolltet
Ihr doch erwecken , E - Plus , oder ...?
Update 4
Update 5
Symlink.ch wirft die Frage auf , ob man sich nicht auch über das Urheberrecht Gedanken machen dürfte .
Ob Google es gut findet , wenn das eigene Logo so bescheiden aussieht ?
Das Original im Vergleich : Thomas Kollenbach schreibt seine Meinung zu dem Thema , hat sich das JavaScript genauer angesehen und fürchtet Sicherheitsrisiken als Konsequenz aus dem TCP - Proxying .
Das allerdings ist bei anständig gesicherter Kommunikation ( SSH , SSL ) nicht zu befürchten .
Aber das hier sieht doch nun wirklich bescheiden aus , oder ?
The reality is that there may be several different reasons for wanting to keep your browsing history private .
No matter what yours is , the idea is hiding and or erasing your tracks .
A great way to get around this issue is by using virtual machines .
These can consist of software or specialized hardware .
In some instances , they are a combination of both .
Folks who use VM ’s do so for other purposes .
They allow a person to protect themselves from malware and viruses .
While either may attack the virtual machine , the main computer will not be affected .
All of these are obvious reasons why people all over are using VMs to cover their tracks .
Especially when they are using the web for looking at smut .
Statistics from the China Internet Network Information Center ( CNNIC ) indicate that 111 million Chinese ( 8.5 % of all Chinese ) are using the Internet .
Compared to the data from July 2005 that ’s an increase of 8 million .
Compared to the end of 2004 that ’s an increase of 17 million .
The last half year shows that growth is slowing down a bit , with a million .
In absolute numbers it is still a big number though .
Other statistics from the report ( based on several news sources as the English version of the report is not yet available )
19.31 million ( 2,6 % of the rural China population ) netizens live in the rural areas
91.69 million of the netizens live in cities , making up 16.9 % of the urban population
57.8 % of the total users are from eastern China , the country ’s most affluent region
15.9 hours a week is the average Internet users spent on the Internet
64.3 million users have broadband access , an increase of 50 per cent on last year .
49.5 mln computers connected to the Internet against 41.6 mln a year earlier
19.8 + million logged on with laptops , 8 million more than in 2004 .
74.39 million Internet IP addresses are in use , ranking China no.3 in the world behind the United States and Japan
100 billion yuan ( US $ 12.4 billion ) is spend on Internet access fees in China last year
103.6 Yuan ( 12.9 U.S. dollars ) per month is the average expense of each netizen , excluding the charges of various kinds of services like the e-commerce provided many websites .
( This last part is great Chinglish but until I can see the English version of the report I wo n’t be able to make much of it .
Much more interesting would be to know how much they spend for services , how much they buy online .
An indicator for that is the last report by the Markle Foundation that learned that more than 75 % of Internet users have never made a purchase on line . )
China is the second - largest population of web users after the US which has an estimated 145 million .
And to end with some sweet propaganda .
Xinhua has their own twist by adding that
Currently the Internet popularization ratio in China is 8.5 percent , much higher than the world ’s average of 1.52 percent .

Paris Hilton has started her own YouTube channel and has posted many videos of her clubbing , recording etc .
" YouTube is the hottest community on the web and that 's where I wanna be " , at least that is what she says in the video !

Last weekend I had the pleasure of visiting my friend and first real Peak Oil influence , Dr. Jerry Unruh .
Jerry and I did a bit of mountain climbing , some snowshoeing , watched An Inconvenient Truth ( I also read the book while I was there ) and spent a lot of time talking about Peak Oil , Global Warming , sustainability , and many other topics .
I took a lot of notes as we talked , because we hit on many topics that are often discussed here .
Jerry Showing me the Solar Panels Behind his House
Jerry is denoted in this essay as JU and I am obviously RR .
If you want to discuss energy or environmental issues with Jerry ( he especially likes to talk about his experiences with solar energy ) he can be contacted at jerryunruh42@msn.com .
On Peak Oil
RR : Jerry , you are probably aware that you were my first major Peak Oil influence .
You asked me what we were going to do when oil production peaks , and I remember naively saying " Switch to ethanol . "
You laughed over that .
JU : Yeah , I remember that .
RR : So , when is world oil production going to peak ?
JU : We may be at peak right now , but I would say definitely within 10 years .
RR : So , what will the world look like 30 years from now ?
JU : If we used wisdom , we could potentially transition from fossil fuels .
We could have more livable cities , public transports , electricity from renewable sources powering PHEVs , and household electricity being produced by a combination of solar power and stationary hydrogen .
However , it is not clear that we have the wisdom , in which case I see more wars and widespread starvation .
RR : Speaking of wars , tell me your views of the Iraq War .
JU : I get so upset talking about it .
I was against it before we ever went in , but look at where we are now .
All of those lives lost and all of that money spent on securing oil supplies .
The recently released Iraq Study Group Report suggested that this war may ultimately cost $ 2 trillion .
$ 2 trillion !
Do you know what could have been done with $ 2 trillion ?
You could have put solar panels on 40 % of the homes in the U.S. Imagine the greenhouse gas reduction from that .
Imagine the energy security .
Instead , we spent it to go to war to protect our oil supplies .
RR : How do you think the U.S. will fare after peak oil ?
JU : I think the Northeast is pretty well - positioned .
They have many walkable cities and public transport is good .
They also have good water and agricultural resources .
I think the West is in a bit more trouble .
I do n't know what California is going to do , because they are so car - dependent .
Actually , California does pretty well with per capita energy usage .
They just have too many " per capitas . "
RR : Jim Kunstler made that same case in The Long Emergency - that the Northeast was better positioned than most places , and that the West is in trouble .
By the way , have you read Kunstler ?
JU : No , not yet .
But he is on my list .
( Incidentally , the books in Jerry 's library included Jared Diamond 's Collapse , Lester Brown 's Plan B 2.0 and Eco-Economy , Al Gore 's An Inconvenient Truth , Joel Cohen 's How Many People Can the Earth Support ? , Garrett Hardin's Living Within Limits , Travis Bradford 's Solar Revolution , Tim Flannery 's The Weather Makers , and Paul Ehrlich 's Extinction .
Jerry also informed me that he has given away several copies of Plan B 2.0 to government officials . )
RR : You also believe that some sort of hydrogen economy can supplement solar ?
JU : Not a hydrogen economy as it is often presented .
I do n't believe that we will drive around in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles .
But I believe that excess solar can be used to electrolyze water and produce hydrogen , and then that hydrogen can be used to produce supplemental electricity in a combined - cycle turbine .
The electricity produced can be used to run PHEVs .
RR : I am also a big fan of the potential of PHEVs driven by wind and solar power , but had n't thought much about a hydrogen tie - in .
That would actually be a great way to supply some electricity at night .
But do you think solar is practical for everyone , given the implications of people operating their own electrical systems and having to maintain their own batteries ?
JU : Ideally , you would have local distribution stations in which the solar power was fed into by the homes in the region .
This would also be where the hydrogen was produced .
The local stations would be responsible for maintaining the integrity of the system .
RR : I hear what you are saying , and agree that this would do wonders for both Global Warming and Peak Oil mitigation .
But then I think back to the comments I made about Al Gore after we watched An Inconvenient Truth .
The facts may be incontrovertible .
The logic may be crystal clear .
The solution may be staring us right in the face .
Now , trace out the path for implementing the plan .
That is the disconnect I see here .
You listen to Al Gore and you think " It is obvious that something must be done . "
But I look at the politics and wonder how we will get it done .
JU : There are solutions , and some are relatively clear .
But again I am not sure we have the collective wisdom to make the transition .
On Biomass as an Alternative
RR : I have a bit of a love - hate relationship with the potential for biomass to mitigate peak oil and global warming .
On the one hand , I love the potential of biomass gasification , and I think biodiesel and potentially butanol make sense in some situations .
On the other hand , I hate what we are doing with corn ethanol in this country .
However , you have a different take on the biomass issue .
JU : Here is my problem with biomass .
The net primary productivity of some of the most efficient ecological systems in the world is at best approximately 1 % capture of solar insolation .
Many areas - the forested regions of the West , for instance - are much lower at 0.2 % or so .
Corn is about 0.5 % , but that includes fossil fuel inputs from fertilizers , pesticides , irrigation , etc .
Of course then if you are going to turn that biomass into biofuels , there are inputs into that process that lower the net capture .
While there may be some limited applications in which such poor efficiencies are justified , in general this is a very inefficient way of capturing solar energy .
Contrast this with our solar panels , which convert approximately 15 % of the sun 's energy into electricity .
That is orders of magnitude better than the biomass route .
We have numerous rooftops that could have solar panels setting on top of them .
There are no issues with soil depletion , and we do n't have to worry about planting great swaths of monoculture crops , nor of food competing with fuel .
Of course with biomass you can produce a liquid fuel instead of electricity , but there is simply no reason that we can't adopt much higher levels of PHEVs instead of continuing to rely on the internal combustion engine as our primary means of transport .
And note that this is with present commercial solar technology .
Spectrolab just produced some solar cells with an efficiency of over 40 % .
Biomass simply can't compete with numbers like that , and it never will .
RR : OK , there are definitely some points there that I have n't considered .
The net primary productivity argument , specifically .
While I have heard passing mention of this , I have never set out to calculate the potential of biomass from first principles like net primary productivity .
Sounds like something I should work on , because this would be a pretty strong argument against biomass and in favor of solar energy .
On Big Oil
RR : So , first of all I have to know if Ana ( Jerry 's daughter , and a supporter of Prop 87 ) is ticked off at me over my Prop 87 essays .
JU : Well , she certainly was n't happy with the way the vote went , but I do n't think she is upset with you .
In fact , she told me that she has defended you many times when people said " Why are you taking that guy seriously ?
He works for an oil company ! "
She would tell them " No , he is very serious and he cares a lot about energy policy . "
RR : You can't imagine how often I get that reaction .
A lot of people are willing to completely dismiss my opinion because I work for an oil company .
JU : No , I can believe that .
The same thing frequently happened to me when I worked for a chemical company .
RR : What really bugs me is that people are so incredibly dependent on petroleum for so many things , and they loathe the companies supplying that product to them .
JU : Of course most people are unaware of the extent of their dependence on petroleum .
Look at the clothes we are wearing .
They came from oil .
Look at the snowshoes we are wearing .
They came from oil .
But people feel that when ExxonMobil is making $ 37 billion and they are paying $ 3 / gallon for gasoline - which should be $ 5 / gallon in my opinion anyway - that something needs to be done about that .
Those profits simply look ridiculous .
RR : But you know that our profit margins are only about average for all industries .
We make about 10 % on sales .
Profits are high because the companies are huge .
JU : It does n't matter .
Your profit margins could be 2 % or 20 % .
The perception people have is that they are being cheated , and those are the consequences you will have to live with as they lobby their representatives for relief .
RR : That 's on my mind a lot , actually .
I have been investing a lot of my money into energy , because I think it will do well even in a post - peak world .
People will still demand energy , and it is going to be very expensive .
Oil companies should do well .
But what is the government going to do when gasoline is $ 6 / gallon , and ExxonMobil makes $ 100 billion ?
There is a risk there , and I imagine government is going to be very hostile to Big Oil in a post - peak world .
JU : One of the reasons for your public relations problem is that oil companies have been too cozy with this administration .
Look at Cheney 's energy task force .
They would n't release the proceedings .
This leaves the impression that Big Oil is getting special favors and benefiting from closed - door deals .
What you really need to do is be proactive .
If you guys would get behind a revenue - neutral fossil fuels tax - and I do n't mean just pay lip service to the idea - then people might start to think you were serious about dealing with issues like Peak Oil and climate change .
You ( personally ) say the right things .
Your ideals are good .
But those of your industry are questionable .
You could also give up some of those subsidies .
Do you really need subsidies ?
RR : I agree that oil companies do n't need subsidies .
In fact , 4 out of the 5 CEOs who testified after Katrina said that they do n't need subsidies .
But I want to point out a couple of things .
First , eliminating the direct subsidies would amount to only a nickel a gallon or so .
Those subsidies spread across all of the diesel and gasoline we use amount to very little per gallon .
I am not defending the subsidies , I am just saying that the effect will be small and more needs to be done like a direct fossil - fuels tax .
But the other thing is that oil companies have not even requested some of these subsidies .
Some subsidies are put in place because congress wants the oil companies to do certain things ; things like drill in a particular location .
So , even though oil companies might never even take advantage of this , it gets counted as a subsidy .
JU : Again , it does n't matter .
It would improve public perception if you were to publicly announce that you were giving up all subsidies .
Besides that , $ 6 billion or $ 10 billion might not mean much to Big Oil , but if those subsidies were redirected to alternatives , it could really accelerate their market penetration .
In fact , just getting rid of the oil subsidies would level the playing field for alternatives and allow them to compete head to head with oil .
Right now it appears to the public that the government is in collusion with Big Oil .
If you want to change this perception , and the perception that people have of Big Oil , you need to make some serious policy changes .
You can only do this by being very serious about solving some of these major issues facing us .
Whitewashing will not do it .
RR : I do believe that those who think that Big Oil is going to fade away after oil production peaks are kidding themselves .
They have enough cash on hand to get into any energy business that looks promising .
I note that 2 of your solar panels were produced by Shell Solar .
JU : I think companies like Shell and BP - despite their recent problems - are positioning themselves to be leaders as oil production depletes .
ExxonMobil just does n't seem to care , and could end up going the way of General Motors .
RR : Speaking of the government and Big Oil , what do you think the new Democratic congress is going to do differently ?
JU : Well , first off I think there will be less pressure to drill in environmentally sensitive locations .
I think we have a real shot at some climate change legislation , but I also expect Bush to start using his veto power with more regularity .
I hope to see higher efficiency standards , higher CAFE standards , and more support for renewables .
One wild card is the greenhouse gas case before the Supreme Court .
It appears to me that the language is clear that the EPA could and should regulate GHGs .
I am cautiously optimistic that the Supreme Court will vote in favor , and this could make a real impact in our fight against Global Warming .
The final section contains information that Jerry put together on their house .

The archipelago is named after Robinson Crusoe , but perhaps it should have been called Treasure Island .
A long quest for booty from the Spanish colonial era appears to be culminating in Chile with the announcement by a group of adventurers that they have found an estimated 600 barrels of gold coins and Incan jewels on the remote Pacific island .
" The biggest treasure in history has been located , " said Fernando Uribe - Etxeverria , a lawyer for Wagner , the Chilean company leading the search .
Mr Uribe - Etxeverria estimated the value of the buried treasure at US $ 10 bn ( £ 5.6bn ) .
The announcement set off ownership claims .
The treasure hunters claimed half the loot was theirs and said they would donate it to non-profit - making organisations .
The government said that they had no share to donate .
It also prompted speculation about the contents of what is considered to be one of the great lost treasures from the Spanish looting of South America .
Chilean newspapers were filled with reports that the stash includes 10 papal rings and original gold statues from the Incan empire .
The hoard is supposedly buried 15 metres ( 50 ft ) deep on Robinson Crusoe island , also known as the Juan Fernández island , home to Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk , the adventurer immortalised by Daniel Defoe as Robinson Crusoe .
Selkirk was dumped on the island and lived alone for four years before being rescued .
His exploits brought worldwide attention to the islands .
For centuries treasure hunters have scoured the island in search of booty which was reportedly buried there in 1715 by Spanish sailor Juan Esteban Ubilla y Echeverria .
Using everything from old Spanish ship manifests to teams of islanders with shovels and picks , foreigners have made so many claims of discovering the lost treasure that islanders are usually sceptical of the proclamations .
This most recent announcement , however , deserves greater credence because of the equipment used by the treasure hunters : a mini robot that can scan 50 metres deep into the earth .
The robot , dubbed " Arturito " , was invented by Chileans and over the past year has grabbed headlines by breaking some of the country 's biggest criminal mysteries .
First , the robot detected the buried arsenal of a rightwing sect known as Colonia Dignidad .
The guns and rocket launchers were buried at some 10 metres and while the authorities had searched for years , the robot found the buried weapons almost instantly .
Then , in the case of missing businessman Jose Yuraszeck , Arturito was able to analyse the soil and identify the molecular composition of human bones , allowing investigators to dig straight to the body of the murder victim .

or a small percentage of enthusiasts , there 's always been the calling to jump from just playing games to creating them .
It 's crazy , of course , because the rush of playing a great game does n't carry over to spending twenty straight hours in the basement trying to figure out why a level initialization routine fails ten percent of the time .
But those that persisted , they drove the industry in its early days .
I remember reading about Mark Turmell - and others whose names I 've forgotten -- who were somehow inspired to design their own games , and then sit down and figure out exactly how to turn them into something their friends could actually come over and play .
Those were fantastic feats that started the chatter about computer games becoming a new art form .
One person , one vision , and six months later a finished product that was snapped up by a publisher -- pure creation .
A new alternative for would - be novelists .
The dream is still alive in these days of 32 - bit processors and 3D accelerators , but over the years the reality behind it has quietly slipped away and few have stopped to notice .
In 1981 , personal computers were in the thick of their 8 - bit heyday .
Not only are we talking about an 8 - bit 6502 - - a processor with one primary register and no multiply instruction -- running at less than 2 megahertz , but it was still acceptable , though just barely , to write games in BASIC .
Now do n't get me wrong , BASIC was the downtrodden interpreted language that it still is , but it shipped with every Apple II and Atari 800 , and was the obvious choice for budding programmers .
As a rule , BASIC games were flaky and slow , but listings for such games appeared in popular magazines for readers to spend hours typing in , often ending up with no more than a simple , choppy , Pac - Man clone .
Many BASIC games even ended up on store shelves or being sold through the Atari Program Exchange .
It is difficult to comprehend the technology involved in writing a game in Atari BASIC .
Even with a processor that could only deal with 8 - bit integers , all variables in Atari BASIC were stored in a six - byte floating - point format .
Adding two floating - point numbers could easily take a hundred instructions or more .
Consider a simple statement like " POKE 1536,0 " -- which old - timers will realize puts a zero into memory location 1536 .
Both numbers , 1536 and 0 , were stored as six - byte floating - point values .
At run -time they were both , unnecessary as it may seem , converted from floating point to integers , requiring obscene amounts of computation , before the simple act of storing an 8 - bit zero into memory .
This is on top of the language being interpreted in the first place .
Other operations could be similarly horrible .
" GOTO 2000 " , which would jump to line number 2000 , did a linear search through all line numbers in the program to find the target line .
As programs got longer , so did the amount of time for the search .
Even the " NEXT " in a " FOR ... NEXT " looping structure did such a scan , rather than remembering where in memory the loop started .
No wonder assembly language was considered the only real option for pro-quality titles .
So how , with all these obstacles , did hobbyists manage to write their own interesting and original games ?
One big reason was that lots of good documentation was readily available ( Atari was persnickety early on , but quickly got over it ) .
You could buy official and easily understandable hardware manuals , including the complete source code for the operating system ( all 10 K of it ) .
You could buy a spiral - bound paperback at Waldenbooks for $ 12 with the annotated source code for Atari DOS 2.0 .
The Atari 800 shipped with a sizable and easy - to - follow book about learning BASIC .
The Commodore 64 came with a thick manual that listed the hardware registers and explained how to use sprites .
Magazines commonly printed source code for complete games , both in BASIC and assembly language .
Two or four pages of dense source were relatively easy to comprehend , with a little study .
The other reason is that everything was simpler .
A programming language or assembler came on an 8 K or 16 K cartridge with a thin manual and was rarely updated ; you could pick up a language and keep using the same version for five years .
Graphical elements were usually monochrome or two or four colors .
Displays could be created using redefined character sets , an entire screen only requiring 480 bytes -- even a full bitmapped screen was only 8 K .
Sprites were supplied in hardware and could be moved by stuffing values in registers .
Scrolling could be done in a similar way ( you could do multi- directional scrolling on an Atari machine with only 2 - 5 % of the CPU ) .
Such simplifications and small numbers led to other simplifications like being able to convert tilemaps by hand and not having to deal with external data files .
Or by being able to choose colors by trial and error , because there were only 128 to select from ( sixteen colors with eight brightness levels of each ) .
If nothing else , you could keep a picture in your head of exactly where everything was and how it worked , avoiding the strange bugs that peer through multiple levels of complex tools and frameworks and operating systems that are common today .
The end result was that you could focus on the game you were writing without too many distractions .
( continued on next page )
Plot hole :
An important plot point ( in the book and the film ) is that Charles Calthrop - thought to be the Jackal , at that stage - played some mysterious part in the 1961 assassination of Rafael Trujillo , the dictator of The Dominican Republic , and rumours of his involvement came to the attention of MI6 and Special Branch , leading to the accidental exposure of the Jackal 's false passport .
In fact there is no mystery at all about the assassination of Trujillo and there were no shadowy foreigners involved .
It was organised by Trujillo 's own senior aides , amongst them General Juan Tomás Díaz , Antonio de la Maza , Amado Garcia Guerroro and General Antonio Imbert Barrera .
The gunman was later identified as Luis Aniama Tio .
All the conspirators except
Tio were arrested , tortured , and shot .
There was no panicked evacuation of foreigners who were involved with Trujillo 's regime , and no reason for them to be concerned - the government did not fall and Trujillo 's brother Hector took over as President , ruling in a brutal and totalitarian manner for a further eight years .
Any rumours of a mysterious Englishman would have been dismissed out of hand and would not have made it onto even the lowest level filing system anywhere in Whitehall .
' South Park ' creators have n't lost their edge
Trey Parker and Matt Stone have made ' South Park ' the cornerstone of Comedy Central .
Here 's how they keep it outrageous .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
The creators of " South Park , " Matt Stone and Trey Parker , do n't make life easy for their bosses at the network .
Here are some of the things that have happened recently behind the scenes :
The U.S. Conference of Bishops complained to Tom Freston , then - CEO of Viacom ( Charts ) , Comedy Central 's corporate parent , about a " South Park " episode in which a statue of the Virgin Mary seemed to be miraculously bleeding ; the two men accused Comedy Central of caving in to pressure when it pulled a rerun of " Trapped in the Closet , " a show making fun of Tom Cruise and his involvement in the Church of Scientology ; and Stone boasted to a men's magazine that he and Parker were tripping on LSD when they attended the Academy Awards in 1999 in gowns like the ones Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez had worn the previous year .
Media companies generally do n't tolerate this sort of behavior for long .
But Parker and Stone 's animated sitcom about foul - mouthed 8 - year - olds Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Kenny McCormick and Eric Cartman growing up in a fictitious Colorado town is crucial to Comedy Central .
Before " South Park's " debut on Aug. 13 , 1997 , Comedy Central was a not - so - funny network that showed reruns of " The Benny Hill Show " and " Absolutely Fabulous . "
" South Park " made the Viacom subsidiary a cable industry power almost overnight .
Comedy Central , which owns 100 percent of it , does n't release " South Park 's " financial results .
But ten seasons later , the show is one of its most valuable franchises .
" South Park " is Comedy Central 's highest - rated program , attracting 3.1 million viewers an episode , more than " The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . "
Last year , according to TNS Media Intelligence , it generated $ 34 million in advertising revenue .
In 2004 , Comedy Central sold the syndication rights in a deal said to be worth $ 100 million .
But " South Park's " real value may lie in the future - particularly in new media , where the show performs spectacularly .
It dominates the iTunes top 100 television show downloads list .
Amp'd Mobile , a cell phone service provider , is in discussions to launch a 24/7 " South Park " channel for its customers .
But that future value will depend on Parker and Stone and on whether they can keep their outrageous edge .
Some people will always think of " South Park " as the show that brought fart jokes to basic cable .
This is the show that began with a pilot titled " Cartman Gets an Anal Probe . "
" Most of the alleged humor on the premiere is self - conscious and self - congratulatory in its vulgarity : flatulence jokes , repeated use of the word ' dildo ' ( in the literal as well as pejorative sense ) , and a general air of malicious unpleasantness , " wrote Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales .
It was clear to many other viewers , though , that " South Park " was the first great post - Simpsons animated comedy .
An entire generation embraced the show in the late 1990s because it was hilarious .
Stan was so in love with his classmate , Wendy Testaburger , that he threw up every time she came near .
Kenny died gruesomely every episode and was often devoured by rats .
Jesus hosted a talk show on local cable .
Satan was a sensitive gay man who agonized over his relationship with Saddam Hussein .
From the start , no celebrity or politician was safe .
Stone and Parker understood the subversive power of animated comedy :
If a victim complained , they could say , " Hey , it 's just a cartoon . "
But even the greatest shows eventually jump the shark .
The phrase itself , now a metaphor for decline , derives from TV comedy :
An infamous " Happy Days " episode , in which Fonzie eluded a shark by leaping over it on water skis , signaled to the world that the writers had lost their spark .
It happened to " All in the Family " after its sixth season .
Jerry Seinfeld has said publicly that his show was " crawling " by its sixth season .
It has been argued that the last great season of " The Simpsons " was the eighth .
" South Park " , though , now in its tenth season , is as sharp as ever and keeps getting better .
Stone and Parker have transformed it from a show about fart jokes to a show about , well , fart jokes and satire worthy of Jonathan Swift ( who was n't above putting fart jokes into " Gulliver 's Travels " ) .
This ranges from sending up Paris Hilton and Mel Gibson to touching on the 2000 presidential election , 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina .
Last year " South Park " won an Emmy for " Best Friends Forever , " a show inspired by the Terry Schiavo controversy .
In June , " South Park " won a Peabody Award for its " stringent social commentary . "
When they started out , Stone and Parker knew how to make shows that were funny and shocking .
Now they have become two of television 's best storytellers .
Their show 's unusually tight production schedule has also kept them from wandering off into shark - infested waters .
Like college students , Parker and Stone can't seem to get anything done until the last minute .
It 's not that they are n't lazy .
They are .
But " South Park's " creators say this is the only way they know to be funny .
People at South Park Studios in Marina Del Rey , Calif. , call the writers ' room " the source of great joy or the source of great sorrow . "
This seems to be a sorrowful day .
The show 's creators are sitting at the room 's long table , unshaven and tired - looking .
Parker appears to be under a great deal of stress .
It is a Monday afternoon in April , and they are rushing to finish an episode that will air Wednesday night .
They have yet to come up with a first or last scene .
The rest of the episode seems to be up in the air too .
" I had a radical idea last night that totally changed the whole show , " Parker says .
It would be a disaster for any other animated series .
You wo n't find " Simpsons " creator Matt Groening tearing apart his show at the last minute .
That show 's writers labor over scripts and then send them off to be animated in South Korea .
The entire process , typical of modern animation , takes eight months .
Parker and Stone , however , produce each of their shows in a week .
They start Thursday morning with a writers ' meeting and finish the following Wednesday , when they send the show to Comedy Central via satellite uplink hours before it airs at 10 P.M .
Anybody expecting television 's reigning bad boys to be maniacs will be disappointed .
They look pretty conventional these days .
Stone , 35 , shed his giant ' fro years ago .
Parker , 36 , has washed out the wacky highlights in his hair that made him look a little like Jeff Daniels in Dumb & Dumber .
He got married earlier this year at his home in Hawaii .
There was , however , a " South Park " - like twist : Parker and his wife , Emma Sugiyama , were married by the famed ' 70s sitcom producer Norman Lear .
Parker , an accomplished singer , entertained his guests with karaoke renditions of Neil Diamond songs .
( " Son of a bitch , " Lear told me .
" He 's good . " )
Despite their deadline pressure , the two men are affable and polite as they explain how their show is put together .
The last thing they want is a year to work on it ; if they kick an idea around too long , they will start to hate it .
" Once you have a moment to second - guess yourself , we would just sit around and look at our stomachs for a month , " Stone says .
" It 's better this way . "
" I think that 's also why the show feels right from the source , because it's not super - refined , " says Parker .
" It 's the first things that come to mind that end up in there . "
The show is done almost entirely in - house by Parker , Stone and their staff of about 70 people .
There is enough computer animation technology in the studio to remake " Finding Nemo . "
But early on they hired a software consultant to make the computers " retarded , " as one " South Park " veteran puts it , so that shows would have the same homemade look as the crude cartoons Parker and Stone made in college with construction papers and scissors .
Stone and Parker often come in the day after one show airs with no idea what the next will be .
" Almost always our best shows are the ones we come up with the idea on Thursday , " says Parker .
" You go , ' What about this ? '
And boom , you just go with it . "
On this particular day they are working on an episode titled " A Million Tiny Fibers , " and they have been thinking about it too long .
They decided back in February to have fun with the story of James Frey , who was excoriated on TV by Oprah Winfrey after admitting that parts of his best - selling memoir about substance abuse , " A Million Little Pieces , " were fabricated .
" A Million Tiny Fibers " was supposed to start with a recurring character called Towelie - a talking , pot -smoking towel - on skid row using crack .
His friends would confront him about his substance abuse ; Towelie would clean himself up and write a Frey - like book but find that publishers were n't interested in a towel 's memoir .
So he would put on a bowler hat and a fake mustache and pretend to be human .
Oprah Winfrey would embrace Towelie and his book , then skewer him on learning of his ruse .
But with 48 hours to go before air time , Parker wants to throw out the intervention and have Towelie remain a pothead throughout the show .
The animators have to redo completed scenes to redden Towelie 's eyes .
Much of the dialogue has to be changed .
While " South Park 's " attempt at literary satire is in need of an overhaul , Stone and Parker are delighted with a silly , scatological subplot about some of Oprah 's body parts , which talk to each other in British accents .
They cook up a scheme to get Oprah fired by revealing Towelie 's identity to Geraldo Rivera .
You might think this subplot would make the people at the standards and practices department nervous - the " Oprah Winfrey Show " is distributed by a division of CBS , a company that , like Viacom , is controlled by Sumner Redstone .
But Stone says " South Park " has talked to them about it .
" Most of the time I actually like the standards people we work with , " Stone says .
" They are pretty reasonable .
They have a really hard job . "
Doug Herzog , president of Comedy Central / Spike TV / TVLand , says much the same of Parker and Stone : " They are great guys to deal with .
They are artists , for sure , but they are also businessmen . "
During my visit to South Park Studios , Parker appears to be the show 's primary funny guy .
He writes the scripts , directs the episodes , and provides the voices of Stan and Cartman .
Stone does the voices of Kyle and Kenny , but you might call him the duo's external - affairs director .
He handles the business aspects of the show that do n't interest his partner .
So why do they share equal billing ?
" Trey physically writes the scripts , " says Anne Garefino , executive producer of the show .
" But it 's Matt and Trey 's voice . "
Jason McHugh , who went to college with the two men and worked on " South Park " in its early days , says , " Usually Trey is the starter and Matt 's the chimer - inner .
But together they will riff out and beat down a joke and turn it inside out and go upwards , backwards , downwards , beat it until it 's not funny anymore , and then it 's even funnier than you ever could have imagined . "
Parker has been shocking audiences since he was a boy growing up in Conifer , Colo .
" When I was in sixth grade there was a talent show , and I wrote my first sketch , ' The Dentist , ' " Parker told David Letterman in a March appearance on Late Night .
" I played the dentist , and I had my friend play a patient .
It was sort of what can go wrong at the dentist , and I just remember I had lots of fake blood and everything .
Finally his head explodes .
My parents got a call from the school ; they were really upset .
The kindergartners were all crying and freaking out . "
Parker went off to the University of Colorado at Boulder , where he met Stone , a math prodigy from Littleton , Colo .
The two collaborated on a short cartoon called " The Spirit of Christmas : Jesus vs. Frosty . "
It 's really the first " South Park " episode , and you can find it today on YouTube .
Kyle , Kenny , Cartman and Stan make a snowman .
He comes to life and kills one of the boys .
" Oh , my God , " Stan says .
" He killed Kenny ! " " You bastard ! " yells Kyle .
The boys summon the baby Jesus , who throws his halo at Frosty like a Frisbee , decapitating him .
Stone and Parker spent much more time on a feature - length musical film about Alferd G. Packer , the 18th - century cannibal who ate members of his prospecting team after they ran out of provisions in the Rocky Mountains .
After college , the two went off to Hollywood in hopes of making more movies .
Brian Graden , then an executive at Fox , put Stone and Parker to work making a pilot for a musical children 's television series called " Time Warped . "
The pilot , called " Rom and Jul , " was a love story about a Homo erectus and an Australopithecus .
Fox took a pass .
But Graden paid Stone and Parker $ 1,200 to make a new version of " The Spirit of Christmas " he could send out as a Christmas card .
It was probably the first viral video .
George Clooney reportedly made 300 copies for friends .
Comedy Central 's Herzog saw it too .
" It literally was the funniest thing I 'd ever seen , " he recalls .
" We said , ' Develop a show . '
So they went off and developed the show . "
Nobody was prepared for what happened next .
In its first season " South Park " made the cover of Newsweek and Rolling Stone .
John Malone 's Denver - based TCI , the nation 's largest cable operator at the time , had recently dropped Comedy Central .
When " South Park " debuted , the Denver newspapers and radio stations lambasted TCI for not having the hit show by two local guys .
" The public went nuts , " says Herzog .
" We added about ten million TCI homes over the next 14 months , which at that time was unheard of . "
Things were chaotic at South Park Studios too .
Stone and Parker were producing the show in a cramped office suite below a sperm bank .
After turning in shows on Wednesday , they would fly to Las Vegas with staff members for a night of debauchery and return to work the next day .
Parker and Stone had huge fights with the network .
" That 's all we 've done since the first season , since doing the episode ' Stan Has a Gay Dog , ' " says Stone .
" It was a struggle to get them to understand the humor . "
The two men won critical acclaim in 1999 when Paramount released " South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut , " a musical film about how America declares war on Canada after the boys finagle their way into a R - rated movie from north of the border .
The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for best song - " Blame Canada . "
Soon viewers were turning to " South Park " for the same kind of satiric take on current events that they got from Jay Leno 's monologue or " The Daily Show 's " fake newscasts .
In " Osama Bin Laden Has Farty Pants , " the boys are captured by al Qaeda in post - 9/11 Afghanistan .
In " Two Days Before the Day After Tomorrow , " Cartman and Stan accidentally destroy " South Park's " biggest beaver dam , causing a Katrina - like flood .
In " The Passion of the Jew , " Cartman tries to rid " South Park " of Jews after seeing " The Passion of the Christ . "
Surprisingly , there has n't been much backlash from celebrities who have been put through " South Park 's " wringer .
The exception was the controversy that ensued after " Trapped in the Closet " made fun of Tom Cruise and Scientology .
Scientologist Isaac Hayes , the voice of Chef , " South Park 's " lusty lunchroom cook , quit in protest .
Stone and Parker complained that Comedy Central pulled a rerun of the show in March because of pressure from Cruise ; both the network and Cruise deny this .
" Trapped in the Closet " was nominated for an Emmy in July .
The network showed its appreciation by running a full - page ad in Variety with the " South Park " boys saying , " C'mon , Jews !
Show them who really runs Hollywood . "
The episode has been rerun many times since .
Cruise has n't done so well .
In August , Viacom ended Paramount 's relationship with Cruise , citing the actor 's erratic behavior during the " Mission Impossible : III " publicity campaign .
The incident speaks volumes about the changing balance of power in Hollywood :
In the digital era , a franchise like " South Park " is more important than big - budget star vehicles like the " Mission Impossible " series .
At this year 's Peabody Awards , host Jon Stewart seems genuinely thrilled when he announces " South Park 's " prize .
" They 've been on the air for ten years , and it just keeps getting funnier and more relevant and more interesting , " he says .
" It 's also one of the only two programs honored with a Peabody that focused entirely on Oprah Winfrey 's talking vagina .
The other one is " Nightline 's " investigative series . "
Parker accepts the award , moves to the microphone , and says , " When Matt and I first started making ' South Park ' , we asked ourselves two questions :
What is socially responsible broadcasting , and how can artists provoke a call to change ? "
The crowd chuckles nervously .
" Why is that so fucking funny ? "
Stone snaps .
Backstage , Parker is candid when reporters ask him how it feels to win a Peabody .
" It 's not cool , " he says wearily .
" It 's not punk rock . "
If Stone and Parker seem a little paranoid , they should .
They are under contract with Comedy Central to do two more seasons .
How do they make it to 2008 without jumping the shark ?
Parker himself recently said he goes into every season thinking , " I should have quit . "
Take , for instance , the last show of the eighth season .
" I was just , like , fried , " recalls Parker .
Thursday went by without an idea , and he sent the staff home .
On Friday night he called Anne Garefino and said , " Okay , Anne , you 're going to have to call Comedy Central and tell them they do n't have a show this week . "
On Saturday morning , however , Parker and his staff had an inspiration :
Why not do an episode about how Stan tries to help some cute forest animals ?
And the critters turn out to be devil worshippers and perform a ritual sacrifice ?
And cover themselves in blood and have an orgy ?
The episode was " Woodland Critter Christmas , " " South Park 's " contribution to the holidays .
Watch it , and you 're likely to have several reactions :
One , this is demented ; two , it 's hard to believe it is on television ; and three , it 's hilarious .
Strange and unsettling things happen when a television show comes together in seven days or less .
As long as " South Park 's " creators remember that , they 'll be fine .

" PHP IN CONTRAST TO PERL "
This document is http://tnx.nl/php -
If you replicate it , please do link .
Trust HTTP headers for last - modified info .
Corrections and additions are welcome at geeks#@tnx.nl .
PHP is a nice tool for adding dynamic parts to a small website .
It is popular because it integrates very well with the popular Apache webserver , but also because the basics of PHP are very easy to learn .
But is it wise to build applications or large websites with PHP ?
Perhaps Perl is a better solution .
This document compares PHP to Perl , because its author is very familiar with these two languages .
It would be nice if others could write comparisons to Ruby , Python , and other dynamic programming languages .
A follow - up document is available , at http://tnx.nl/php5.
Table of contents
Arguments and return values are extremely inconsistent
To show this problem , here 's a nice table of the functions that match a user defined thing : ( with something inconsistent like this , it 's amazing to find that the PHP documentation does n't have such a table .
Maybe even PHP people will use this document , just to find out what function to use :P )
replaces case gives s/m/x offset matches with insens number arrays matches flags ( - 1=end ) ereg ereg no all no array no 0 ereg_replace ereg str no all no no no 0 eregi ereg yes all no array no 0 eregi_replace ereg str yes all no no no 0 mb_ereg ereg [ 1 ] no all no array no 0 mb_ereg_replace ereg [ 1 ] str / expr no all no no yes 0 mb_eregi ereg [ 1 ] yes all no array no 0 mb_eregi_replace ereg [ 1 ] str yes all no no no 0 preg_match preg [ 2 ] yes / no one no array yes 0 preg_match_all preg yes / no all no array yes 0 preg_replace preg str / expr yes / no n/ all yes no yes 0 str_replace str str no all yes number no 0 str_ireplace str str yes all yes number no 0 strstr , strchr str / char no one no substr no 0 stristr str / char yes one no substr no 0 strrchr char no one no substr no - 1 strpos str / char no one no index no n stripos str / char yes one no index no n strrpos char [ 3 ] no one no index no n strripos str yes one no index no - 1 mb_strpos str [ 1 ] no one no index no n mb_strrpos str [ 1 ] yes one no index no - 1
The problem exists for other function groups too , not just for matching .
( In Perl , all the functionality provided by the functions in this table is available through a simple set of 4 operators . )
[ 1 ] Handles multi - byte characters
[ 2 ] PCRE regex : so - called " Perl compatible " regular expressions .
[ 3 ]
Also does strings in PHP 5
PHP has separate functions for case insensitive operations
( This can be argued both ways .
Some think it 's good to have functions that combine functions , even if that means having dozens of extra names to remember )
In Perl , you use a double lc( ) ( lowercase ) or the / i flag where PHP usually provides a case insensitive variant .
The case - insensitive versions have very inconsistent naming .
Perl : $ foo cmp $ bar lc $ foo cmp lc $ bar PHP : strcmp ( $ foo , $ bar ) strcasecmp ( $ foo , $ bar ) Perl : index ( $ foo , $ bar ) index ( lc $ foo , lc $ bar ) PHP : strpos ( $ foo , $ bar ) stripos ( $ foo , $ bar ) Perl : $ foo =~ s/foo / bar / $ foo =~ s/foo/bar /i PHP : $ foo = str_replace ( ' foo ' , ' bar ' , $ foo ) $ foo = str_ireplace ( ... )
PHP : $ foo = ereg_replace ( ' foo ' , ' bar ' , $ foo ) $ foo = eregi_replace ( ... )
PHP has inconsistent function naming
Case insensitive functions have the ' i ' or ' case ' at different positions in their names .
There is no apparent system in underscore (s ) versus no underscore(s ) : underscore no underscore : stream_get_line readline disk_free_space diskfreespace is_object isset mcal_day_of_week jddayofweek set_error_handler setlocale snmp_get_quick_print snmpget get_browser getallheaders base64_encode urlencode image_type_to_mime_type imagetypes msql_num_fields mysql_numfields php_uname phpversion strip_tags stripslashes bind_textdomain_codeset bindtextdomain cal_to_jd gregoriantojd str_rot13 strpos Perl has no core function names with underscores in them .
Perl has no core function names with underscores in them .
PHP has unlink , link and rename ( system calls ) , but touch ( the system call is utime , not touch ) .
And they can't decide on word order : object verb : base64_decode , iptcparse , str_shuffle , var_dump verb object : create_function , recode_string Perl core functions are all " verb object " except the superseded dbm* functions .

PHP has no lexical scope
Perl has lexical scope and dynamic scope .
PHP does n't have these .
For an explanation of why lexical scope is important , see Coping with Scoping .
PHP Perl Superglobal Yes Yes [ 1 ]
Global Yes Yes Function local Yes Yes [ 2 ]
Lexical ( block local ) No Yes Dynamic No Yes
[ 1 ]
Perl has variables that are always in the main : : namespace .
These are like PHP 's superglobals .
[ 2 ]
Using a lexical variable in a sub routine 's block , you get a function local variable .
PHP has too many functions in the main namespace
( Using the core binaries compiled with all possible extensions in the core distribution , using recent versions in November 2003 . )
Number of PHP main functions : 3079 [ 1 ]
Number of Perl main functions : 206 [ 2 ]
Median PHP function name length : 13 Mean PHP function name length : 13.67 Median Perl function name length : 6 Mean Perl function name length : 6.22
Note that Perl has short syntax equivalents for some functions :
readpipe ( 'ls - l ' ) == > `ls - l` glob ( '*. txt ' ) ==> readline ( $ fh ) ==> quotemeta( $ foo ) == > " \Q$ foo " lcfirst ( $ foo ) == > " \l$foo " ( lc is \ L ) ucfirst ( $ foo ) == > " \u$foo " ( uc is \U )

PHP lacks abstraction and takes TIMTOWTDI to bad extremes
Why has PHP got 3079 functions while Perl does with only 206 ?
In PHP , there are usually several functions that are very similar .
In Perl , you have to know and remember less .
Another important factor is the use of modules , especially the DBI module which provides support for SQL databases , instead of bloating the core with lots of features that occupy memory but are rarely used .
( Modules that are more often not used than used do n't count ( This rules out PEAR for PHP and IO :: File for Perl ) .
Modules may be pulled in when the core provides no similar functionality .
For simplicity , internal working is left out of this comparison . )

This is one post in a series , describing challenges we need to overcome to make free software ubiquitous on the desktop .
We have to work together to keep free software freely available .
It will be a failure if the world moves from paying for shrink - wrapped Windows to paying for shrink - wrapped Linux .
As free software becomes more successful and more pervasive there will be an increasing desire on the part of companies to make it more proprietary .
We ’ve already seen that with Red Hat and Novell , which essentially offer free software on proprietary terms – their “ really free ” editions are not certified , carry no support and receive no systematic security patching .
In other words – they ’re beta or test versions .
If you want the best that free software can deliver , a rock solid , widely certified , secure platform , from either of those companies then you have to pay , and you pay the same price whether you are Goldman Sachs or a startup in Rio de Janeiro .
That ’s not the vision we all share of what free software can achieve .
With Ubuntu , our vision is to make the very best of free software freely available , globally .
To the extent we make short - term compromises , for drivers or firmware along the way , we see those as bugs , and ones that will be closed over time .
The dream for me is to be able to keep free software free of charge for the people who want it on those terms .
To have people sharing the same high quality base and innovating on top of it – from Beijing to Buenos Aires – will create something that we ’ve never had before , which is a completely level software playing field for every young aspiring IT practitioner , and every aspiring entrepreneur .
I believe that ’s how we will really change the world , and how we will deliver the full benefit of the movement started more than two decades ago by Richard Stallman .
This is a personal challenge – I benefited hugely from the existence of Linux in 1996 , it was what made it possible ( together with SSLeay , now OpenSSL ) to get into the crypto game and ultimately found Thawte .
Now my goal is to make Ubuntu sustainable so that it can continue to grow while at the same time making all of that opportunity , all of those tools , freely available to the next generation of entrepreneurs .
I ’m glad to say our commercial support operation in Montreal is growing and that users are turning into customers , so the ball is rolling .
As Ubuntu moves into the enterprise , with some of the world ’s largest companies deploying it , I think we ’re starting to show that it really is possible to have a platform that is both free and self - sustaining .
We ’ve come a long , long way from that first meeting in April 2004 .
If this is a dream that inspires you too then get involved and contribute !
We ’ll take whatever time and input you can give – from documentation and advocacy to local training and support .
Art , energy , code … it takes all sorts to build something as complete as Ubuntu can be .

Macht Fernsehen klüger ?
Thomas Pany
In den USA ja .
In Deutschland eher dümmer
Es gibt viele Formen der Überheblichkeit .
Zu den beliebten Arten , sich als kultiviert , intellektuell und anspruchsvoll auszuweisen , gehört das klassische Statement beim Essen im großen Kreis , wonach man aufs Fernsehen verzichte , da dies nachweislich verdumme : " Sollen die Unterschichtler ruhig glotzen - und blöd bleiben - , ich lese Bücher .
Und mein Kind auch . "
Der altzopfige Dünkel gegenüber den Populärmedien , Fernsehen an erster Stelle , Computerspiele und Comics , erlebt vor allem im Privaten ein Revival .
War die primitive Kulturtechnik des Fernsehens vor einigen Jahren auch für elitäre Kulturkreise wieder salonfähig geworden , so hat seit geraumer Zeit die geistreiche Bemerkung erneut Konjunktur , der zufolge der Bang & Olufsen - Schirm am besten schwarz bleibe , das Fernsehgerät verschenkt wurde oder zum Sperrmüll gebracht : Schluss mit der Verdummung , rettet den IQ , die Phantasie , die Komplexität , das Reale .
Jahrzehntelang , so der amerikanische Journalist und Buchautor Steven Johnson in einem Artikel in der New York Times , hätten wir mit der Prämisse gelebt und gearbeitet , dass die Massenkultur einem steten Pfad folge , der zwangsläufig abwärts verlaufe .
Zum Null - Standard des kleinsten gemeinsamen Nenners .
Die " Massen " verlangten nach dumpfen , einfach gestrickten Vergnügungen und die Big Media - Unternehmen würden den Massen geben , was die sich am meisten wünschten .
Falsch , sagt Johnson .
Das genaue Gegenteil sei der Fall .
Die populäre Kultur werde in kognitiver Hinsicht immer anspruchsvoller .
Zwar sei im TV wie in Computerspielen ein Trend zu mehr Gewalt zu beobachten , auch würden ethnische Stereotypen nach wie vor häufig bemüht , aber neben diesen Trends zeige sich eine andere , wichtige Entwicklung der Unterhaltungskultur :
Um etwa eine Folge der Serie " 24 " ( in Deutschland bei RTL2 ) zu verstehen , müsse man schon sehr aufmerksam dabei sein , dauernd Schlüsse ziehen ( und verwerfen ) und dazu imstande sein , den sich ständig verändernden Beziehungen der Figuren untereinander auf der Spur zu bleiben .
Verlangt werde also ein engagierter TV - Seher , kein sedierter .
" 24 "
" Sleeper Curve " nennt der Amerikaner seine
These , wonach die am schlechtesten beleumundeten Formen der Massenunterhaltung - Videospiele , Fernsehserien , die wenig Scheu vor Gewaltszenen haben und Sitcoms für ein jugendliches Publikum - sich zuletzt als sehr " nahrhaft " herausstellen .
Der Name für die
These stammt aus einem Woody Allen Film : " The Sleeper " ( dtsch . " der Schläfer " ) , genauer aus einem Dialog , in dem sich Wissenschaftler in der Zukunft darüber wundern , dass man sich im 20 .
Jahrhundert nicht darüber im Klaren war , wie wertvoll , nahrhaft und gesund fettreiches Essen , - Steaks oder Kuchen mit Sahne usw. , tatsächlich sei ( dazu ein unfreiwilliger Witz der Geschichte : Vor kurzem haben Wissenschaftler eine lebensverlängernde Wirkung von Fett herausgefunden ) .
Johnson führt zum Beweis seiner
These , dass Fernsehen smarter mache und die mentale Entwicklung der jugendlichen Zuschauer fördere , vor allem zwei Argumente ins Feld : Fernsehserien in den USA würden immer komplexer erzählt , sowohl was die Handlungsfäden und die Anzahl der beteiligten Figuren angeht , wie die Art und Weise , mit der man den Zuschauer auf der Höhe der notwendigen Hintergrundinformation hält .
Und : Sogar der Bodensatz der Fernsehunterhaltung , das " Bad TV " stelle heutzutage Forderungen an die Zuschauer , die es bei früheren Junk TV " Formaten nicht gegeben habe .
Dann die unerwartete Pointe seiner Argumentation : Statt anzunehmen , wie es gängige Weisheit will , die Großen der Unterhaltungsindustrie würden aus Profitgründen die Massen dumm halten , habe die Unterhaltungsindustrie längst das Geschäft in der neuen " Smart Culture " entdeckt .
Televised Intelligence
Der Buchautor mit einer unorthodoxen , von frischen Gedanken beseelter Neugier für neuronale Prozesse in unseren Köpfen zitiert als amerikanischer TV - Zuschauer natürlich amerikanische Fernsehserien als Beispiel für nahrhaftes Synapsenmanna aus der " Glotze " : " 24 " , " Hill Street Blues " , " Emergency Room " , " L.A. Law " , " Twin Peaks " , " West Wing " u.a .
Den deutschen Fernsehzuschauern dürften einige Serien bekannt sein .
Man muss sie auch nicht alle kennen , um nachzuvollziehen , worum es Johnson geht :
Seit den guten alten Fernsehtagen , als " Bonanza " , " Starsky und Hutch " und " Dallas " lief , hat sich einiges verändert :
Vor allem sind die Plots , die Handlungsabläufe , weitaus komplizierter geworden , sehr viel mehr Figuren kommen ins Spiel , die Grenzen zwischen Haupt - und Nebenfiguren werden " fuzzy " , verwischter , immer mehr Handlungsfäden weben ein komplexes Knäuel , das große Ansprüche an den Zuschauer stellt .
Seit den 80er sei ein Anstieg dieser Komplexität sehr deutlich zu erkennen .
Aktuelle Serien wie " The Sopranos " ( in Deutschland erfolglos im Öffentlich - rechtlichen gelaufen ) würden in einer Szene oft drei verschiedene Erzählfäden , die auf frühere Folgen aufbauen würden , miteinander verknüpfen .
Die Herausforderung werde vom Publikum " begeistert aufgenommen " , weil sie von den Vorläuferserien wie etwa " Hill Street " schon für diese " multi - threaded dramas " geschult worden sind .
Erwünschte Verwirrung
Kluge Drehbuchautoren hassen sie , kluge Fernsehzuschauer fühlen sich beleidigt , Trashfans lieben ihre peinlichen Zeigefinger - Auftritte : Die Metainformation , die eingefügt wird , um eine Szene zu erklären .
Klimaforscher sprechen in einer
Szene fachmännisch über ein Phänomen , z.B. in " The Day after Tomorrow " über die Ankunft einer neuen Eiszeit .
" Wir sind am kritischen Punkt der Entsalzung angekommen . "
Statt dem Zuschauer dessen eigene Folgerungen zu überlassen , führt der Drehbuchautor eine Figur ein , die in diesem Moment dem hilflosen Zuschauer mit der obligatorischen Erklärung zu Hilfe kommt : " Das würde erklären , was das schlechte Wetter verursacht " .
" Flashing Arrows " nennt Johnson diese Hilfeleistung von Drehbuchautoren an das vermeintliche Nicht - Checker - Publikum .
Bei neueren Serien , wie etwa " West Wing " oder der auch in Deutschland bekannten " Emergency Room " , beobachtet Johnson das Phänomen , dass man dort genauso schnell spricht und genau das " Fachchinesisch " wie in der Wirklichkeit .
Die Zuschauer bekommen keinen Oberlehrer mehr , der ihnen mit Pfeilen erklärt , welche Schlüsse sie aus den Gesprächen ziehen müssem , keine Anbiederung mehr , kein " Talk down to the audiences " .
Die Schlüssel werden diskreter in die Geschichte verwoben , subtiler , die Zuschauer sind nicht dümmer , aber auch nicht klüger als die Darsteller in der Szene .
Was bei ihnen das Verlangen auslöst , auf die " Rückspul - Taste " drücken würde , um das Ganze zu verstehen , mit dem Gefühl eine wichtige Stelle verpasst zu haben .
Selbst der neue Junk ist besser
Die Vertreter der Meinung , dass TV früher besser war , würden in der Mehrheit Äpfel mit Birnen vergleichen .
In Amerika " Joe Millionaire " ( vgl. Grinsekatzen forever ? ) mit " MASH " , also völlig verschiedene Formate .
Würde man aber " Joe Millionaire " mit einer ähnlich angelegten Familienshow aus früheren Jahren vergleichen - Johnson zieht das hierzulande unbekannte " The Newlywed Game " zum Vergleich heran - , dann würde man schnell erkennen , dass auch dieses Format raffinierter , komplexer und auf einem höheren Niveau angelegt wird .
Shows , wie " Joe Millionaire " seien angelegt wie anspruchsvolle Video - oder Computergames , so Johnson .
Anders als in früheren
Shows würden keine festen Regeln gelten .
Stattdessen gelte , dass man während des Spielens lerne .
Das Vergnügen an Reality - Shows , dem wahren TV - Trash also , sei nicht , wie oft behauptet , ein voyeuristisches , sondern eines , das aus einem Mix an sozialem Sich - Hinein - Versetzen und der Suche nach der richtigen Strategie herrühre .
Daraus , dass andere Menschen einer Umgebung mit komplexem Schwierigkeitsgrad ausgesetzt werden , wo hoher Druck herrsche und keine etablierten Strategien vorlägen .
Daher die Lust am Gespräch danach über die Sendung : Warum hat es der in die letzte Runde geschafft , welche Strategie verfolgte der oder die und und und .
Jeder kenne die intellektuelle Lust daran , die schwachen Punkte in einem System und entsprechende Möglichkeiten zu finden .
Genau das sei die kognitive Herausforderung dieser Reality - Shows , die auf eine von Games vorbereitete und geschulte neuronale Karte in unseren Köpfen treffe .
Neue Maßstäbe der " Smart Culture "
Am Ende bringt Johnson gar ein Argument , das elitären Schöngeistern am allerwenigsten gefällt , den Profit .
Die " Sleeper Curve " gebe es nur , weil man viel Geld damit verdienen kann , die ( Pop ) - Kultur smarter zu gestalten .
Die Unterhaltungsindustrie würde die " kognitive Komplexität " ihrer Produkte nicht aus Wohltätigkeitszwecken erhöhen .
Nein , vielmehr habe man erkannt , dass solche Programme sich gut auf DVDs verkaufen lassen , da sie mehrfaches Sehen , das immer neue Nuance zutage fördert , belohnen oder gar verlangen .
Dazu käme das Internet , Foren , in denen Anmerkungen , Kommentare und Interpretationen zu den komplizierteren Unterhaltungsformaten rege ausgetauscht werden .
Shows wie " Lost " ( in Deutschland auf Pro Sieben ) oder " Alias " würden dort mit einer Intensität " zerpflückt " , die sonst nur " für Talmud - Schüler reserviert " ist .
Interaktive Spiele , so Johnson , hätten eine neue Generation von Medienkonsumenten geschult , die sich jetzt ähnlich anspruchsvoll gegenüber dem Unterhaltungsfernsehen zeigten .
Es sei Zeit für diejenigen , die Qualitätskriterien für die Fernsehunterhaltung aufstellen , sich an neuen Maßstäben zu orientieren .
Der wahre Prüfstein für gute Unterhaltung sei in erster Linie nicht , wie oft das Wort " Fuck " vorkomme oder Gewaltszenen , der Junk - Charakter zeige sich darin , ob das Programm den Zuschauer sediere , und die Klasse , wie sehr sie den Zuschauer engagiere .
Wenn Ihre Kinder Reality - TV sehen wollen , dann ermutigen Sie sie dazu , " Survivor " zu schauen , nicht " Fear Factor " .
Wenn sie Mystery sehen wollen , dann ermutigen Sie sie zu " 24 " , nicht zu " Law and Order " .
Wenn Sie ein Game mit viel Gewalt spielen wollen , dann " Grand Theft Auto " , nicht " Quake " .
Hilfreich wäre ein Klassifizierungs - System , dass mentale Arbeit als Kriterium benutzt und nicht Obszönität oder Gewalt als Schablone zur Bewertung von der Qualität von Massenkultur .
Und in Deutschland ?
" Praxis Dr. Kleist "
Es gibt viele Formen der Überheblichkeit .
Zu den beliebtesten unter den Programmverantwortlichen des deutschen Fernsehens gehört der pädagogisch verbrämte Überlegenheitsdünkel gegenüber den Fernsehzuschauern , die extrem bevormundet werden .
Hausgemachte Serien , wie etwa " Praxis Dr. Kleist " , die in ihrer Komplexität noch den einfachsten Kinderreim unterbieten , wollen vor allem ruhig stellen , also sedieren .
Der Zuschauer soll nicht gefordert werden , sondern in ruhigen Gewässern dümpeln .
Die extrem restriktive Praxis der Programmgestalter zeigt sich auch in der Auswahl von ausländischen Produkten gerade von den öffentlich - rechtlichen Anstalten .
" 24 " läuft zu einem unpopulären Zeitpunkt auf einem privaten Kanal " RTL2 , der bei Klischee - Intellektuellen nur den Pavlowschen Reflex nach einer witzigen , abschätzigen und langweiligen Bemerkung auslöst .
Das Krimigenre mag die Ausnahme von der Regel sein .
Natürlich gibt es zum Beispiel intelligente " Tatort " - Folgen .
Aber auch bei den Krimis wird im Sinne der vermeintlichen Überforderung des Zuschauers Selbstzensur betrieben .
Eine Serie wie " Boomtown " , von den Machern von " Speed " , wird nicht gekauft , weil zu komplex : " Boomtown " erzählt eine Geschichte aus 17 verschiedenen Perspektiven .
Mag sein , dass hier einige gute Gründe anzuführen sind , die dem Zorn auf die fehlende Courage der deutschen Programmgestalter manche Spitze nehmen können " wie z.B. dass das Zappen durch die vielen deutschen Kanäle Komplexität herstellt , welche die Programm einzeln für sich genommen nicht haben .
Dass die visuelle Ebene in den USA etwa durch den anders bewerteten Konsum von Comics in der Populärkultur auf eine andere Basis zurückgreifen kann " summasummarum bleibt der neidische Blick auf die besseren Angebote im amerikanischen TV .
Zum Glück gibt es DVD .
( Thomas Pany )
A handful of the world 's largest food companies and commodity traders , including McDonald 's in the UK , are driving illegal and rapid destruction of the Amazon rainforest , according to a six - year investigation of the Brazilian soya bean industry .
The report , published today , follows a 7,000 km chain that starts with the clearing of virgin forest by farmers and leads directly to Chicken McNuggets being sold in British and European fast food restaurants .
It also alleges that much of the soya animal feed arriving in the UK from Brazil is a product of " forest crime " and that McDonald 's and British supermarkets have turned a blind eye to the destruction of the forest .
The report , by Greenpeace investigators , details how the world 's largest private company , the $ 70 bn ( £ 40 bn ) a year US agribusiness giant Cargill , has built a port and 13 soya storage works in the Amazon region .
It provides farmers with seeds and agrochemicals to grow hundreds of thousands of tonnes of beans a year , which the company then exports to Liverpool and other European ports , mainly from Santarem , a city on the Amazon river .
Animal feed
From Liverpool , much of the high protein soya , which is used as animal feed , goes to Hereford - based Sun Valley , a wholly owned Cargill subsidiary that rears chickens .
The company provides McDonald 's , the largest fast food company in the world , with up to 50 % of all the chicken it serves in Britain and across Europe .
According to Greenpeace , public and indigenous land is being seized by farmers using bulldozers and even slave labour .
Last year more than 25,000 sq kilometres ( 10,000 sq miles ) of Amazon forest were felled , largely for soya farming .
Much of the damage , says the report , has followed the entry of large multinational firms .
Using satellite photography and government records , Greenpeace claims it can pinpoint where the destruction has taken place .
For instance , only five years ago , much of the land around Santarem was heavily forested .
But when Cargill announced plans to build two grain silos , a $ 20 m terminal and its own port , it had a momentous impact .
Satellite images show that in two years , deforestation rates doubled to 28,000 hectares ( 69,000 acres ) a year , land prices rocketed and soya took off as farmers from all over Brazil arrived to take advantage of guaranteed markets .
Much of that soya would have been trucked to Cargill 's silos in Santarem , then shipped to feed Sun Valley - reared chickens that would be sold to McDonald's .
The scale of Amazon deforestation due to soya expansion driven in part by demand from UK and other European firms is unprecedented , says Greenpeace .
About 14,000 hectares in the Santarem / Belterra areas now produce 34,000 tonnes of soya a year .
Further south , Mato Grosso has become Brazil 's largest soya - producing state and the one with the greatest deforestation .
Farming finance
Cargill , which dominates much of world trade in commodities , makes no secret of actively aiding soya farmers in Amazon states .
According to Greenpeace , its help is fuelling the development of large soya farms only made viable by the infrastructure the company has put in place .
Others are driving the destruction of the forest , says the report , including Brazil 's " soya king " , Blairo Maggi , and other US grain companies .
Mr Maggi , the governor of Mato Grosso , is the world 's largest individual soya grower and has accessed $ 30 m of World Bank loans to help finance soya growing on 2 m hectares , much of it former rainforest .
Forest destruction , says Greenpeace , has increased near all the soya facilities , and soya is the most powerful destroyer of the Amazon .
" Most of the land in the Amazon is classed as ' empty ' land and is unprotected and vulnerable .
Soya farmers target these areas .
They use loggers and bulldozers to clear and burn it in readiness of the crop . "
It adds : " What makes the new assault even more damaging is that farmers have access to cheap credit and a guaranteed market ...
The rainforest is largely beyond the law so the risks are low .
Such activities in effect constitute perverse financial subsidies for Europe 's cheap meat . "
Europe is now a key market for Amazon soya , partly because it is mostly still GM - free .
Sun Valley rears and processes about a million chickens a week , of which up to half go to McDonald's .
According to Greenpeace conversations with the company , roughly 25 % of the soya Sun Valley uses is Brazilian , and comes via Liverpool .
Although only 5 % of the soya grown in Brazil is from the Amazon , that small quantity , says Greenpeace , threatens to destroy the forest 's ecosystems .
The report follows attempts by campaigners in the 90s to link McDonald 's to rainforest destruction .
Those accusations were refuted in Britain 's longest civil trial , dubbed Mclibel , which ended in 1997 .
Greenpeace is hoping to tap into the growing awareness over food sourcing .
" [ Large scale ] soya farming leads to soil erosion , it requires massive chemical inputs to boost harvests .
As the soil becomes exhausted farmers move to other areas and repeat the vicious cycle of soil degradation and chemical pollution , " says the report .
Keith Kenny , senior director of quality assurance at McDonald 's Europe , yesterday told the Guardian : " Worldwide , we take our supply chain and environmental responsibilities very seriously .
We believe that the claim made by Greenpeace relates to the GM - free soya used in chicken feed .
" We can confirm that we will be investigating this claim fully and will review it for consistency in line with our existing policy not to source beef from recently deforested areas .
McDonald 's in the UK sources the majority of its food from the UK and Ireland .
In 2005 , over 17,000 British and Irish farmers supplied the company with ingredients . "
Sustainable soya
Cargill and Sun Valley yesterday issued a joint response , saying they have always been transparent about their supply chain and were working with conservation groups and the industry to minimise environmental harm .
" We are committed to sustainable development which creates income to support thriving communities and enables responsible environmental management over time , " said a spokeswoman .
" Our involvement in soya in Brazil is as a provider of export access for soybeans .
From Santarem we export soya primarily sourced in Mato Grosso and from local pasture land around Santarem .
We are working directly with farmers who are our suppliers to minimise negative impacts of soya production , and to maximise the economic benefits for families and communities .
" While we are satisfied that we apply our global standards for responsible environmental management in our operations , there are significant broader challenges .
We alone cannot ensure sustainable soya development throughout Brazil . "
Meanwhile , the Xingu basin in the pristine heart of the forest is being turned into the regional waste drain , says the report .
Home to 14 indigenous tribes , it is changing fast , says Ionaluka , a director of the Xingu Indigenous Land Association .
" Every time I leave the reserve I do not recognise anything because the forest keeps disappearing , " he says .
Both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal rolled out articles on calorie restriction research today ; more than that , they are representive of the mainstreaming of the will to a gentle , slow , modest form of healthy life extension as pushed by the folk behind the Longevity Dividend proposal .
The New York Times first :
Many scientists regard the study of life extension , once just a reliable plotline in science fiction , as a national priority .
The number of Americans 65 and older will double in the next 25 years to about 72 million , according to government census data .
By then , seniors will account for nearly 20 percent of the population , up from just 12 percent in 2003 .
Earlier this year , four prominent gerontologists , among them Dr. Miller , published a paper calling for the government to spend $ 3 billion annually in pursuit of a modest goal : delaying the onset of age - related diseases by seven years .
Doing so , the authors asserted , would lay the foundation for a healthier and wealthier country , a so - called longevity dividend .
While in general I 'm all for raising public awareness of any plasticity of the human lifespan , we 've all seen the objections to the Longevity Dividend ; it is unambitious and slow , setting the bar so low that the target gains will probably happen anyway .
It is the sort of lowest common denominator big tent approach that gets politicians to spend tax dollars on inefficient ways forward while ignoring the real possibilities of doing far better .
As I 've pointed out in the past , the stage is being set for the same sort of conflict that occurred in nanotechnology in recent years .
On the one hand , you have the larger group of moderates who support a slowing of aging via understanding and manipulating metabolic processes .
On the other side , a smaller group of engineers who support the reversal of aging by repairing known forms molecular damage .
The moderates - who are chasing large sums of public money from the government - may come to feel they must defend their inferior path against people with better plans and more ambitious targets .
The nanotechnology fight was quite ugly ; one can hope that it wo n't happen for healthy life extension science .
We all benefit when the atmosphere is one of friendly competition and may the best science win .
At heart , the folk working on metabolic science have the right intentions :
“ It ’s a just big waste of talent and wisdom to have people die in their 60s and 70s , ” said Dr. Sinclair of Harvard .
And just as big a waste in any following decade .
Hopefully more people will come to see that in the years ahead - if 10 extra years , why not 20 , or 30 , or more ?
There is no age at which it is anything other than a tragedy that people suffer and die , with no help nor rescue .
But on to the WSJ piece , which - sadly - requires registration .
A few interesting quotes :
A company that Dr. Sinclair co-founded in 2004 , Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc. , of Cambridge , MA , has begun testing a resveratrol - based drug in diabetic patients .
It has raised $ 82 million from venture capitalists , a hefty sum for an early - stage biotech .
...
It faces competition from Elixir Pharmaceuticals Inc. , also based in Cambridge , which Dr. Sinclair 's former mentor , Massachusetts Institute of Technology biologist Leonard Guarente , co-founded in 1999 to develop drugs based on gene variants that slow aging .
The niche also includes BioMarker Pharmaceuticals of Campbell , CA , and LifeGen Technologies of Madison , WI , both of which focus on mimicking CR with drugs .
The companies hope to develop therapies for diseases , not antiaging pills .
One reason is that the Food and Drug Administration does n't recognize aging as a problem warranting treatment .
But if a drug could retard aging , it might delay the onset and possibly the progression of age - related diseases .
" When you slow aging , " says University of Illinois epidemiologist S. Jay Olshansky , " you push a host of diseases to later ages at one fell swoop -- cancer , heart disease , Alzheimer 's , diabetes , as well as everything else that 's negative about growing older . "
The FDA issue makes my blood boil ; it so distorts the entire process of funding , research and development that no meaningful non-philanthropic funding will be dedicated to directly attacking the problem of aging .
This is not even to get into the ongoing disaster that government intervention has made of medical research in the US .
High prices , forgone opportunities , vanishing investment .
Such is the end result of repressive regulation .
If telomerase inhibitors were a new kind of computer chip , they would have been on every Wal - Mart pharmacy shelf and selling for ten dollars a bottle by now .
...
In a free system , life insurance companies , consumer magazines , and other competing interests would provide medical databases .
Maybe even the AMA would become a force for " truth - in - medicine , " as it was to some degree before the creation of the FDA .
Under common law but free of arbitrary regulation , drug development would be as fast as computer development .
Cancer would be extinct and human beings would finally , really , own their own bodies .
But back to the WSJ piece ; I think you 'll find this interesting :
Dr. Sinclair later got another call from Mr. LoGiudice , this time inviting him to make a pitch for funding to one of Mr. Rasnow 's wealthy acquaintances , Paul Glenn , a venture capitalist and a longtime supporter of research on aging .
After Dr. Sinclair did so , the Glenn Foundation for Medical Research in Santa Barbara , CA , awarded $ 5 million to Harvard Medical School to launch a center on the basic mechanisms of aging with Dr. Sinclair as its founding director .
Now plans are afoot to expand the center into a leading institute on aging , says Mr. Glenn , with start - up funding of $ [ 75 - 100 ] million .
You should head over to the Paul F. Glenn Laboratories for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging and take a look ; seems it 'll be getting much bigger fairly soon .
Technorati tags : biotechnology , calorie restriction , life extension
Some parts of the web are finished , unchanging creations – as
polished and as fixed as books or posters .
But many parts change all
the time :
Article Continues Below
news sites bring up - to - the - minute developments , ranging from breaking news and sports scores to reports on specific industries , markets , and technical fields
weblogs , journals , and other personal sites provide a window on the interests and opinions of their creators
corporate weblogs , wikis , knowledge banks , community sites , and workgroup journals provide share news and knowledge among co-workers and supply - chain stakeholders
Some of these sites change every week ; many change every day ; a few
change every few minutes .
Daypop ’s Dan Chan calls
this the Living Web , the part of the web that is always
changing .
Every revision requires new writing , new words that become the
essence of the site .
Living sites are only as good as today ’s update .
If the words are dull , nobody will read them , and nobody will come
back .
If the words are wrong , people will be misled , disappointed ,
infuriated .
If the words are n’t there , people will shake their heads
and lament your untimely demise .
Writing for the Living Web is a tremendous challenge .
Here are ten
tips that can help .
1. Write for a reason #section2
Write for a reason , and know why you write .
Whether your daily
updates concern your work life , your hobbies , or your innermost
feelings , write passionately about things that matter .
To an artist , the smallest grace note and the tiniest flourish may be
matters of great importance .
Show us the details , teach us why they
matter .
People are fascinated by detail and enthralled by passion ;
explain to us why it matters to you , and no detail is too small , no
technical question too arcane .
Bad personal sites bore us by telling us about trivial events and
casual encounters about which we have no reason to care .
Do n’t tell
us what happened : tell us why it matters .
Do n’t tell us your opinion :
tell us why the question is important .
If you do n’t really care , do n’t write .
If you are a student and
everybody is talking about exams and papers and you simply do n’t
care , let it be .
If your job bores you , it will bore us .
( If you
despise your job with a rich , enduring passion , that ’s another thing
entirely ! )
Write for yourself ; you are , in the end , your most
important reader .
If your site belongs to a product , a project , or an enterprise , you
must still find a way to represent its passion and excitement .
If
you do not understand why your product is compelling or comprehend
the beauty of your enterprise , find the reason or find a new writer .
Write honestly .
Do n’t hide , and do n’t stop short .
When writing about
things that matter , you may be tempted to flee to safe , familiar
havens : the familiar , the sentimental , the fashionable .
Try to find the
strength to be honest , to avoid starting the journey with passion and
ending it with someone else ’s tired formula .
The work may be hard , it
may be embarrassing , but it will be true – and it will be you , not a
tired formula or an empty design .
And if you can be satisfied with
that tired formula , you are n’t writing for a reason .
Never , for any consideration , publish a statement you know to be false .
Though you write with passion about things that matter greatly ,
always remember that it ’s a big world , filled with people and
stories .
Do n’t expect the world to stop and listen .
Never expect any
individual ( or , worse , any quantity of individuals ) to read your
work , for they may have other things to do .
At the same time , steel
yourself to expect the unexpected visitor and the uninvited guest ;
the most unlikely people may read your work .
Your mother , who never
uses a computer , may read your intimate weblog one day in the
library .
To be honest with the world , you may need to be honest with
your mother ; if you cannot face your mother , perhaps you are not
ready to write for the world .
2. Write often #section3
If you are writing for the Living Web , you must write consistently .
You need not write constantly , and you need not write long , but you
must write often .
One afternoon in grad school , I heard B. F. Skinner
remark that fifteen minutes a day , every day , adds up to about book
every year , which he suggested was as much writing as anyone should
indulge .
You do n’t need to write much , but you must write , and write
often .
If you do n’t write for a few days , you are unfaithful to the readers
who come to visit .
Missing an update is a small thing – rudeness ,
not betrayal – and readers will excuse the occasional lapse .
If you are inconsistent , readers will conclude you are untrustworthy .
If you are absent , readers will conclude you are gone .
It ’s better to
keep religiously to a once - a - week , or once - a - fortnight schedule , than
to go dark mysteriously .
If you cannot write for a time , and the reason for your absence is
interesting , write about it .
Your honeymoon , your kidney transplant ,
your sister ’s gubernatorial inauguration – all these can be
predicted and worked into the fabric of your writing so that the
interruption , when it comes , seems natural .
But avoid , if you can ,
sudden cryptic pronouncements : “ I ’ll be unable to post for a while ”
gives us nothing we can use or learn from .
Do n’t assume that you will find something to say every morning .
The
day will come , sooner or later , when you need inspiration and
find you have none .
Store topics , news items , entire articles for
slow times .
Carry a notebook or a PDA and jot down reminders .
You
cannot have too many notes saved up , but you can easily find yourself
with too few .
Since you write often , use good tools .
Select them to fit your hand
and voice .
Learn to use them well .
3 . Write tight #section4
Omit unnecessary words .
Choose a visual design that fits your voice .
Unless the design is the
point of your site , select colors and visual elements that support
without dominating .
Resist the temptation to add features , for it is
often best to use only those few technical and design elements that support
your mission .
Do n’t rush to replace a good design : you will grow
bored with it long before your readers do .
Read your work .
Revise it .
Do n’t worry about being correct , but take a moment now and then to think about the craft .
Can you
choose a better word – one that is clearer , richer , more precise ?
Can you do without a word entirely ?
Omit unnecessary words .
4 . Make good friends #section5
Read widely and well , on the web and off , and in your web writing
take special care to acknowledge the good work and good ideas of
other writers .
Show them at their best , pointing with grace and
respect to issues where you and they differ .
Take special care to be
generous to good ideas from those who are less well known , less
powerful , and less influential than you .
Weblog writers and other participants in the Living Web gain readers
by exchanging links and ideas .
Seeking to exchange links without
ideas is vulgarly known as blogrolling .
Begging high - traffic pages or
famous writers to mention you is bothersome and unproductive
Instead of begging , find ways to be a good friend .
All writers thrive
on ideas ; distribute them generously and always share the credit .
Be
generous with links .
Be generous , too , with your time and effort ;
A - list sites may not need your traffic , but everyone can use a hand .
Many prominent web writers travel a lot – to conferences , meetings ,
trade shows .
Sooner or later , they ’ll come to your corner of the
world .
Offer to feed them .
Invite them to parties .
Offer to introduce
them to interesting people .
They might be too busy .
They might be too
shy .
But the road can be a lonely place , and it ’s always interesting
to meet thinking people .
Small , thoughtful gifts are nice .
Share books you love , or that
you ’ve written .
If you ’re a photographer or an artist , prints and
sketches can be unique and memorable .
( Include permission to
reproduce them on the web . )
Join their cause .
Donate to their charity .
Friends are vital for business sites as well , but business and
friendship can be a volatile mix .
Your prospects , customers and
vendors are obvious friends , but both they and your readers will
understand that your friendship is not disinterested .
Unlikely
friends , including your competitors , may prove more convincing .
5 . Find good enemies #section6
Readers love controversy and learn from debate .
Disagreement is
exciting .
Everyone loves a fight , and by witnessing the contest of
competing ideas we can better understand what they imply .
Dramatic conflict is an especially potent tool for illuminating
abstract and technical issues , whether in software engineering or
business planning .
At times , choosing a communications protocol or
adopting an employee benefits plan may seem an abstract task , barely
related to the human crises that daily confront us .
If each
alternative has a determined , effective advocate , however , it may
reveal the source of the conflict and to remind us of the
consequences of the choice .
To make an abstract or difficult point more real , identify and
respond to an advocate who holds a different position .
Choose your
opponent with care .
If you choose a rival who is much less powerful
than you , readers may see you as a bully .
If your rival is a business
competitor , you may seem unscrupulous .
The best enemy , in fact , is
often a friend – a writer you cite frequently and who often cites
you , but with whom you disagree on a specific questions .
A handful of individuals seemingly live for controversy and seek out
ways to create and inflame disputes .
These so - called trolls are
chiefly the bane of discussion groups but occasionally find their way
into the Living Web .
Never engage them ; you cannot win .
( Trolls , when
ignored , will usually retire .
If they cause danger or damage that
cannot be ignored , the police and the courts will assist you . )
When beginning a debate , always have in mind a plan for ending it .
Ill - planned arguments can drag on , lost in a mass of boring detail or
irrelevant side - issues .
Worse , the personalities of the advocates may
become more engaging than the issues , obscuring your purpose
entirely .
Have in mind , from the outset , an idea of how long you want
to engage the issue and how you expect the exercise to end ( or reach
a resting point ) .
Plan a conclusion before firing the first salvo .
You might devise an event – a final meeting , a live debate or online
poll – that will provide a sense of closure .
Write a joint
communique for your readers or your management , summarizing the
outstanding issues and highlighting progress .
Then archive both sides
of the exchange – perhaps with annotation from a neutral authority
– so future readers may enjoy and benefit from the conflict .
When it ’s over , try to make good friends with good enemies .
6 . Let the story unfold #section7
The Living Web unfolds in time , and as we see each daily revelation
we experience its growth as a story .
Your arguments and rivalries ,
your ideas and your passions : all of these grow and shift in time ,
and these changes become the dramatic arc of your website .
Understand the storyteller ’s art and use the technique of narrative
to shape the emerging structure of your living site .
Foreshadowing hints at future events and expected interests :
your vacation , the election campaign , the endless midnight hours at
work in the days before the new product ships .
Surprise , an
unexpected flash of humor or a sudden change of direction , refreshes
and delights .
Use links within your work to build depth , for today ’s
update will someday be your own back story .
People are endlessly fascinating .
Write about them with care and
feeling and precision .
Invented characters , long a staple of
newspaper columnists , are rarely seen on the Living Web ; creating a
fascinating ( but imaginary ) friend could balance your own character
on your site .
When the star of the site is a product or an organization , temper the
temptation to reduce the narrative to a series of triumphs .
Although
you do n’t usually want to advertise bad news , your readers know that
every enterprise faces challenges and obstacles .
Consider sharing a
glimpse of your organization ’s problems : having seen the challenge ,
your readers will experience your success more vividly .
Interweave topics and find ways to vary your pacing and tone .
Piling
tension on tension , anger on rage , is ultimately self - defeating ;
sooner or later , the writing will demand more from you than you can
give and the whole edifice will collapse in boredom or farce .
When
one topic , however important , overshadows everything else in your
site , stop .
Change the subject ; go somewhere new , if only for a
moment .
When you return , you and your reader will be fresher and
better prepared .
7. Stand up , speak out #section8
If you know your facts and have done your homework , you have a right
to your opinion .
State it clearly .
Never waffle , whine , or weasel .
If you are not sure you are right , ask yourself why you are writing .
If you are seeking information or guidance from your readers , ask
them .
Do n’t bore them ( and discredit yourself ) with a hesitant ,
unformed opinion .
If you are writing in order to discover your mind
or to try out a new stance , continue by all means – but file the note
in your desk drawer , not on your website .
If you believe you are right , say so .
Explain why .
It does n’t matter
that you are young , or unknown , or lack credentials , or that crowds
of famous people disagree .
Do n’t hesitate or muddy the water .
The
truth matters ; show us the right answer , and get out of the way .
Never lie about your competitors , and never exult in your rival ’s bad news .
Try , if you can , to avoid inflicting unnecessary pain and humiliation
on those who have the misfortune to be mistaken .
People err , and you too will be wrong tomorrow .
Civility is not mere stuffiness ; it
can be the glue that lets us fight for our ideas and , once we
recognize the right answer , sit down together for drinks and dinner .
8 . Be sexy #section9
You are a sexual being .
So are all of your readers ( except the Google
robot ) .
Sex is interesting .
Sex is life , and life is interesting .
The
more of yourself you put into your writing , the more human and
engaging your work will be .
If your writing is a personal journal , and if it is honest , you will
have to write about things that you find embarrassing to describe ,
feelings you might not want to share , events that you would n’t
mention to strangers ( or , perhaps , to anyone ) .
Decide now what you
will do , before it happens .
Undressing , literally , figuratively , or emotionally , has always been
a powerful force in personal sites and web logs .
Pictures do n’t
matter in the long run ; what matters is the trajectory of your
relationship with the reader , the gradual growth of intimacy and
knowledge between you .
9 . Use your archives # section10
When you add something to the Living Web and invite others to link to
your ideas , you promise to keep your words available online , in their
appointed place , indefinitely .
Always provide a permanent location ( a
“ permalink ” ) where each item can be found .
Do your best to ensure
that these locations do n’t change , breaking links in other people ’s
websites and disrupting the community of ideas .
The promise to keep your words available need not mean that you must
preserve them unchanged .
In time , you may find errors you want to
correct .
The world changes , and things that once seemed clear may
require explanation .
Today , this permanent location is often a chronological archive , a
long list of entries for a particular week or month .
These archives
are useful and easy to make .
Many popular tools build chronological
archives automatically .
But chronological archives are limited : you
might someday want to know what you wrote in May of 1999 , but why
would anyone else care ?
Topical summaries and overviews are much more
helpful to new readers and to regulars alike , and if they require a
modest additional effort every day , that effort pays dividends that
grow as your archives expand .
New tools like Six Degrees and
Eastgate ’s Tinderbox can make it
easier to keep track of categories , to find where new things fit and
to find old things that need new links .
Topical archives are
Google ’s natural friend .
Remember that your old pages will often be
read by visitors from search engines ; introduce yourself on every
page , and be sure that every page , however obscure , has links to tell
people :
who you are , what you want , and why you ’re writing
your email address
where to find your latest writing
Link to work you ’ve already written – especially to good work that
you wrote long ago .
Do n’t be shy about linking to yourself : linking
to your own work is a service , not self - promotion .
Do n’t worry too much about correctness :
Find a voice and use it .
Most
readers will overlook , and nearly all will forgive , errors in
punctuation and spelling .
Leave Fowler and Roget on the shelf , unless
they ’re your old friends .
Write clearly and simply and write quickly ,
for if you are to write often you must neither hesitate or quibble .
Do n’t worry about the size of your audience .
If you write with energy
and wit about things that matter , your audience will find you .
Do
tell people about your writing , through short personal email notes
and through postcards and business cards and search engines .
Enjoy
the audience you have , and do n’t try to figure out why some people
are n’t reading your work .
Do n’t take yourself too seriously .
Do let your work on the Living Web flow from your passion
and your play , your work life and your life at home .
Establish a
rhythm , so your writing comes naturally and your readers experience
it as a natural part of their day or their week .
But if the rhythm
grows onerous , if you find yourself dreading your next update or
resenting the demands of your readers , if you no longer relish your
morning web routine or your evening note - taking , find a new rhythm or
try something else .
Change the schedule , or voice , or tone .
Switch
topics .
Try , if you can , to resist the temptation to drop things
entirely , to simply stop .
Do n’t worry about those who disagree with you , and do n’t take bad
reviews to heart .
The web is filled with caring and kindness , but
thoughtless cruelty can and does cloud every writer ’s spirit from
time to time .
Ideas matter , but name - calling does n’t , and petulant
critics wrap tomorrow ’s virtual fish .
The growing international crisis over Iran 's nuclear programme could trigger a catastrophic oil price spike , sending crude prices over $ 100 a barrel , senior Wall Street analysts are warning .
With prices already at around $ 72 a barrel , such an increase could mean drivers facing prices of 110 p a litre on forecourts , according the the Petrol Retailers Association .
Last week Lord Browne , chief executive of BP , warned that prices could rise to £ 1 as he unveiled bumper $ 5.27 bn profits for the first quarter .
Shell is also expected to announce close to record numbers next week , with analysts expecting profits around $ 5.57bn , driven largely by the oil price .
A single political shock could be enough to send oil markets into panic , said Adam Sieminski , senior energy economist at Deutsche Bank in New York .
' If we have one more big problem we are going to have triple - digit oil prices . '
Sieminski points to confrontation with Iran , a worsening of the situation in Iraq or a recurrence of devastating hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico as potential catalysts for a major rise .
Prices rose by as much as $ 1.20 in late trading on Friday after the United Nations inspector Mohamed El Baradei said Iran had not complied with demands to disclose the extent of its uranium enrichment programme .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad later said he ' did not give a damn ' about the UN 's opinion .
In a report , Sieminski argues that with the world consuming some 85 million barrels of oil a day , a supply disruption of 2 million barrels a day ( 60 per cent of Iran 's exports ) ' can only be rebalanced through an extraordinary rise in prices . '
But he believes any breaching of the $ 100 level would be short - lived , and that prices would fall to between $ 30 and $ 60 as increased investment brings new production and refining capacity on stream in oil - producing nations .
Mary Novak , managing director of energy services at consultants Global Insight , said Iran would not need to turn off the taps completely - even if it shut off just a 10th of its 3 million barrels a day of exports , the impact would be dramatic .
' With the situation we have , 300,000 barrels a day would drive prices up significantly , ' she said , adding that with the global economy growing more quickly than expected this year ' demand is still expanding and supply is having trouble catching up ' .
High crude prices have pushed gasoline prices up to $ 3 a gallon in the US , where President George Bush has described the rise as a tax on motorists , and Republican senators have promised measures to abate prices , including an investigation of oil company tax payments .
The approach of the US driving season has combined with the hangover effect of last year 's hurricanes on US refining capacity to underpin current price levels .
Refineries in the US have increased their spring maintenance shut - downs for several weeks , to deal with damage from the autumn .
At the same time , more stringent environmental controls on gasolene content led to some US petrol stations running dry on Friday .
New rules , which come into force this year , have mandated higher ethanol content in vehicle fuel ; but since ethanol cannot be pumped through pipelines , a shortage of infrastructure meant that in some states , including Texas , fuel was not getting to the pumps .
Manouchehr Takin , oil analyst at the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London said ' Every year , approaching the summer driving season in the US , the market gets hyped , and the prices go higher , because of the fear of a shortage . '
Ray Holloway , of the Petrol Retailers ' Association , said that ' such a hike would be critical in the second quarter of this year , if we went to $ 100 a barrel in that period , you could see unleaded petrol at 110 p a litre . '
Average prices this weekend were 95 p a litre .
The stand - off with Iran is one of several factors that could cause a significant supply disruption .
Ethnic and tribal disputes in Nigeria have resulted in the loss of 500,000 barrels a day .
Output in Iraq , potentially the world 's second - largest exporter , is still well below pre-war levels .
There are also concerns among traders about supplies from Venezuela and Russia because of internal politics .
High prices have advanced rapidly up the political agenda in the US , where Republicans are trailing in the polls ahead of mid-term elections .
Republican senators led by majority leader Bill Frist , have proposed a series of measures including the repeal of tax incentives to oil companies intended to make them invest in the Gulf of Mexico and measures to increase refinery capacity .
The issue has also prompted a return to the debate over opening up the unspoilt Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to drilling by oil companies .
President Bush also called for an investigation into possible price manipulation , and for new deposits into the US strategic petroleum reserve to cease .
Returning briefly to England from France for a speaking engagement , I bought three of the major dailies to catch up on the latest developments in my native land .
The impression they gave was of a country in the grip of a thoroughgoing moral frivolity .
In a strange inversion of proper priorities , important matters are taken lightly and trivial ones taken seriously .
This is not the charming or uplifting frivolity of Feydeau ’s farces or Oscar Wilde ’s comedies ; it is the frivolity of real decadence , bespeaking a profound failure of nerve bound to have disastrous consequences for the country ’s quality of life .
The newspapers portrayed frivolity without gaiety and earnestness without seriousness — a most unattractive combination .
Of the two instances of serious matters taken with levity , the first concerned a 42 - year - old barrister , Peter Wareing , attacked in the street while walking home from a barbecue with two friends , a man and a woman .
They passed a group of seven teenagers who had been drinking heavily , one of whom , a girl , complained that the barrister and his friends were “ staring ” at them .
Nowadays , English youth of aggressive disposition and porcelain - fragile ego regard such alleged staring as a justified casus belli .
The girl attacked the woman in the other party .
When Wareing and his male friend tried to separate them , two of the youths , aged 18 and 16 , in turn attacked them .
They hit the barrister ’s friend into some bushes , injuring him slightly , and then knocked the barrister to the ground , knocking him down a second time after he had struggled to his feet .
This second time , his head hit the ground , injuring his brain severely .
He was unconscious and on life support for two months afterward .
At first , his face was so disfigured that his three children were not allowed to see him .
The doctors told his wife , a nurse , that he was unlikely to survive , and she prepared the children for their father ’s death .
She wrote in a journal that she kept as she sat by his bed , “ Very scary feeling that all his natural life is gone . ”
Nevertheless , he made an unexpected , though partial , recovery .
His memory remains impaired , as does his speech ; he may never be able to resume his legal career fully .
It is possible that his income will be much lower for the rest of his life than it would otherwise have been , to the great disadvantage of his wife and children .
One of the two assailants , Daniel Hayward , demonstrated that he had learned nothing — at least , nothing of any comfort to the public — after he had ruined the barrister ’s life .
While awaiting trial on bail , he attacked the landlord of a pub and punched him in the face , for which he received a sentence of 21 days in prison .
Before passing sentence for the attack on Wareing , the judge was eloquent in his condemnation of the two youths .
“ You were looking for trouble and prepared to use any excuse to visit violence on anyone you came by .
It is the callousness of this that is so chilling .
. . .
You do not seem to care that others have been blighted by your gratuitous violence . ”
You might have thought that this was a prelude to the passing of a very long prison sentence on the two youths .
If so , however , you would be entirely mistaken .
Both received sentences of 18 months , with an automatic nine - month remission , more or less as of right .
In other words , they would serve nine months in prison for having destroyed the health and career of a completely innocent man , caused his wife untold suffering , and deprived three young children of a normal father .
One of the perpetrators , too , had shown a complete lack of remorse for what he had done and an inclination to repeat it .
Even at so young an age , nine months is not a very long time .
Moreover , when I recall that for youths like these a prison sentence is likely to be a badge of honor rather than a disgrace , I cannot but conclude that the British state is either utterly indifferent to or incapable of the one task that inescapably belongs to it : preserving the peace and ensuring that its citizens may go about their lawful business in safety .
It does not know how to deter , prevent , or punish .
The remarks of the policeman in charge of the case were not encouraging .
He said afterward that he hoped that “ the sentences . . . send a clear warning to people who think it is acceptable to consume large quantities of alcohol , then assault members of the public in unprovoked attacks . ”
If the law supposes that , as Mr. Bumble said in Oliver Twist , “ the law is a ass — a idiot . ”
As for Peter Wareing , even in his brain - damaged state , he had a better appreciation of things .
He was evidently a man of some spirit : having been a salesman , he decided to study for the law , supported himself at law school by a variety of manual jobs , and qualified at the bar at the age of 40 .
The extent of his recovery astounded his neurosurgeon , who attributed it to Wareing ’s determination and “ bloody - mindedness . ”
He is avid to get back to work , but the contrast between the nominal 18 - month sentence for his attackers and his own “ life sentence , ” as he called it , of struggle against disability is not lost on him .
“ If there were real justice , ” he said , “ they would have gone to prison for life . ”
Could any compassionate person disagree ?
Perhaps the final insult is that the state is paying for him to have psychotherapy to suppress his anger .
“ I have this rage inside me for the people who did this , ” he said .
“ I truly hate them . ”
Having failed in its primary duty , the state then treats the rage naturally consequent upon this failure as pathological , in need of therapy .
On reading Peter Wareing ’s story , ordinary , decent citizens will themselves feel a sense of impotent rage , despair , betrayal , and abandonment similar to his .
Do we all need psychotherapy ?
A second case similarly illustrates the refusal of the British state to take the lives of its citizens seriously .
An engineer — Philip Carroll , the father of four — was tinkering with his car outside his home .
Four drunken youths sat on a wall on his property , and he asked them to leave .
They argued with him , and one of them threw a stone at his car .
He chased this youth and caught him , but between 20 and 40 more youths loitering drunkenly nearby rallied round , and one 15 - year - old hit the engineer to the ground , where he too banged his head and received severe brain damage .
Unconscious for 18 days , he needed three operations to survive ; and now he too has an impaired memory and might never work again .
According to his parents , the culprit , Michael Kuba - Kuba , felt deeply ashamed of what he had done , but this did not in the least prevent him during the trial from claiming ( unsuccessfully , in the event ) that he had been acting in self - defense .
This does not sound like genuine shame to me but rather an attempt to get away with it .
Before passing sentence , the judge said : “ I have to try to ensure that the courts will treat incidents like this with great severity , to send out a message to other young people that violence is not acceptable . ”
Another prelude , you might think , to a stiff sentence — but again you would be wrong .
The young man got 12 months , of which he will serve six .
Six months for the active life of a man — for having caused 30 or 40 years of disability , as well as incalculable suffering to the disabled man ’s family !
It is not difficult to imagine Kuba - Kuba returning from prison to a hero ’s welcome , because he had simultaneously gotten away with near - murder and survived the rite of passage that imprisonment now represents .
The message the judge sent out to other young people , no doubt unintentionally , was that youths may destroy other people ’s lives with virtual impunity , for the British state does not care in the least about protecting them or deterring such crimes .
Two aspects of the case went unexamined in the newspapers .
The first was that Kuba - Kuba ’s parents were the owners of a grocery store specializing in African foods , and were deeply religious .
The young man doubtless did not grow up in abject poverty , then ; nor would he have derived his readiness for violence from anything his parents might have taught him .
The second was that Kuba - Kuba was a talented athlete , apparently of Olympic standard .
He was a promising soccer player , so promising that several major teams were seriously interested in recruiting him .
If , as seemed likely , he had made the grade , he would have become a multimillionaire by his early twenties , earning more in a year than most people in a lifetime .
Lack of economic prospects and the frustration it entails can hardly explain a propensity to violence in his case , therefore .
We must look elsewhere for the source of his violent conduct .
Possibly he was born a sport of nature , a creature biologically destined to violence — no doubt there are such cases .
But far more likely was that an aggressive popular culture that glorifies egotistical impulsivity and denigrates self - control influenced him .
Although his parents presented him , in their statements , as a paragon of virtue , he already had a conviction for theft , and he clearly hung about with teenagers who drank a lot and made a nuisance of themselves .
Carroll confronted the youth who threw the stone precisely because he was exasperated by the unruly behavior that prevailed in his neighborhood , undeterred and unpunished by the state .
A senior policeman said after the attack , “ We have gangs of young people hanging around on street corners being abusive , intimidating and causing trouble .
. . .
They do n’t give a damn about the police or the criminal justice system . ”
And who can blame them ?
What deterrent , punishment , vengeance , or protection for society is six months in prison for having injured a man so badly that he did not recognize his wife or children for several months afterward , that he now has poor eyesight , has lost his sense of smell and taste , has to wear a brace on one foot and a hard hat to protect his skull , and says of himself , “ I just have no interest in anything or anyone ” — having previously been a highly successful man ?
Having seen how the British state takes the serious lightly , let us now see how it takes the trivial seriously .
The newspapers reported the case of an Oxford student who , slightly drunk after celebrating the end of his exams , approached a mounted policeman .
“ Excuse me , ” said the young man to the policeman , “ do you realize your horse is gay ? ”
This was not a very witty remark , but it was hardly filled with deep malice either .
It was , perhaps , a manifestation of the youthful silliness of which most of us have been guilty in our time .
And Oxford was once a city in which drunken students often played , and were even expected to play , pranks on the police , such as knocking off their helmets .
The policeman did not think the student ’s remark was innocent , however .
He called two squad cars to his aid , and , in a city in which it is notoriously difficult to interest the police in so trivial a matter as robbery or burglary , they arrived almost at once .
Apparently , the mounted policeman thought — if thought is quite the word I seek — that the young man ’s remark was likely to “ cause harassment , alarm or distress . ”
He was arrested and charged under the Public Order Act for having made a “ homophobic remark . ”
The young man spent a night in jail .
Brought before the magistrates the following day , he was fined $ 140 , which he refused to pay .
The police then sent the case to the equivalent of the district attorney , who brought the student before the courts again but had to admit that there was not enough evidence to prove that his conduct had been disorderly .
The degree to which political correctness has addled British consciousness , like a computer virus , and destroyed all our traditional attachment to liberty , is illustrated by the words of one of the student ’s friends who witnessed the incident .
“ [ His ] comments were . . . in jest , ” he said .
“ It was very clear that they were not homophobic . ”
In other words , the friend accepted the premise that certain remarks , well short of incitement to commit violence or any actual crime — words that merely expressed an unpopular or intolerant point of view — would have constituted reasonable grounds for arrest .
One consequence of the liberal intelligentsia ’s long march through the institutions is the acceptance of the category of Thoughtcrime .
On the other hand , political correctness permits genuine incitement to murder — such as the behead those who insult islam placards carried by Muslim demonstrators in London four months after the publication of cartoons of Mohammed in a Danish newspaper — to go completely unpunished .
Other people , other customs .
Goodness knows how much time of how many people this episode in Oxford had wasted , and at what cost to the taxpayer — all in a country with the highest rate of crime ( that is to say , of real crime ) in the Western world .
I could not help comparing the alacrity with which the police dealt with the “ homophobic ” remark with their indifference to an act of arson my wife witnessed shortly before we left England .
She noticed some youths setting fire to the contents of a dumpster just outside our house , a fire that could easily have spread to cars parked nearby .
She called the police .
“ What do you expect us to do about it ? ” they asked .
“ I expect you to come and arrest them , ” she said .
The police regarded this as a bizarre and unreasonable expectation .
They refused point - blank to send anyone .
Of course , if they had promised to make every effort to come quickly but had arrived too late , or even not at all , my wife would have understood and been satisfied .
But she was not satisfied with the idea that youths could set dangerous fires without arousing even the minimal interest of the police .
Surely , some or all of the youths would conclude that they could do anything they liked , and move on to more serious crimes .
My wife then insisted that the police should at least place the crime on their records .
Again , they refused .
She remonstrated with them at length , and at considerable cost to her equanimity .
At last , and with the greatest reluctance , they recorded the crime and gave her a reference number for it .
This was not the end of the matter .
About 15 minutes later , a more senior policeman telephoned to upbraid her and tell her she had been wasting police time with her insistence on satisfaction in so trivial a matter .
The police , apparently , had more important things to do than suppress arson .
Goodness knows what homophobic remarks were being made while the youths were merely setting a fire that could have spread , and in the process learning that they could do so with impunity .
It is not difficult to guess the reason for the senior policeman ’s anger .
My wife had forced his men to record a crime that they had no intention whatever of even trying to solve ( though , with due expedition , it was eminently soluble ) , and this record in turn meant the introduction of an unwanted breath of reality into the bogus statistics , the manufacture of which is now every British senior policeman ’s principal task — with the sole exception of enforcing the dictates of political correctness , thereby to head off the criticism levied at them for many decades by the liberal Left — not always without an element of justification .
Proving their purity of heart is now more important to them than securing the safety of our streets : and thus Nero fiddled while Rome burned .
Another story in the newspaper then caught my eye : the government wanted to ban smoking in British prisons .
At first sight , this might seem like a serious rather than a frivolous idea .
More than nine - tenths of prisoners smoke , and , if they continue to do so , about a half of them will die prematurely as a result .
The evidence that smoking is bad for the health has long since been overwhelming and incontrovertible .
Therefore , the government could reasonably claim that the proposed ban was evidence of its solicitude for the welfare of the most despised of all sections of society , prisoners .
And after all , what could be more serious , less frivolous , than saving lives , or trying to do so ?
In general , I am not sentimental about the rights of prisoners .
I do n’t think the proposed ban infringes any of their rights ; but it seems to me that there are plenty of reasons for treating prisoners decently and humanely other than the observance of their supposed rights .
Decency and humanity are goods in themselves , after all .
The proposed ban was not only hypocritical but gratuitously cruel and inhumane , and likely to prove ineffective into the bargain .
But it would be wrong even if effective .
Smoking is not illegal in Britain , and the government derives large revenues from the consumption of tobacco , indeed far larger than the profits of the tobacco companies .
It uses these revenues not to lessen the taxes of non-smokers but merely as one among many other sources of revenue .
Although high taxation on tobacco does discourage smoking , that is not , and never was , its primary aim .
At bottom , the proposal looks like the arbitrary bullying of a defenseless population in a fit of Pecksniffian moral enthusiasm .
It is to deprive that population of a small privilege long accepted by custom and usage .
And , of course , the moral enthusiasts of the government will not bear the practical cost of enforcing the ban ; the prison wardens will .
The proposal is an example
of the soft and creeping totalitarianism that comes with unctuous offers of benefits and avowals of purity of intention , rather than the boot - in - the - face variety of Orwell ’s description .
It is the insinuation of the government into the nooks and crannies of everyday life , on the pretext that people are incapable of deciding anything for themselves .
Everyone is a child for whom the government is in permanent loco parentis ( except children , of course , who can consent to sex at age 16 and are to be given the vote at the same age , if Chancellor Brown has his way ) .
The newspapers confirmed what I had long perceived before I left Britain : that the zeitgeist of the country is now one of sentimental moralizing combined with the utmost cynicism , where the government ’s pretended concern for the public welfare coexists with the most elementary dereliction of duty .
There is an absence of any kind of idealism that is a necessary precondition of probity , so that bad faith prevails almost everywhere .
The government sees itself as an engineer of souls ( to use the phrase so eloquently coined by Stalin with regard to writers who , of course , were expected to mold Homo Sovieticus by the power of their words ) .
Government thus concerns itself with what people think , feel , and say — as well as with trying to change their freely chosen habits — rather than with performing its one inescapable duty : that of preserving the peace and ensuring that citizens may go about their lawful business in confidence and safety .
It is more concerned that young men should not smoke cigarettes in prison or make silly jokes to policemen than that they should not attack and permanently maim their elders and betters .
One definition of decadence is the concentration on the gratifyingly imaginary to the disregard of the disconcertingly real .
No one who knows Britain could doubt that it has very serious problems — economic , social , and cultural .
Its public services — which already consume a vast proportion of the national wealth — are not only inefficient but completely beyond amelioration by the expenditure of yet more money .
Its population is abysmally educated , to the extent that in a few more years Britain will not even have a well - educated elite .
An often cynical and criminally minded population has been indoctrinated with shallow and gimcrack notions — for example , about social justice — that render it singularly unfit to compete in an increasingly competitive world .
Not coincidentally , Britain has serious economic problems , even if the government has managed so far — in the eyes of the world , at least — to paper over the cracks .
Unpleasant realities cannot be indefinitely disguised or conjured away , however .
Therefore I have removed myself : not that I imagine things are much better , only slightly different , in France .
But one does not feel the defects of a foreign country in quite the same lacerating way as the defects of one ’s native land ; they are more an object of amused , detached interest than of personal despair .

" When I Wake Up "
Director : Keith Schofield
Believe scammers , go to jail
San Jose resident Steven Chesser , like so many of us , receives checks in the mail from people who claim he 's just won a lottery or sweepstakes .
Unlike most of us , though , he can't tell they 're fake .
And for that reason , he 's spent the entire holiday season in the Santa Clara County Jail .
Chesser , who is 51 but , according to his father , has the mind of a 12 - year - old , is n't sure why he 's locked up .
He told his dad that , as best as he can figure , it 's because he opened a bank account .
In fact , Chesser 's mistake was thinking that if you receive checks in the mail , and if you take those checks to a bank , and if that bank gives you money , then everything must be all right .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
But it was n't .
Chesser was arrested July 7 on charges of check forgery and commercial burglary .
He was subsequently released on his own recognizance but taken into custody again Nov. 1 after missing a court date .
He was scheduled to enter a plea on Tuesday .
But the public defender representing him , Kipp Davis , requested that the hearing be postponed until Jan. 19 .
Davis declined to comment on the case .
Chesser 's parents say the delay was sought to give the lawyer more time to negotiate with the Santa Clara County district attorney 's office .
Jay Boyarsky , the supervising deputy district attorney , acknowledged that " the criminal justice system does not always deal well with people who have mental disabilities . "
But he said his office had n't been made aware before Tuesday that Chesser 's case involves mental illness and bogus checks .
" We thought this was just a guy trying to deposit checks totaling $ 38,000 , " Boyarsky said .
" We had no thought that the checks he was trying to deposit were related to some Canadian lottery scam . "
He said the district attorney 's office will now look into how Chesser 's case can be expedited .
For the time being , however , Chesser remains behind bars .
He 's being held in a special wing " for inmates who need mental health treatment , " according to jail spokesman Mark Cursi .
Grace McAndrews , executive director of the California branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness , was shocked by Chesser 's plight .
" I thought I 'd heard of everything , " she said .
" This is just terrible . "
Still , McAndrews acknowledged that it's all too common for people with mental disabilities to fall victim to scams .
" They do n't have the capacity to know the difference , " she said .
Steven Chesser lives with his 81 - year - old father , William Chesser .
His 76 - year - old mother , Mary , lives separately in Cupertino .
Chesser is described by his parents as a likable and friendly person with no previous run-ins with the law .
His mother said that when Chesser was a child , he was diagnosed by specialists at Stanford University as " slow , " requiring special classes and medication .
" He talks to imaginary people , " Mary Chesser said .
" He hears voices .
But he 's always been a good boy . "
Chesser does n't read very well and does n't always comprehend what 's going on around him , his father said .
He 's worked as a janitor and held other unskilled jobs .
He 's easily taken advantage of by others .
" When he 's working , his friends always come around on payday and get him to buy them beer , " William Chesser said .
" That sort of thing is common . "
The younger Chesser likes to receive mail .
His father said Chesser will respond to virtually any marketing solicitation that comes his way .
As a result , " he 's on a lot of mailing lists . "
That 's probably how the scammers found him .
A particularly devious scam currently making the rounds is from Canadian fraudsters who write to say that you 've been awarded thousands of dollars in an international lottery .
To get your winnings , you simply have to pay about $ 2,000 in taxes and service costs .
But not to worry :
Here 's a check for that amount from a U.S. financial institution that will cover the expense at no risk to you .
Just cash the check , send in the funds and your lottery windfall will follow .
The check , of course , is counterfeit , and the scam involves people sending in their own money while the bogus check is still being processed by the bank .
In recent months , his father said , Chesser has received a number of checks from overseas lotteries and sweepstakes .
They came in handy when Steven decided in July that he wanted to buy a bike from a friend .
William Chesser said his son went to a Wells Fargo branch in Cupertino with a couple of checks he'd received , ostensibly worth a total of about $ 2,000 .
Chesser opened a checking account , deposited the funds and asked for some money .
The bank gave him $ 500 , his father said .
Chesser returned a few days later with a few more checks .
Once again , his father said , the bank handed him $ 500 .
" He showed the checks to me and I said I did n't think they were any good , " William Chesser recalled .
" But Steven does n't always believe me .
And besides , the bank was giving him money . "
So Chesser went to the bank yet again with even more checks .
And this time , bank officials suspected something was up .
They called the Santa Clara County Sheriff 's Department and Chesser was promptly arrested for passing bad checks .
" He was attempting to deposit numerous checks , " said Deputy Serg Palanov , a spokesman for the Sheriff 's Department .
Chris Hammond , a Wells Fargo spokesman , said , " There is more to the story , but we are not able to disclose it because we must respect the privacy of the customer 's information . "
He added : " Wells Fargo does not make decisions based on a customer or potential customer 's appearance .
However , if a team member observes questionable or suspicious actions or behaviors in our banking store , it may be appropriate to contact authorities to ensure the safety of our customers and team members . "
Chesser was handcuffed and taken to jail .
He was released on his own recognizance the next day .
William Chesser said his son then disappeared for the first time ever , returning home several days later and refusing to say where he'd been .
William Chesser , who filed a missing - person report with police , speculates that his son was ashamed of his arrest -- what he understood of it -- and could n't immediately find the courage to go back home .
In any case , the date of Chesser 's first court appearance arrived in August , and his father said Chesser locked himself in his room and refused to come out .
His father went without him .
A warrant was issued for Chesser 's arrest .
Sheriff 's deputies arrived at the house on Nov. 1 and took Chesser into custody .
He 's been in jail ever since .
Bail was set at $ 10,000 , but William Chesser said he 's decided not to pay it because of the danger that his son might disappear again .
" If he gets out , it 's possible I would n't be able to get him back to court , " William Chesser said .
" That would make things even worse . "
And so Steven Chesser has spent Thanksgiving and the entire holiday season behind bars -- all because con artists targeted him with their scams .
" He 's going to be spending Christmas in jail , " his mother said , her voice catching .
" I feel so sorry for him . "
Nearly two months of incarceration has n't been good for Steven 's condition , his parents observed .
" When I saw him in jail , he said the walls were talking to him , " Mary Chesser recalled .
William Chesser had a similar impression .
" He 's been talking to imaginary people , " he said .
" When I visited him , we were speaking on the phone from two sides of a glass window .
Steven would hold up the phone so an imaginary person could hear what I was saying .
" I asked him if he knew why he was there , " the father continued .
" He said it was for opening an account at Wells Fargo .
" I asked if he knew the checks were no good .
He said they 'd come in the mail and were addressed to him , so they must be good .
He does n't understand how a check can be bad . "
Wells Fargo's Hammond said holds are routinely placed on checks so that banks can determine that funds are available .
But he said a portion of the deposited amount may still be made available right away " at the customer 's request . "
" Customers are advised not to spend funds until the item has cleared , " Hammond said .
" They are responsible for the authenticity of the item .
In a situation when funds are not available or the item negotiated is found to be fraudulent , the customer is responsible for the amount the bank has distributed to the customer . "
Chesser 's father said he received a letter from his son recently , asking that he be let out of jail .
" It 's very sad , " he said .
" It 's hard to understand why this is happening . "
Hamilton , Ontario , May 1 , 2006 - Have you ever asked a colleague for information , only to have them ignore your request ?
Did you feel they were purposely avoiding you or only pretending to be ignorant ?
You may have been right .
Catherine Connelly , assistant professor of human resources & management at the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University , has found that employees often protect their knowledge and will even take steps to hide it from co-workers
Considering that companies regard knowledge acquired on the job as proprietary and implement expensive knowledge management systems to ensure those in the know share with others , this behaviour is bad for business , says Connelly .
The reluctance to share produces a contagious tendency to hide important knowledge and as a result productivity suffers , she adds .
Connelly found that employees are more willing to share with people they trust and who treat them fairly .
" When organizations emphasize positive relationships and trust among employees , knowledge sharing will become part of the culture , " explains Connelly .
Connelly and her colleagues David Zweig of the University of Toronto and Jane Webster of Queen 's University will present their findings at the annual conference of The Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology in Dallas May 5 - 7 .
Clues you 've been a victim of knowledge hiding :
You ask a colleague for help , and they say
" I 'm sorry .
My boss does n't want this to be public right now . "
Nothing .
They ignore your request .
" I do n't know .
Maybe someone else can help you out . "
they feel that an injustice has been done to them
they are distrustful of co-workers or management
they are retaliating against someone else 's behavior toward them
the organizational climate encourages secrecy , not sharing
they can get away with it
emphasize positive relationships and trust among employees
explain the mutual benefits of having colleagues share their knowledge
treat all workers fairly and respectfully
make knowledge sharing part of the culture
###
Why people engage in knowledge hiding :
How to encourage knowledge sharing :
McMaster University , a world - renowned , research - intensive university , fosters a culture of innovation , and a commitment to discovery and learning in teaching , research and scholarship .

Technology Correspondent , BBC News website
From its origins at the Cern lab the web has become a phenomenon
Along with that familiarity with browsers and bookmarks goes a little knowledge about the web 's history .
Many users know that Sir Tim Berners - Lee developed the web at the Cern physics laboratory near Geneva .
But few will know the details of the world wide web 's growth - not least because the definitive history of how that happened has yet to be written .
Zero to hero
One key date is 6 August 1991 - the day on which links to the fledgling computer code for the www were put on the alt .
hypertext discussion group so others could download it and play with it .
On that day the web went world wide .
Jeff Groff , who worked with Mr Berners - Lee on the early code , said a very simple idea was behind the web .
" The vision was that people should not have to deal with the technology stuff , " he said .
The web was an overlay that tried to hide the underlying complexity of the data and documents proliferating on the internet .
Early on this commitment to simplicity meant that the now familiar addresses beginning http :// were never seen .
WEB GROWTH
The growth of the world wide web since its early days
At-a-glance
At that time , he said , computers were islands of information .
A login only gave access to that machine 's resources .
Switching computers meant logging in again and probably using a different set of commands to find and retrieve data .
The web really caught Mr Kunz 's interest after Tim Berners - Lee showed it querying a database of physics papers held on an IBM mainframe .
" I knew what the results should look like on the screen and the results looked identical in the web browser , " said Mr Kunz .
The web server set up by Mr Kunz let physicists trawl through the 200,000 abstracts more easily than ever before .
This proved so useful that soon even Cern scientists were querying the database via the Slac webpage rather than using the copy on their network .
Audience share
But though physicists were being won over by the web 's promise , in the early years few others grasped its potential .
The early web hid the now familiar http:// addresses
Particularly popular was a technology known as Gopher developed at the University of Minnesota that also put a friendly face on the blooming complexity of the computers connected to the internet .
It got the name partly because the college 's sports team is called the Golden Gophers .
Gopher was released in Spring 1991 and for a few years statistics showed far more gopher traffic was passing across the net than web traffic .
During this time Mr Berners - Lee , Jeff Groff and colleagues involved in the world wide web project were evangelising their creation at conferences , meetings and online .
The whole project got a boost in April 1993 when the first PC web browser appeared .
It was created by Marc Andreessen at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois rather than at Cern because , said Jeff Groff , the web team did not have the staff available to write browsers for PCs , Macs or Unix machines .
Mosaic was so successful that it established many of the conventions of web use still around today , said Mr Groff .
For instance , he said , the original conception of the web had no place for bookmarks or favourites .
Also in 1993 , the University of MInnesota began charging for Gopher which led many people to consider alternatives far more seriously .
Express yourself
For many years the web was overshadowed by gopher
Gopher and FTP systems were typically set up by companies or large institutions , he said .
Also Usenet lacked any kind of persistence so anyone making a point had to re-post their opinions regularly .
Early on people started to use webpages as a way to express themselves in a way that other technologies simply did not allow .
Mr Vielmetti said web code was very tolerant of mistakes and encouraged people to play around with it .
" Websites filled this unique little niche for you as a person , not as a corporate entity , and you can have the page sitting there and have it be yours , " he said .
Every surge of interest in the web has been driven by the appearance of tools that make this expression , or a new type of it such as blogging , far easier than before .
The foresight of Mr Berners - Lee and the pioneering coders was such that , even today , many early webpages can still be viewed .
That persistence can last decades .
GLOBAL WEB USERS
Figures reveal just how worldwide the web has become
At-a-glance
He added : " Tim Berners - Lee was working on a problem to solve in high - energy physics but in finding a solution he found a solution to problems that the general public did not know they had . "
In late 1994 web traffic finally overtook gopher traffic and has never looked back .
Now there are almost 100 million websites and many consider the web and the net indistinguishable .
But , said Mr Groff , only now is the web meeting the vision that the pioneers had for it .

Blocks and Closures in Ruby
A Conversation with Yukihiro Matsumoto , Part III
by Bill Venners

Summary
Yukihiro Matsumoto , the creator of the Ruby programming language , talks with Bill Venners about two kinds of nameless functions in Ruby , blocks and closures .
Yukihiro Matsumoto , or " Matz , " as he is known online , is the creator of the Ruby programming language .
Ruby is an object - oriented language suitable for writing day to day scripts as well as full - scale applications .
Matz began work on Ruby back in 1993 , because he wanted a language that made him productive while being fun to use .
Initially popular in Japan , Ruby has been finding its way into the hearts of programmers all over the world .
On September 24 , 2003 , Bill Venners met with Yukihiro Matsumoto at the JAOO conference in Aarhus , Denmark .
In this interview , which is being published in multiple installments on Artima.com , Yukihiro Matsumoto discusses Ruby 's design philosopy , the features of the Ruby language , and becoming a better programmer .
In Part I : The Philosophy of Ruby , Matz waxes philosophic about design imperfection , the danger of orthogonality , granting freedom with guidance , the principle of least surprise , and the importance of the human in computer endeavors .
In Part II : Dynamic Productivity with Ruby , Matz discusses morphing interfaces , using mix-ins , and the productivity benefits of being concise in Ruby .
In this third installment , Matz discusses two kinds of nameless functions in Ruby , blocks and closures .
Loop Abstraction with Blocks
Bill Venners : Ruby supports blocks and closures .
What are blocks and closures , and how are they used ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Blocks are basically nameless functions .
You may be familiar with the lambda from other languages like Lisp or Python .
Basically , you can pass a nameless function to another function , and then that function can invoke the passed - in nameless function .
For example , a function could perform iteration by passing one item at a time to the nameless function .
This is a common style , called higher order function style , among languages that can handle functions as first class objects .
Lisp does it .
Python does it .
Even C does it with function pointers .
Many other languages do this style of programming .
In Ruby , the difference is mainly a different kind of syntax for higher order functions .
In other languages , you have to specify explicitly that a function can accept another function as an argument .
But in Ruby , any method can be called with a block as an implicit argument .
Inside the method , you can call the block using the yield keyword with a value .
Bill Venners :
What is the benefit of blocks ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Basically , blocks are designed for loop abstraction .
The most basic usage of blocks is to let you define your own way for iterating over the items .
For example , if you have a list , sequence , vector , or array , you can iterate forward by using the method provided by the standard library .
But what if you want to iterate backwards from the end to the beginning ?
In C , you have to set up four things : an index , a start value , an end comparison , and an increment .
This is not good , because it reveals internal details of the list .
We want to hide that logic .
By using blocks , we can hide the loop logic inside the method or function .
So for example by calling list .
reverse_each , you can do a reverse iteration over the list without knowing how the list is implemented on the inside .
Bill Venners : I just pass in a block that 's going to do whatever I want to do with each element , and it's up to the list to know how to go backwards .
In other words , I pass as a block whatever code I would have put inside the for loop in C .
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Yes , and that also means you can define many ways to iterate .
You could provide a forward way to iterate , a backward way , and so on .
It 's up to you .
C# has an iterator , but it has just one iterator per class .
In Ruby you can have an arbitrary number of iterators if you want .
If you have a tree class , for example , which you think people will want to traverse depth first and breadth first , you can provide both kinds of traversal by providing two different methods .
Bill Venners :
Let me see if I understand this .
In Java , they abstract iteration with Iterator s. A client can ask a Collection for an Iterator , for example .
But the client must use a for loop that runs through and processes the items returned by the Iterator .
Inside the for loop , I have " the code " that I want to perform on each item , so that for loop always shows up in the client code .
With blocks , I do n't call a method to get an Iterator back , I call a method and pass as a block " the code " I want to process each item of the iteration .
Is the benefit of the block approach that it takes a little bit of code , the for loop , out of each client ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
The details of how to iterate should belong to the service provider class .
The client should know as little as possible .
That was the original purpose of blocks .
In fact , in early versions of Ruby , the methods called with blocks were referred to as iterators , because they were designed to iterate .
But in the history of Ruby , the role of blocks was later enhanced from loop abstraction to anything .
Bill Venners : For example ...
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
For example , we can create a closure out of a block .
A closure is a nameless function the way it is done in Lisp .
You can pass around a nameless function object , the closure , to another method to customize the behavior of the method .
As another example , if you have a sort method to sort an array or list , you can pass a block to define how to compare the elements .
This is not iteration .
This is not a loop .
But it is using blocks .
Using Closures
Bill Venners :
What makes a block a closure ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : A closure object has code to run , the executable , and state around the code , the scope .
So you capture the environment , namely the local variables , in the closure .
As a result , you can refer to the local variables inside a closure .
Even after the function has returned , and its local scope has been destroyed , the local variables remain in existence as part of the closure object .
When no one refers to the closure anymore , it 's garbage collected , and the local variables go away .
Bill Venners :
So the local variables are basically being shared between the closure and the method ?
If the closure updates the variable , the method sees it .
And if the method updates the variable , the closure sees it .
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
Yes , local variables are shared between the closure and the method .
It 's a real closure .
It 's not just a copy .
Bill Venners :
What is the benefit of a real closure ?
Once I make a block into an object , what can I do with it ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
You can reconvert a closure back into a block , so a closure can be used anywhere a block can be used .
Often , closures are used to store the status of a block into an instance variable , because once you convert a block into a closure , it is an object that can by referenced by a variable .
And of course closures can be used like they are used in other languages , such as passing around the object to customize behavior of methods .
If you want to pass some code to customize a method , you can of course just pass a block .
But if you want to pass the same code to more than two methods -- this is a very rare case , but if you really want to do that -- you can convert the block into a closure , and pass that same closure object to multiple methods .
Bill Venners : OK , but what is the benefit of having the context ?
The distinction that makes Ruby 's closure a real closure is that it captures the context , the local variables and so on .
What benefit do I get from having the context in addition to the code that I do n't get by just being able to pass a chunk of code around as an object ?
Yukihiro Matsumoto : Actually , to tell the truth , the first reason is to respect the history of Lisp .
Lisp provided real closures , and I wanted to follow that .
Bill Venners :
One difference I can see is that data is actually shared between the closure objects and the method .
I imagine I could always pass any needed context data into a regular , non-closure , block as parameters , but then the block would just have a copy of the context , not the real thing .
It 's not sharing the context .
Sharing is what 's going on in a closure that 's different from a plain old function object .
Yukihiro Matsumoto :
Yes , and that sharing allows you to do some interesting code demos , but I think it 's not that useful in the daily lives of programmers .
It does n't matter that much .
The plain copy , like it 's done in Java 's inner classes for example , works in most cases .
But in Ruby closures , I wanted to respect the Lisp culture .

Building a Windows CLISP version
First install a " Full installation " of MinGW - 4.1.1.exe with all default settings .
Then install MSYS - 1.0.10.exe .
Use " C:\mingw \1.0 " as the installation directory .
Use these answers for the post- installation process :
Do you wish to continue with the post install ?
[ yn ] -> y
Do you have MinGW installed ?
[ yn ] -> y
Where is your MinGW installation ? ->
c:/MinGW
Save clisp-2.38.tar.gz , clisp-2.38.patch and libsigsegv-2.2.tar.gz in the directory C:\mingw \1.0 ( note : Internet Explorer wants to change the name " libsigsegv-2.2.tar.gz " to " libsigsegv-2.2.tar.tar " , change this to " libsigsegv-2.2.tar.gz " ) , start MinGW ( Start Menu-> MinGW -> MSYS ->msys ) and build it .
To avoid problems with other applications which have the same name as MinGW programs , we set the path first ( you can use your middle mouse button , or shift and left button , for pasting text into the MinGW shell window ) :
export PATH=.:/bin:/usr/bin:/mingw/bin cd / tar - xzf clisp-2.38.tar.gz cd clisp -2.38 cat / clisp-2.38.patch | patch - p1 CC='gcc - mno-cygwin ' ; export CC mkdir tools ; cd tools ; prefix=`pwd`/i686-pc-mingw32 tar xfz / libsigsegv-2.2.tar.gz cd libsigsegv - 2.2 ./ configure -- prefix=$ {prefix} make make check make install cd ../.. ./ configure -- with - mingw \ -- without - readline \ --with-libsigsegv-prefix=${prefix} \ --with-module=rawsock \ --with-module=bindings/win32 \ -- build clisp - gui
The build fails at the first " test " call , if you applied the patch , because the console - less application does n't print values to stdout , but the build of the program istself is completed .
Note : if you do n't care that a console window is created whenever you start a delivered application ( see next chapter ) , you do n't need to build your own Lisp version , but you can download just the official CLISP release for Windows .
Delivering applications
Then copy the files / clisp-2.38/clisp-gui/full/lisp.exe and /clisp-2.38/clisp-gui/full/lispinit.mem to your application directory .
Create a " hello world " application in your application directory and save it as message .
lisp :
( use - package " FFI " ) ( def - call - out messagebox ( : name " MessageBoxA " ) ( : library " user32.dll " ) ( : arguments ( hwnd int ) ( text c- string ) ( capt c- string ) ( type uint ) ) ( : return - type int ) ( : language : stdc ) ) ( defun main ( ) ( messagebox 0 " Hello World ! " " Message " 0 ) ( quit ) )
And now create a standalone GUI application .
Start a DOS command prompt and execute these commands ( you can save it to a BAT or CMD file , too , e.g. deliver.cmd ) :
lisp - M lispinit.mem -x " ( load \" message.lisp\ " ) ( ext : saveinitmem \ " message\ " : init- function #'main : executable t : norc t ) "
All files in one archive , which you need to buid your own exe-files .
The message program itself is 1.2 mb zipped and can be started standalone , without a DOS console , on every Windows ( I have tested it on Windows 98 and Windows XP ) .

30 . April 2006 , Frank Buß
The most senior British military commander in Afghanistan today described the situation in the country as " close to anarchy " with feuding foreign agencies and unethical private security companies compounding problems caused by local corruption .
The stark warning came from Lieutenant General David Richards , head of Nato 's international security force in Afghanistan , who warned that western forces there were short of equipment and were " running out of time " if they were going to meet the expectations of the Afghan people .
The assumption within Nato countries had been that the environment in Afghanistan after the defeat of the Taliban in 2002 would be benign , Gen Richards said .
" That is clearly not the case , " he said today .
He referred to disputes between tribes crossing the border with Pakistan , and divisions between religious and secular factions cynically manipulated by " anarcho - warlords " .
Corrupt local officials were fuelling the problem and Nato 's provincial reconstruction teams in Afghanistan were sending out conflicting signals , Gen Richards told a conference at the Royal United Services Institute in London .
" The situation is close to anarchy , " he said , referring in particular to what he called " the lack of unity between different agencies " .
He described " poorly regulated private security companies " as unethical and " all too ready to discharge firearms " .
Nato forces in Afghanistan were short of equipment , notably aircraft , but also of medical evacuation systems and life - saving equipment .
Officials said later that France and Turkey had sent troops to Kabul but without any helicopters to support them .
Gen Richards will also take command of the 4,500 - strong British brigade in Helmand province at the heart of the hostile , poppy - growing south of the country when it comes under Nato 's overall authority .
He said today that Nato " could not afford not to succeed " in its attempt to bring long - term stability to Afghanistan and build up the country 's national army and security forces .
He described the mission as a watershed for Nato , taking on " land combat operations for the first time in its history " .
The picture Gen Richards painted today contrasted markedly with optimistic comments by ministers when they agreed earlier this month to send reinforcements to southern Afghanistan at the request of British commanders there .
Many of those will be engineers with the task of appealing to Afghan " hearts and minds " by repairing the infrastructure , including irrigation systems .
Gen Richards said today that was a priority .
How to eradicate opium poppies - an issue repeatedly highlighted by ministers - was a problem that could only be tackled later .
General Sir Mike Jackson , the head of the British army , said recently : " To physically eradicate [ opium poppies ] before all the conditions are right seems to me to be counter - productive . "
The government admits that Helmand province is about to produce a bumper poppy crop and is now probably the biggest single source of heroin in the world .
Ministers are concerned about criticism the government will face if planting over the next few months for next year 's crop - in an area patrolled by British troops - is not significantly reduced .
Kim Howells , the Foreign Office minister responsible for Afghanistan , told the Guardian that the immediate target had to be the biggest poppy cultivators and dealers who control the £ 1 bn - plus Afghan drug trade .
The strategy should be : " Go for the fat cats , very wealthy farmers , the movers and shakers of the drug trade " and their laboratories , he said .
Asked about the concern of British military commanders that by depriving farmers - and warlords - of a lucrative crop , poppy eradication would feed the insurgency , Mr Howells admitted : " It 's a big problem for us . "
— A Cary High School student has been released on bond after allegedly spiking a science teacher 's water bottle with acid .
Zachary Midgett , 17 , was arrested Monday on a charge of assault on a government official .
The misdemeanor carries a maximum sentence of 150 days in jail .
Police said Midgett admitted putting hydrochloric acid and zinc chloride from the school science lab in his teacher 's water bottle last Friday .
Wendy Beeler said her students were taking a test and she was drinking a bottle of water that she noticed tasted funny .
She realized something was wrong only when one of her students warned her not to drink any more water .
" I felt flushed all over .
I broke out in a rash and felt weak , " Beeler said , adding that a student got her help .
" Fortunately , I must not have had enough consumption because it can close your esophagus and you can die from both of those substances . "
Hydrochloric acid is a highly corrosive liquid that , if concentrated , can cause severe burns on the skin and can be deadly if swallowed or inhaled .
It 's also a main component in stomach acid , aiding in breaking down and digesting food .
Zinc chloride is a white powder that is considered highly toxic if ingested .
It is used in processing textiles and soldering metals .
" We are treating it as a crime , as a very serious offense against an individual , and it 's something we wo n't take lightly and school officials wo n't take lightly , " Said Sgt. Randy Byrd of the Cary Police Department .
Beeler was treated at Western Wake Medical Center and released .
But she remains shaken by the incident .
" I 'm hurt , angry .
A lot of emotions are involved , " she said .
" She was explaining it to us ( Monday ) in class .
She was looking like she was going to cry , but she did n't .
She looked like , why me , and she did n't think anything about it while she was drinking it , " student Sheena Amy said .
Students also were upset by the poisoning .
" How do you do something like that , put acid in somebody 's drink ?
That 's just cold - hearted , " student Kailin Daniels said .
" I think it 's messed up .
I think they should n't do that to their teacher .
Why would he want to put someone 's life in danger like that ? " student Crystal Thompson said .
Midgett , whose family could n't be reached for comment Tuesday , is serving an automatic 10 - day suspension pending further action .
He could face long - term suspension or expulsion or be moved to an alternative school , according to Wake County school system policies .
The school punishment is made independently of the criminal investigation .
Beeler said she hopes the courts and the school district make the punishment fit the crime .
" I think that , if something does n't happen now , there will be something more serious down the line , " she said .
More On This
AS MOST Americans will tell you if you can stop them long enough to ask , working people in the United States are as busy as ever .
Sure , technology and competition are boosting the economy ; but nearly everyone thinks they have increased the demands on people at home and in the workplace .
But is the overworked American a creature of myth ?
A pair of economists have looked closely at how Americans actually spend their time .
Mark Aguiar ( at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston ) and Erik Hurst ( at the University of Chicago 's Graduate School of Business ) constructed four different measures of leisure . *
The narrowest includes only activities that nearly everyone considers relaxing or fun ; the broadest counts anything that is not related to a paying job , housework or errands as “ leisure ” .
No matter how the two economists slice the data , Americans seem to have much more free time than before .
Over the past four decades , depending on which of their measures one uses , the amount of time that working - age Americans are devoting to leisure activities has risen by 4 - 8 hours a week .
( For somebody working 40 hours a week , that is equivalent to 5 - 10 weeks of extra holiday a year . )
Nearly every category of American has more spare time : single or married , with or without children , both men and women .
The only twist is that less educated ( and thus poorer ) Americans have done relatively better than more educated ones ( see chart ) .
And that is not just because unemployed high - school drop - outs have more free time on their hands .
Less educated Americans with jobs — the overstretched middle class of political lore — do very well .
These findings will no doubt be scoffed at by many Americans who are certain that they , and nearly everyone they know , are overworked ( and who may find time to write letters to the editor saying so ) .
Indeed , a 1992 book by Juliet Schor , “ The Overworked American ” , became a best - seller by telling people something that they thought they already knew .
In fact , most of the official numbers have shown that American toil has not changed that much over the past few decades .
Americans may put in longer hours at the office than other countries , but that is because average hours in the workplace in other rich countries have dropped sharply .
In America , official studies tend to show women working more and men less , but the average working week has been fairly constant .
How then have Messrs Aguiar and Hurst uncovered a more relaxed America , where leisure has actually increased ?
It is partly to do with the definition of work , and partly to do with the data they base their research upon .
Most American labour studies rely on well - known official surveys , such as those collected by the Bureau of Labour Statistics ( BLS ) and the Census Bureau , that concentrate on paid work .
These are good at gleaning trends in factories and offices , but they give only a murky impression of how Americans use the rest of their time .
Messrs Aguiar and Hurst think that the hours spent at your employer 's are too narrow a definition of work .
Americans also spend lots of time shopping , cooking , running errands and keeping house .
These chores are among the main reasons why people say they are so overstretched ( especially working women with children ) .
However , Messrs Aguiar and Hurst show that Americans actually spend much less time doing them than they did 40 years ago .
There has been a revolution in the household economy .
Appliances , home delivery , the internet , 24 - hour shopping , and more varied and affordable domestic services have increased flexibility and freed up people 's time .
So women are devoting more hours to paying jobs , but have cut their housework and other burdensome tasks by twice as much .
Men have picked up some of the slack at home ; but thanks to technology and other advances , there is plenty of free time left over for them as well , since they have yielded some of their paid working hours to women .
The data for Messrs Aguiar and Hurst 's study comes from time - use diaries that American social scientists have been collecting methodically , once a decade , since 1965 ( the latest one used in their paper was from 2003 ) .
These diaries ask people to give detailed information on everything they did the day before , and for how long they did it .
The beauty of such surveys , which are also collected in Australia and many European countries , is that they cover the whole day ( not just the time at work ) , and they also have a built - in accuracy check , since they must always add up to 24 hours a day .
Time - use diaries have long been a treasure trove for sociologists .
( John Robinson , who helped oversee the diary surveys for years at the University of Maryland , co-wrote a book in 1997 , “ Time for Life ” , that aimed partly to rebut Ms Schor 's claims . )
But economists in America have only recently begun paying much attention to them .
The BLS started using them in 2003 .
Keep reading ... you have a moment
Do the numbers add up ?
One thing missing in Messrs Aguiar 's and Hurst 's work is that they have deliberately ignored the biggest leisure - gainers in the population — the growing number of retired folk .
The two economists excluded anyone who has reached 65 years old , as well as anyone under that age who retired early .
So America 's true leisure boom is even bigger than their estimate .
Another question - mark has to do with child care .
When the BLS took over the time - use diaries for the 2003 survey , it changed the measures for what parents do when their kids are around .
That cast some doubt on comparisons between the 1993 and 2003 diaries .
Against that , the 1965 - 93 figures are consistent — and over that period , even working women with children enjoyed an increase in leisure time of more than six hours a week .
The biggest theoretical problem with time diaries is “ multi- tasking ” .
Do you measure the time you spend cleaning your house while listening to portable music as “ leisure ” or “ work ” ?
This problem may be exaggerated : usually people seem to combine two work activities ( using a laptop computer on a plane ) , or two leisure ones ( watching television and doing something else ) .
The two economists counted many combinations of work and leisure — such as reading a novel while commuting or goofing off on the internet at the office — as time spent working .
Richard Freeman , a labour economist at Harvard , reckons that , despite the inability to measure multi-tasking , the finding of a big increase in leisure is “ basically right ” .
Another well - known work - watcher , Daniel Hamermesh at the University of Texas at Austin , who has worked with various countries ' time - use diaries , agrees .
Is all this leisure a good thing ?
Some part - time workers might well wish they had less leisure and more income .
For most Americans , however , the leisure dividend appears to be a bonus .
Using average hourly wages after tax , Steven Davis , a colleague of Mr Hurst 's , reckons that the national value of five extra hours of leisure per week is $ 570 billion , or $ 3,300 per worker , every year .
But why do Americans feel so harried ?
Weirdly , prosperity may be to blame in two ways .
First , thanks to rising real incomes , an American 's time is worth more now .
A walk in the park is more expensive than it used to be .
( When people complain to him about being too busy , Mr Hamermesh tells them that their real problem is too much money . )
Second , economic advances allow people to squeeze ever more possible activities , both work and leisure , into a day , which encourages people to try to do too much .
Mr Robinson reckons that people will feel less busy to the extent that they can control their schedule and gain flexibility .
It is easy to see why a personal video recorder , which offers near - total mastery of the television , is such a popular device ; and why traffic jams and security queues at airports exasperate modern workers .
Finally , there is the changing nature of work .
Mobile phones and e-mail make people accountable on short notice , and competition may make them less secure in their jobs .
So even if they are playing golf or walking in the park , they may feel as if they are working .
It is surely nicer to feel overworked in the park than to be overworked at the office , but few Americans seem to look at it that way .
Think about that in your spare time .

When the Hetch Hetchy valley - often called the prettier twin of its famous neighbour , Yosemite - was flooded in the Twenties , no one thought it would be seen again .
Its loss was mourned by the nascent environment movement , and especially by the naturalist John Muir , who had fought to save what he called a ' mountain temple ' because of its spectacular scenery .
Now hopes are high that Hetch Hetchy will re-emerge in one of the biggest restoration projects on American soil .
It could cost billions and take years , but its proponents say it would herald a new age of restoring damaged eco-systems .
' It is an idea whose time has come .
This is a signal of hope .
This will show that the Earth can restore itself , ' said Ron Good , founder of Restore Hetch Hetchy , the group spearheading the project .
There are certainly grounds for optimism .
Knocking down the dam and restoring the valley to wilderness has been an ambition of many people ever since it disappeared .
A concerted effort in the late Eighties came to nothing , but this summer the California state government published the findings of a huge probe into the viability of the project .
Its conclusion : that restoring Hetch Hetchy was both viable and potentially desirable .
Environmentalists have also been given an unexpected boost from Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger .
The film star won a second term based mostly on a dramatic shift towards being green and has said the project needs more research .
' The political winds are moving in the right direction , ' said Good .
The scientific winds are pretty much already there .
The valley has lain under 90 metres ( nearly 300 ft ) of water for eight decades and the first task will be to knock down the huge dam that flooded Hetch Hetchy in the first place .
Then the landscape underneath will have to be restored to its wilderness state , allowing animals and plants to flourish .
Some scientists favour a phased restoration , draining the reservoir bit by bit and experimenting to see which methods work best to keep out non-native plants .
' There are many unknowns .
At the moment we really do n't know what exactly will work best unless we give it a go , ' said Joy Zedler , an ecologist at the University of Wisconsin , who has created a phased restoration plan .
Scientists hope to learn much about how to restore a landscape from what is likely to be little more than a moonscape of mud when first revealed .
That knowledge will boost reclamation projects around the world .
Zedler believes they will amass information that will be used globally , even as other countries - such as China , with its Three Gorges project - keep building big dams .
' They 'll knock that dam down and restore it too one day .
The next generation is going to be the restoration generation , ' said Zedler .
No one is pretending that recreating Hetch Hetchy will be easy .
The soil will probably have changed after being soaked in water and covered in sediment .
The rare lichens that covered the cliff walls will have died .
There will be a ' dirty ring ' around the whole valley similar to a tide mark or , more prosaically , a ring of dirt around a bath tub .
The biggest task would be knocking down the dam .
The tallest one previously dismantled was just 20 m high , one - fifth of the height of Hetch Hetchy .
Removing it will generate about half a million cubic metres of concrete and cost at least $ 900m .
There are other issues .
About 2.4 million residents of San Francisco and the Bay area use water from the reservoir , and it generates vital hydroelectric power .
To keep water flowing to consumers , there will have to be a ' re - plumbing ' of much of central California 's water supply , and a new source of electricity will need to be found .
Official estimates vary on the total cost of the project - from $ 3bn to $ 10 bn - though environmentalists put the bill at ' just ' $ 1bn .
Opponents say the high costs show that the project is a non-starter , but its backers say the opposite : if money is the sole object , they will find ways to get it .
There is certainly huge optimism among supporters of Hetch Hetchy , who now include celebrities such as Harrison Ford , who has helped to make a documentary backing the plan .
' I get more optimistic every day , ' said Zedler .
Knocking down dams is increasingly accepted by Americans , more and more of whom see them as unnecessary and ecologically damaging .
In the Olympic National Park near Seattle in Washington state , two large dams are being taken down in a restoration project costing $ 185 m .
It is scheduled to begin in 2009 .
In the Florida Everglades a staggering $ 10.5 bn has been set aside to restore the threatened wetlands landscape .
If the Hetch Hetchy project does succeed , California would end up with a second version of Yosemite , the famous national park that attracts three million visitors a year .
It will be a natural wonder and a paradise for hikers and climbers .
The valley was once full of savanna and oak and pine forests , with waterfalls and huge cliffs in dramatic colours .
It was also home to the Paiute and Miwuk Native American tribes , and its name is derived from their word for a type of edible grass that used to grow there .
When Muir , who founded the Sierra Club environmental group , visited the valley he often described its beauty in quasi-religious terms .
When first told of plans to dam it he replied : ' Dam Hetch Hetchy ?
[ One might ] as well dam for water tanks the people 's cathedrals and churches , for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man . '
Good agrees with those sentiments .
He believes work could start on the project as soon as 2013 .
